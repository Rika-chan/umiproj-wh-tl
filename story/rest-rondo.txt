`".........zzzzz..."`
`".........Whew.`
` ...Looks like she's finally calmed down..."`
`Hideyoshi wiped his own forehead.`
`...For a time, Eva had seemed to be having a very painful nightmare, but it appeared she'd finally fallen asleep.`
`As promised, he still gripped Eva's hand.`
`...He'd thought it might be time to let go pretty soon, but he faithfully continued to hold on.`
`Every once in a while, his hand would get tired, and he would switch between his right and his left,`
` but even so, as promised, he didn't let go of her hand...`
`At that time, there was a heavy knock.`
`Eva had finally been able to fall asleep, so Hideyoshi grimaced for just an instant.`
`"...Aneki, Hideyoshi-san, sorry.`
` Is Rosa there...?"`
`It was Rudolf's voice.`
` ...What could it be?`
`Hideyoshi headed for the door, hiding his footsteps so that he wouldn't wake Eva.`
`...It was definitely Rudolf's voice, but just in case, he opened the door without removing the chain.`
`"What is it?`
` Somethin' happen to Rosa-san?"`
`"We can't find Rosa or Maria-chan.`
` I thought they might be with you."`
`"...I heard her scolding Maria-chan in the corridor.`
` They got quiet after that, so I thought they'd gone back to the lobby, ...but did they...?"`
`"......That idiot..."`
`Rudolf clicked his tongue.`
`Other people could be seen in the corridor.`
`Rosa hadn't returned for a while after going out into the corridor, so they'd begun to worry.`
`Near the front door, Natsuhi pointed at the unset chain.`
`"...The chain isn't set.`
` They must have gone outside to see that rose after all."`
`"How extraordinarily careless, to go out and leave the door unlocked.`
` What a troublesome person."`
`"...I'm more worried about Rosa-san and Maria-chan themselves."`
`"Right.`
` ...Hey, brats.`
` Where was this rose of Maria's?!"`
`"I'm pretty sure...it was in the flower bed right in the middle of the rose garden..."`
`"If that's where they are, we should be able to spot them pretty quickly if we go."`
`"...Dad, shouldn't we bring them back here as soon as we can...?"`
`"Of course.`
` We'll bring them back and give 'em a good spanking.`
` I'll dash out there and come back.`
` Lock the door as soon as I go out."`
`"...Dad, I'll go with you."`
`"Don't be stupid.`
` It's obviously a brat's job to watch over the house with Mama."`
`"......What is it...?`
` Did something happen...?"`
`"Sorry, did I wake you up...?`
` ...It seems Rosa-san took Maria-chan outside.`
` ...How reckless of her."`
`"Rosa and Maria-chan are...`
`...outside...?`
` In the rose garden...?!"`
`"That's right.`
` ...Oh, did you hear?`
` Maria-chan was causin' a ruckus because she wanted to see this rose."`
`"...Th-They mustn't...`
` ...They mustn't go to the rose garden...!`
` Tell Rosa to stop...!"`
`"Th-There's no tellin' her to stop now, it looks like they left a while ago.`
` ...Seriously, how reckless of them."`
`"......That's not it...`
` ...Not the rose garden...`
` ...There's a witch there, `
`...and she's waiting for a sacrifice...!`
` Rosa, you mustn't go, `
`...ooooooooooohhh..."`
`...Eva cowered again, holding her head.`
`...Her complexion looked very bad.`
`"What is it?`
` Did the fever make you dream somethin' bad?"`
`"......It's a dream, `
`...yes...`
` ......In the rose garden, the witch, doing that to Rosa and Maria-chan...`
` ......That's right.`
` ...It's a dream...`
` It must be..."`
`"Calm down.`
` I'm here in this room.`
` And the chain is set.`
` The shutter's closed on the window, and we've even got a gun.`
` This room is just like a fort.`
` There's nothin' to be afraid of."`
`Hideyoshi beat his chest, trying to calm her, but Eva's insecure expression didn't change.`
`...Under the covers, Eva kept praying that the grotesque nightmare she'd just had was only a dream...`
`"In the center of the rose garden, Rudolf identified the corpses of Rosa and Maria.`
` After that, he returned to the guesthouse, called for help, and carried both of them into the guesthouse."`
`"If we can trust Nanjo's examination, the cause of Rosa's death was a stab to the medulla oblongata with the pointed gate of the fence.`
` It is thought that Maria's death was due to strangling with bare hands.`
` However, due to the 'Devil's Proof', we cannot discount a misdiagnosis."`
`"...I will say it in red.`
` #ff0000Rosa and Maria died#ffffff.`
` #ff0000The causes of death were as Nanjo diagnosed#ffffff.`
` ...She wasn't eaten by a spider, nor was she crushed by a mountain of cake.`
` Don't worry."`
`"......So, you argue that even though you toyed with their deaths so much, it's all fine because the corpse is neat and clean...?`
` I definitely won't forgive you."`
`"...I definitely won't forget all of that brutal treatment you gave Aunt Rosa,`
` so I won't forgive you..."`
`"...L-Like I said, that wasn't me...`
` ...I believe I gave them a much more peaceful death than the way she treated them..."`
`"Shut the hell up.`
` I'm not talking to you."`
`"......It was stated that there are no more than 18 people on this island, and now that eight people are already dead,`
` we can narrow the field of suspects down to ten.`
` One of them probably killed those two."`
`"...Or could it also be an accidental death?`
` Like Maria was having a tantrum,`
` and when Aunt Rosa tried to stop her crying, she misjudged how much power she was using and accidentally killed her.`
` Then she was so upset that she slipped and fell, landed on the fence, and unluckily, died."`
`"...How's that?`
` That way there's no need for a witch or magic."`
`"...Well, that's not quite true.`
` Actually, Rosa and Maria..."`
`"Shut up.`
` Didn't I say I wasn't talking to you?`
` You're an eyesore, so disappear.`
` You monster."`
`Battler said that without rage, ...but with a horribly cold voice.`
`...That strange behavior was something Beato had noticed right off the bat.`
`In a fight, both of them could go at each other without restraint.`
`However, he wouldn't even step into the ring.`
` She could feel that coldness.`
`Beato didn't find that amusing.`
`...She thought about flaring up, but she held back.`
`Maybe even though she was innocent and childish,`
` she had enough sense to realize that she shouldn't pick fights.`
`"......`
`......Is that so?`
` Then I'll vanish.`
` ...Ronove, continue for me."`
`"Certainly.`
` ...Will that be satisfactory, Battler-sama?"`
`"......There are no problems with her proposal.`
` If Battler-kun doesn't want to see Beato's face, perhaps that will do."`
`"Do what you like.`
` ...If I can live without seeing that monstrous face, I don't care about anything else."`
`"...Hey, wait a second.`
` ...You keep saying monster, monster, but isn't that a cruel way to speak of me?`
` ...Why do you instinctively hate me so much, Battler?`
` Even though none of that was me, even though it was all the work of my disciple..."`
`"......It's not like I'm only mad about what happened just now.`
` It's been like that from the very beginning."`
`"Hey, Battleer.`
` Don't misunderstand, okay...?`
` Aren't we just a pair of players confronting each other through a game?`
` ...We look for moves to make things painful for each other, but..."`
`"Don't get the wrong idea.`
` I don't hate you because you're my rival in this strange game about whether I accept you as a witch or not.`
` ...I just can't forgive how senselessly cruel you are."`
`"Well, serial murders are a part of this game...`
` It's probably impossible to avoid a little cruelty..."`
`"I'm not just talking about what just happened.`
` There was the last time, and the time before that too.`
` ...Tearing everyone's stomachs open and stuffing them with sweets, plowing their faces...`
` What was the point of all that?"`
`"......That's...`
`well..."`
`"When it comes to closed room murders and tricks and alibis,`
` I'm willing to give you a pass.`
` You want to claim that this is a murder done by magic,`
` so I'll grudgingly accept that those complicated crimes need to occur."`
`"...But what exactly is the point of all those grotesque murders?"`
`"......Well, umm, `
`......nothing much..."`
`"That's right.`
` They don't mean anything.`
` You're just fooling around by mangling the corpses for fun.`
` That has nothing to do with whether you're a witch, or whether it could or couldn't be done with magic."`
`"You're just exploring the depths of cruelty for fun.`
` This isn't about whether you're a witch, or anything like that.`
` There are just some things I can't forgive as a human."`
`"......Wh-`
`What do you mean, as a human...?"`
`"For example,`
` ...the six people of the first twilight for this game.`
` ...Well, other than Grandfather being burned black,`
` the other corpses were killed in a normal way, without any unnecessary shaming of the dead.`
` ...It wasn't clear whether the weapon was a spear or a gun, but anyway, as far as killing goes, that was acceptable.`
` It was much better than the nonsensical grotesqueness and cruelty from the first twilight last time, or the time before that."`
`"And this time, there were six closed rooms tied together to make a closed room chain.`
` ...That was sort of interesting."`
`"When we were going back and forth with each other that time, to be perfectly honest, I thought it was just a little fun."`
`"...You were frantic to make me accept your existence, and I was frantic trying to deny it.`
` ...We were both frantically doing all we could."`
`"This may sound weird, but I've felt a faint sense of sportsmanship between the two of us.`
` ...We exist in conflict, `
`but I faintly thought that we might not be completely unable to understand each other's existence."`
`"......But just now, that feeling was blown away without a trace."`
`"Th-That's what you're misunderstanding...!`
` That wasn't me-"`
`"That's not it.`
` That's not what I'm talking about!`
` ...You watched Aunt Rosa being killed horribly over and over, `
`and you sneered at it like it was an interesting show."`
`...When I saw that, I was deeply disappointed in you.`
`When I realized that your decision to kill them in a slightly better way this time was nothing more than a faint whim,`
` ...and that nothing had changed in your cruel character, I was deeply disappointed.`
`On the contrary, you were even genuinely enjoying those brutal deaths.`
`You weren't just acting as cruel as you could to bully me.`
`...You truly, genuinely enjoy cruelty.`
`Your character lets you enjoy it.`
`You said I'd probably think that Aunt Rosa being brutally killed over and over was fun.`
`You weren't joking.`
` You enjoyed it from the bottom of your heart, wanted me to sympathize, and said that I'd probably think it was fun.`
`...In that instant, I lost respect for you and realized the truth.`
`"The problem isn't whether you're a witch or not.`
` ...I will not forgive that cruelty of yours.`
` And I can't understand it!`
` I can't forgive it, either!`
` Still, I'll continue this game of whether to accept or deny witches.`
` I won't step down and accept my own defeat."`
`"However, your pointless cruelty is absolutely unnecessary for that game.`
` So I've decided that I won't accept you as my opponent.`
` Ronove is a hundred times better.`
` He doesn't have the same cruel hobby you do.`
` Even if he does, he doesn't have the awful taste to show it off in front of me."`
`"...That's right, you have awful taste.`
` You're heartless and cruel, so you can't understand.`
` That's unpleasant in an opponent.`
` So I don't want to see your face again."`
`As Battler went on and on by himself, Beato was shocked into silence for a long time.`
`Maybe she couldn't understand what she was being told,`
` and this was a sign that she was doing all she could in an effort to understand.`
`For a while, she kept switching between angry expressions, frustrated expressions, bold expressions,`
` ...as though even she herself didn't know what attitude she should take.`
`In the end, she made her face into a candid expression, as though she had come to her senses, `
`and shrugged her shoulders as though she was tired.`
`".........`
`......In that case, do as you like.`
` From now on, I will continue this game through Ronove.`
` ...You have no complaints as long as I don't show myself, right?"`
`"...For the time being.`
` But I definitely won't forgive all of your cruel actions up until now.`
` And I definitely won't accept you.`
` For that reason as well, I won't back down from this fight you've picked.`
` And I definitely won't lose.`
` ...That's all there is to it."`
`"......Beato,`
` no matter how many more excuses you give, his impression will not waver.`
` ...I have something to talk about later.`
` Until then, stay back."`
`".........I-Indeed...`
` ...Understood.`
` ...Then I'll vanish until you call..."`
`Looking lonely, Beato turned her back to them and vanished.`
`...Battler watched, a slightly displeased expression on his face.`
`He thought his argument had been valid, but for some reason, his mood didn't clear up.`
`"...She's...`
`an idiot."`
`"......That's true.`
` An idiot, and a straightforward one."`
`"That idiot watched Aunt Rosa get killed horribly with me,`
` then turned around with a huge smile on her face.`
` ...She really believed that she could laugh with me at that cruel show.`
` ...She really believed that I could sympathize with that emotion..."`
`"Looking at that innocent smile, I felt just horrible.`
` ...It would've been much better if she'd said it with her normal bullying face...`
` ...Damn it..."`
`"Milady has never had the experience of having a friend.`
` ...In addition, she has probably never had something spoken to her that strongly."`
`"Madam and I are her attendants.`
` No matter what we say, it will not reach her ears.`
` For Milady, this is also-"`
`"Don't screw with me.`
` I don't remember ever becoming her friend."`
`"...That's true enough.`
` My apologies."`
`".........`
`...There is one thing I would like to thank you for.`
` ...Thank you for not backing down from that child's game."`
`She spoke words of gratitude, but for some reason, Battler made a displeased face.`
`Then as though in self-derision, he chuckled.`
`"Now that I've even got witches and demons thanking me, I'm screwed.`
` ...Let's resume the game.`
` Of course, I don't intend to go easy on you."`
`"I wouldn't have it any other way.`
` Unlike Milady, I do not get agitated."`
`"...I've already made my move.`
` If we suppose that Aunt Rosa is the culprit and died in an accident, I can deny the witch.`
` ...I don't want to suspect Aunt Rosa, but I think I can bear to accept that premise if it'll beat the hell out of Beato."`
`"I will deny it with red.`
` #ff0000Rosa's and Maria's deaths were homicides#ffffff."`
`"Okay.`
` ...Let's start from there.`
` ......Damn, I'm just not getting fired up."`
`With Rosa's and Maria's deaths, it was now clear that the culprit was still hiding somewhere,`
` trying to add even more murders to this chain.`
`As he shed tears, Rudolf scolded Rosa's corpse for being reckless several times,`
` but Rosa would never respond to that again.`
`They decided to place the two corpses in one of the guest rooms...and to seal it until the police arrived...`
`The second murder...no, the murder of the second twilight had delivered a heavy blow to everyone.`
`It had blown away the optimism that some of them had held,`
` the thought that 'a crime didn't actually occur, and it was all a game or a farce by Kinzo and the servants'.`
`Trying to distract themselves from the loss of the people they liked, `
`George and Jessica had spent the whole time since morning talking about every possibility.`
`...And, they had distracted their hearts by supposing that these murders might actually have all been an act,`
` and that Shannon and Kanon were only pretending to be dead.`
`When the next murder occurred, it destroyed that thought,`
` ...and they were once again struck by the fact that the person they liked had most definitely been killed...`
`The tears that they'd thought had died away began to drip down once more, and Battler couldn't think of anything to say to them...`
`After that, all of the adults checked that all of the rooms were safe and locked, just in case.`
`They made certain that the shutters on all of the windows were down and locked, and they confirmed that no one suspicious was hiding anywhere.`
`On top of that, they checked their weapons once again...`
`and checked with each other to make sure they were mentally prepared, so that they wouldn't hesitate to fire off a preemptive shot if they saw the shadow of a mysterious person.`
`Rosa's gun had been found near the scene of the crime.`
`Someone had gone out of their way to leave it there, so everyone suspected that it was some kind of trap, `
`but when Hideyoshi delicately used a fire iron to fire off test shots, it was able to discharge without incident.`
`So, since the five shots loaded into it had discharged without any problems,`
` they reloaded it with bullets and handed it over to the only adult male who wasn't armed, Hideyoshi.`
`However, the fact that it had been able to fire off five shots gave rise to a certain paranoia.`
`This short barrel Winchester could hold only five shots.`
`In other words, Rosa hadn't fired even once.`
`And yet, the two had probably been killed by someone with their bare hands.`
`This meant there was a possibility that the crime had been committed by someone whose face they knew...`
`"...When the first murder occurred,`
` I privately thought of the possibility that it was all an act.`
` ...My apologies to Doctor Nanjo, but if he had actually been an accomplice, `
`I thought the deaths of all the servants might possibly have been a massive, elaborate act by Father."`
`"...After all, the closed room situation they were in couldn't have been created unless we suppose that it was all an act."`
`"...We also...`
`suspected that.`
` ...No, `
`...I still want to believe that's the case."`
`"......My apologies, ...but that is not so.`
` ...I am quite old.`
` I might possibly make a misdiagnosis.`
` ...However, I would never mistake whether they were alive or dead..."`
`'!s0`
` Don't go out of your way to say it out loud, Doctor Nanjo...!"`
`"...My apologies..."`
`They had no way of knowing,`
` but Beato had already used the red to proclaim the deaths of the six...`
`no, the deaths of all victims so far in this game.`
`That faint dream that it was all a farce, that the victims were actually alive...`
` I'm sorry to say it, but that's impossible...`
`"...In that case, it makes more sense to assume it's someone familiar with the mansion,`
` someone hiding around and carrying out a really well-polished crime.`
` So, ever since the typhoon came to this island and sealed it off from the outside world, there's been more than 18 people here."`
`Of course, there was no way for them to know about that either.`
`That claim of Rudolf's has also been denied in red.`
`There are no more than 18 humans on this island...`
`"I might have a way to look at it that keeps things consistent, at least a little.`
` ...Simply put, this person in hiding is someone who shouldn't really be on this island right now.`
` And yet, there's a likelihood that they were someone Rosa-san knew, someone she'd let her guard down around."`
`'!s1`
`So, for example, `
`could it be...a servant who wasn't on this two-day shift...?"`
`"Hmm...`
` ...It's hard to be certain about that one.`
` When our servants finish their work and leave the island, it isn't as though we punch their ticket or something to make sure.`
` If we're supposing that a servant on a shift from a few days ago only pretended to leave the island and actually stayed here,`
` that would be hard to deny..."`
`"...I don't think Rosa-san is such a fool.`
` If a servant who wasn't supposed to be here popped up in front of you, who wouldn't be on their guards...?"`
`"......I'm not even sure we should be assuming that it was someone she recognized.`
` ...Maybe they suddenly attacked Rosa from the darkness and were about to steal her gun.`
` Then Rosa fell, hit her head against the fence, and stopped moving.`
` The guesthouse was nearby and they wanted to avoid the sound of gunfire, so they killed Maria-chan with their bare hands..."`
`"...There's also that possibility.`
` ...Still, even if that is the case,`
` would they really intentionally leave Rosa's gun at the scene of the crime?`
` We don't know what the culprit's armed with, but they've got to feel insecure about our guns.`
` ...Wasn't that a perfect chance for them to thin out our supply?`
` Why would they intentionally leave it at the scene of the crime?"`
`"At first, I thought that gun was a trap.`
` ...That's what chessboard thinking says it should be.`
` By purposefully leaving it, they wanted to make one of us touch it.`
` And they must have wanted to make us pull the trigger.`
` ...I was sure that something dangerous had been done to it...to make it explode and cause massive injuries."`
`"But, it was actually okay.`
` ...The culprit probably panicked.`
` I'll bet that right now, they're regrettin' that they missed their chance to steal a gun...!"`
`"......I don't like it.`
` It ticks me off, like it's a message from the witch, saying she isn't even scared of guns."`
`"...However, in any event, this is truly a fearsome opponent.`
` Even at a glance, they should have been able to tell that Rosa had a gun.`
` To think that they attacked her despite that.`
` ...The fact that they are unafraid of guns should not be taken lightly."`
`"Indeed...`
` It's as Natsuhi says.`
` ...We should probably be even more cautious than we have been."`
`"This is just for peace of mind, but...`
`...at the time we think Rosa-san was attacked outside,`
` where was everyone...?"`
`"Natsuhi and I were here, along with Rudolf and Kyrie-san.`
` I can guarantee their alibis."`
`"Eva and I were together.`
` I can guarantee that."`
`"George-aniki, Jessica, and I were together.`
` ...When Aunt Rosa yelled at us to return to the second floor, `
`we retraced our steps back to the cousins' room, all dejected."`
`"...Back then, `
`...if we hadn't let Maria go..."`
`"Saying that isn't going to change anything..."`
`"......Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"I-I was reading a book in a room on the second floor.`
` ...I was by myself, so no one can verify my alibi, `
`but I believe everyone saw me return to the second floor with the children."`
`"...Once I say this, it'll never end, `
`but what if you jumped out the window, attacked Rosa,`
` then climbed back up using a rain gutter or something...?"`
`"D-D-Don't be absurd...`
` How could I perform a feat such as jumping down from the second story or climbing up with this old body...?"`
`"...Let us stop suspecting each other...`
` It's more important that we trust each other and, for the children's sakes as well, defend this place until the very end."`
`"You're right...`
` ...It's like Natsuhi-san says.`
` ......For now, let's stop suspecting each other."`
`"That's right.`
` We may be useless as far as searching for the culprit is concerned.`
` ...We can only stay alive until tomorrow, inform the police, and follow their instructions.`
` Because the police will definitely expose who the culprit is."`
`"......What is it, Eva?`
` ...Is your body still feelin' bad...?"`
`"M-Mother, what's wrong?`
` Are you okay...?"`
`"...Sorry.`
` ...It looks like my fever is still strong.`
` I'll be fine, so leave me alone..."`
`When they looked, they saw Eva staring at the floor, her breathing harsh again.`
`...She had been able to act firm for a time, due to the urgency of their situation, `
`but it seemed her body wasn't at its best after all...`
`"Yeah.`
` I killed those two.`
` Now, we're the only ones who know about the gold.`
` I won't give up even a scrap to the other siblings."`
`"......What have you done...?!`
` There was so much of that gold, right?!`
` Giving Rosa and the others their share wouldn't have been a problem at all, right...?!"`
`"It would.`
` ...That gold is to be passed on only to the Head of the Ushiromiya family.`
` That's because it, as a whole, represents no more or less than the honor of the Head."`
`"...To wound that even a tiny bit...`
`is definitely not something that I, the new Golden Witch, Beatrice, will permit.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"...Do you plan to continue these murders according to the witch's epitaph...?`
` Do you actually plan to become a murderer five more times...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` If I don't finish that annoying ceremony, it seems my power as a witch won't become complete.`
`...Hey, 'me'.`
` ...The power of the witch is really awesome.`
` It really can make all the crazy things we imagine become reality.`
` The power to make dreams more than just dreams...!`
` Now that I've learned of this power, I can no longer stop being a witch.`
` If I can finish the ceremony and make my power complete, I'm sure I'll be able to teach you that feeling too.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Stop acting like an fool...!`
` Haven't you played at being a witch enough?`
` We found the gold.`
` And we've even been promised the position of the Successor.`
` We'll probably need to tightrope walk just a bit, but by now, that's a dream that will definitely come true.`
` ...Beyond that, what more could you wish for...?!"`
`"I wanted to become a witch."`
`"I don't give a damn about that dream...!"`
`"That's right.`
` Because I kept holding onto that dream, I've lived at this age forever.`
` ...When you became an adult, you threw that dream away."`
`"...No matter how long you wait, the rabbit holding a clock won't visit you,`
` and you won't be able to meet Humpty Dumpty.`
` Of course, you definitely won't be invited to the land of cards.`
` Because you gave up and accepted all that, you became an adult."`
`"So you don't want to become a witch or anything like that anymore.`
` ...You've even forgotten that it truly was your own dream at one point."`
`"...Anyway, stop it!`
` I've already gotten my hands on two dreams!`
` The gold and the position of Head.`
` That's more than enough!`
` So please, your dream has nothing to do with me!`
` Stand down...!!"`
`"......No waaay.`
` Magic's too interesting.`
` ...Also, those two dreams of yours both came true because of my magic.`
` It wouldn't be fair if my dream didn't come true too."`
`"I'm grateful for your magic, and I acknowledge that you're a real witch.`
` ...So just stand down and return to the inside of my heart!`
` And never appear again!!"`
`"No wa-y.`
` ...We're both misunderstanding each other, aren't we?`
` That's right, I am not you anymore.`
` You are Ushiromiya Eva.`
` I am the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
` So it's not my responsibility to go back inside your heart.`
` ...I guess I feel like a butterfly who's broken out of her cocoon, meaning you."`
`'!s1`
`...haah...`
`...urg, `
`...the fever...`
`is making my mind cloudy..."`
`"My inexperience with magical power is forcing me support it with your vitality.`
` Until I finish the ceremony and become a full witch, you might have to bear the burden.`
` I'll take that as payment for making two of your dreams come true."`
`"...It's fine, don't worry, okay?`
` For the remaining five sacrifices, I'll avoid your family."`
`"Let's see, Rudolf, Kyrie, Krauss, Natsuhi.`
` ...After that, what about that old geezer Nanjo?`
` Perfect, I'll kill those five people.`
` *giggle*giggle* Could you call this a murder announcement revealed only to yoouu?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`Eva finally crouched down.`
` Hideyoshi rushed up to her and lent her his shoulder...`
`"...Are you okay?`
` ...Let's take it easy and rest!"`
`"Are you all right...?`
` Doctor Nanjo, take a look at Eva...!"`
`When Nanjo and George tried to approach, Eva made a gesture to stop them.`
`"...Thank you.`
` I'm fine, Doctor Nanjo.`
` I'm taking medicine.`
` ...I apologize for saying this during such an extreme situation, `
`...but let me rest a little longer..."`
`"Mom, ...I'll lend a hand too..."`
`"Thank you,`
` but I'll be fine as long as your father watches over me.`
` ...Go back to the second story cousins' room and don't come out no matter what.`
` ...Understood...?`
` No matter what happens, you must not leave the guesthouse...`
` ...Outside, `
`...that...witch will...`
`uuuu..."`
`"Don't talk anymore...!`
` Sorry, everyone, but I'll be watching over Eva in our room.`
` Tell us if something happens."`
`Hideyoshi and Eva retreated from the lobby.`
`...However, Eva wasn't the only one who wasn't feeling good.`
`They hadn't gotten a wink of sleep since the previous night...and had been pressed by tension since that morning.`
`...They were mustering their energy to protect their families,`
` but if they relaxed even a little, surely everyone would be down and out...`
`"...Everything has gone as planned until now, but from here on out, it will become difficult, you see?"`
`"Difficult, meaning...?"`
`"Indeed.`
` Normally, as the ceremony progresses and the victims increase in number, they begin to tighten their guard,`
` and in most cases, they hole up in one place and stop moving.`
` That is extremely inconvenient for us."`
`"...Are you saying that we witches are inferior to a bunch of Humans in a group...?"`
`"Witches are never inferior to Humans...`
` However, perhaps you could say that times change, and that Humans have gotten their hands on a poison...`
` ...This wasn't a problem long ago, when people believed in witches,`
` but just like that annoyance Battler, people in the current era deny magic on a fundamental level."`
`"In other words, their existence itself is anti-magical.`
` As a result, at some point, they grew to possess a toxin inside their bodies that denies magic."`
`"In other words, you're saying that the more Humans there are, `
`the stronger that magic-resisting toxin gets, and the greater the disadvantage is for us witches?"`
`"...The combined amount of power in their hearts that denies magic...in other words, their magic resistance power, becomes the denominator in the equation of your magic's power...`
` Understand?`
` Is that a bit too difficult for you...?"`
`"You're joking.`
` Actually, I understand it easily.`
` ...In other words, you're saying that the more people there are who don't believe in magic,`
` and the stronger their will is, the more the effects of our magic are divided.`
` ...Yeah, if it's so formulaic, I'll have to rethink my method of attack."`
`Fundamentally, magic possesses a vast power.`
`It can even make a rain of fire fall from the heavens or divide a sea, and reviving a lost life isn't impossible either.`
`However, that power is extremely weak against the toxin that rejects it.`
`And that toxin started piling up in Humans since the time they forgot to respect things sacred,`
` ...until finally, this earth was covered with enough toxin that the miracles of magic could not be displayed.`
`Thus, witches from across the world were chased from their dwellings.`
`...They had been forced to choose to throw away their magic and live as Humans, or else live in hiding in remote areas where the toxin of Humans didn't reach.`
`In that sense, Rokkenjima, with its population of only a few dozen humans, was extremely favorable for witches.`
`And even more favorable was the existence of the ghost story about the witch who lived in the Rokkenjima forest.`
`...In other words, by permeating the island with the fear that a witch might exist,`
` the magic-resisting toxin from the Humans was weakened.`
`A small population...and room for them to acknowledge magical beings.`
`In other words, minds that were only weakly anti-magical.`
`...Only by existing in the valley where those two converged...could a witch live in modern times...`
`"I see...`
` ...So, using this formula, we can arrive at several rules for how a witch can use her power efficiently."`
`"The first is presentation.`
` Create a murder scene that couldn't conceivably have been done by Humans, decorate it in an occult way, `
`make it look very much like a witch exists, and permeate people with fear to make them believe that witches exist.`
` As a result, the anti-magic power and the denominator for our magical power will be decreased.`
` ...I see, so this is why the creepy magic circles of the first twilight were created?"`
`"Th-That's right, exactly...!`
` The gaudy scenes for the first twilight in each game are all for that reason.`
` It's definitely not as though I like being cruel or am doing it for fun..."`
`"...In that case, Predecessor-sama,`
` you failed this time around.`
` You killed them in a very plain way.`
` It doesn't look like anything more than a simple mystery."`
`"......I heard about last time and the time before that from Ronove.`
` You should've damaged the corpses more grotesquely, like you did then, making it look more like fantasy and instilling fear in those people."`
`"......W-Well, about that.`
` ...I thought it wouldn't be artful to do that every time, you see...?`
` Don't think too deeply on it, it's just a whim...!"`
`Actually, it really had been her whim.`
`After what Battler had said to her, she couldn't say it out loud anymore,`
` but she really had decided her methods of killing based on mere whims.`
`No, would it be better to say that she had halfheartedly let Ronove decide?`
`After all, she left the closed rooms of this game's first twilight to him.`
`But if she'd had a cruel idea, then she would surely have explored the limits of atrocity even worse than in the previous game...`
`"............`
`You told me to show some restraint when deciding Rosa's and Maria's deaths too,`
` but that wasn't a course of action beneficial to us witches either, was it?"`
`"In actuality, by now, none of them believe one bit that a witch actually exists.`
` They're totally sure that it's a mystery, not a fantasy.`
` This turn of events is a failure from a witch perspective.`
` ...For some reason, you keep doing things in a kinda lukewarm way, Predecessor-sama."`
`"Aah, ...l-like they say, things you learn when you're young will definitely help you out in the future...!`
` This is a test passed on from my predecessor to you.`
` Take it on with respect.`
` Wahahaha...!"`
`Beato tried to laugh heartily,`
` but it was obviously the fake laugh of someone trying to cover something up, `
`and the new witch shrugged with a sigh.`
`"............`
`...At this stage, it's probably too late to create a scene and reduce the anti-magic power.`
` ...In that case, there's another move.`
` Getting the Humans to split up should work."`
`"Indeed, that is probably the most effective way.`
` The smaller the number of Humans, the more the denominator shrinks.`
` As a result, the magical power functions instantaneously.`
` In other words, it all begins from one point: how to destroy this barricade situation and have them split up into small groups."`
`"However, they are already very cautious.`
` The barricade won't be destroyed easily, right...?`
` Both the barricade in Kinzo's study two games ago and the barricade in the parlor last time were very stubborn.`
` Furthermore, most of the cunning adults still remain this time."`
`"The situation is more difficult than all the ones before it, understand?`
` ...If you wish, I could give you some special advice..."`
`In a closed circle, when the first murder case occurs, the survivors always hole up, `
`gathering together to observe each other and ensure their safety.`
`...Funnily enough, not only do mystery authors and murder culprits worry about how to break that situation apart, `
`but so do witches, who supposedly exist at the other end of the spectrum.`
`For a while, the new witch poked her cheek with her pointer finger, `
`and after acting as though she was planning something, she spoke.`
`".........`
`...No, I'm fine.`
` After all, it is a test.`
` ...I won't borrow your moves."`
`"Nn, ...really...?`
` ...Still, it will be rather difficult to defeat this barricade, right...?"`
`"I've already made my move.`
` I'm pretty sure it'll work.`
` And it'll definitely work on someone smart."`
`"I-Is that so...?`
` You really are excellent...`
` I'm pleased to see that my disciple won't be causing me much trouble."`
`"My motto is to study things myself before asking other people.`
` ...Then, if you would excuse me.`
` I have to wait for my prey to get lured out."`
`"Indeed.`
` ...Well then, handle it with care."`
`As the new witch lowered her head, her face blank, she turned into gold butterflies and vanished.`
`...Beato didn't look happy at all.`
`She seemed to be lonely because of how little she was being relied on.`
`"......Not one of them gives a fig for me.`
` ......Hmm.`
` You witch apprentice, acting so smart...`
` ...I'll bet she makes some painful mistake and starts crying."`
`"Then, without a doubt, she'll finally realize my greatness and beg me to teach her!`
` *cackle* Until then, I shall watch from on high."`
`She laughed loudly on the outside, but a laugh no one can hear is completely pointless.`
`Beato gave up and quickly stopped laughing.`
`...Ronove chose that time to show himself.`
`"Excuse me, Milady.`
` ...The game of the second twilight with Battler-sama has ended."`
`"...Nn, I see.`
` Good work.`
` What was the result?"`
`"My sincere apologies.`
` I was forced to resign.`
` ...By saying in red that 'both deaths were homicides', `
`I made Battler-sama revise his claim of 'Rosa strangled Maria to death, then died in an accident',`
` ...but I could not repel his chain of moves placing Eva as the principal offender."`
`"Wasn't Eva sleeping in her room the whole time as Hideyoshi cared for her?"`
`"...He put forth the possibility that Hideyoshi was an accomplice, and that the two worked together to create an alibi."`
`"He even suspects Hideyoshi...?!`
` Couldn't you have struck back by saying in red that he was in the guest room at the time of the murder?"`
`"...I also thought of that, but multiple important pieces might have been taken several moves later.`
` ...And, because this move might be connected to the new Beatrice-sama's strategy,`
` I acted out of respect to her.`
` ...My apologies."`
`"Strategy, you say?`
` ......Her mind does seem to be sharp.`
` ...Hmph, we can let her do as she pleases.`
` It will be quite a show to see how far she can go."`
`"Pukukukuku.`
` I thought you would say that.`
` ...I see that the un-cuteness of your disciple has left you in a bad mood."`
`"That's none of your business.`
` I wonder how that one plans to destroy this barricade going forward.`
` I shall keep a close eye on her.`
` ......Oh, and...`
`...h-how was Battler's mood?"`
`"It appeared as though he had calmed himself down.`
` He did say that he couldn't get fired up after all, without you as his opponent."`
`"R-Really, well that's no surprise, no surprise at all!`
` If I don't return for the fourth twilight and after, Battler will probably be lonely himself...!"`
`"Pu ku ku ku...`
` And with that, if you would excuse me.`
` ...I need to go bake some delicious cookies.`
` I must at least enliven the discussion between you and Battler-sama, Milady."`
`"Indeed!`
` That guy really was munching your cookies, wasn't he?`
` It's no surprise that a boy can eat so much.`
` Make a lot of them...!"`
`"Certainly.`
` I shall make enough cookies to bury the table."`
`"That sounds great...!"`
`"...What's going on?`
` What did you want to talk about...?"`
`Kyrie called Rudolf out into the corridor.`
`It was obvious that she wanted to talk about something that she didn't want the others to hear.`
`"Umm, I..."`
`"Yeah?"`
`"......I want to go outside."`
`"...Certainly, the body cannot last with nothing more than a small breakfast, but..."`
`"Of course, we understand.`
` Still, as time passes, it'll get darker and darker out.`
` It's probably at its brightest now.`
` It's the most convenient time."`
`"Only about an hour has passed since Rosa-san was attacked.`
` This is simply too reckless...!"`
`It was only natural that Natsuhi was yelling about recklessness.`
`...After all, Rudolf had said he was going to the mansion to get food.`
`Certainly, on top of their fatigue, their hunger was tormenting them.`
`In the beginning, a mild level of hunger had been just what they needed to fight off drowsiness.`
` However, it now just made their minds hazy, since it was still only midday, and their bodies felt like they were reaching their limits.`
`The thought of going to the kitchen in the mansion and bringing back some food certainly was attractive.`
`"I am opposed to this.`
` It may be a little rough, but we definitely shouldn't leave this place."`
`"...Don't worry about us,`
` but it would pain my heart to keep the children hungry...`
` I must be responsible as a parent."`
`"D-Dear...!`
` Now that Father is dead, you are the Ushiromiya Family Head.`
` It is not permissible for you to take on such a danger...!"`
`"......You're right.`
` It's like Natsuhi-san says.`
` Krauss-san, you should remain here, as our leader."`
`"...Then who will go to the mansion?"`
`"I think it should be Kyrie and me, and Hideyoshi-san too.`
` Hideyoshi-san and I have guns.`
` They shouldn't be able to lay a hand on us that easily."`
`"Rosa-san also had a gun, but she was attacked.`
` ...Won't it be dangerous?"`
`"...When I went out to check on Rosa and Maria-chan, I had a gun, but I was alone.`
` And yet, I wasn't attacked.`
` ...Maybe they'll be cautious if their opponent is a man."`
`"We'll have two men.`
` And even two guns.`
` Those two will act as guards, and I'll transport our cargo using a cart.`
` I believe the situation will be significantly different than it was for Rosa-san."`
`"If you're countin' on me 'cause I'm a man, I'd be happy to help.`
` I may not look it, but I'm built up pretty strong from pushin' food stands around.`
` Leave the heavy liftin' to me!"`
`"You men can devote youselves to guarding.`
` There's a folding cart in the servant room, and using that, I should be able to handle carrying the food.`
` ...Of course, we'll be careful.`
` And if we can succeed in this adventure just once, `
`there won't be any need for us to take risks again."`
`"......Is there any way I can get you to rethink this?`
` It may be painful for everyone to deal with empty stomachs, ...but even so, we do not know what is happening outside now..."`
`"We'll take care.`
` ...And Eva's feelin' pretty darn bad right now.`
` We can't let her stay hungry.`
` If her stomach's empty, she can't take her medicine.`
` I have to go out for Eva's sake as well."`
`"How is Eva?"`
`"Looks like she's finally gotten to sleep.`
` ...She has a high fever.`
` If we just leave her be for a while..."`
`"...You can't just stand still when it comes to your wife's health...`
` ......Understood.`
` I'll give you permission to go outside."`
`"Then, we'll take a little trip there and back.`
` A speed contest.`
` Canned food's okay, right?`
` You at least have a can opener here, don't you?"`
`"Y-Yes.`
` We have a can opener and a bottle opener..."`
`"There's running water in the guesthouse, so we won't need anything to drink.`
` We need to get ten people's worth, so no being picky about what you get."`
`"All right!`
` Why don't we dash out and bring it back quickly?`
` There's no time to open umbrellas...!"`
`"See you, Aniki.`
` I'll trust you to look after this place."`
`"...Take care.`
` ...Under normal circumstances, I'd want to go too.`
` ...Being a man, I despise how this title of the oldest brother prevents me from lending a hand in an emergency like this."`
`"This is about the only time we get to show off.`
` Sit back and take it easy every once in a while, Aniki.`
` Okay, Natsuhi-san.`
` Wait here and get some towels ready or something.`
` We aren't using umbrellas, so we'll be soaked to the bone when we get back."`
`"U-Understood.`
` ...Take care."`
`Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi, `
`each leaving their own brave words behind, left the lobby...`
`Compared to the time Rosa and Maria had gone outside, the winds were much stronger.`
`Rudolf's group of three people jogged through the rose garden without umbrellas, holding their guns and a folded cart.`
`If everything had been still and quiet, without the wind and the rain, they would probably have kept their ears open and moved with caution.`
`But in this rain, even if some suspicious person was hiding nearby, it would be difficult to notice them.`
`Because of that, it had been Rudolf's plan to instead dash through the dangerous area.`
`...If there was a chance that their opponent was equipped with a gun, `
`then walking slowly with their guard up would only make them targets.`
`Taking swift action was probably the correct choice.`
`"......The rose garden.`
` It feels like we're just askin' to be attacked...!"`
`"Please, let nobody come out of there..."`
`Even as Rudolf and Hideyoshi continued to run, they looked around restlessly, vigilant of their surroundings.`
`Rosa and Maria's deaths had not been caused by a projectile weapon.`
`...However, it was easy to suspect that the servants had been killed in such a manner.`
`Will they come flying out of the dark?`
`Or will they take careful aim and snipe from the shadows?`
`...Either way, they couldn't relax their tension for even an instant.`
`But even so, when they reached the overhang in front of the entrance to the mansion and escaped the reach of the raindrops,`
` they felt themselves breathing a sigh of relief.`
`"No problems for the first step.`
` ...Unlike how it was for Rosa-san.`
` Maybe they can't get their hands on us easily."`
`"I'd like to believe that.`
` Kyrie, unlock the door while we keep a lookout."`
`"Sure.`
` Returning home to the mansion with a pair of SPs makes me feel just like an executive."`
`"Wahahahaha.`
` If we had a welcoming party of servants with a red carpet, it'd be perfect."`
`"A welcoming party, huh?`
` ...You never know.`
` Be careful."`
`As the two cautiously surveyed their surroundings, `
`Kyrie unlocked the entrance with the master key she had been given.`
`"It's open."`
`"Hideyoshi-san,`
` could you take the front?`
` I'll keep an eye on the rear."`
`"Understood.`
` Kyrie-san, try not to move from my shadow.`
` ...Okay, let's break in!"`
`"Rear guard, roger that. Covering...!"`
`"...Ah, men.`
` Even in a situation like this, you're just playing around, aren't you?"`
`"Give it up, that's how men are.`
` ...Seriously though, that stench is awful."`
`...It felt like the air in the mansion was stagnant with a gloomy silence.`
`And on top of that, it was still thick with the stench from Kinzo's burnt corpse in the boiler room, `
`and they were struck with an uncontrollable desire to leave the mansion.`
`"No problems in the front.`
` Just a short dash to the kitchen."`
`"Let's finish this quickly and head home.`
` This suit'll get fumigated with Dad's stench."`
`The three of them dashed towards the kitchen...`
`And after they disappeared from the entrance hall, ...the new witch appeared there.`
`"They were lured out just as planned.`
` ...Just as planned, they got caught in my trap."`
`The witch grinned.`
`...Thinking about it now, no matter how unbearable their hunger had grown,`
` it hadn't even been a few hours since Rosa and Maria had been attacked and had lost their lives.`
`In that case, why had they needed to recklessly leave the guesthouse...?`
`Until that question could be dealt with, the only answer was that they had been called out by the witch's magic...`
`"What reckless people.`
` ...They'll never leave this mansion alive.`
` Seal yourself, lock. Seal yourself, mansion!"`
`The instant she proclaimed that...`
`The mansion was sealed off into a separate world.`
`...Unless her barrier was undone, no longer would anyone be able to exit this mansion or enter it.`
`"...Spectacular.`
` To think that even though barely half a day has passed since you succeeded the Endless Witch, you can use magic this well.`
` ...That talent surprises me.`
` It's almost as though you were born a witch."`
`"Well, I have been a witch since the time of my birth.`
` ...Who taught you how to blink?`
` That's what using magic is like for me."`
`".........`
`...What a fearsome person."`
`The witch's face twisted with brutality.`
`...She just couldn't help looking forward to toying with someone's life again.`
`"Well then...`
` ...Gehehehehhihhihihihihihihyahya!`
` First up is Rudolf and Kyrie, but in what cruel way should I kill them...?!"`
`"...If you don't mind me saying,`
` your Predecessor-sama has left instructions that you are to restrain yourself from committing murders of unnecessary cruelty.`
` And, there is an etiquette for offering the sacrifices from the fourth twilight onwards.`
` For that, you must borrow the power of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory."`
`"...Oh, really?`
` Now that you mention it, that's right.`
` I could only play as I like with that second twilight.`
` .........Boring.`
` Just when I thought I could play to my heart's content like I did with Rosa."`
`"...But, that only counts for how they're killed in the end, right?"`
`"Meaning...?"`
`"I could just kill them however I want over and over again, revive them,`
` and then follow the epitaph during the last time I kill them, right?"`
`"...So, in the end, no matter how I play, it isn't a problem.`
` ...Who'd act well-behaved with an entertaining power like this...?!`
` Kuhhihihihihihihi!"`
`Her absurd argument was, for an Endless Witch, an extremely valid one.`
`The etiquette that controlled the manner of killing the sacrifices of the fourth twilight and onward was represented by lines like 'gouge the head'.`
`However, that referred to the way those people died in the end.`
`In other words, ...in the process leading up to that, she was free to tease and kill them however she wanted.`
`She just had to keep on reviving them...and follow the rules only when she killed them the final time.`
`Though Ronove felt that her innocent cruelty was part of her talent as a witch,`
` he was beginning to notice a innately brutal side of her.`
`"...They do say that apprentices are the most brutal of witches, and now I see this may be true.`
` ......Do as you wish...is what I would like to say, `
`but here, it may actually be wiser to show restraint.`
` They have guns.`
` Weapons with a high anti-magic power, such as guns, are the natural enemies of witches and demons."`
`The witch stared blankly at this demon butler, who was surprisingly afraid of guns.`
`"......That can't be right.`
` Shouldn't witches be able to take a shot from a bullet easily?"`
`"No.`
` It would be just as fatal for a witch as it would be for a normal Human.`
` ...To prevent that weak point from being noticed, `
`most witches rigorously strengthen their guard with a defense of protective barriers and furniture."`
`"Do I have any of those protective barrier things?"`
`"...Constructing a barrier to make even gun bullets ineffective requires much in the way of preparation and ceremonies.`
` I am afraid to say that Beatrice-sama currently has none of those.`
` Furthermore, you are currently ill prepared to summon furniture strong enough to block a bullet."`
`"So even though I've become a Great Witch with this much magical power, I really do have to be afraid of lead bullets.`
` ......It's annoying, but I don't have a choice.`
` So, in that case, should I call some furniture to act as my arms and legs?"`
`"Yes.`
` Leaving everything to your servants while not exposing yourself to danger is also a part of a witch's refined tastes.`
` Beatrice-sama, leave this to the furniture and hide in a safe place."`
`"......I get it.`
` ...I call on the Seven Sisters of Purgatory.`
` I don't care who, any two...!"`
`Leviathan and Belphegor responded to that call.`
`"Leviathan of Envy, right here."`
`"Belphegor of Sloth, right here."`
`"Show me your power.`
` Your targets are Rudolf and Kyrie.`
` Don't attack Hideyoshi.`
` ...Come on, show me just how cruel you can be, furniture."`
`"...My apologies,`
` but we've received orders from the Predecessor-sama to refrain from unnecessarily cruel actions."`
`"Buuut, I think the Predecessor-sama's order does give us some leeway to tease them.`
` Do you still wanna go through with it?"`
`"Hmph.`
` I get it, I'll compromise.`
` ...Don't let them die easily.`
` Thoroughly corner them and let them taste the fear of death before killing them.`
` ...Will that be okay, Ronove?"`
`"Yes. Depending on the degree, I do not believe there will be a problem."`
`"......Then, go!"`
`""Yes, leave it to us...!""`
`"Your opponents are armed with guns.`
` ...For those such as you, dodging them should be easy, `
`...but if you are hit, the wound will be fatal.`
` Proceed with an appropriate level of caution."`
`"Don't worry.`
` We aren't that incompetent."`
`The two Sisters of Purgatory vanished.`
`Ronove bowed and vanished himself.`
`"......There are even rules on how to kill them.`
` ......Why do I have to be constrained by my Predecessor-sama?`
` ......It's so rigid and boring."`
`As the witch looked up at the portrait of the Predecessor Beatrice hung in the hall, she cursed...`
`The three people had already arrived at the kitchen and were gathering food supplies.`
`Considering the possibility of poison, they gave up on the alluring fruits and vegetables...`
`and gathered a whole cardboard box full of only the safe canned foods.`
`It was very heavy, but by piling it on the cart, they could carry it well enough.`
`This should be more than enough for ten people to hold out until tomorrow's breakfast.`
` That should carry them until the boat arrives.`
`The two men were supposed to be focused solely on guard duty, but the weight of the load was tough on Kyrie even with the cart.`
`Hideyoshi, who wanted to show off his power, switched to be the cart-pusher, and Rudolf and his wife took up the task of guard duty.`
`"With all this, even George and the kids will be full.`
` The trip back'll be a picnic, so let's go...!"`
`When Hideyoshi vigorously announced their departure, Kyrie frowned and seemed to be gazing into the distance.`
`...There was a wall in that direction.`
`...No, if her gaze could go through that, there was the main hall beyond it...`
`"......What is it, Kyrie?"`
`"...It's vague,`
` ......but I've got a bad feeling gnawing at me."`
`Kyrie stopped walking and narrowed her eyes even further.`
`"......Women's intuition?"`
`At times like this, Kyrie's intuition often rang true, even when she didn't have a logical reason.`
`...Rudolf believed in that intuition.`
`"Yes.`
` Someone's probably waiting to ambush us.`
` ...I didn't sense them before,`
` ...but just now, I felt it.`
` ...Just now someone...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~set up an ambush for us~ib~`
`."`
`"...Then there's no reason to go back the way we came.`
` There's a back door over there, right?`
` Let's leave that way."`
`Rudolf made to unlock the back door.`
`When goods were carried into the kitchen, they never passed through the part of the mansion that the family came and went from.`
`So outside the back door, there was probably a ramp used to carry things in.`
` Surely, they would be able to leave through there with the cart.`
`"...What the heck?`
` ...It's stuck.`
` ...Damn, what's going on?"`
`"Can't you open it?"`
`"Nope.`
` Is it broken?`
` It isn't giving an inch..."`
`Rudolf tried various things, first using force, then coaxing it,`
` but the lock was as hard as stone and didn't even budge.`
`"...Don't force it. Let's leave through the front entrance.`
` Right now, it'll be even worse if we stand around wasting time."`
`"............"`
`"...You think this is a trap?"`
`"...I don't know.`
` Be careful."`
`With strained expressions, the three of them returned to the hall again and headed for the entrance...`
`"Wh-Who is it?!!"`
`The instant they exited into the hall, Rudolf noticed a suspicious shadow right in front of them and yelled...`
`In that instant, a storm of gold leaf started blowing, and gold butterflies covered the area with a gold color.`
`"......I can't believe it.`
` A lowly Human predicted our ambush?"`
`"I-It isn't my fault.`
` I was hiding my presence...!"`
`"Don't hesitate!! Fire!!!"`
`The two guns spouted fire.`
`The lead bullets blasted right through the magical defense of the pair as easily as though it were a wet paper wall,`
` ...but the two figures that should have been there had disappeared.`
`Certainly, guns were frightening objects for them.`
`...But there was no need to fear as long as they weren't hit.`
`They at least had enough speed to dodge those.`
`"Wait a sec!`
` You won't even give us a chance to say our names?!`
` This is why I hate Humans!"`
`Leviathan was a full 10 meters from where she had supposedly been, popping her head out from behind the pillars in the shadow of the staircase and protesting.`
`"In accordance with Beatrice-sama's orders, we will hunt you down!`
` Our orders tell us to make it take some time and to tease you.`
` You are free to resist, but know that it will be useless...!"`
`That voice came from overhead.`
`Belphegor could be seen on top of the hall chandelier.`
`Elegantly looking down upon them, she proclaimed their execution with a cruel smile.`
`"...Wh-`
`What are these girls...?!"`
`"Forget the cart!!`
` We have two opponents, so if we split up, they can't chase all of us!"`
`All three of them were well acquainted with the inside of the mansion.`
`In case of a crisis, they had planned to run off in separate directions,`
` returning to the guesthouse by breaking windows or leaving through a back door.`
`Fighting was forbidden.`
` ...As long as they could fully escape.`
`"Hahaha, in a tight spot, escaping is victory...!"`
`The three of them ran into the depths of the mansion at full tilt.`
`That pair of furniture calmly watched them go.`
`"...I'll kill the woman.`
` You take the man!"`
`"Understood."`
`The furniture in the shadows of the pillars and on the chandelier made their figures explode,`
` and, leaving behind only the sound of a hopping beetle knocking against the wall, they pursued their respective targets.`
`Their speed was overwhelming, and they easily blocked the others' paths of retreat.`
`"......Let's see what this furniture's got.`
` I hope they're at least able to amuse me..."`
`"Beatrice-sama, it may not be prudent for you to reveal your form unnecessarily..."`
`"And you don't unnecessarily move your king away from the center.`
` That's part of a monarch's...`
`...and a witch's dignity!"`
`Belphegor was already blocking the way in front of Rudolf, who had boldly tried to escape to the second floor.`
`"It's useless to try and resist or escape.`
` ...You don't need to think about anything.`
` Just close your eyes.`
` I'll gently end it all for you."`
`"You'd make a good wife.`
` Husbands love to hear that kind of thing when they come home all tired."`
`"To think you're still relaxed enough to speak with such insolence at a time like this...!`
` Beatrice-sama, thank you for this excellent prey!`
` Die!!!"`
`Rudolf shot first.`
`But even before that bullet could hit her, Belphegor had already moved behind Rudolf's back.`
`She then raised a purple curve springing out from her arm...`
`However, incredibly, before that arm could decapitate Rudolf, he had swung his gun behind him.`
`The barrel remained pointing behind his back...from the same motion with which he had reloaded the sawed-off gun one-handedly.`
`It was pointing right at Belphegor's chest...`
`*click*, *cha-clunk*...!`
`It was the sound of the ejected empty cartridge finally hitting the wall after the reload.`
`In other words, it meant that the next shot was already fully loaded.`
`Without turning around, his gun pointing right at Belphegor's chest, Rudolf grinned.`
`"......Not bad......`
` ...For a middle-aged man...!!"`
`"Don't look down on the generation that loves old Westerns, okay?`
` You brats don't know anything about the refinement of a lever-action."`
`Just like Rudolf, Kyrie was also confronting a demon stake in the first floor corridor.`
`"What a moron.`
` You could've just escaped with your husband.`
` You do know that was your final farewell just now, right...?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"Don't worry.`
` This kind of thing is my husband's specialty.`
` I'm sure he'll come for me on a white horse soon.`
` Because he's never failed to come and save me when I'm in trouble.`
` ...Not even when Asumu-san was around.`
` Heheh."`
`"Heheheheheheheh!`
` What a happy couple.`
` I'm jealous.`
` ......I am Leviathan of Envy...!`
` Envy itself is my power.`
` My anger, my lifeblood!"`
`"I agree.`
` Envy is the source of a woman's power.`
` ...And if that is power, I won't lose to a girl like you."`
`"Hahhahahahahahahahaha!`
` Imagine saying that to the one who governs envy!`
` You actually think I'd let you two be reunited...?!!`
` Ahhahahahaha, I'll give you a tragic farewell!!"`
`The arm Leviathan swung was trailed by a purple curve.`
`It was a magic blade that cut with the power of malice.`
`Kyrie blocked it with her gun.`
`...Even though the magic blade should have cut through the metal like butter, the 'gun', with its extremely high magic resistance power, `
`was able to block the blade as easily as if it were a rolled up newspaper.`
`Rapidly, two times, three times.`
` It blocked all of them.`
`And, without missing the opening created when that purple curve took a swing upward,`
` Kyrie kicked Leviathan in the stomach with her heel.`
`Leviathan was knocked away like a lightly dancing feather.`
`...Before the demon stake's feet touched ground again...`
`Kyrie was already pointing her gun directly at Leviathan in midair.`
`From that position, the two women who had called envy a form of power met each other's gaze.`
`"...C-Can you do it?`
` Can you pull that trigger...?!!"`
`"I can be brutal when my husband isn't around."`
`"Owowowowowowow!!"`
`Rudolf tumbled down the staircase.`
`He'd been gradually cornered by Belphegor...and had been pushed back into the main hall they'd started from.`
`"......The Predecessor-sama's furniture is pretty good.`
` They aren't very flashy though!"`
`"Beatrice-sama...!`
` It isn't over yet, and it's dangerous to show yourself...!"`
`".........Don't tell me you're...`
`...Eva?"`
`"That used to be my name.`
` But it's different now, Rudolf."`
`"You don't have to tell me.`
` You're gonna say you're the Golden Witch, Beatrice, right?"`
`"Ehheheheheh, ahhahahahaha!`
` How did you know?"`
`"...Since the time Rosa was killed, I had a vague idea.`
` ......Rosa, forgive me.`
` Forgive me for sending the sister you hated down to the hell you're in...!!"`
`"Beatrice-sama, look out!!!"`
`Rudolf mercilessly pointed the barrel of his gun at the witch who claimed to have once been his sister.`
`But Belphegor would not permit that and attacked savagely.`
`She dashed, disappeared, and headed for Rudolf's back...`
`...She dodged that shot and again headed for Rudolf's back...`
`...And vanished over and over, instantly moving into Rudolf's blind spots.`
`It was almost like she was a fairy.`
`As she blinked in and out of vision, Belphegor incessantly drove towards Rudolf.`
`"Maybe this is kinda fun.`
` Rudolf, let me sit back and watch to see how long your brave efforts last you.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`At that time, there was a dull tearing sound, along with Rudolf's cry of anguish.`
`Rudolf's reaction to the dance of the purple curve that pressed upon him had finally been too slow,`
` and he'd let it lightly cut his flank.`
`That single wound slowed him down just once.`
`That led to a new wound, which slowed his actions again.`
`Belphegor's dance began to swallow Rudolf whole...`
`Watching Rudolf's body gradually get carved up, his former sister let out a shrill laugh.`
`Leviathan could no longer hide her irritation that Kyrie hadn't suffered a single fatal wound.`
`"......I really am a moron.`
` ...Among the Seven Sisters, I was always the slowest to grow.`
` I was always slow, always weak, always stupid."`
`"...That inferiority complex became envy, `
`and when I convert that into power, I gain a strength greater than that of any of the sisters."`
`"It's important for young girls to have a moderate inferiority complex.`
` It teaches women about cosmetics and hard work."`
`"I don't like having to use the limits of my power against mere Humans,`
` ...but I can turn my envy of your ability to trust completely in your husband into power."`
`"...I don't like it.`
` Why are you so relaxed when you're fighting for your life?"`
`"...*giggle*`
` I wonder?"`
`"......I get it.`
` You're fully convinced that your husband will come to your rescue and save you.`
` ......Isn't it incredible, that trust of yours?`
` It's enough to make me jealous."`
`What kind of trust did we sisters have for each other?`
`The sisters are always looking down on each other, trying to thoroughly lambast each other when things already look bad...!`
`"I've always been bullied by my sisters.`
` I've always wanted just one person to take my side.`
` ...So when I see you with a single ally who's completely trustworthy, `
`I feel the strongest envy..."`
`"......Aaah, that confident expression of utter belief in your husband...!`
` I can feel it giving me power...!!`
` ......I might even surpass that.`
` The speed of sound!!!"`
`Leviathan turned herself into a stake, and the speed of her flight as she attacked was proportional to the strength of her envy.`
`"Since the day my sisters looked down on me,`
` I was jealous from the bottom of my heart of the other six, who grew quickly!`
` I was jealous for seven days and seven nights!!`
` You can see the power I gained as a result in my speed...!!`
` Die, Ushiromiya Kyrieeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`The demon stake exposed her true form, leaping about at a terrible speed.`
`The noise from her bouncing off the walls sounded like a machine gun.`
`By now, Kyrie probably couldn't tell if it was a single stake or a swarm of beetles flying and bouncing around.`
`Leviathan was over 100% certain of her victory, believing in it from the bottom of her heart...!`
`Then, Kyrie spoke with an unbelievably calm voice.`
`"......I was the one who went out with Rudolf-san first.`
` ...Asumu-san blatantly cut in between us...`
`and shrewdly got pregnant."`
`"...I don't blame Rudolf-san.`
` That woman used her body as a weapon to seduce him, and then acted even more repulsively,`
` cornering Rudolf-san and forcing him to get engaged to her."`
`Asumu-san had been carrying Battler-kun.`
`And at the same time, I was also carrying a boy.`
`...As fate would have it, our delivery dates were on the same day.`
`"Then, Asumu-san gave birth to Battler-kun.`
` ...But I had a miscarriage.`
` ......I think about it, sometimes.`
` What if Asumu-san had had the miscarriage...and I had been the one to give birth?`
` ...Would Rudolf-san have broken off his engagement and married me?`
` ...But I couldn't give birth to my child.`
` So until Asumu-san died, `
`and until I got pregnant with Ange, I cursed Asumu-san and was jealous."`
`Let Asumu-san die.`
`Then, I want him to marry me. In my envy, I kept cursing like that, over and over, until Asumu-san finally died.`
`I was certain.`
`I was certain that I'd used the power of magic to curse and kill Asumu-san.`
`But that didn't quell the flames of my envy.`
`Don't tell anyone, okay?`
`Every time I look at Battler-kun, I remember that woman.`
`Every single time I look at him,`
` ...I think that if only my child had been born, he would be the same age.`
`I'm still jealous of her, tormented by her.`
`Even now, and from now on.`
` Into the future, for all eternity.`
`"You say you were jealous of your sisters for seven days and seven nights...?"`
`"...Th-That's right..."`
`Don't make me laugh, little girl.`
`'!s1`
`and who's burned with envy for 18 years...?!!"`
`'!s0`
`If Leviathan had the power of 24 hours x 7 days, or 168 hours of speed...`
`'!s0`
`was 24 hours in 1 day, `
`365 days in 1 year, `
`and 18 whole years...`
`Even without counting leap years, `
`that was 157680 hours.`
`...Compared to Leviathan's power and speed, `
`it was more than 938 times greater.`
`So then, even if Leviathan could soar at the speed of sound, 1225 km/h,`
` ...to Kyrie's eyes, it only looked like `
`1/938 of that.`
`'!s0`
`...a speed of...`
`1.30 km/h.`
`...They say a human's walking speed is 4 km/h, so it was even less than half of that.`
`This is almost the same speed as a baby crawling on the floor.`
`Which means, which means, which means...!`
`In the time it took the demon stake to move at a pace so slow that you could count all the bits of dust floating through the air, `
`Kyrie looked at it with pity.`
`She pitied the slowness at which it came towards her.`
`Then, she lazily raised the barrel of her gun.`
`Almost as though she was trying to swallow the demon stake up with the gun barrel.`
`'!s0`
`...Try harder next time, little girl."`
`"Rudolf, what happened to all that vigor from a couple seconds ago?`
` You're supposed to slice up a fish while it's still flopping around.`
` After it dies, it isn't interesting anymore.`
` That's enough.`
` Why not kill you now?!"`
`"......Nng, ...damn it..."`
`"I'm surprised you managed to endure this long after being carved up.`
` ...That's enough.`
` From now on, you don't need to think about anything.`
` I'll steal away your life painlessly...!"`
`"Wait, ...there's a favor I wanna ask.`
` At the very end, I wanna do one of those..."`
`"...What do you mean, one of those?"`
`"You know, that thing you see in all the Westerns.`
` We start with our backs together, walk three steps, and then *bang*."`
`"......Ah, a duel.`
` Very well.`
` If that will satisfy your regrets in this world, I'll accept."`
`Rudolf moved his wound-covered body and turned his back to her.`
`Belphegor responded and turned her back to his.`
`...Belphegor had an honest nature that was uncommon in a witch's furniture.`
`"Let me warn you.`
` Even if you press the barrel of your gun between my eyebrows,`
` I can move instantaneously, even faster than you could pull the trigger and have the bullet reach my skull."`
`"...Yeah, I can feel that already.`
` ...You're faster than a bullet."`
`"I have agreed to this out of respect for your courage in challenging me to a duel despite that knowledge.`
` Thank me."`
`"...Well, you're an honest and principled person.`
` And a good woman.`
` You might just steal my heart away."`
`"Let's begin.`
` Three steps will do fine, yes?`
` ......First, one step."`
`"...Two steps."`
`"...Three steps.`
` Is that okay?"`
`"Yep.`
` ...And, since you still haven't noticed after walking three whole steps,`
` ...it's my victory, miss."`
`"What...?!`
` ............Ah...!"`
`Rudolf turned around and fired a bullet.`
`...However, Belphegor could easily see through the speed and trajectory of a bullet like that.`
`It should have been no problem at all to dodge it.`
`But a spray of fresh blood flew about.`
`...Belphegor had set up an adequate magical defensive barrier.`
`But before an incarnation of anti-magic power such as that bullet, it was completely meaningless.`
`"......What are you doing?`
` Why'd you get hit...?!"`
`The bullet had hit Belphegor right in the chest.`
`...The pain from the lead caused her to grimace, as did the pain from the denial of magic...`
`"...Forgive me.`
` I'm a coward of a man."`
`'!s1`
`...ggghh..."`
`"Wh-What a killjoy.`
` To think that furniture of a witch could be defeated by a Human...!`
` Know your shame.`
` Worthless, pathetic...!`
` If only you'd just grovel and die!!"`
`"......Quit it, Aneki.`
` ...She could've dodged it.`
` But she didn't."`
`"...She realized that you were in the line of fire, Aneki.`
` So this faithful girl took it without dodging, protecting you.`
` At the very end, she saw that I was pinning the rook and the king."`
`"...S-Spectacular......"`
`"Don't hate me for it.`
` ...I planned to resign if you noticed it while you were taking those three steps."`
`'!s1`
`out of consideration...`
`...for me, didn't you...?`
` ......I didn't even try to think about it.`
` ...I...`
`was...`
`lazy......"`
`"...You were a good woman.`
` Go to heaven before me and get yourself all made up.`
` I'll definitely come and chat you up."`
`As Belphegor slowly fell over, ...she lost even the power that kept her in human form,`
` and she grew small, like gold dust, melting into thin air...`
`At that point, Kyrie dashed in.`
`It seemed that she had somehow defeated her pursuer by her own hands.`
`As she pointed the barrel of her gun straight at the witch, she ran up to the wound-covered Rudolf.`
`"...Are you okay?`
` Were you chatting someone up just now?"`
`"Yep, a good woman.`
` ...No match for you, of course.`
` ......Sorry, Aneki.`
` It's checkmate."`
`The two of them pinned the witch down the barrels of their guns.`
`"......Worthless furniture.`
` ...To think they'd be beaten by Human opponents.`
` ...Worthless.`
` Stupid.`
` ...Boring...!"`
`"Beatrice-sama, we should retreat for now.`
` ...There is no furniture or barrier to guard against bullets here."`
`"Eheheheh, `
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch began to let out a muffled laugh.`
`...It surprised not only Rudolf and Kyrie, but Ronove as well.`
`......Because a situation like this, with two guns pointed at her, `
`was not one that even a witch could just laugh off.`
`But the witch laughed with pleasure.`
`"......Well, it's only natural that the Predecessor-sama's worn out furniture couldn't do it.`
` ...I need to get new furniture that's suitable for me.`
` I used them out of obligation,`
` ...but I've always hated second-hand stuff."`
`As she said that, she looked down at Belphegor's remains, which had already finished turning into a pile of gold dust, with disgust.`
`"I don't know what you're talking about.`
` Be a good girl and put your hands up."`
`...Then, the witch obediently raised her hands.`
`But instead of raising her hands because a gun was being pointed a her,`
` it looked more like she was a conductor facing an orchestra, waving her conductor's baton.`
`"Come, arise, furniture suitable for me...!!`
` Not that cheap furniture, much stronger ones!`
` Cruel ones!!`
` Ahhahahahahahahahahahahyahhyahhya!!!"`
`"Stop this bizarre act...!`
` I'll pull the trigger..."`
`In response to the witch's call, the hall was once again buried with the color of gold.`
`As the brilliantly radiant gold butterflies danced,`
` ...it felt as though they were being sucked into an ocean of gold leaf.`
`Ronove was shocked at that upsurge in magical power...`
` After all, it far surpassed that of his former master.`
`As their eyes were dazzled amidst this golden flash, a gunshot could be heard.`
` Either Rudolf or Kyrie had fired a round.`
`...Then, when the golden flash subsided, at the very least the witch was standing there, looking cool and composed.`
`The bullet?`
` Kyrie must have fired it into her.`
`But the witch had not been hit anywhere on her body.`
`There it is.`
` ...The bullet had been fastened in midair right in front of the witch's chest.`
`"...A-A bullet-proof barrier......!"`
`In an instant, a barrier that would require a significant amount of preparation even for the Predecessor had been...`
` Ronove's face was twisted in shock.`
`And, the surprises did not end there...`
`The cloud of gold butterflies had created two humanoid forms.`
`...It was a furniture summoning.`
`The butterflies peeled off and flew away, and beneath them, furniture in the shape of girls showed themselves.`
`".........The Chiester Sisters Corps...`
` ......Even the Predecessor...`
`...wasn't able to summon Pendragon's Memorial Troops on a moment's notice, and to do it so easily...!"`
`"Chiester 410. Riiight here."`
`"Chiester 45. Right here."`
`"...You two are suitable furniture for me, I take it?"`
`"From reading a picture book out aloud, to going on a date, to shooting down meteorites,`
` we'll take care of anything. Nihihi."`
`"I-If we don't take care of it, Pendragon-sama will get mad at us...!`
` Please, your orders, Great Lady Beatrice!"`
`"......Rudolf-san,`
` let's run for it.`
` We're no match for these ones...!"`
`"...S-Sure!"`
`Kyrie definitely heard warning sirens going off in her head, `
`thanks to the same feeling that had alerted her to the ambush by the Seven Sisters of Purgatory.`
`Without hesitation, they escaped.`
`As the witch elegantly watched them leave, she commanded her new furniture.`
`"...This is an order.`
` Kill the two who ran away.`
` Then bring the corpses back here.`
` I'll bring 'em back to life and play with them over and over.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`The witch's expression twisted into an evil smile.`
`Even though she feared that expression, Lucifer appeared and spoke.`
`"F-Forgive my presumption,`
` ...but the Predecessor-sama asked that you avoid brutal actions of that sort..."`
`When the witch stared at her with those terrifying eyes, Lucifer was struck dumb.`
`...She was frustrated.`
`It was so boring, not being able to let her own power and cruelty run wild.`
`...This annoying furniture of the Predecessor kept telling her to show restraint, bringing her irritation to a peak.`
`"Oh, it's Lucifer of Pride.`
` Long time no see nyeh, how ya doin'?`
` Let's play together again sometime.`
` Nihhihihihihihi!"`
`"Y-You mustn't whisper, 410, you'll get in trouble...!`
` Let us carry out the Great Lady Beatrice's order at once...!"`
`"Nihi.`
` Well, yeah, we are on the job right now nyeh.`
` ...410, roger that.`
` Preparing for Sniping Pursuit Combat."`
`"Accumulating Terrain Data, Accumulating Data for Firing.`
` Data Link with 410."`
`"410, Data Received.`
` Target Lock Acquired.`
` Commencing Terrain Calculation Error Correction.`
` Formulating Firing Curve, Supplemental Control Point Calculations Complete.`
` Data Link to 45."`
`"45, Data Received.`
` Checking Hazard Zone...ah, that's no good!"`
`"Lucifer-chan, better get out from behind us, `
`or you'll get roasted by the backblast. Nihi!"`
`"......Nng..."`
`Thanks to their paired measurements, `
`the Chiester Sisters were able to instantly calculate the terrain throughout the mansion and the coordinates of their targets,`
` as well as a firing curve to reach them.`
`...That's right, their shots could be guided to follow a curved line.`
`None could escape.`
`The precision guidance used by the Seven Sisters of Purgatory was nothing more than a cheap knockoff of the ability these two held.`
`"45, Firing Preparations Concluded.`
` Ammo Type Selected and Loaded."`
`As the two of them faced each other,`
` it was as though they were both pulling back a bowstring together...`
`...A dazzling gold arrow was readied there.`
`"410, nihi.`
` Firing."`
`After giving that announcement, they released a single arrow together.`
`As the path taken by the gold-sparkling snake of light drew a curve,`
` it followed the direction that Rudolf and Kyrie had escaped to in rapid pursuit.`
`It turned through the corridors, crawled over the floor, chasing them as it drew a beautiful curve.`
`No one could block the guided shots of the Chiester Sisters.`
`No one could escape from them.`
`And their strength could pierce all physical and magical defenses.`
`...It was quite a merciless guided weapon of certain death.`
`However, among mythical-class soldiers, it was a weapon used by pretty much everyone.`
`It was very commonplace for them...and very extraordinary for those of the everyday world.`
`"Wh-What the...?!"`
`When he noticed something rapidly chasing them and turned around...`
`The exact position of Rudolf's heart was pierced by the gold snake.`
` It all happened in an instant.`
`"R-Rudolf-san...?!"`
`After the gold snake pierced Rudolf, `
`it swooped down to the floor, drawing a beautiful spiral, coiled itself around Kyrie's legs, and crawled up to her chest.`
`And just like Rudolf, it pierced the exact location of her heart.`
`...And all of that happened in an instant.`
`It pierced Rudolf, and then Kyrie.`
`So they died, dropped to their knees, and fell over at almost the exact same time.`
`"...What's thiiis?`
` Talk about overwhelming, ahhahahahahahahahahahahaha!`
` Ridiculously easy, isn't it?`
` Kuhhihihyahyahyahyahya!`
` This is the kind of furniture I need.`
` Way different from Predecessor-sama's second-hand furniture!"`
`"Come on, bring their corpses here.`
` I'll keep reviving them until I'm bored, and I'll try killing them in as brutal a way as I can think of.`
` Aaah, to think being a witch could be so much fun, `
`that taking a life could be so much fun, ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!"`
`...From the time humans are born, the most shunned action they can take is the murder of another human.`
`It's only natural that humans can't understand how pleasurable it can be to break this taboo.`
`...But she was no longer a Human.`
`She was a witch.`
`...And there were some pleasures that only witches could understand.`
`By now, she had tasted those pleasures...and was totally immersed in them.`
`...After learning that the contents of the forbidden pot were honey, she could no longer live without them.`
`...No, maybe the contents were honey because they were forbidden.`
`Anyway, by killing Humans gruesomely, `
`and doing it over and over, she could feel the drug-like pleasure even now.`
`As the witch rolled over laughing, `
`the gold snake that had just been shot returned as though being reeled in.`
`At the tips, two people were pinned and dragged along.`
`The witch's order had been fulfilled.`
`...Rudolf and Kyrie had been killed instantly, and their corpses had been carried back.`
`"Chiesters 45 and 410, Order Execution Complete.`
` We await your next order, Great Lady Beatrice.`
` Please, your orders...!"`
`"From babysitting, to playing online games with you, `
`to shooting down a space shuttle, we'll take care of everything.`
` Nihihi!"`
`"......It looks like these two are the sacrifices for the fourth and fifth twilights.`
` So in the end, I'll need those worthless Seven Sisters...`
`or are they the Five Sisters now?`
` I need those guys to pierce and gouge the forehead and the chest."`
`"...But I can do that at the very end, and I'm free to play in any way I want until then, right?`
` Heheheheheheheheheh!"`
`"Wait wait wait waait.`
` ...Have you already forgotten what I've told you?!"`
`"Oh, it's you, Predecessor-sama.`
` Do you have any complaints?"`
`"Of course I do...!`
` You're doing whatever you please, aren't you?!`
` Why haven't you followed my directions?!"`
`"What's wrong with doing as I please, Predecessor-sama?`
` Anyway, I don't plan on deviating from the rules of the ceremony in the slightest."`
`"I'll definitely clean these two corpses up later and drive stakes into their forehead and chest."`
`"I'm telling you, that is not the problem...!`
` If you act so undignified and cruel...`
`umm, some people might take it badly..."`
`"............`
`...You mean your opponent in that game, the one you're supposedly fighting against somewhere?`
` Ronove told me."`
`"...D-Damn that blabbermouth.`
` ......Well, to be perfectly honest, that's how it is.`
` If you go a little too far...umm, `
`...that person will object, you see?"`
`"Why can't this person just complain to me directly, instead of making you take a message?`
` ...That coward."`
`"......Well, this is a resident of a different world from yours.`
` There's no choice but to use me as an intermediary.`
` Well, that's beside the point but-"`
`".........`
`...Which means that this person couldn't interact with me even if they wanted to.`
` And I can't interact with them even if I want to either.`
` Simply put, this is a completely unrelated person from a world that distant, right?"`
`"I-Indeed.`
` ...For example, perhaps you could say these worlds are like very close parallel lines.`
` The distance between them is quite small, but because the lines are parallel, they will never cross.`
` For now, that should be a convenient way for you to view that world."`
`"They never cross.`
` Which means...`
`...that world has nothing to do with me.`
` ...If you're speaking for that person when you tell me to show restraint, please pass this message on to them."`
`"To them?`
` What should I say...?"`
`"It's none of your business, so disappear, you old hag.`
` If only you'd just give up and die..."`
`".........Wha..."`
`"...Oh, I'm sorry.`
` Since it was a friend of yours, I just assumed she'd be a woman.`
` By 'old hag', I'm definitely not talking about you, Predecessor-sama, so please don't get mad at me.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`When she spoke, the witch was looking straight into Beato's eyes.`
`...Anyone present would be able to tell what she meant by it.`
`"......Predecessor-sama,`
` there's something I find really strange.`
` ...Why do you have to play a game with someone from another world...`
`and have him accept that you're a witch?"`
`"Well, as to that,`
` ...it's because making all humans accept the existence of witches is a prerequisite of perfect control.`
` There was a single holdout who simply wouldn't accept me as a witch."`
`"......Why would you need the approval of a Human?`
` Witches are witches and can use magic, so why should we need to be acknowledged by Humans?"`
`"...Nnn...... Well, like I said earlier, magic is..."`
`"I am a witch.`
` I can use magic without anyone's approval in particular, so what's your point...?"`
`"In this world, right?`
` However, since that person won't accept it, umm, `
`...nnnnn, how should I explain it..."`
`"...I don't need you to.`
` After all, isn't all this about a different world that never crosses this one?`
` In other words, that world might as well not exist."`
`"......You fighting a game in another world is absolutely no different from you telling me about stuff from your imagination.`
` ...I'll say it again.`
` It has nothing to do with me.`
` And, I am already a witch."`
`"Predecessor-sama, somehow or another, it seems that you can't become a witch as long as this person doesn't acknowledge you, but I'm different.`
` Even though no one has acknowledged me, I'm an excellent witch already.`
` ......Since you are my predecessor, I will formally pay you respect,`
` but that's out of kindness, not out of duty."`
`"...I won't ask for your advice anymore...`
`because I clearly know what I should do and how I should play from now on."`
`"......So I will carry out the murder of 13 people as a final act of respect for you.`
` However, there is absolutely no reason for you to interfere with the methods I use...`
`or what I do afterwards.`
` .........Therefore, I'll be counting on you in that regard."`
`At a glance, those words seemed obedient, but they contained within them a clear parting of ways.`
`...She was no longer under Beato's care in any way.`
`That's why she was clearly saying nothing more than 'Don't get in the way of my fun'.`
`Beato understood that...`
`and was dejected, realizing that no matter how she explained it, she wouldn't be able to make the witch understand.`
`"...I......I see...`
` Then it is no longer my problem...`
` Go and learn with your own body how magic ceases to exist when you lose your respect for it."`
`"...I wish you'd tell me where the respect was in that carefree rampage of yours up until now."`
`After hearing that, Beato could not respond.`
`...Because she remembered hearing exactly the same thing from her teacher.`
`"Okay now.`
` Chiester Sisters?`
` See off my predecessor on her way back."`
`"Nihihihihi.`
` Predecessor-sama, please leave this place."`
`"I-If you don't, we'll be scolded...!"`
`Throughout her body, Beato felt something unseeable from the Chiester Sisters...which could only be described as an oppressive sensation.`
`...Most likely, they were initiating firing calculations.`
`It was an action much like taking out a gun and cocking it.`
`Even Beato could not escape from the Chiester Sisters' attacks without any preparation.`
`...In the past, she had placed her greatest trust in them, so she knew how terrifying they were down to her very soul.`
`"......Predecessor-sama, if you would retire.`
` ......I would not recommend damaging Beatrice-sama's mood any further."`
`"...Predecessor-sama..."`
`"...I-I understand.`
` ...I shall leave for now.`
` ...I'll watch over the end you eventually reach at my leisure!"`
`It was almost infinitely close to a parting shot.`
`...So, after Beato vanished, the witch and her furniture doubled over laughing...`
`"......Well, I do understand.`
` The endless power is fun.`
` ...The joy of freely toying with an extremely limited life cannot be explained to those who have not tasted it.`
` ...I can understand that feeling of being possessed with a pleasure similar to drugs."`
`"...It must have been quite fun,`
` judging by your antics in the past."`
`"Are you saying...it's just like when you tried to admonish me in the past, over and over, and I did not listen...?"`
`"......Why have you started trying to scold that child for her actions?"`
`"Nnn, ...umm, well.`
` ........."`
`"...There's a single large difference between you and that child.`
` That child may already be a witch.`
` Of course, you are also a witch.`
` ...At least, in the world on top of the game board."`
`"...However, to be acknowledged as a witch in the world outside the game board,`
` you need to have Battler-kun, your opponent in this game, acknowledge you.`
` ...You must have understood that when you started the game."`
`"...I thought that if I could show off a whirlwind of proof that I am a witch,`
` blow away his desire to deny me, and make him surrender, `
`......he would acknowledge me as a witch.`
` ...It all went my way last time, so I thought I was just a breath away..."`
`"It's actually the opposite.`
` Battler-kun was disgusted by your brutality.`
` He did not step up to the plate as a player because he acknowledged you as a worthy opponent.`
` It was based on a strong animosity, his resolve to completely deny the existence of a brutal witch."`
`"......In your foolishness, you probably felt that Battler-kun's acceptance of his role as your opponent was a first step `
`towards making him acknowledge you as a witch.`
` However, it was actually the opposite."`
`"Battler-kun challenged you in this game because he was absolutely determined not to acknowledge you.`
` ...No matter how hard the thoughtless north wind blows, the traveler only wears his cloak even tighter.`
` You were committing a huge error from the very beginning."`
`"......This game is not torture to make Battler-kun surrender.`
` It is a test, in which you must try to make Battler-kun accept you."`
`"......`
`...Uu...`
` ...I've vaguely...`
`noticed that..."`
`"The last game was a tough one for Battler.`
` But, as it seems you've already noticed,`
` ...this game is a tough one for you."`
`"Wh-What should I do from now on?"`
`"Think about it for yourself.`
` ...Fortunately, you have already given up your pieces on the game board to the new witch.`
` You should have plenty of time to reflect upon your own self."`
`"......But Battler's already a mass of hostility to me.`
` He won't accept witches, so he won't accept me.`
` ...In that case, what can I do to make him accept me...?`
` Are you saying that if the north wind doesn't work, ...then I should shine on him as the sun from now on...?`
` Me, after all this time...?"`
`"It's October now.`
` The Halloween season.`
` ......It's the month of rebirth, when the sun dies and is revived again.`
` When the sun is weak right after reviving, it may not reach far through the cold winter winds."`
`"However, it slowly grows...and is eventually able to hail the coming of spring.`
` ...At that time, the traveler may even fold up his cloak."`
`"......Are you saying...`
`that I've been mistaken......?"`
`...The beautiful hall of the Ushiromiya mansion was covered with a golden sparkle like gold leaf...`
`and stained deep red with thick spurts of blood.`
`The number of deaths given to Rudolf and Kyrie had long surpassed anything you could count on both your fingers and your toes.`
`The witch was breathing so hard her shoulders shook, but it wasn't because she was tired.`
`...She just couldn't hide her ragged breaths caused by her still uncontainable excitement.`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahaha!!`
` How fun it is to do as I will with people's lives and deaths!`
` With the power of the Endless Witch, the endless everything I paint with my mind becomes reality!`
` No matter how sloppily I mash them, `
`I can revive them, returning them to normal with just a snap of my fingers.`
` Because in the end, I just have to restore the corpses and follow the epitaph as an afterthought.`
` Ahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"...Hey, you guys,`
` have you ever sliced a stuffed animal's stomach open?"`
`"Never, nihi.`
` What about you, 45?"`
`"N-No...!`
` I have never done it, my apologies...!"`
`"That's understandable.`
` Normally, you wouldn't.`
` Especially not if it was a stuffed animal you liked.`
` But I've always thought about it."`
`"I always thought about peeking in...`
`and seeing what was packed inside this fluffy stuffed animal I loved."`
`If you cut it and looked inside, your curiosity might be quelled, but the stuffed animal would be broken.`
`...So, even though you want to see, you can't.`
`You understand that feeling, right?`
`"...The power of the Endless Witch can truly grant that wish.`
`  ...As I am now, I can slice the stuffed animal all I want."`
`"...And yet, with a bit of magic, I can return it to normal and revive it.`
` ...In other words, it means I've broken all limitations in this world.`
` ...As I am now, I don't have to hesitate or give up an idea or anything."`
`"That joy...aah, there's probably no one who can understand it.`
` No one other than me, the Golden Witch!!"`
`As the witch let out a mad war cry, she revived Rudolf and Kyrie again,`
` and faster than they could realize it, she killed them right away.`
`...And she made it known that something other than cotton was stuffed inside those two.`
`"...Q-`
`Quit it, Eva...!"`
`"Huh?`
` ...Ah, it's you.`
` How long have you been there?"`
`In that gruesome hall, Hideyoshi appeared with his gun readied.`
`The witch had sealed the mansion with a barrier, so Hideyoshi had nowhere to run.`
`...He'd probably picked up Rudolf's or Kyrie's gun and come back.`
`The gun, which should have been something to be feared, was apparently no longer an object she took seriously now that she was overflowing with magical power.`
`Her bold expression didn't flinch in the slightest.`
`"......Why did you have to kill Rosa-san and Maria-chan, `
`...and Rudolf-kun and Kyrie-san...?!"`
`"Huh?`
` I am the Head of the Ushiromiya family, the witch of Rokkenjima.`
` Everything that occurs on this island is all up to me.`
` ...Whether they happen to be alive or dead at any particular moment in time is meaningless to me."`
`"...You went mad after finding Father's gold...!`
` Just how high must that gold have been piled?`
` I can't even imagine it.`
` It must have been enough to steal away your sanity..."`
`"...But if there was that much gold,`
` ...why didn't you think of graciously splittin' it up...?!!"`
`"You misunderstand.`
` ......All of that belongs to the Golden Witch.`
` No one is qualified to touch it except me.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle* Ahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`"...What are you?`
` Don't tell me you're that thing Eva told me about long ago, ...the witch Eva from when she was young?"`
`"That's right.`
` I am the 'me' from my years as a girl, who's been living in the heart of your wife, Ushiromiya Eva, this whole time.`
` ...And I'm a witch.`
` ......Eva became an adult by forgetting me.`
` So she can't use magic."`
`"...All kids get their heads filled with innocent but cruel ideas sometimes.`
` When I was young, I'd sometimes go around steppin' on ants and pullin' the wings off dragonflies.`
` ......However, I learned the importance of life, and graduated from that cruel childhood age."`
`"...Right now, you really are a child!`
` ...A personality that I know Eva graduated from!`
` That personality isn't Eva.`
` It's a completely different human!!"`
`"That's right.`
` I am not Ushiromiya Eva.`
` I'm the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
` It's so fun, not being bounded by any limitations, and the pleasure of being able to do as I will with life and death is truly wonderful...!`
` I don't have to apologize for breaking a goldfish bowl,`
` and I can tear stuffed animals up as much as I want!`
` I-"`
`There was a crisp sound.`
`...It was the sound of Hideyoshi slapping the witch's face.`
`Looking at the hall stained deep red with fresh blood, he should have been able to imagine how terrible the witch was.`
`But without fear, without even hesitating, Hideyoshi had walked determinedly up to her and hit her on the cheek.`
`"............!"`
`'!s0`
` Don't act like you're cruel, not when you're really a coward and a weakling!`
` I'll correct that evil nature of yours again if I have to!!`
` You fool!`
` Fool!!"`
`'!s0`
`...ouch, `
`...hey...!"`
`"You're a woman who understands how important, how fragile a life is, aren't you?!`
` I'll make you remember...!!`
` What are you calling a 'witch', you stupid fool?!!`
` You're my wife, Ushiromiya Eva!`
` If anything, you're witch of the kitchen, who can always make the perfect snacks out of refrigerator leftovers in a flash!!`
` Won't you open your eyes, you fool...?!!"`
`"Didn't I just tell you...`
`that I'm not Ushiromiya Eva...?!"`
`"You stupid fool!!`
` You!`
` You!!"`
`As tears dripped down his face, Hideyoshi kept hitting the witch's head.`
`He wasn't even pointing the gun at her anymore.`
`Therefore.`
`That sound of gunfire couldn't have come from the gun Hideyoshi was holding.`
`...The gun, which had fallen in the corner near Rudolf's corpse, was floating in the air,`
` ...and smoke lingered near the barrel.`
`And the bullet?`
`......A red stain was slowly spreading across the chest section of Hideyoshi's vest.`
`Even though his back was facing the barrel of the gun, ...the bullet had driven through Hideyoshi's chest.`
`'!s1`
`va......`
`......uu..."`
`"...Like I said, I'm not Eva.`
` What a stupid, annoying man.`
` ...You're a pain, so I'll switch the sacrifice of the sixth twilight to you.`
` ...If only you'd just hidden under some bed shaking or something, I planned on letting you go.`
` ...But no, you went to all the trouble of coming back.`
` You really are a stupid man."`
`*thunk*...`
` There was a dull sound as Hideyoshi fell to the floor.`
`Even though death would have allowed him to escape from that pain, he resisted until the last second,`
` and staring straight into the witch's eyes, ...he passed away.`
`Because he had died without closing his eyes, the witch didn't realize that he was dead for a short while...`
`and remained pinned by that gaze.`
`"Should we make this one a new toy and play?`
` Nihi."`
`At those words, the witch finally realized that Hideyoshi was dead.`
`"......Nng, ...yeah.`
` ...Right, what'll we do..."`
`The Chiester Sisters waited for instructions.`
`On the inside, they imagined the sorts of even more brutal orders their master might give.`
`But the expression that rose to the witch's face looked as though she'd gotten over her excitement.`
`She looked down at Hideyoshi's face, which still had tears dripping down it...`
`"...It's such a killjoy, and it's all this guy's fault.`
` I'm done.`
` ......Ronove, are you there?"`
`"Yes, right here."`
`"Take care of the cleanup.`
` ...I'll bet the Predecessor-sama makes a fuss over this one.`
` Please make it clean enough for that old hag to accept. ...I guess I'll follow the rules of the ceremony, out of a sense of obligation to my Predecessor-sama.`
` Treat these three corpses as the fourth through sixth twilights.`
` Lucifer, it's your turn."`
`"Lucifer of Pride, right here."`
`"Dig into these three corpses and gouge them."`
`"...I-Into corpses?"`
`"That's right.`
` Got a problem with that?"`
`"N-No..."`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory had their own sort of pride.`
`It was the pride of a hunter, the pride of gouging prey that they had brought down themselves.`
`...However, being told to gouge a corpse that someone else had brought down ran contrary to that sentiment.`
`Of course, the witch didn't mean it that way, but for the Seven Sisters, it was horribly humiliating.`
`...However, they had already screwed this up, with two of the Sisters defeated, so they had no right to question her.`
`Only Ronove appreciated this, and he rested his hand on her shoulder in understanding.`
`"...This is an order from Beatrice-sama.`
` Lucifer, carry these three and dispose of them in accordance with the etiquette of the ceremony.`
` Then, when you are done, lend me a hand with the cleanup."`
`"Certainly..."`
`The witch looked down upon Hideyoshi's corpse, as though implying that the now delicate atmosphere was all Hideyoshi's fault.`
`"......Stupid man.`
` And you didn't even have to die."`
`"Dear...!!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!`
` Dear, where are you?!`
` You're there, right?`
` Answer me!!"`
`The crash of a thunderbolt woke Eva from her nightmare.`
`If Hideyoshi had been gripping her hand at that time, her fearful heart would probably have been instantly healed.`
`However, Hideyoshi, who had supposedly sworn that he wouldn't leave even for a moment, was nowhere to be seen in the room.`
`"Dear, `
`...answer me, `
`......dear...!!`
` Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!"`
`...30 minutes had already passed since Rudolf's group had left the guesthouse.`
`By any measure, their return was too late.`
`...And Krauss and Natsuhi, who waited by the entrance, were reaching the limits of their patience.`
`The chain was set on the door.`
`That was a precaution in the event that Rudolf's group was attacked and the master key stolen from them.`
`For that reason, they needed to wait by the entrance like this for the others to return...`
`"...They really are too late.`
` Don't you think something might have happened to them...?"`
`"......Indeed..."`
`Krauss glanced between his watch and the door, struggling to keep his composure.`
`"If...something happened to prevent them from returning..."`
`"...A terrible thought, but it seems we should ready ourselves for that possibility.`
` ...So, it really was too reckless after all."`
`"Th-That is what I said...!`
` Why did they go outside when they knew it was this dangerous...?!`
` How foolish!`
` Why go outside, even though Rosa-san had just been attacked...?!!"`
`"......Nothing will come of saying that now.`
` ...At any rate, there are now three adults in the guesthouse.`
` Me, you, `
`...and Eva, who's asleep with a high fever."`
`At that time, the forceful sound of a door being opened came from the hallway, and they heard Eva's panicked voice.`
`...That voice kept calling out Hideyoshi's name.`
`...It seemed as though she'd had a bad dream or something due to her fever...and was calling for her husband.`
`"Eva-san, `
`...what is it, are you okay...?"`
`"...Wh-Where is my husband?!`
` My husband isn't here!!`
` Even though he promised that he'd stay with me the whole time!`
` Even though he promised that he'd grasp my hand the whole time!!"`
`...Krauss was struck dumb by this attitude of hers, which she had never shown in front of him before, but Natsuhi understood her feelings.`
`"...C-Calm down...`
` Hideyoshi-san is with Rudolf-san and Kyrie-san, and they're outside right now."`
`"Outside?!?!`
` Wh-Wh-Why, `
`why did he go outside, `
`after he promised that he'd stay with me the whole time?!`
` You mustn't go outside, the witch is outside, you mustn't go, you'll be killed!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`"...Eva, calm yourself.`
` ...Hideyoshi-san returned to the mansion with Rudolf and Kyrie-san."`
`"Why did he have to go to the mansion?!!`
` Why did he go outside, even though it's safe here?!!`
` Why did he go back to the mansion?!!"`
`"............`
`...They went to get enough food to last until tomorrow.`
` ...Hideyoshi-san was worried about your health...and said that was partly why he wanted to go..."`
`"When will they come back?!`
` When will they come back?!`
` Don't go outside, don't go to the rose garden, don't go to the mansion!!`
` The witch is there, the Golden Witch is walking about!`
` If she finds you, you'll be killed, you'll definitely be killed!!`
` When will my husband come back?!"`
`"......They left here thirty minutes ago.`
` We are waiting for their return."`
`"Th-Thirty minutes ago?!`
` Isn't that strange? Why would it take so much time for them to go to the mansion to get food and come back?!`
` And why are you two just standing around here?!`
` We have to go get them!!`
` We have to hurry to where they are!!`
` Eeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!"`
`Eva probably had quite a nightmare.`
`...And, because it had continued even after she woke up, she could no longer hide her panic.`
`Natsuhi tried calming her down, but all it did was make Eva's emotions explode even more.`
`...Maybe they heard that disturbance.`
`Battler and the kids, who had supposedly been on the second floor, were peeking their faces through the crack of the lobby door.`
`Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva.`
` And Battler, George, Jessica, Nanjo.`
`...Everyone in the guesthouse had gathered by the entrance...and understood the current situation.`
`"I agree with Mother.`
` We should go to check on Father and the rest."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` It's even possible that their load's too heavy and they're having trouble carrying it.`
` They should welcome some extra hands."`
`"...Th-This happened right after Rosa-san was attacked.`
` ...This may have been a secondary disaster connected to that.`
` We should act with caution here and..."`
`"Don't be a fool!!`
` What do you mean, caution?!`
` Are you saying we should let my husband die, even though he might be begging for help?!`
` I'm going to look, and the cowards can stay here!!"`
`Looking agitated, Eva raised her gun.`
`Judging by her face, it would be useless for anyone to try and stop her.`
`...George, who realized that first, raised his head.`
`"I'll go as well.`
` You will too, right, Battler-kun?`
` The more people, the better...!"`
`"S-Sure!!`
` Aunt Eva, we're coming even if you tell us not to."`
`"...I-I'm coming too...!`
` I can't be the only one to hide in a safe place...!"`
`"Jessica, you must not go outside!!`
` Stay here with me.`
` Got it?!"`
`It was like they were implying that those three had already been killed anyway, so going outside would be pointless.`
`Natsuhi realized that Eva felt like her heart had been gouged out, but she spoke out strongly as Jessica's mother.`
`".........You're right.`
` That should be fine.`
` Let's have Nii-san's family keep an eye on the guesthouse.`
` This is a problem for my family and Battler-kun's.`
` And I wonder if Doctor Nanjo would mind coming too.`
` Just in case."`
`"......In the hall of the mansion, Battler, Eva, George, and Nanjo...`
`found the corpses of Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi."`
`"......The fourth through sixth twilights?`
` Then, the corpses were pierced through the forehead, chest, and stomach with those demon stakes?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...The demon stakes were buried into them: one in Rudolf's forehead,`
` one in Hideyoshi's chest,`
` and one in Kyrie's stomach."`
`"The disorder of the clothing on all three suggests that they were fighting or running away.`
` Since the three corpses were not found right next to each other, it is hypothesized that after coming into contact with the culprit, they attempted some form of resistance."`
`"......And they had stakes in the forehead, chest, and stomach.`
` ...Horrible, just like usual..."`
`"............"`
`Even though Ronove knew it would be superfluous, he contemplated telling Battler the truth.`
`...Normally, the witch would have killed them in a much, much more horrible way.`
`...The corpses had been left in this manner only because Beato had suggested to the witch that she show restraint.`
`The new witch, thinking it would fit well enough as long as she gouged them with stakes,`
` ...would probably have just stuck a stake into a lump of meat that wasn't even shaped like a Human.`
`Rosa's and Maria's corpses were a particularly striking example.`
`...If they'd been killed as the Golden Witch had wished, just how gruesome would the corpses have been?`
`Beato had changed that into the 'still better' kind of killing Battler had mentioned earlier.`
`Wanting to have Beato's small bit of thoughtfulness appreciated, he thought of telling Battler about this.`
`...But judging by Battler's eyes, that might do more harm than good.`
`To humans, the gap between being alive and being dead is very large.`
`Saying that she'd given them better deaths might have made it possible for a demon to understand her feelings and pardon her,`
` but there was no way a Human would be so accepting.`
`Understanding this, Ronove remained silent despite knowing of Beato's modest efforts...`
`"Just like usual, let's start by checking whether the corpses are dead.`
` ...Ronove, please declare it in red."`
`"............"`
`"Hey, can't you hear me?`
` ...Please declare it in red.`
` Repeat it.`
` 'Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi are dead'."`
`"......My apologies.`
` Allow me to decline from repeating that."`
`"The hell...?`
` What are you planning, all of a sudden...?"`
`By now, proclaiming that the victims were dead in red was almost a given in this battle.`
`Refusing to do that was almost like losing by default.`
`...So when Ronove refused as part of his first move, Battler was dumbfounded.`
`"My apologies.`
` As of this moment, I relinquish my position as Milady's representative.`
` ...Accordingly, 'I' cannot repeat that in red.`
` ...The only one qualified to repeat that...is Milady."`
`"........."`
`"...His point is a valid one.`
` Ronove is only a representative for Beato's side.`
` ...If he steps down from that position, and if you will not accept Beato as an opponent,`
` ...a new representative must be named."`
`"...No new representative exists.`
` ...Please, Battler-sama.`
` Please accept Milady as your game partner once more."`
`"......Sorry, `
`but that's advice I can't listen to.`
` ...I definitely won't accept that unpleasant, cruel bastard as my opponent.`
` ...My refusal to accept her is why I can't step down from this game."`
`"As to her being unpleasant, I apologize in Milady's stead.`
` Allow me to pledge that Milady will not undertake such unpleasant actions again."`
`".........`
`...I wonder about that."`
`"...Battler-kun,`
` I also want to apologize as that child's teacher.`
` I'll give that child a good talking to, so please offer your forgiveness just this once."`
`"...Hey, hey, enough of that.`
` You're making it sound like I'm the bad guy.`
` ...And no matter how much you guys apologize, it won't reach my ears.`
` ...If Beato can say that from her own lips, `
`......well, I might listen to her."`
`"......Understood.`
` If that is your only condition for acknowledging your opponent again, let us have that child apologize.`
` ......Ronove,`
` call for that child.`
` Will that be all right, Battler-kun...?"`
`"......Sheesh.`
` ...Do whatever you want.`
` Still, don't expect me to forgive her.`
` ...Go get that irritating witch."`
`"...You have my thanks, Battler-sama.`
` ...I shall summon her here.`
` ...Milady, Battler-sama is calling for you."`
`After a few heartbeats, gold butterflies gathered together in midair and created Beato's form.`
`...It was a much more docile appearance than the one's she'd made before.`
`"......Did you call, Ronove?"`
`"...I believe you heard.`
` ...Is there something you have to say, from your own lips...?"`
`"............"`
`"............"`
`It looked as though Beato shrunk slightly under Battler's cold gaze.`
`Several times, Beato made an effort to get the words out of her mouth, but that didn't work so well,`
` ...and she was just as awkward as someone trying to light a match during a freezing winter with icy hands...`
`Even as she did that, the game board was advancing...`
`In the hall, they had just found the corpses of the new victims and had broken down crying...`
`'!s1`
`...Kyrie-san, `
`...oooooooooooooooooohhhh, `
`...nnngaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh..."`
`"Dear, ...deeeaar, ...whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh...!!"`
`"...Mother, `
`...hang in there...`
` ...Even for me it's...`
`...so crushing...`
`...so sad...!!"`
`".........They probably died instantly.`
` ...I'm sure that, even if we had arrived immediately after they fell, it would have been too late..."`
`"No, that's wrong!!`
` They were definitely alive!!`
` His chest was stabbed with something like this...!`
` My husband must have died in extreme pain...!!`
` If we had come faster, ...surely they would've been saved!`
` They would definitely have been saved!!`
` Uuuuuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh..."`
`"...It must be tough...for you too, Battler-kun, ......but stay strong..."`
`"......I'm okay, ...it's okay, Aniki...`
` Let me cry just a little bit longer...`
` ...I've got it the best...`
` I should be the least sad...!`
` So if you let me cry just a little longer, ...I'll be fine..."`
`"That isn't true...`
` ...I can understand how much it must hurt your heart to have lost both parents...`
` ...I still have Mother.`
` ...That's much better than what you're going through, Battler-kun..."`
`"No, that's wrong!!`
` It's got to be toughest for you, George-aniki...`
` ...I understand, Aniki...`
` ...In this group, ...you're the saddest...and the one who has it toughest!!`
` I understand that, `
`...so I can't keep on sobbing like this...!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaggghhhh!!"`
`"...Why...do you say it's toughest for me...?"`
`"To me, Dad and Kyrie-san...were people I'd eventually split up with when I grew up and became independent.`
` Since they're parents, it was fated that they'd die before their kids.`
` ...It just happened a little early, that's all...!"`
`"......But it's different for you, Aniki.`
` You didn't just lose your parents, who would've parted ways with you eventually.`
` ...You also lost Shannon-chan, `
`...someone you should've spent the rest of your life with...!!"`
`"............"`
`"You can't value human lives differently.`
` Whether it's a baby or an old person, they should all be respected the same...!`
` ...But still, the more life that person has ahead of them,`
` ...the longer the future you're building together is, ......the sadder the fact of their death is...!!"`
`"Aniki, you were engaged to Shannon-chan, right?`
` You promised that you'd build a life and a home together in the future, right?!`
` ......Compared to how huge that future was, ...compared to how huge that happiness was,`
` ...stuff like my pain doesn't even come close...!!"`
`"......So you should be allowed to cry much, much more, Aniki...!!`
` And yet, ...just because you act like a big brother to us cousins, `
`......you force yourself to act like you're so calm...!"`
`"......Stop it, ...Battler-kun."`
`George was trying to make a calm smile.`
`...But already, ......he couldn't stop a single hot tear from leaving a streak down his face.`
`"...There's no way I wouldn't...`
`...be sad, right...?`
` ......Together with Shannon, I painted a picture of many futures in my mind.`
` We talked of dreams that couldn't all come true even if we lived a hundred years.`
` ...Of those dreams, `
`even the very first one, `
`......having her move into my family register, could not be granted, `
`......so there's no way I wouldn't...`
`...be sad, right......?"`
`"Compared to that, I...I...!!`
` Like I said, I have no right to cry any more!`
` When even you're struggling to hold it in, I have no right to shed any more tears!!"`
`"...We're the same.`
` ...We both feel the same sadness from losing those close to us.`
` ......So there's no rule that says you can't shed any more tears than me, Battler-kun."`
`"......And,`
` ...for me too, ...there's no rule...that says I have to hold back my tears any longer, is there?"`
`"...Aniki, ...Anikii...!!!`
` Aaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!"`
`"Shannon, the one who shared my dreams for the future, is dead.`
` Father's dead too.`
` ......It's so sad, ...so sad...`
` ...Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!"`
`As Battler and George hugged each other tightly, they cried a waterfall of tears over each other's shoulders for the people who had been so precious to them...`
`"......Do you understand why I said that George-aniki has it the toughest...?"`
`"...I-I was listening, so I understand.`
` ...Your sadness is proportional to the length of time you would have been able to spend with that person afterwards..."`
`"...Of course, you can't calculate it just like that though.`
` ......We Humans aren't like you witches.`
` ...From the time we receive life to the moment we die, we live within that limited period as strongly as we can manage."`
`"......I can't forgive anyone who makes light of that.`
` ...And I definitely can't forgive anyone who sneers at people and toys with them.`
` ...A person like you, whose very concept of death is all screwed up, probably can't understand that."`
`"............"`
`"...I'm not just mad because of the length of time they would've lived afterwards.`
` It's...sneering at the lives of people living with all they've got...`
` That's what I can't forgive the most."`
`"George-aniki lived his life by recklessly doing his best.`
` ...He must have approached this day with a grim resolve to marry Shannon-chan no matter the challenges.`
` ...That's completely different from me, since I was happy just to be able to meet my cousins after a long while."`
`"...B-But still..."`
`"Beato.`
` For now, stay silent and listen."`
`"......I-Indeed."`
`"......In a way, I understand your point.`
` ...You say you need to continue murdering according to the epitaph for your own resurrection."`
`"...So, considering your circumstances, `
`...I can just barely bring myself to understand your murders.`
` ...Because to you, it's a necessary course of action.`
` ...But that means all unnecessary actions you take beyond that...are due to your meaningless and brutal tastes."`
`"...In other words, if killing the six people for the first twilight was a 'necessary action' for you, `
`...then all that show of crushing their faces and splitting their stomachs and stuffing them full of sweets was completely unnecessary,`
` and caused by nothing more than your brutal hobby.`
` ......That's an aspect of you that I definitely cannot forgive."`
`"......I-Indeed..."`
`"When you saw Aunt Rosa getting repeatedly killed in that horrible way,`
` ...you apparently said something like `
`'If they're going to be brought back to life in the end anyway, it doesn't matter how they're killed.'`
` I heard from Virgilia."`
`'!s1`
`...well, `
`...umm......"`
`"That idea that you can kill them as many times as you want, as long as you bring them back to life in the end...`
` Isn't that a completely unnecessary action, with no purpose other than to toy around with someone's life?"`
`"......If you're going to kill, do it instantly!`
` Don't toy with them!!`
` If you won't kill them, then don't bully them!!`
` You're taking advantage of the fact that you can do as you will with people's lives, and you've forgotten the sanctity of life.`
` So I can't accept or acknowledge you...!`
` I definitely can't accept as my opponent a person who doesn't know the value of a life...or the sadness felt when lives are lost!"`
`"......That is why the Endless Magic is known as a black art.`
` ...The Endless Witch has no concept of limitations.`
` ...She has no concept of the limitations and losses caused by breaking and killing."`
`"...For that reason, Endless Witches sometimes start playing by jumping over the gap between life and death `
`like it's a game.`
` ......That is a very, very frightening thing.`
` So as an Endless Witch, and by my own choosing, `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~I never reached your level~ib~`
`."`
`It was something Virgilia had been trying to tell Beato for a long time.`
`But Beato had been too young to obediently listen to those words.`
` She had been too wild.`
`...She had been possessed by that detestable pleasure.`
`"...I have been told not to break vases.`
` ...But that's why I wanted to break them.`
` ......Then I gained the Endless Magic.`
` ...When I knew that I could fix them back to normal no matter how badly I broke them, `
`...I was surprised at how fun it could be to break a vase..."`
`"That is what's known as the forbidden honey.`
` People are not captivated by what's inside.`
` They are captivated by the sealed lock.`
` ......It is truly regrettable."`
`"......I want to ask you, Virgilia.`
` Why does this thing called the Endless Magic exist?`
` ...For what purpose does it exist in this world?"`
`"It is not limited to the Endless Magic.`
` ...All magic exists to bring happiness to the human world.`
` ...After everything that has happened, it may be difficult for you to believe, Battler-kun, ...but in order to bring blessings to the human world, `
`we witches are supposed to become bridges between humans and nonhumans, and that is why we train so hard."`
`"...How does reviving the dead and torturing them to death over and over again help the human world?"`
`"When a vase that was an important memento is broken, `
`if by fixing it, everyone will regain their smiles, I would repair it with magic as many times as necessary.`
` However, I would not be fixing it in order to break it again.`
` ...I would be reviving it to give humans happiness."`
`"In that case, `
`......Beato,`
` you fail as an Endless Witch."`
`"............I-Indeed..."`
`"...There's this thing I've been vaguely thinking about.`
` ......Why do I keep playing this strange game against you?"`
`"...Maybe this game isn't about making me surrender.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ...Maybe it's a test for you to be accepted as an Endless Witch...~ib~in the truest sense~ib~."`
`"...I-I don't know about that.`
` ...The reason I proposed this game to you was...umm...simply as a way to kill time...`
` There were no ulterior motives at work."`
`"Just now, I heard the definition of a witch from Virgilia.`
` By that definition, you, Beato, `
`are not even a witch.`
` You're an apprentice who's still in training...and who misunderstands her own power."`
`"...This was supposed to a fight between a witch and a human.`
` If you aren't a witch, then you aren't qualified to be my opponent.`
` ......Understand?"`
`"...You say...`
`...I am still...`
`...only an apprentice...?`
` Then, when will I be accepted as your opponent once again?`
` ...When can we resume this game?"`
`"......Who knows.`
` ...At the very least, it isn't now.`
` ...When you fully understand what I've said and become a real witch,`
` ...I'll probably accept you as my opponent in this game once more."`
`"I-I can't understand if you say it so abstractly like that...`
` Clearly tell me what I should do to earn your forgiveness..."`
`"No, I've said enough.`
` You think about the rest.`
` ......That's all I want to say.`
` ...If you can't figure it out, try talking with Virgilia and Ronove.`
` ...A brat like you should start off by listening to what the adults say."`
`"......Virgilia,`
` suspend the game for now.`
` Now that Ronove has stepped down as a representative, `
`all we can do is wait for Beato to gain the qualifications of a proper opponent."`
`"...Understood.`
` ...Until Beato has been acknowledged as having earned those qualifications, the game will proceed without an opponent.`
` Is that all right with you too, Beato?"`
`"...I-I have no objections.`
` ......I want time...and a place where I can think at a leisurely pace.`
` ...May I leave my seat for that?"`
`"......Yeah, that's fine."`
`"...Well then, see you...later."`
`"Wait.`
` ...Don't make that dejected face."`
`"............Sorry about that.`
` Letting everything inside my heart show up on my face is part of my personality.`
` I cannot deceive."`
`"Then maybe there's still some hope for you.`
` ......Let me promise you one thing.`
` In this game with you, I might win, and I might lose.`
` ...If you don't come back, it might be my victory by default."`
`At that point, Battler stopped talking for a second.`
`...Then he spoke forcefully.`
`"......However, I definitely won't be the one to step down.`
` I definitely won't give you a victory by default.`
` ...I'll keep on waiting here for you to sit there again as my worthy opponent."`
`"...Battler-sama..."`
`"......Thank you, `
`Battler.`
` ...I will definitely...come back and be accepted by you."`
`After showing a hopeful smile for a very short while, Beato vanished.`
`...After seeing her expression as she left, Battler was absolutely convinced that her face could tell no lies...`
`The seven survivors returned to the guesthouse once again.`
`By now, it was clear that those who went outside would not return alive.`
`Rudolf's group had gone out with two guns and a master key.`
`But those had been lost.`
`It was already clear that those had been stolen by the culprit.`
`Because the shutters were closed on the windows, they couldn't be opened even if the culprit had a master key.`
`The front and back doors that led to the outside were all sealed by chains,`
` and they were further blocked with sofas and tables.`
`Even if the culprit decided to break in through violent means, it wouldn't be easy for them.`
`"...At this point, the typhoon may actually be fortunate.`
` If it were clear outside, it might have been possible for them to set fire to the guesthouse."`
`"If there wasn't a typhoon in the first place, the boat would have arrived before noon.`
` That's not much of a silver lining."`
`"...Eva-san, how do you feel?`
` Please, try to take it easy."`
`"Thank you.`
` ...I still feel like I have a fever, but this is no time to complain about that.`
` ...For the children's sake as well, this is no time to be bedridden."`
`After crying so much in front of Hideyoshi's corpse,`
` Eva had felt a strong self-awareness of her position as a mother, and her expression conveyed a strong will.`
`...In actual fact, her fever still hadn't gone down.`
`And she was aware of that.`
`If she didn't keep a strong hold on herself, she felt as though the fever would make her mind hazy again.`
`By this point, the first floor formed a final line of defense set up by Krauss, Natsuhi, and Eva.`
`The children and the guest, Nanjo, had been strongly warned not to go downstairs without taking great care.`
`If the culprit used a ladder or something, it probably wouldn't be impossible for them to attack from the second floor.`
`But it wouldn't be easy for them to break those sturdy shutters from such an insecure position.`
`The second floor was relatively safe compared to the first.`
`Battler and George had also wanted to remain on the first floor so that they could fight if the worst happened, but Eva had put a stop to that.`
`In her mind, George was now the only member of her family.`
`It seemed that she didn't even want to expose him to the danger of coming downstairs to the first floor.`
`Krauss and Natsuhi could understand that feeling.`
`...Also, a great deal of time had passed since the siege began.`
`In the second floor cousins' room, Battler, George, and Jessica sat dazed...`
`and didn't even listen to the TV that had been left on.`
`For a while, Nanjo had been with them and had tried to lend them words of encouragement,`
` but when he realized that he might actually be having the opposite effect, he hid himself in his own room on the same second floor.`
`George kept looking dazedly at the photographs inserted in his notebook.`
`...It was from the time he'd taken a vacation to Okinawa with Shannon.`
`Shannon's happy smile was contained in those photos.`
`...George could remember the temperature and the humidity, the warmth and strength of the wind, `
`and even what he had been talking about with her at the time those photos had been taken...as clearly as though it had been yesterday.`
`So to George, they weren't simply photos,`
` but a door to bring back warm memories...`
`In this room, even though the sound of the typhoon and the TV should have entered George's hearing,`
` ...it was the scenery of Okinawa he had seen with her and her laughing voice that reached his eyes and his ears...`
`George had strived to be reborn after meeting Shannon.`
`He had sworn to separate himself from the timid person he had once been, `
`easily caught up in the atmosphere, unable to refuse a request, `
`and easily used by those around him.`
`...He had resolved himself to become a strong man who could make her life more joyous.`
`Therefore.`
` ...If he hadn't met Shannon, `
`...the man called Ushiromiya George would probably have lived a very different life.`
`And the George of that different life surely wouldn't have been as excellent a man as he is now.`
`The person I am now exists for Shannon's sake...`
`...Now that Shannon is gone, `
`...why do I exist?`
`It's completely meaningless, isn't it?`
`...He felt a deep, deep sadness, as though he himself had become empty.`
`That feeling must have been tormenting him this whole time.`
` ...However, until Battler mentioned it, he hadn't been aware of the feeling himself.`
`...He'd finally managed to remember...that it should have been all right for him to cry much, much more.`
`So he cried.`
`Just like Battler had, he cried himself dry.`
`...By now, his eyes were bright red and swollen, and he couldn't cry any more.`
`So George did his best to change his way of thinking.`
`He was not meaningless now, ...and he should be grateful to Shannon for giving him such a character.`
`The dead don't come back to life.`
`He would have to get over being separated from his most beloved person.`
`If he were to chase after Shannon and kill himself, she would surely be deeply dejected.`
`...It worked the other way around, too.`
`If he had died, and Shannon had chased after him, throwing away her own life, he wouldn't have been able to forgive himself.`
`...So he chose to surpass his sadness and anger...`
`...and decided to thank her instead.`
`After meeting Shannon, she made his days rich and full...`
`and taught him the meaning of working hard for other people's sakes.`
`As a result, she had shaped him into the kind of person he had wanted to be.`
`...He wanted to thank her for that.`
`He tried to quell his sadness in this way,`
` but each time he did, he remembered Shannon's smile...`
`......He understood it logically.`
`He knew that grieving any more than this would only make her grieve in heaven, `
`...but that didn't bring a stop to his sadness...`
`"Why is it...`
`...that when people die...`
`it's so sad like this...?"`
`Battler muttered.`
`...It was as though he was speaking on behalf of all humans.`
`His question probably hadn't been directed at anyone, but Jessica answered.`
`"...It's always sad when you have to say goodbye.`
` ...But when the person's old or there's some time,`
` ...when you know beforehand that it's coming, sooner or later, `
`that sadness gets spread out over a long period of time.`
` ...When misfortune comes suddenly, it's sad...because you don't even get that time..."`
`"......I see.`
` So, if they get sick or something and end up bedridden in a hospital, you might be able to ready yourself for it bit by bit, `
`...but when it happens suddenly someday, you don't get that luxury."`
`"...The sadness that's usually spread out over several years...closes in on you all at once.`
` ......That's pretty tough.`
` ...Sometimes, it makes you feel a sadness so deep, it can leave scars for life..."`
`"...Scars for life, huh?"`
`"...Like Grandfather's occult hobby.`
` People say that's what caused it.`
` ...That Beatrice, his mistress, died a long time ago, and he was so sad that he couldn't pull himself together.`
` ...Some people whisper...`
`that this is why he started sacrificing the rest of his life to occult research, in order to revive the dead."`
`"If that's true, Grandfather succeeded in that miracle in his last moments.`
` ...The culprit is the revived Beatrice, and Grandfather was reunited with her at the moment he was killed.`
` Pretty ironic that he revived her, and then got killed by her."`
`"......Even so, Grandfather probably managed to meet her.`
` ...He gambled half of his life and, even though it was only for a short time, `
`he was reunited with the woman he wished to see once again."`
`"...Then he got totally roasted though.`
` Feels like that result doesn't quite add up to the cost of researching for half his life."`
`"That's not true.`
` ......Even if it was only for an instant,`
` ...Grandfather must have been happy to be reunited with the woman he loved."`
`"......And that would be true...even if his crime of going against divine providence was punished by God,`
` and his body was burnt and sent down to hell, `
`...even if that reunion only lasted a very short time, right...?"`
`"George nii-san..."`
`"...I wouldn't care I met with the wrath of God and had my body burned.`
` ......Even if it was just for a short amount of time, `
`...if I could revive Shannon again,`
` .........I would sacrifice the rest of my life to the same research as Grandfather.`
` ...I want to talk with Shannon again, `
`...even if it's only for five minutes...`
` ...Even one minute would be fine...`
` ...In exchange, ...I wouldn't mind...sacrificing the rest of my life...!"`
`"......Aniki..."`
`When Battler and Jessica realized that their pointless discussion was causing George pain, they could do nothing more than shut their mouths...`
`...George directed his thoughts to Kinzo's life.`
`He sacrificed half his life to research that no one understood.`
`...And, on the last day of his life, he revived the person he loved most, `
`...and probably succeeded in his reunion in his final moments.`
`George didn't know how much time they'd had together.`
`...He didn't know if they'd been given an hour...or just five minutes.`
`However, ...that moment must have been enough to reward him for all those months of research.`
`...Even though he spent dozens of years to achieve it, that small amount of time was probably more than worth it to him.`
`Until today, I never believed in the occult or magic or anything.`
`Somewhere in my heart, `
`...I even made fun of Grandfather's research, thinking of it as nothing more than a pastime.`
`However, `
`...I won't make fun of it anymore.`
`...No, to the contrary, I'll believe strongly that it's real.`
`...If the power of belief can create miracles, `
`I'll probably throw away all of my studies up until today, `
`spending the rest of my life from today onwards studying magic.`
`......Give me the power of magic.`
`...And give me a miracle that'll let me see Shannon again...`
`"............`
`...Haha, ...ha.`
` ...Sorry, you two.`
` What am I talking about?`
` ...If you could revive the dead with magic, `
`...people would probably be researching it everywhere around the world.`
` ...But things like that don't exist in reality.`
` No one researches it.`
` ......That's because...they know the dead can't be revived with magic.`
` ......Sorry for saying something so weird.`
` It's my fault that the atmosphere here has gotten so strange.`
` ...Sorry for making you tiptoe around me, even though this is tough for us all."`
`...Even if I did it to divert myself from my sadness, maybe I did say something strange.`
`If I keep talking about stuff that's so weird, I'm sure it won't do anything good for their sadness...`
`But...that doesn't mean I can bear this silence.`
`"...I'll go downstairs and get another cup of coffee.`
` ...Mom's very particular about how she likes hers.`
` Does anyone else want a refill?"`
`Battler-kun and Jessica-chan lightly shook their heads.`
`Without pressing them any further, I took my mug and left the room.`
`The shutters were all closed in the hallway, so the corridor was very dim.`
`I tried visiting Doctor Nanjo's room and asking if he wanted more coffee,`
` but he said he didn't need any either.`
`...It seems my mother's orthodox method of making coffee isn't universally appreciated.`
`One time, I made some for Shannon, `
`...but she told me that while it was delicious, it was a little strong...`
`......Shannon......`
`That's no good...`
` ...Even though I left the room to change my mood, `
`...that image of Shannon's face filling my head hasn't faded in the slightest...`
`I keep seeing those fun days with her, more and more vividly, `
`......and it's saddening that I never even got a chance to see her dead face.`
`According to our parents, she was apparently killed with something like a gun or a spear.`
`...I'm sure they were just trying to console me, ...but they had said her dead face had been very beautiful and peaceful.`
`I wonder if she had the engagement ring I gave her last night...on her finger.`
`...If she accepted my engagement, she should have had it on the ring finger of her left hand...`
`Last night, we were both on the edge of losing it and not calm at all.`
`Shannon accepted my engagement pretty courageously, `
`but she might have regretted that as a rash action once she cooled her head.`
` She might have taken the ring off.`
`...I wonder if she has the ring on now.`
`...I want to be sure of at least that much.`
`I want to know how she felt...at the very end...`
`But...even if I do confirm that, ...it doesn't mean she'll come back.`
`......I wonder what will happen to her body.`
`After the autopsy, ...it will probably be immediately cremated.`
`Then, I'll never be able to see her face, ...even her dead face, for all eternity...`
`"......`
`...Haha, ...has the shock of losing Shannon...`
`made me go a little crazy...?"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`I don't want...her body to be burned.`
`If she's burned and turned to ash, ...never again ~ib~will it be possible for her to revive~ib~.`
`They say cremation is frowned upon in Western tradition.`
`...Because on the day of resurrection, there would be no body to revive.`
`Because of that, it seems that great criminals in Western history were often cremated after execution as a punishment,`
` and their ashes were sometimes scattered in rivers and such...`
`In other words, to Western people, death is nothing more than a sleep until the resurrection.`
`It is essential that the corpse is left after death.`
`'!s1`
`that's because...`
`...Western people...`
`......knew of a miracle that can revive the dead.`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, geo_3e140:`
`Now I understand.`
` ...I understand why Grandfather idolized the Western occult.`
`That was his only reason from the very beginning.`
`...Just to revive the person dear to him, ...Grandfather spent the rest of his remaining life researching the Western occult.`
`......The situation surrounding us now is abnormal.`
`Grandfather did revive his beloved Beatrice.`
`...And, that Beatrice has carried out a terrible serial murder, `
`with linked closed rooms that force us to conclude that magic was used.`
`...The Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
`The incarnation of the miracle of the Western occult.`
`......And also, the culprit who killed Shannon...`
`She's an entity I should hate, ......and yet, for some reason, I want to cling to her.`
`I wonder...if Shannon could be revived with the magic of miracles, which Grandfather bet his life on...`
`According to the legend of the Ushiromiya family, Grandfather met with her long ago and was given a vast quantity of gold.`
`...Then, if I also met with her, `
`...instead of gold, would she give me Shannon's life?`
`As collateral, I don't care what sort of devil's contract she imposed.`
`I wouldn't mind sacrificing all of my remaining life...`
`George probably couldn't believe or realize that his voiceless wish...`
`was heard by the witch herself, who stood right behind him.`
`Beatrice had been listening to that entire discussion between the children just now in the cousins' room.`
`...Battler had told her that she didn't know the value of a human's life,`
` ...and wanting to understand that in her own way, she had stealthily visited, listening in on their discussion.`
`".........`
`...That is your wish, you say...?`
` If I could grant that, would I be accepted as a witch...?"`
`Beato looked at the palms of both of her hands.`
`...She had handed over most of her once-surging magical power when the new witch succeeded the name of the Endless Witch.`
`Of course, her current power still made her worthy of being called a witch, `
`...but it could not begin to compare to her previous strength.`
`"...Hmm.`
` Even without the Endless Magic, I am a Great Witch whose name has been thundered for a thousand years.`
` Reviving the dead will be no trouble at all."`
`Inside her head, she thought about several magical steps she could take to revive the dead.`
`...Even magic that should have been easy in the past would be difficult with her current power.`
`She thought of something, then clicked her tongue, then did so again, over and over.`
`In the end, ...she finally thought of a single spell.`
`But that was a spell that she couldn't use by herself.`
`It was a spell that witches with weak power used, one that relied on the aid of others.`
`...In the past, Beato had looked down upon that type of magic.`
`Therefore, she frantically tried to search for any conceivable alternative, `
`......but in the end, she couldn't think of one and slumped over in self-derision.`
`Then, ...careful not to surprise him, she softly called out.`
` Softly, to George's heart...`
`"......Ushiromiya George,`
` ...can you hear my voice...?"`
`"...I can hear you.`
` ...Who are you...?`
` Are you really the witch, Beatrice...?`
` ...Or are you an illusion created by my sorrow...?"`
`"......If it's the former, please hear my wish.`
` ...And if it's the latter, just leave me alone..."`
`Their conversation in a mental world was a lot like having one in a dream.`
`When you dream, haven't you ever had the experience...`
`of casually accepting something that would've been absurd in the real world?`
`...The conversation in this world was like that.`
`So even though a witch appeared and started talking to George, he was not surprised...`
`"Indeed.`
` ...I am...the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
` ......Normally, you and I would not be able to talk together in this manner.`
` ...However, you are strongly conscious of me and wish to have a discussion, `
`...so both of our channels are able to match like this."`
`"......I don't care if the person who killed Shannon was you...`
`or someone else using your name.`
` ...As long as you exist as a real witch..."`
`"......I'll pay whatever cost you ask for.`
` If you desire my life, take it right now.`
` ...Please, I want you to bring Shannon back to life...`
` ......If that's impossible, I'd be satisfied if you'd just let me talk to her for a short while...`
` ...Please......"`
`"......I ask for nothing in return.`
` I shall grant that wish."`
`"...Really...?`
` Really, you'll revive Shannon......?"`
`"Indeed.`
` ...However, my current magical power is not sufficient to use the magic of resurrection.`
` ...Therefore, I must rely on your help."`
`"......If there's anything I can do, I'll do it.`
` ...Even if that means taking my heart out right here and now, I will not hesitate..."`
`"...I told you, I don't need anything like that.`
` ......I will chant the magic.`
` Then, a gap will open in the door to the Land of the Dead."`
`"...But as I am now, I do not have the power to bring Shannon's soul up through that gap.`
` ......However, you have strong feelings for Shannon, `
`and those feelings will surely become magic that can bring her soul out without fail."`
`"...What do you say?`
` Will you help me...?"`
`"...I will.`
` ......If Shannon's life will be restored, `
`...there's nothing I'm afraid to lose...!"`
`George's fists shook in silence.`
`...Then, he slowly came to his senses.`
`He had been absent-mindedly standing near the window in the hall that whole time, his mug still in his hand...`
`And...`
`......the witch from his dream...was still there.`
`"Wh...What the... ......I-It isn't...a dream......"`
`"...Be quiet.`
` I am very fragile now.`
` If any more Humans appear, I will not be able to preserve this form.`
` ...I shall grant your wish, so stay silent for now.`
` ...Understand?"`
`George covered his mouth with both hands, nodding enthusiastically several times.`
`In that instant, he almost dropped the mug he was holding.`
`George frantically juggled it around and caught it.`
`...He was afraid that if it fell to the floor and made a loud sound,`
` the witch's form might disappear like a bubble popping.`
`He softly set the mug on the floor...and stared at the witch in front of him again.`
`......Her form didn't disappear.`
` It wasn't a dream...`
`"Come, let us go to the parlor where Shannon sleeps.`
` With the power of your feelings, we will bring back her soul."`
`"Y-You say go, but how...?`
` My mother and the rest are downstairs.`
` There's no way they'd let us go outside.`
` ...And...didn't you just say that you wouldn't be able to preserve your form if another Human appeared?"`
`"...Come to think of it, that is true.`
` So, Krauss and the rest are downstairs.`
` ...In that case, we definitely cannot go down.`
` ...Well then, we just need to go to the mansion without going down to the first floor, right?`
` It's simple."`
`Beato laughed, as though she had thought of a pleasant prank.`
`...And with her golden pipe, she lightly tapped a window with its shutter closed.`
`When she did, three gold butterflies appeared from the pipe and opened the lock on the window as though melting it.`
`Then, the window opened without a sound.`
`The shutter beyond it was exactly the same.`
`The clasp unset itself, also without making a sound, and it quietly opened.`
`The window opened, exposing the wind and rain outside the mansion.`
`...Perhaps because of the direction or something related to the construction of the building, the wind did not blow inside.`
`Because of that, for a while, `
`George felt as though this entrance that opened to the outside was a dream or an illusion, and he couldn't accept it as real.`
`"Come, let us go.`
` Come with me."`
`Beato gently floated upwards.`
`It was a natural action, like that of a diver enjoying an underwater stroll.`
`...It made it easy to believe that if you acted like she did, `
`you too might be able to float in the sky just as though you were swimming through the water.`
`...No, George did believe that.`
`...So without thinking, just as she had done, he also...`
`...gently, `
`...as though swimming in the water, lifted his feet...`
`"...Ah, ......aaaaaaahh......"`
`"Hoh.`
` ...Not bad.`
` So, you learned how to dance in the sky faster than I could explain it."`
`George was shocked to find himself floating in midair like he was swimming.`
`...Of course, Beato was also shocked that George, who shouldn't have been able to use magic, had figured out how to do that just by instinct.`
`"......To be able to...`
`...fly in the air, `
`...to swim in the air..."`
`"...You mustn't be bound by reason.`
` Accept it as a natural thing.`
` ...You mustn't fall back to your Human doctrines, such as those of Newton and Einstein."`
`"Especially when flying high in the sky.`
` ...Inexperienced witches sometimes plummet to the earth."`
`"...I-I accept things for what they appear to be...`
` I-I accept things for what they appear to be..."`
`George repeated those words over and over.`
`...He must not deny magic, no matter what.`
`Denying that would be like throwing away what might be his first and last chance to revive Shannon.`
`However, compared to Beato, who was elegantly drifting like smoke, George's movements clearly resembled someone underwater.`
`...Therefore, if he didn't act like he was kicking his feet in water every once in a while, he'd be caught by the force of gravity bit by bit.`
`"I must say you're doing better than when I first danced through the sky.`
` ...Here we go.`
` Come with me."`
`When Beato beckoned to George, she gently flew into the stormy sky.`
`...It was just like a scene from a fairy tale.`
`The scene unfolding before George's eyes felt entirely like an extension of his dream.`
`"...Being able to fly is...incredible, ...but so is the wind and the rain..."`
`"What's this? Are the wind and rain tormenting you...?`
` ...I could teach you magic to block against that, `
`but it may be too early for you, and it may be a misuse of time right now."`
`".........Yes.`
` ...The magic I need...isn't that."`
`George wore a strong-willed gaze, refusing to let the wind and rain get to him.`
`"The mansion is coming into sight.`
` ...Hold out just a little longer.`
` If you fall now, you'll hit the bushes in the rose garden."`
`The undulating rose garden was spread beneath the witch and George's gazes.`
`This illusion-like scene no longer surprised George.`
`Only the gradually approaching mansion was reflected in his eyes.`
`"Shannon, ......wait for me...`
` ...I will definitely...revive you...!"`
`At that time,`
` ...the cruel new witch could be seen staring at the guesthouse from a different location.`
`"......Now, all that's left is the seventh and eighth twilights.`
` Just two more, and my obligation to that old hag Predecessor is finished.`
` ......I'll kill Krauss and Natsuhi.`
` Let them die together like the good couple they are."`
`"Nihi.`
` Where's the target nyeh?"`
`"...In the lobby on the first floor of the guesthouse, two targets and Ushiromiya Eva identified.`
` Measuring Anti-Magic Power Levels.`
` Data Link to 410."`
`"410, Data Received.`
` Anti-magic power levels are extremely low.`
` If Eva just goes outside, they're tuna and abalone on a chopping board.`
` Nihihihihi...!"`
`"What do you think, Great Lady Beatrice?`
` When you give the order, we shall snipe right away...!`
` Please, your orders...!"`
`"...You guys reeeally are convenient furniture.`
` Not at all like that old, second-hand furniture that's only useful for gouging corpses.`
` Right?"`
`"............Nn..."`
`"Chiester Sisters, please show me your skill once more.`
` ...Prepare to fire!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!`
` And carry out the corpses again, got it?`
` 'Cause I'll play with them a lot.`
` No complaints from you, right, Ronove?"`
`"...Correct.`
` As you command."`
`"Nn..."`
`At that moment, the witch noticed something.`
`...It was as though some presence had disappeared...`
` ...Was it her imagination...?`
`"......Was that someone's presence just now?`
` Did anyone feel it?"`
`"M-My apologies, I haven't noticed anything, ...so please forgive me...!!"`
`"We were in the middle of observing the guesthouse, so our peripheral surveillance was set to off. Nihi.`
` ...What about you, Lucifer-chaaan?`
` Did you feel any presence?"`
`"......Nn-"`
`For just an instant, Lucifer glanced at Ronove, asking whether she should answer honestly or not.`
`Ronove gave a small nod in response.`
`"No.`
` ...My apologies, Beatrice-sama.`
` We noticed nothing.`
` ......Forgive us the stupidity of us second-hand furniture."`
`"............"`
`"............"`
`"............`
`...I see.`
` If a great demon like you says that, then it must've been my imagination."`
`The witch persistently stared in the direction the presence had disappeared to.`
`...That was where the rose garden lay.`
`And beyond that, she could see the mansion's dark silhouette creating by lightning.`
`...It took quite some time before she pushed her unsatisfied feelings aside...`
`and once again faced the guesthouse.`
`The guesthouse lobby was wrapped in silence.`
`The strings of tension binding Krauss, Natsuhi, and Eva had already loosened, and they were completely worn out, with their minds beginning to waver.`
`Every once in a while, they would stand up and walk around pointlessly, as though fighting their drowsiness.`
`"......Are you okay, Eva-san?`
` ...Please, do take it easy and rest."`
`"I told you, I'm fine...`
` ...The three of us are now the only adults...`
` There's no time to rest...`
` No matter what the cost, we must guard this place until the end...`
` ...Haah, ...haah..."`
`She spoke bravely, but she couldn't hide her rough breathing.`
`...It seemed that the fever, which had been calmed with medicine for a short time, had returned.`
`It was very obvious that Eva's health was not good.`
`"Take it easy.`
` At least close your eyes.`
` If something happens that you need to be awake for, we will definitiely wake you."`
`"I'm telling you I'm fine...!`
` Leave me alone...!!"`
`"............"`
`It seemed she was already unwilling to budge.`
`...Krauss and Natsuhi realized that even if they talked to her any more when she was like this, it wouldn't reach her ears.`
`So without saying anything more, they decided to let her be.`
`To Eva right now, even having an argument like that would be burdensome.`
`It would probably be better for her body if she just sat there with her mouth closed.`
`In truth, Eva was just a step away from being beaten down by drowsiness.`
`...Perhaps she shot back at them with a temper because she was trying to rouse herself and throw off her sleepiness.`
`The clock would be pointing to 6:00 in the afternoon very soon.`
`She'd had several snacks to distract herself from her drowsiness, so she didn't feel hungry, `
`but now her lack of sleep made it feel like it was 6:00 in the morning, not the afternoon.`
`...Even supposing that the boat came at precisely 9:00 in the morning tomorrow, `
`...they still had more than 12 full hours to go.`
`...It was an overwhelmingly long stretch of time.`
`......Long.`
`......Painful...`
`...Hot...`
`Even the sound of the clock torments my body now.`
`In times like this, ...when that person puts his hand on my forehead, the fever fades at once.`
`...But that person no longer exists......`
`As Eva's mind grew foggy, she was once again gripped by a deep sadness...`
`She had already cried herself dry.`
`Even so, the sadness of losing her beloved husband had not been exhausted...`
`"......I...`
`...was wrong..."`
`"...What do you mean?"`
`The new witch and Eva were fundamentally the same being.`
`...If Eva talked to her, she would always respond...`
`"...I thought that if I could gain the position of the Ushiromiya Family Head, ...that alone would be enough.`
` ...But then, as soon as I saw that mountain of gold, my greed grew.`
` ......I was struck by a desire to have that mountain all to myself..."`
`"That's nothing to be ashamed of.`
` After all, it's your natural right as the Ushiromiya Family Head.`
` How could you give up even a bit of it to anyone else?"`
`"......I was gripped by that temptation, ...which is why you were born.`
` ...While you are a young girl version of me, `
`...at the same time, you are also my self-centered evil heart.`
` ...Because of my foolish greed sprouted by that mountain of gold, `
` ...the shell of the egg that is my heart cracked, ...and you were born into this world...`
` ......I am responsible for your birth...!"`
`"In that case, when I killed Rosa and Maria, `
`and then Rudolf, Kyrie and Hideyoshi, you were responsible for that too."`
`"Why did you kill my husband too...?!`
` Why...?!!`
` Aaaaaaaagggghhhhh!!"`
`"...I didn't want to kill Hideyoshi.`
` He was just so annoying and persistent.`
` ...And that's our...no, your fault.`
` It's your fault for choosing a husband like that."`
`"A child like you cannot understand what made that man so wonderful!!`
` Oooooooooooooooohhhh, ...dear, ...aaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!"`
`"......What the heck?`
` Our dreams were made real with magic, right?`
` We solved the riddle of the epitaph.`
` Then we found the gold and got the Head's Ring.`
` All of our dreams came fully true, right?`
` What more could you want...?"`
`"Those weren't all of my dreams...!!`
` What about living a wonderful life with that person and giving George an excellent life...?!`
` I still have many dreams that haven't come true...as a wife, as a mother...!!`
` And yet, ...and yet...!"`
`"...Those are just extra dreams you added after becoming an adult.`
` They aren't my dreams."`
`"That's because you're a child...!!`
` Do you only care about what's best for yourself?!`
` ...That's right, everything is my fault...!!`
` Back then, why did I resist doing what Rosa told me to?`
` Why couldn't I announce to all of the siblings that I'd found the gold...?`
` ...It's all because I'm so hideous!!`
` My evil heart, which sprouted from my desire to have all that gold for myself, ...caused you to hatch!!"`
`"......Looks like you really hate me.`
` Even though we're both Ushiromiya Eva."`
`"No, that isn't true anymore.`
` And it was you who said it.`
` I am Ushiromiya Eva.`
` And you are the Golden Witch, Beatrice...!!`
` So just disappear!`
` Witches are imaginary, illusions that only exist in fairy tales...!!`
` Things like you should just disappear!`
` Never appear in front of me again!!"`
`"...Yeah, ...you're right.`
` ...I understand.`
` I'll disappear from in front of you.`
` ...And I am no longer Ushiromiya Eva.`
` From now on, I'm the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
` ...So now I can play however I want."`
`"I don't even care about you.`
` If only you'd just give up and die!"`
`After having a very childlike tantrum, the witch who had once been another Eva vanished.`
`...Only Eva was left behind in the darkness.`
`And she questioned herself...`
`"Me...?`
` I...killed them...?`
` Did I kill...that person...?`
` ...Did I...kill...him......?"`
`She could no longer answer that question herself...`
`'!s0`
` *cough*cough*cough*!!"`
`It seemed that, half-asleep, she had gotten some saliva caught in her windpipe just as she was dozing off.`
`...Eva suddenly started coughing.`
`"Are you okay, Eva?`
` ...Please Natsuhi, some water."`
`"Y-Yes..."`
`"I-I'm fine, okay...?`
` *cough*cough*cough*!`
` *co-ugh*cough*!!`
` I just...choked a bit...!`
` *cough*cough*cough*!"`
`Eva pushed away Natsuhi's hand as she tried to rub her back...and unsteadily rose to her feet.`
`"......I'm going to go wash my face.`
` ...Sorry, I fell asleep.`
` ...When I get back, I'll make some more coffee.`
` ......Extra strong, so that I won't get drowsy until tomorrow morning."`
`"Yes, please do.`
` ...Your coffee's more to my tastes than what Gohda makes."`
`"I'm glad to hear it, even if it's flattery...`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, eva_3e883:`
`Eva exited the lobby, heading for the bathroom.`
`Krauss and Natsuhi watched over her frail back...`
`"...So, you sometimes do show concern for Eva-san, even though you've always been so much at odds with her."`
`".........`
`...Isn't this how an older brother is supposed to be...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` I believe you're right."`
`"It isn't just Eva.`
` ...There's Rudolf and Rosa too.`
` ...Instead of acting like an older brother to them, all I ever did was speak arrogantly and bully them."`
`"......In my own way, I was frantic in my desire to be like Father.`
` ...But I could never match up, and I always vented my feelings on them...`
` But that is no excuse.`
` ...I probably gave Eva scars so deep that they still have not healed.`
` ...I regret it, but even if I apologized after all this time, it would do nothing to heal those wounds..."`
`"......If you can hold onto that feeling, instead of only letting it last for this moment,`
` ...I'm sure your siblings will come to see it sooner or later."`
`"...Though, by now, Eva is the only sibling I have left."`
`"......If only...you and your siblings hadn't been born into the Ushiromiya family, `
`...you might have had a more normal, a more fun sibling relationship..."`
`"...You mustn't say that...`
` ......Eva will probably continue to hate me for her whole life.`
` And she has a right to.`
` ...I...intend to resign myself to that fact and accept it."`
`".........Dear..."`
`"...Eva, `
`......I'm sorry.`
` ...Of course, you don't have to forgive me..."`
`Of course I won't forgive you. What are you talking about, after all this time?`
`"Oh, so now you're feeling guilty? If only you'd just give up and die right now!`
` Do it, Chiester Sisters!!"`
`"45, Firing Permission Received.`

` Data Link to 410."`
`"410, Data Received, Firing Permission Confirmed.`
` Nihihihihi, Firing!"`
`Together, the sisters released the magical bowstring they had readied.`
`A beautiful tail trailed behind the gold arrow, and it drew a lovely curve as it flew.`
`It was just like a gold snake.`
`It skillfully avoided a grove of trees and flew towards the front door of the guesthouse.`
`Then it flew into the keyhole of the door and snuck into the guesthouse without any problem at all.`
`The gold snake raced down the hall smoothly, yet as fast as an arrow.`
`Right before it was the door to the lobby.`
`When it flew into the key hole, Krauss and Natsuhi were already...`
`For an instant, Krauss thought he saw a gold-colored sparkle in the keyhole on the door.`
`However, at the same time as he strained his eyes to see what it was, that sparkle bent like a whip and attacked, `
`wrapping itself around Krauss's neck.`
`"......Ack, ......ah, nn-"`
`Just looking at it, the gold snake seemed very supple.`
`However, it was as though a wire had tightened around Krauss's neck.`
`And while that snake choked Krauss, it extended even more, and also tightened around Natsuhi's neck.`
`Without even a chance to scream, their eyes bulged as they went into convulsions and then collapsed.`
`"45, Hit and Kill Confirmed.`

` Data Link to 410."`
`"410, Data Received.`
` Initiating Corpse Towing.`
` We got both of 'em nyeh, nihi!"`
`The gold snake began to drag Krauss and Natsuhi's bodies back.`
`...They slipped through the door to the corridor, dragging the bodies, gradually increasing in speed, `
`and rapidly pulled them outside the guesthouse.`
`So, the lobby was silent, as though nothing had happened.`
`...As though Krauss and Natsuhi had not been there since the beginning.`
`Only the sound of the wind and the rain remained, as if they were playing dumb and pretending to be the only ones there...`
`"...Sorry, I'm fine now.`
` ...I'll go make some coffee."`
`Eva returned from the bathroom.`
`But no one was in the lobby.`
`Even though they had supposedly been in that sofa until the moment she had choked and gone to the bathroom, `
`they were gone, as if they'd been an illusion from the very beginning.`
`"...How careless of them...`
` ...Where did those two go off to together?"`
`Eva put her hand on the sofa as though acting out a scene from a detective novel.`
`...She felt a warmth that meant that they'd been sitting there until a short while ago.`
`Maybe they went to do the rounds or something.`
`For the time being, Eva sat down and waited for their return...`
`Beato and George could be seen in the parlor of the mansion.`
`George was kneeling near Shannon's body as though praying...`
`His face was serious, and there was even sweat on his forehead.`
`However, Beato was the same.`
`Now that she had handed her name over, most of her previous power had been lost.`
`...Of course, she still had more than enough power to be called a witch, but compared to the past, it was a very faint thing.`
`"...Good.`
` Don't talk to her, don't touch her with your hand.`
` ...Call to her with the voice of your heart, and seek her with the hand of your heart.`
` ...Only your strong feelings can make my magic reach Shannon's lost soul."`
`"............!"`
`George kept praying earnestly and silently.`
`He kept frantically yelling inside his heart, trying to call back the soul of the person he loved.`
`...He strongly envisioned his soul leaving his body...and searching for her as she wandered through the Land of the Dead.`
`...Beato turned that strong force into magical power that supplemented her own magic.`
`This was magic that, in the past, she could have performed easily, without anyone's help.`
`...But now, if she didn't rely on someone's assistance, she wouldn't be able to finish the chant, much less succeed.`
`"......I'd forgotten for several centuries...`
` ......Was magic...`
`was resurrection...`
`always this difficult...?"`
`Beato was wearing an even more strained expression than George.`
`...It had slipped her mind, but originally, the magic to revive a life was the ultimate hidden art.`
`The abnormal thing was her previous magical power, which could be used over and over with a snap of her fingers.`
`So, the heavy burden on her body and mind was, fundamentally speaking, extremely natural...`
`"...However, ......this man's power...`
` ...Even though he doesn't know magic, it's nothing to be laughed at.`
` ...I see, so he truly is Kinzo's grandchild..."`
`The strong energy pouring from George was large enough to act as magical power.`
`...At first, Beato thought it must be the blood of Kinzo, the sorceror.`
`...However, that probably wasn't it.`
`...She had a feeling that Battler had already told her what it was.`
`It had been born from the power of George's sadness at the death of the person he loved, ...and from the way he had tried his hardest throughout his life, `
`from the warm time spent together with Shannon, to the size of the dream they swore to protect in the future.`
`Is it really possible for humans to take life so seriously, even though they only have a single one?`
`...It was only natural.`
`To her, a life didn't mean anything more than the difference between the top and bottom of an Othello piece.`
`If the black represented death, then she thought all you had to do was flip it over again and make it white.`
`However, it was just like that broken vase.`
`...To humans in a world without magic, where they cannot return things to their original form,`
` ...it is very, very natural for them to bet their life and soul.`
`"......So, is an Endless Witch, who can do as she pleases even with life and death...`
`inferior to a limited Human who can't even surpass the mountain of death...?"`
`This time, the witch acknowledged it.`
`He was able to hold a magical power that could never reside in witches who didn't understand the value of a life.`
`...Why does this thing called the Endless Magic exist?`
`...Even though I called myself the Endless Witch,`
` did I forget what the Endless Magic means for a thousand years......?`
`She looked at George's expression again.`
`......His surging earnestness was like a lightning bolt.`
`...Right now, even if George's body had been burned or smashed by a waterfall, `
`he would probably continue to pray for his beloved without minding it, without noticing it.`
`For the first time, ...she showed respect for that power.`
`So in that instant, all magical resistance was lost, and the enormous power of George's feelings turned into magical energy in its complete form...`
`The vase was very beautiful, rich with history and value.`
`Even as young as I was, it still forced me to take a deep breath when I witnessed its beauty.`
`...But that just made me want to touch it.`
`But the vase easily fell and smashed into pieces.`
`...Like a bubble that had popped,`
` it felt as though the time it possessed a form had been just an illusion.`
`Lives are just that fragile, just that easily...lost.`
`I realized that my foolish curiosity had led to something that couldn't be undone.`
`No matter how much I regretted it, no matter how much I apologized.`
`The smashed vase wouldn't return back to its original form...`
`A lost life will not return to normal no matter what happens.`
`I was frightened that, even though my actions had been thoughtless and careless, `
`...they had stolen away a life that could never be revived again.`
`Then, I pitied that lost life and cried.`
`I was frightened of myself, the one responsible for its loss, and cried even more.`
`I'm sure Grandfather will also cry at the loss of his precious vase.`
`I'm sure that all the people who love Grandfather and see him like that will cry.`
`With the loss of a single life, the whole world can be filled with so much sadness.`
`...I cried even more at how terrible that was.`
`Beatrice appeared...and spoke.`
`"Then, Milady,`
` let us revive that vase with magic.`
` If that will make everyone happy, the vase and the magic and the spirits...`
`will happily lend you their power and return it to its original form.`
` Come, Milady.`
` Close your eyes and chant with me..."`
`"Come, try closing your eyes.`
` And try to remember.`
` What form did you have?`
` It was surely a very, very beautiful form.`
` Please, show me that form one more time..."`
`Those words of power knocked forcefully on the door to the Land of the Dead.`
`The magic of her old self had performed that same forceful knock.`
`...However, doing it that way was horribly violent...and earned the displeasure of the peacefully sleeping dead...`
`But this time was different.`
`...It was very forceful...and yet gentle and loving.`
`The dead near the door opened their eyes...`
`and called out to the others that there was a voice calling for someone to come back.`
`...The sadness of that voice calling from the outside touched the hearts of the dead, `
`and, trying to respond as quickly as possible, they searched for Shannon's lost soul...`
`And then, `
`......they found it.`
`They found the casket in which Shannon was peacefully sleeping.`
`It truly was Shannon's soul, sleeping in the land of the dead.`
`...Inside the casket that was covered with rose flowers frozen with frost, she was sleeping in peace...`
`The dead silently lifted that casket up.`
`...While at a glance, it looked like a funeral march, it had the complete opposite meaning.`
`It was solemn, but filled with joy.`
`...The long-forgotten dead were made to remember that they were loved after their deaths,`
` ...and they were all given a warm sense of peace...`
`Then, ...as though guided by a warm light from the heavens, ...Shannon's body floated up out of the casket...`
`The dead watched her go.`
`...They squinted at that warm light, `
`offering their respect to this unknown member of the living...who had not lost his love for a person even after their death...`
`Shannon's body was enveloped in the light from the heavens and began to disappear...`
`In the jet-black darkness of the land of the dead, the faint flickering of gold butterflies could be seen.`
`...It reminded them of the gentle stars in the night sky, which they had long forgotten...`
`"............!"`
`George remembered being told that he must not say anything, and he hurriedly covered his mouth.`
`However, it felt like his heart was trying to jump into his throat.`
`...Because he had seen Shannon's eyelids shake slightly.`
`Then, ...those eyelids slowly opened.`
`Shannon's eyes were there, but they were still wrapped in the fog of the land of the dead.`
`However, ...the human world's warmth...`
`...No, her lover's warmth, which had called back her soul, slowly dissolved that fog,`
` ......and her eyes gradually regained their sparkle.`
`Then, ......her eyes moved...and recognized George.`
`"...George...san......"`
`As her lips shook weakly, `
`...Shannon definitely said that.`
`The words were very faint.`
`So much so that they normally wouldn't have reached his ears.`
`...However, George clearly heard them.`
`......He heard the person he cared for, his fiancée, the one he loved most and who should have been dead,`
` call his name once again...`
`'!s1`
`......Shannon, `
`...do you...`
`...know who I am......?"`
`"...George-sa...n, `
`......is this...a dream......?"`
`"No.`
` This isn't a dream.`
` ...C'mon, see here... ...Even if I pinch you, you won't wake up."`
`As George said that, he softly pinched Shannon's cheek.`
`...It was how George had always responded in the past, when Shannon had been surprised by something and had asked if she was dreaming.`
`When Shannon felt the warm touch of George's finger on her cheek...`
`...And when George realized that the warmth of the living had already returned to his beloved person's cheek...`
`...They both cried.`
`...What words should a pair of lovers separated by death celebrate with when they are reunited?`
`...The words of the human world are not enough.`
`In short, they had no need of the words of this world...`
`George simply hugged Shannon, who was sitting up, without talking.`
`Shannon's strength was still feeble...and putting her arms around George's back took all she had, `
`...so George hugged her tightly to make up for that.`
`To stop each other from going once more to a place the other's hand couldn't reach,`
` they hugged each other so tightly, and yet so gently...`
`As Shannon's fingers curled around George's back,`
` ...on her ring finger, the engagement ring George had given her definitely shone.`
`That strong glint certainly wasn't just the sparkle of diamond.`
`...There definitely was a magical power that only the two lovers could possibly feel.`
`It was because that strong light existed...that they had been able to find her casket in the land of the dead.`
`Beato understood.`
`...That ring, ...no.`
`......The feelings of the pair, embodied in that ring, were a miracle made real.`
`In that moment, George definitely used magic.`
`Beato had done nothing more than help him along.`
`That magic had a power that could only reside in those who knew of the importance of life, who knew what it meant to try with all one's might.`
`It was the power of a miracle, one that the Endless Witch couldn't possibly know of...`
` A miracle that only the power of the finite could give rise to.`
`By now, she had no choice but to accept it.`
`...She had to accept that true magic, true magical power...`
`...Exists in the place furthest away from she who called herself a Great Witch.`
`"......Beatrice...sama..."`
`"...She brought you back to life...`
` Thank you, Beatrice...!"`
`"No.`
` I did nothing.`
` ...What revived Shannon...was your magical power.`
` It was your magic.`
` ......The Ushiromiya blood, which makes miracles come true, ...surely saw you through."`
`"......George-san...revived me...?"`
`"...Indeed.`
` ......It was an incredible display of magical power, one that I could not hope to compete with.`
` ...So, I am still nothing more than an apprentice.`
` ...Now I finally know my place."`
`Beato staggered backwards.`
`...Her physical strength was clearly exhausted.`
`She had humbly said that George's power alone had revived Shannon, but Beato had also used all of her magical and physical strength.`
`...And she reflected upon how difficult it was to revive a single life, something she'd been able to play around with however she wanted to in the past.`
`The couple kept on embracing each other tightly.`
`...By doing that, those feelings that couldn't be communicated with a billion words...were shared...`
`"Thank you, Beatrice.`
` ...We're in your debt..."`
`"...Thank you very much, Beatrice-sama.`
` ...I'll never forget the debt I owe you for bringing me to George again."`
`"...Stop that, stop that.`
` Being thanked by a pair of lovers is far too embarrassing for one who has been feared as a monster of a person.`
` ...Don't worry...about me.`
` ...Celebrate your reunion together......to the fullest......"`
`Beato, who was leaning with her back against the wall, slid down the wall and sat.`
`How many centuries had it been since she last grew this tired from using magic?`
`...I probably haven't been this tired since the time I first succeeded in magic.`
`......Didn't Teacher praise me that time?`
`Oh, but didn't I kill that same Teacher who praised me?`
`...Don't be so naive, Beatrice.`
`...Isn't that what killing means...?`
`"...Finally.`
` ...It seems you've finally remembered how to use magic."`
`"......My head...feels parched and suffocated, ...and I can't even remember...`
` ...More importantly, ...didn't I kill you?`
` You shouldn't be appearing..."`
`"You are still allowing me to live even now.`
` That is why I can appear like this.`
` ...However, I did not come just to pat your head."`
`"...Did you come to sneer at how pathetic I am?`
` ...Anyway, ...if I have my head patted by a retired witch after all that's happened, the other witches will laugh at me..."`
`"That's right.`
` ...According to your bragging, you were not only a full adult, but a retired one,`
` and yet only now have you learned how to use magic. That certainly does sound too embarrassing to tell anyone."`
`"......Yeah, tell me about it.`
` ...Keep it a secret, okay, Teacheer...?"`
`Beato gazed at the couple hugging each other with a sense of pleasant despondency.`
`"Love, is it?`
` ......I'm no match..."`
`"45, Data Received.`
` Firing Preparations Concluded.`
` Ammo Type Selected and Loaded."`
`"410, Firing.`
` Nihi!"`
`The gold snake arrow fired by the Chiesters...`
`'!s0`
`weaved its way through the hedges, `
`and climbed the stone steps towards the mansion's entrance, `
`aiming for the keyhole.`
`It weaved through the corridors...`
`and flew into the keyhole on the door to the parlor...!`
`"...Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh?!?!"`
`It happened in an instant.`
`...One could hardly blame Beato, who was completely worn out, for not noticing it beforehand.`
`Right before Beato's eyes, the gold snake flew in through the keyhole,`
` ...surrounded the two lovers, `
`and pierced the two hearts in a blink of an eye.`
`...Furthermore, the gold snake faithfully pierced a hole through Shannon's chest once more...`
`The two hearts were pierced by that gold snake...`
`no, by that gold sewing thread of the new brutal witch's furniture,`
` ......and it had happened in an instant, mocking the amount of effort it had taken to revive Shannon...!`
`Before Beato's shocked eyes, the two fell over and landed on the floor...`
`'!s1`
`George, `
`......Shannon......"`
`'!s1`
`...Beatrice...`
` ...For letting us meet, `
`...even just for a short while, `
`...thank you......"`
`George spent his last breath thanking Beato...and died alongside the one he loved.`
`The gold snake, which still sewed the two in place, spun like a large cyclone, revolving around the inside of the parlor.`
`......It was searching for further prey in that room.`
`Then, the tip of the snake met Beato's gaze...`
`In that instant, Beato was prepared to die.`
`At that moment, Virgilia stood in front of her, the fingers of both her hands drawing a seal.`
`Instantly, gold-colored gold leaf buried the inside of the parlor.`
`It was like a blizzard of gold...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"Beato, run while you can!!`
` ~ib~No one can escape~ib~`
` from the Chiesters' golden bow!!!"`
`"410, Target Lost!!`
` Nihyah, it's magical chaff!!"`
`"45, roger that...!`
` Modifying Search Algorithm, Switching to Anti-Personnel Image-Based Tracking.`
` Target Lock Reacquired, Data Link to 410."`
`"410, Data Received.`
` Too slow, Predecessor-sama!`
` Coming, coming, coming, `
`...impact!!"`
`Prey targeted by the Chiester Sisters' golden bow did not escape.`
` It could not be blocked.`
`...No magical barrier could even dream of blocking it without being multilayered.`
`The gap opened during that instant of confusion caused by Virgilia's deception magic was Beato's only chance to escape.`
`And, it was the only chance to make the sisters confuse Virgilia for Beato.`
`As Virgilia spread her arms wide, blocking the way to her beloved disciple, the gold snake pierced straight through her heart...`
`After sneaking in through the keyhole, the snake shot through George, Shannon, and then Virgilia in an instant, `
`completely failing to notice Beato as she used that instant to escape...`
`As soon as Virgilia saw that Beato had gotten away, she died.`
`...The strength left her body, and like gold dust drifting with the wind, her form was erased...`
`Beato completely erased all traces of her magical power,`
` became gold butterflies, and passed through the wall, escaping to the wind and rain outside...`
`".........Damn it, `
`......damn it, damn it...`
` ...You bitch, `
`...you biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch...!!"`
`Beato felt regret from the bottom of her heart.`
`Why?`
`Because she had been attacked by the new witch?`
`Probably not.`
`Of course, she hated losing her teacher.`
`And even more importantly, Beato was enraged at the barbarism that had boorishly stolen away the reunion between two lovers.`
`...Beato had poured out almost all of her magical power to reunite them.`
`...Even though the result had been a miracle, `
`...the time it took to steal that away had been so ridiculously short...!`
`Beato trembled at the barbarous cruelty that had brought about such an abrupt end.`
`...Besides, ...this was the true form of the acts she herself had committed up until that point...`
`So just as strongly as Beato hated the new witch, she also looked at her previous self with disgust.`
`But now, she had to escape...`
`...If she was targeted next, she would probably lose her life.`
`To think that a chess player had descended, thinking they were like a god,`
` ...only to be attacked by the pieces.`
`"45, Impact Confirmed, Target Scattered.`
` ...W-Without a doubt, we crushed the Predecessor-sama...!"`
`"Looks like our pile of kill medals is gonna get bigger again nyeh.`
` Nihi!"`
`"What was that about loving couples?`
` You get to enjoy tearing the two apart by death, reuniting them, and then tearing them apart again, right?`
` *cackle* Hihihihihihhihi!"`
`"And along with that, I get to say goodbye to that damn fussy old hag.`
` ...Ronove, you don't have any complaints, right?"`
`"...I do not, `
`Beatrice-sama."`
`"That person interfered with the ceremony of the witch's epitaph, you see?`
` She revived a sacrifice from the first twilight without permission, obstructing my ceremony.`
` She's got no right at all to complain."`
`"Kuhhihihihhyahyahyahya...!`
` But it sucks that she didn't leave a corpse behind.`
` ...And I thought I'd be able to torture that old hag to death over and over again endlessly.`
` Kuhhihihyahyahya...!!"`
`"............"`
`"G-George did...?!`
` No, I didn't see him. When did he come down?!"`
`"...Wh-When, you say...?`
` Uh, what hour was that, again...?"`
`"I think...it was probably around 4:00 or 5:00.`
` ...At the very least, it was more than an hour ago..."`
`"We got sleepy...and probably dozed off after that...`
` But I think it's probably like Jessica says.`
` About one or two hours ago."`
`"I-I also remember something from around that time.`
` I was asked if I wanted more coffee..."`
`Something hard to believe had happened...`
`Apparently, when Aunt Eva had left for a second to wash her hands, `
`Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi had disappeared.`
`There's no way they went hiding somewhere.`
`Of course, the doors and windows had all been rigorously checked, and all were locked from the inside.`
` Not one of them was broken.`
`And that wasn't just true for the first floor. The second floor was the same.`
`Again, all the doors and windows had locks built in a way that made it impossible to lock them from the outside.`
`...In other words, there was no way that Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi had gone outside.`
`...And yet, they couldn't be found.`
`Furthermore, they weren't the only ones who had disappeared. ...So had George-aniki, of all people.`
`George-aniki had left saying he was going to get more coffee, `
`and had gone downstairs more than an hour earlier.`
`We'd assumed that he was having a conversation with Aunt Eva and the rest, `
`...but Aunt Eva, who had been in the lobby the whole time, said that no one had come down.`
`Since all the doors and windows were locked from the inside,`
` ...it was unthinkable that they had gone outside.`
`...However, three humans had evaporated from this barricaded guesthouse, which had become a perfect closed room...`
`In a situation like this, we couldn't imagine that this was because they were playing hide-and-seek and trying to scare us with a prank.`
`...It was probably reasonable to assume that they'd been caught up in this crime...`
`When Aunt Eva had learned that her only son was missing,`
` she had gone half insane, running from room to room and yelling his name.`
`...And Jessica, who had suddenly lost both of her parents, had chased after her.`
`Cries of 'George, George' and 'Mom, Dad' had continued to echo through the guesthouse for some time...`
`I think George said something about wanting to see Shannon's dead face.`
`...It would be reasonable to assume that he snuck out of the guesthouse and went to the mansion.`
`...But I didn't have a clue about Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi.`
`...Did they see him leave...and then go to the mansion to search for him...?`
`Without even telling Aunt Eva...?`
`At this rate, it's only a matter of time before we start planning to leave the guesthouse to go search for them.`
`......When that time comes, I'll agree.`
`We'd thought staying holed up in the guesthouse would be safe,`
` which was why our big, happy group of 12 people locked themselves up here this morning.`
`And yet, now there's only four of us left.`
`...That means staying here is no guarantee of safety...`
`However, ...there's one thing we can't afford to forget.`
`All the doors and windows were locked from the inside.`
`...This is a closed room.`
`How did they manage to vanish from this place?`
`We searched around thoroughly.`
`However, we couldn't find any traces of someone hiding.`
`...The three of them had almost certainly been taken outside the guesthouse.`
`"......I wonder how it was done...`
` You don't think...there might be something like a hidden door?"`
`"A hidden door...?"`
`"...The doors and the windows were built in a way that makes them impossible to lock from the outside.`
` Even using a fish line, it would probably be impossible with the way they're constructed.`
` So, it may be reasonable to assume that they left via something other than a door or a window..."`
`"......You're right.`
` That does make logical sense.`
` ...No one can be sure that no hidden doors exist."`
`"...However, before leaping to that conclusion, I suspect a much simpler possibility."`
`"And...what would that be...?"`
`For some time, Battler had been opening windows, opening shutters, and checking outside,`
` repeating this for each window.`
`"......Hmm.`
` ...This window's pretty quiet.`
` ...I see, unlike the other windows, because of how the building's shaped, the wind doesn't blow into this one."`
`"It appears that way...`
` It feels strange that no wind or rain comes in, even though there is so much of it outside."`
`"Doctor Nanjo,`
` ...when I opened the window just now, did you hear a sound?"`
`"Huh?`
` ...No, I did not notice it...`
` I believe it is well oiled."`
`"In other words, `
`it's possible to slink through a window in the hallway when no one is looking.`
` Furthermore, the wind doesn't blow in through this window, `
`so the air pressure wouldn't cause the curtains or a door to make a sound.`
` It'd be quiet."`
`Battler leaned forward and looked at the ground below.`
`...He was searching for some sign that George had jumped down.`
`...But at a glance, he didn't see any mark like that on the grass in the middle of the pouring rain.`
`"...There might also be a window like this on the first floor.`
` It'd be possible to go outside without anyone noticing."`
`"However, not only the doors, but the windows too are all locked, and the shutters are even down as well, correct...?`
` It may be possible to go out through them, but you couldn't lock them afterwards..."`
`"Sure you can lock them.`
` Just like this, *click*"`
`Battler closed the window and locked it, as though this was perfectly obvious.`
`"......B-Battler-san, you aren't saying........."`
`"If someone inside locked it afterwards, this closed room is as easy as pie."`
`"B-But that means`
`......that means, `
`...ooooooohhhh..."`
`Nanjo turned pale and shook his head several times.`
`...Because the thing Battler had said had forced him to face a fact that was frightening even to imagine...`
`"...That's only if the trick I'm thinking of actually happened, okay?`
` However, with this trick, only a very limited number of people can be suspected."`
`He didn't want to say it in front of Nanjo, ...but after eliminating Jessica, who had been with him the whole time, `
`only Nanjo...and Eva could have done it.`
`"I-I did not do anything of the sort...!`
` Y-Yes, I swear it...!!"`
`"...In this case, it becomes a battle between Aunt Eva and Doctor Nanjo for an alibi.`
` ...We just have to suspect both of you, `
`and confine the two of you separately."`
`"......To say it the other way around, the more survivors there are, the more effective this trick might be, `
`but since our numbers have shrunk so much, it isn't effective at all."`
`...No, on the contrary, there'd be a chance of having your own neck strangled by using it.`
`...It would have been more advantageous to make it look like the culprit was outside,`
` to intentionally leave a door unlocked or break a window...`
`"......If this disappearance drama had taken place midday today,`
` I'd be able to claim this theory with full confidence.`
` ...However, at this stage, I'm not confident at all.`
` ......What's going on here?`
` ...What in the world does it mean?`
` ......This 'closed room'..."`
`"...Y-You don't think, umm......"`
`"Hmm?`
` What is it, Doctor Nanjo?`
` ...Even if it's just a thought, please say it."`
`Nanjo looked like he was trying to swallow his words, even though he'd thought of something, so I urged him on.`
`After Doctor Nanjo refused several times, saying that it was just a foolish idea, he finally said it out loud.`
`"...Well, umm,`
` ......don't you think this might actually be...`
`...the work of the witch...?"`
`"R-Ridiculous.`
` There's no way witches exist."`
`"...The witch is trying to make her case to us.`
` ...Specifically because she's doing things that humans cannot do, `
`...she must be trying to make us accept her as a witch.`
` ...To me, this disappearance from the closed room of the entire guesthouse...feels like that kind of message from the witch...`
` ......It's something I must not think of.`
` Surely, it cannot mean anything.`
` ...Oooh, ...I...I am frightened..."`
`As Doctor Nanjo shook with fear, it looked like he was he was trying to erase the fearsome thoughts that he kept imagining one after the other.`
`...When we went down the stairs, Aunt Eva and Jessica were enraged, `
`and were each persistent in their desire to leave this place and search for their respective families.`
`It was a desire that naturally hits those who can no longer see their family.`
`Aunt Eva told Doctor Nanjo and me to stay here, but I shook my head and started walking.`
`"......I've been shut up inside for a long time already.`
` ...I've started wanting to breathe some outside air."`
`"Yeah, if we're going, let's go quickly...!!`
` There's no way I'm gonna keep myself shut up in a place like this any more...!!`
` Let's go and find Mom, Dad, and George nii-san right now...!!"`
`The blood had all risen to Jessica's head.`
`...I hope it doesn't set off her asthma.`
`"If anyone wants to stay, go ahead and stay.`
` We'll be searching outside...!"`
`"What about you, Doctor Nanjo...?`
` Will you watch the place by yourself...?"`
`"N-No...`
` Allow me to join you..."`
`Rather than holing up alone in a guesthouse whose security was by no means guaranteed, `
`it would be better to enter a danger zone as a group of four people.`
`Aunt Eva had a gun.`
`Moving separately from her was almost like asking to be made into the next victim.`
`In this way, the four of us decided to leave the guesthouse.`
`...Even though it should have been safe to barricade ourselves here, ...we lost eight people after doing so.`
`It was almost as though it this was a holding cell from which the sacrifices could be killed one after another.`
`We removed the chain, unlocked the front door and opened it.`
`It was already pitch black.`
`While there were some lights outside that dimly lit the pathway, `
`...they didn't have enough power to pierce the darkness that some suspicious person might be hiding in.`
`"I'm going...!`
` If you fall behind, you're on your own, okay...?!"`
`Still holding her gun, Aunt Eva dashed out without an umbrella.`
`Jessica followed after her.`
`After glancing at each other, Doctor Nanjo and I chased after them.`
`...What in the world is happening in this mansion, on this island?`
`I've just been shut up in the guesthouse with the rest of the cousins since yesterday.`
`So I don't know anything about what's going on outside.`
`Just what is happening that I don't know about...`
`outside this room, in the mansion, on this island?`
`...Everything is happening, everything is proceeding, `
`...and everything is ending without my knowing it.`
`Somewhere in my heart, I've already started giving up.`
`...Most likely, ...not one of us will see tomorrow morning.`
`When the seagulls cry, nobody will be left alive...`
`"Dad, ...Mom...!!`
` Who would do something like this...?!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`Jessica's woeful voice echoed throughout the rose garden...`
`Perhaps it was the intuition of a person who lived on this island.`
`...After checking the part of the rose garden where Aunt Rosa and Maria had fallen and seeing nothing, `
`Jessica went to look in the arbor next.`
`Normally, the arbor was probably a wonderful location to enjoy tea peacefully while appreciating the roses on a good sunny day.`
`...Maybe even Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi...`
`had days when they relaxed and enjoyed their tea together here.`
`...In that arbor lay their corpses.`
`At least they aren't drenched in the rain like Aunt Rosa and Maria had been, `
`but there was no way I could say that out loud to Jessica at the moment...`
`"...What do you think, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"...St-Strangulation, I believe.`
` ...Come, take a look at this.`
` On their necks, there are distinct markings that something thin was used to strangle them."`
`"Right. `
`...I doubt those things were the primary cause for their deaths."`
`Right there...lay two stake-like weapons decorated with an occult design, `
`which had been found driven into Uncle Krauss's thigh area...`
`and near Aunt Natsuhi's calf.`
`When we found these sticking out of my parents' forehead and chest, `
`we decided to preserve the crime scene and leave them for the police, `
`...but Jessica didn't care about such matters and immediately pulled the stakes out of her parents' forsaken bodies.`
`"...By now, bodies gouged in the head, chest, stomach, knee, and leg have been found."`
`"Aaaaaaaaahh, damn it, damn it, damn it!!`
` I'll kill that murderer, kill him!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`"...With this, the eighth twilight has been completed.`
` ...Is this going to continue onto the ninth twilight?`
` ...The witch shall be revived, and none shall be left alive."`
`"Bring it on...`
` ...If the witch revives, `
`...that means the culprit is gonna make his grand appearance, right?!`
` No one's going to be left alive? Bullshit...`
` ...I'll kill him...!`
` I'll definitely kill the culprit who killed Dad and Mom with my own hands...!!"`
`Jessica let her emotions flow out as she howled furiously.`
`...To avoid being crushed by grief, she could do nothing but resist it with anger.`
`"...We still...haven't found George.`
` ...Jessica, you children had better stay here.`
` I'll go into the mansion."`
`"E-Eva-san, we mustn't split up...!! `
`It's dangerous if we do not all stick together...!"`
`"There's nothing we can do for Nii-san or his wife.`
` But George may be still alive somewhere...!`
` I have no time to waste here...!!"`
`As Aunt Eva screamed this, Jessica glared at her.`
`...Eva had no more time to bother about the dead.`
`She was more concerned for the safety of her only son, who had yet to be seen.`
`"Jessica-chan, you should stay by your father and mother's side.`
` I'll make a short trip to the mansion.`
` Battler-kun and Doctor Nanjo, you two can stay here as well."`
`After arbitrarily saying this, Aunt Eva rushed out of the arbor.`
`I called out to stop her, but there was no way she would listen.`
`...However, being alone in this situation meant nothing short of death.`
`If we silently watched her leave, it would be the same as letting her die.`
`Since Aunt Eva was unwilling to stop, we had no choice but to follow her.`
`...And, while it may be cruel to say so, `
`Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi were already dead, `
`so there was nothing more we could do for them...`
`In the end, we had no choice but to console Jessica and head for the mansion together.`
`...Fortunately, Jessica stood up.`
`Perhaps she had been able to break free from her grief.`
`...But...what had surfaced in its place was an expression like a demon's.`
`"...I'll kill that person with my own hands, ...I'll definitely avenge them......`
` ...Let's go, Battler.`
` If we find the culprit, don't get in my way.`
` I'm definitely gonna kill them...!!"`
`"......I've got my own parents to avenge.`
` Sorry, but this is first come, first serve."`
`"...Yeah, ...that's right...`
` ...Let's kill them!"`
`At my words, Jessica finally seemed to feel like we sympathized with her emotions.`
`She still had that dark expression, but I felt that Jessica had regained some of her sanity.`
`We took off.`
`Chasing after Aunt Eva.`
`Through the rose garden, `
`up the stone steps, `
`running at full speed towards the mansion, ...whose large, intimidating shadow flashed in the lightning.`
`...With this, the murders of the epitaph have reached the eighth twilight.`
`And then, on the ninth twilight, the witch shall revive.`
`...None shall be left alive.`
`I will most likely lose my life.`
`...But at the very least, I want to burn the truth into my eyes.`
`That's the only thing motivating me to move right now.`
`We were able to meet up with Aunt Eva, who was having trouble with the lock to the front door.`
`It seemed that all the blood had risen to Aunt Eva's head.`
` That was probably making her fingers clumsy.`
`It looked like she couldn't even handle the simple task of inserting the key into the lock.`
`...Then, there was a faint sound.`
`The sound of the door unlocking.`
`Just as though it had waited for all the survivors to unite before opening.`
`It felt to me as though the malicious mansion...`
`was trying to swallow up all the remaining humans at once...`
`Perhaps the stench that erupted outwards the instant the door opened...`
`couldn't be described as just a smell.`
`It wasn't just the charred smell from Grandfather.`
`...I think it also may have contained the regrets of the servants and Dad's group,`
` ...all of the dead.`
`...What did it mean as it floated out, overwhelming us?`
`...Was it the cry of the dead, telling us not to enter?`
`However, Aunt Eva didn't even flinch at something like that.`
`...And we who had to chase after her...`
`were forced to step into the mansion, even after receiving that message...`
`"George?!`
` George!!`
` If you can hear me, answer!`
` Geoooooorge!!"`
`Aunt Eva shouted at the top of her lungs.`
`...Considering the situation, it's probably far too optimistic to imagine that he's alive.`
`In the hall, I had heard myself say that Dad's corpse was there.`
`I wanted to see his face, `
`but stealing George's lunch money came first.`
` It's not like he needs it anymore...`
`When we started following Aunt Eva's example and calling out George's name in loud voices...`
`...Aunt Eva spotted something...and stopped walking.`
`She was standing in front of the door to the parlor.`
`"......What is this......?`
` D-Doctor Nanjo, could you come here for a second...?"`
`"Wh-What is it...?"`
`I'd heard about the eerie magic circles written on doors, like the one on the parlor, from the adults.`
`...Eerie is the only word to describe that thing, `
`which was scribbled with a deep-red paint, reminiscent of blood, so that it slowly dripped down.`
`However, that had supposedly been there since this morning.`
`...Wondering why Aunt Eva, who had supposedly seen it already, `
`would think it odd now, Jessica and I stared at the door...`
`"...Certainly, ......I have no memory of numbers such as these being written here."`
`"Right, they weren't.`
` ...Eerie magical characters were written here, but not numbers."`
`From what the two of them said, only the magic circle had been there this morning.`
`However, right now, there were eight digits written near the upper part of the magic circle.`
`07151129.`
`...I didn't know what it meant, `
`but I didn't even want to imagine what someone had been thinking when they wrote it.`
`It was drawn with the same paint as the magic circle,`
` ...but it had clearly been written very recently.`
`The way it had dried and the condition of the color was completely different from the magic circle part.`
`"......Heh.`
` I'm sure it just has some magical meaning.`
` No point wasting time thinking about it."`
`Jessica intentionally spat those words out in an attempt to push aside the eerie feel it gave off.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"It...could be a magic`
`~ib~ square~ib~`
`.`
` ...The idea that a ward against magic can reside in a certain sort of number play.`
` I believe everyone has heard of the one where adding all of the numbers in each row leads to the same sum..."`
`"Wasn't that a group of numbers buried in a rectangle?`
` This is just a single row.`
` I don't have a clue what it could mean.`
` ...What Jessica-chan said is probably correct.`
` There isn't any point in us wasting time thinking about it..."`
`Even though she said that, she probably suspected that it actually meant something.`
`Aunt Eva was deftly writing that number down on an old receipt or something with a short ballpoint pen.`
`Unless it had some obvious pattern, it'd probably be tough to memorize a code made up of an eight-digit number.`
`............`
`'!s1`
`...this be a date, `
`...or something?"`
`"A date...?`
` What are you talking about...?"`
`"Well, ...it's probably a coincidence, `
`but my birthday......`
`is July 15.`
` ...Once I thought that 0715 might refer to July 15,`
` I figured that if 1129 stood for November 29, maybe that'd fit perfectly..."`
`"......Why would your birthday be written in a place like this? And what's up with November 29...?"`
`"That's what I wanna know...`
` Still, ...it's probably just a coincidence.`
` When I thought about it, it started to feel a little creepy.`
` ...What if someone's birthday was November 29?`
` That's not the birthday of anyone else in my family, not Dad or Kyrie-san or Ange.`
` And of course, it isn't my Mom's either."`
`"Nothing comes to mind...`
` ...I don't believe it's Kinzo-san's or Genji-san's birthday."`
`"It isn't from my family either.`
` And it isn't Rosa's or Maria-chan's."`
`"It can't be anyone in my family...`
` And it isn't Kanon-kun's or Shannon's.`
` ...I always give the servants presents on their birthdays, so I know it for all of them,`
` but I don't know anyone who was born on November 29..."`
`Once we started imagining that the eight digits weren't meaningless,`
` but actually two dates written together, it really started to look that way.`
`...However, its true meaning may be something completely different, or there may be no meaning at all.`
`Anyway, since we don't have any real clues, it's probably pointless to stand around here worrying about it.`
`...The inside of the parlor's much more important.`
`This morning, behind each of the doors with a magic circle drawn on them...had been the body of a victim.`
`...So, if something new has been added to this door, `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`does that mean something new `
`~ib~has been added~ib~`
` inside the parlor?`
`When Aunt Eva tried to open it, she felt the resistance of the lock.`
`She immediately took out a master key and put it in the keyhole.`
`As soon as she opened the door, ...Aunt Eva let out a high-pitched scream and ran inside.`
`That alone was enough to tell us what had happened inside the room...`
`Doctor Nanjo and I looked at each other, and I shook my head slightly as we entered the parlor...`
`'!s0`
` Geooooorge!!`
` Hang in there...!!`
` Geoooooooooorge!!`
` Doctor Nanjo, quickly!!"`
`George-aniki lay there crumpled alongside Shannon-chan's corpse.`
`His chest was stained bright red.`
` And judging by his still-opened eyes,`
` ...I'd hate to say it to Aunt Eva, `
`...but I couldn't pick up any signs of life.`
`After moving to take George's pulse, `
`...Doctor Nanjo shook his head, wordlessly reporting that George was dead.`
`Brushing him aside, Aunt Eva once again crouched beside George-aniki...`
`and started crying at the top of her lungs...`
`With Aniki's death, ...one thing is certain.`
`The murders hadn't ended on the eighth twilight.`
`The epitaph was being carried out in its complete form, including the ninth twilight, 'And none shall be left alive'...`
`I was really starting to lose track of things.`
`...For some reason, Aunt Eva's half-crazed cries actually made me cool down...`
`...Crestfallen and exhausted, I flopped onto the sofa and plunked my feet on top of the table.`
`Maybe all these murders numbed my heart.`
`Instead of just being frightened, I felt completely confused.`
`Dad and Kyrie-san are dead, and people have been killed off one by one, starting with the servants.`
`...And there's been a hell of a lot of them by now.`
`I don't know when the first murder happened,`
` ...but they might have been killed at a rate of about one person per hour by now.`
`We believe that the boat will come for us around 9:00 tomorrow.`
`...There's still a full 12 hours until then.`
`...How many more sacrifices to the witch will there have to be for us to survive...?`
`With the four of us, if one goes each hour, ...we won't last any longer than four hours.`
` We don't even know if we'll last until midnight tonight...`
`...Yesterday, after lunch, we came into this parlor.`
`Just as they started talking about serving some tea Aunt Rosa had bought, `
`we kids decided to take a walk.`
`...Maria was jumping around, wasn't she?`
`...Didn't Shannon-chan bring us some cookies?`
`She said Kumasawa-san had baked them, or something.`
`...It would've been hilarious if she'd baked some mackerel into them, wouldn't it?`
`......That's right, I'll never hear Kumasawa baa-chan's mackerel jokes again, will I...?`
`...Oh, right, if I only remember stuff about Kumasawa baa-chan, that wouldn't be fair to everyone else...`
`......Why did Dad and Kyrie-san...even go outside?`
`It's not like going without food for a day would kill us.`
`...So why did gluttony get ahold of them and make them go out for food?`
`...I'll bet that fearless dad of mine just started complaining about being hungry...`
`Kyrie-san, you were supposed to be the brakes for my reckless dad...`
`Why didn't you stop him?`
`......And...what about your daughter, Ange...?`
`She's still just six years old.`
` Don't tell me you planned to leave her in my care...`
`After all, it's doubtful now whether even I'll be able to leave this island alive......`
`"S-Stop...!!`
` Why are you fighting at a time like this...?!`
` Jessica-san, stop...!!"`
`...It's been kinda noisy for a while.`
`By the time I looked up to see what it was, Jessica and Aunt Eva had suddenly started fighting each other.`
`...No, maybe I should say that Jessica was grabbing at Aunt Eva.`
`"...Aunt Eva killed Dad and the rest!!`
` There's no other explanation!!"`
`"How foolish!!`
` Why should I know anything about what happened to your parents?!"`
`"Who was on the first floor of the guesthouse?!`
` Aunt Eva!!`
` Dad and Mom were in the first floor lobby, along with her!`
` And who was left alive?!`
` Only Aunt Eva!!`
` Why?"`
`"It's obviously because you're the culprit!!`
` You killed Mom and Dad, carried them outside, and then shamelessly locked the door,`
` trying to make it seem like it was the witch's doing...!!"`
`'!s0`
` He never came down to the first floor!`
` So, did he disappear from the second floor?!`
` And who was on the second floor?!`
` You people were, right?!!`
` You knew, didn't you?!`
` You knew that George slipped out of the guesthouse!!`
` And you brazenly acted as if you didn't know anything!!`
` If you'd stopped George, he'd be...he'd be...!!!"`
`"I said stop...!`
` Jessica-san was in the cousins' room the whole time!`
` And Eva-san was in the first floor lobby the whole time!`
` Neither of you is responsible for anything!`
` What we have here is simply the sadness of losing family members...!!`
` The culprit is no one, nowhere...!!`
` It is all......just the witch's fault!!`
` So stop hating each other, you two...!!"`
`...The witch's fault, huh...?`
`I wonder if that's a good way to cool down the situation right now.`
`Yeah, ...I finally understand why three people evaporated from the guesthouse...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`when all the doors and windows were ~ib~locked from the inside~ib~...`
`This is what they were after.`
`...Making us think the culprit was inside...and sparking this ugly, mutual hatred...`
`has to be the culprit's...the witch's goal.`
`......But if that's the case, how did the culprit`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~lock it from the outside~ib~`
`...?`
`When Dad's group was attacked, their master key was definitely stolen.`
`...But the doors and windows to the guesthouse were built so that you couldn't lock them from the outside, no matter how hard you tried.`
`So that master key should have had nothing to do with the guesthouse closed room...`
`Jessica and Aunt Eva were turning their sadness at losing their blood relatives into anger at the person in front of them.`
`Doctor Nanjo was trying to step between them.`
`......And I sat in the sofa, staring up at the ceiling, `
`...thinking about things that didn't even matter anymore with a worn out expression...`
`......I just couldn't believe that this was the same parlor that had been so warm and pleasant midday yesterday,`
` ...for just a short time before the typhoon hit...`
`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaahhhh, `
`...uwaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!"`
`The sudden sound of a gunshot shook me out of my half-asleep trance.`
`...Smoke was rising out of the barrel of the gun Aunt Eva held.`
`Jessica had fallen to the floor and was covering both her eyes.`
`Aunt Eva and Doctor Nanjo were looking down at her in shock...`
`"A-Are you okay, Jessica-san...?!`
` Jessica-san...!!"`
`'!s1`
`it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, `
`...rrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggghhh..."`
`"...I-It wasn't my fault...`
` ...Th-This happened because you came at me even after I told you to stop...!"`
`"H-Hey, wait a sec, what's going on...?!"`
`So, did Jessica grab at Aunt Eva, which turned into a scuffle...?`
`Did they start fighting over Aunt Eva's gun?`
`Did some kind of impact cause the trigger to be pulled...?`
`I didn't know if the bullet had grazed her or if she'd been burned by the discharge,`
` but either way, Jessica was covering both of her eyes, screaming 'It hurts, it hurts' and rolling around on the floor.`
`"...Don't worry, calm down...!`
` It is not a serious wound, so get ahold of yourself...!"`
`'!s1`
`...I can't see, `
`...I can't see...!!"`
`Doctor Nanjo let Jessica borrow his shoulder, saying that he would tend to her in the servant room.`
`...The servant room in this mansion had a bed and a first aid kit and was able to function as an infirmary.`
`"Damn iiiiiit!!`
` You killed Mom and Dad!!`
` I'll kill you, I'll kill you...!!"`
`"...I-It wasn't me, ...it wasn't me...!!"`
`"Jessica-san, you'll aggravate the wound, so don't move about...!`
` Come, let us go to the servant room..."`
`Jessica continued to curse Aunt Eva as her parents' murderer.`
`It seemed that Aunt Eva couldn't conceal her trembling at the fact that she had pulled the trigger, even if it had been an accident.`
`"...It wasn't my fault, ...it happened because that kid jumped at me...`
` ...I didn't kill anyone...`
` ...More importantly, ...who killed George?`
` That's right, who killed George?!!`
` George, Geooooooooooorge!!`
` It isn't my fault, it isn't my fault...!!"`
`"W-Wait a sec, Aunt Eva...!!`
` Don't go off on your own!!"`
`I didn't know if it was because Aunt Eva couldn't bear her mistake...`
`or if she'd given up control of her body to anger at the person who had killed her only son...`
`or if it was both of those all mixed together.`
`...At any rate, she ran out into the corridor, yelling, fearful, and screaming.`
`I was also worried about Jessica's condition, but right then, I couldn't leave Aunt Eva alone.`
`Why would she go off on her own in this mansion, of all places? Is she suicidal...?!`
`Doctor Nanjo took Jessica towards the servant room.`
`...I chased after Aunt Eva, dashing into the depths of the mansion...`
`After sitting Jessica on the servant room bed,`
` Nanjo told her several times not to touch her eyes and examined the affected area.`
`The barrel had probably been near her eyes.`
`There was a possibility that the flames from the discharge had injured her corneas.`
`...There was no threat to her life, but it would probably be necessary to take her to a doctor as soon as possible.`
`Nanjo applied emergency first aid, covering the affected area with gauze and wrapping it with a bandage.`
`As a result, Jessica completely lost her field of vision...`
`"Is that okay...?`
` The wound may hurt or itch, but you mustn't scratch at it or rub it.`
` When tomorrow comes, let us go to an ophthalmologist as soon as possible."`
`"...That bitch, she really was trying to kill me...`
` If the angle had been just a little bit off, I'd have been killed by now...`
` I'll definitely turn her in to the police...!"`
`"...Eva-san would not do such a thing.`
` That was an accident."`
`"You call that an accident...?!`
` She killed Dad and Mom.`
` There's no way any 19th person or witch exists on this island...!!`
` She's behind everything.`
` She was the only one on the first floor of the guesthouse!"`
`"George nii-san must have seen her kill Mom and Dad, and she killed him to keep him quiet!!`
` It's the same with Grandfather and the servants.`
` I'm sure she snuck out of the family conference last night and killed all of them...!!"`
`"...I-If that is indeed the case, then we'll find out about it as soon as the police investigate.`
` The police are incredible, and with their powers of discernment, there is nothing that cannot be understood.`
` ...There is no need for us to suspect or hate anyone.`
` The police will resolve everything."`
`"So for now, Jessica-san, you should devote yourself to resting your body and keeping your eyes safe.`
` ...Of course, if you wrinkle your forehead too much, it will do nothing good for your eyes, not to mention your beauty."`
`When Jessica's abuse of Eva had reached a crescendo, `
`she actually had started glaring instinctively, and the pressure on her eyes had hurt her.`
`Jessica herself realized that the more she talked, the more the wound would hurt,`
` and regardless of whether she'd overcome her suspicions of Eva, she regained her composure for the time being...`
`"......She killed them, `
`...Dad and Mom.`
` ...And Shannon...`
`...and Kanon-kun...`
` Kanon-kun......"`
`She'd heard that Kanon had been killed in the chapel.`
`...Jessica still hadn't seen his face after he had died.`
`Jessica was now less fearful about the fact that she was blinded,`
` and more frightened that the police would carry Kanon's body away while she still couldn't see,`
` and that she would have to say her final farewell without being able to look at his face.`
`Her anger at the culprit...and her sadness at the death of the person she'd liked.`
`...Those mixed emotions started her crying.`
`But right now, tears were actually painful for her,`
` so she wasn't even permitted to leisurely remember his face in bygone days...`
`Jessica could do nothing but sit on the bed and let her head droop, withstanding the pain...`
`"......`
`...Well then, now I am worried more about Eva-san.`
` I hope she isn't too shaken by this."`
`Realizing that Jessica had calmed down for the time being and letting out a sigh, `
`he stuck his head out into the hallway to look for any sign of the others coming back.`
`"......!"`
`Then, their eyes met.`
`Nanjo, unable to understand who this person was, was bewildered for an instant.`
`"I hear that people who have lost the power of sight have zero anti-magic power and magic resistance power.`
` In other words, you're an isolated pawn right now.`
` Understand what that means?"`
`"...Wh-What did you say...?"`
`Nanjo had no way of understanding who the person in front of him was,`
` much less what she had just said.`
`"......Doctor Nanjo?`
` What's going on...?"`
`Unable to see, Jessica had to rely on voices alone to make out the situation.`
`...But since she heard Nanjo say something in an uneasy tone,`
` she tightened up, thinking that something bad might have happened.`
`"...S-Stop, please...!`
` Please don't kill me...!!`
` I have a sick grandchild...!`
` I mustn't die here...!`
` Please, spare me...!!`
` Eeeek!!!"`
`"...Doctor Nanjo...?`
` Doctor Nanjo?!"`
`Jessica couldn't do anything except call out from the bed.`
`...Judging by the tone of his voice, Nanjo was in the corridor, confronting someone.`
`And he was scared.`
`His life must have been threatened just a second ago.`
`"No, stop it!!`
` Eeeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!!"`
`"On the ninth twilight, the witch shall revive, and none shall be left alive.`
` Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!"`
`The witch pointed the end of her gold staff at Nanjo.`
`...Even though he didn't know what she was planning to do, `
`Nanjo assumed that she must be trying to take his life.`
`"Doctor Nanjo!!`
` Doctor Nanjo!!`
` Is someone there?!`
` Answer me!!"`
`"Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit, ahiiieeeeeeeeehhh!!"`
`*bang*!`
` A sharp sound echoed.`
`And just as sharply, the tip of the golden staff tapered and stretched, slicing into Nanjo's forehead...`
`Jessica, who could only try to grasp what was happening with her ears, had no clue what was going on.`
`...But even so, she was able to realize that with that sound, Nanjo had died.`
`And, ...she could tell that that person was now in the corridor, right in front of the servant room.`
`...Furthermore, since she couldn't see, she wouldn't be able to run away, much less resist.`
`...Knowing that she was a mouse in a trap and in a life or death situation, Jessica shuddered...`
`"...Oh, Jessica.`
` Too bad, your eyes got injured.`
` ...Now you can't even escape.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*`
` ...I'm gonna play a whole lot with Nanjo's corpse now.`
` ...When I get bored of that, I'll kill you next and play a bunch more."`
`"...No, wait, if I've got you here blind already...`
` ...I won't wait until you're dead.`
` I'll have a lot of fun with you before I kill you too.`
` ...Kuhhihyahyahyahya...!!`
` So wait there shaking for a while, okay?`
` As you try to imagine all the ways I'm playing with Nanjo's corpse!!"`
`'!s0`
`Jessica was struck with fear and let out a frail scream.`
`...She wanted to scream in a much louder voice, trying to get someone to help her.`
`But she couldn't.`
`When faced with true fear, it clogs up a person's throat...`
`Right then, Jessica could barely even breathe.`
`'!s1`
`Help me, `
`...help me......!!`
` Eeeeeeeeeekk!!"`
`She searched around with her hands, trying to find some way to escape.`
`But even though she should have known this room well, just being unable to see made it like a closed room of darkness.`
`She ran into a shelf or something, and things like a candy jars and bottles fell down, hitting her on the head.`
`...As she was now, it would've been tough for her to even guard her head to block it.`
`...She was painfully aware of how powerless humans become just by losing their sense of sight.`
`Of course, she had no time to be impressed by this fact.`
`She crawled around at random, trying to escape from that place,`
` but she kept bumping into things that she didn't understand, getting hit by various falling objects,`
` and it felt like the entire room was alive, bullying her and refusing to let her escape.`
`Then, a footstep could be heard from that presence in the hallway.`
`And then, a voice.`
`...She'd probably poked her head into the room, since Jessica had been so loud.`
`"You really are noisy.`
` Act like a lady and wait there on the bed.`
` 'Cause I'll give you a wonderful blood-red death outfit fitting for such an honored daughter.`
` ...Something good enough to make the person who finds you faint, okay?`
` Gehheheheheheheheheheh!!"`
`"E-Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!"`
`Until just a second ago, she had sworn that she'd kill the culprit if she found them.`
`...However, she was now very powerless.`
`She couldn't do anything except let out a scream, crawling around on the floor and bumping her head into the bed and the legs of desks.`
`"Help me, ...help me...!`
` Someone, help me...!!`
` Dad, ...Mom...!`
` Battleeeer...!`
` Someone, coooooooome...!!`
` ......Help me, ...Kanon-kun......!!"`
`In the corridor, as the witch thought of how to toy with Nanjo's life...`
`...A single gold butterfly secretly watched that scene from the corner of the hallway.`
`...It was Beato, who had barely escaped with her life once before.`
`The gold butterfly softly returned to human form.`
`...It was faint and transparent like a lace curtain.`
`By now, her power was so weak that even maintaining this form was difficult for her.`
`Right next to her, Ronove also appeared.`
`"...It is unlikely that Jessica will survive.`
` ...Of course, there were to be no survivors from the very beginning."`
`".........She has grown feelings of love for Kanon.`
` ...I have toyed with them at times.`
` ......However, such behavior was shameful for a witch."`
`"...Love is the single element.`
` Romantic love is even more pure, more sacred.`
` ...Though for some reason, you seem to despise it thoroughly, Milady."`
`"............`
`...Teacher told me.`
` ...Magic exists to bring people happiness.`
` ...That's something I myself must have been aware of in the past."`
`"...Ever since I forgot that, I stopped being a witch.`
` ...And so, ...I lost the right to be Battler's opponent..."`
`"......I can hardly believe it, Milady.`
` ...Do you actually intend to rescue Jessica?`
` It will be dangerous."`
`"I know...`
` Even if I do save her, she will become a plaything of the witch's banquet when the door to the Golden Land opens.`
` ...But even so, ...that death would be far more compassionate than what that person would do to her.`
` ...The witch's banquet steals lives in a terrible way, but it does not do so more than once.`
` It does not toy with life and death."`
`"...However, that person is different.`
` She kills over and over.`
` She kills for fun!`
` There is not even a trace of compassion there.`
` ......I want to at least save Jessica from that kind of cruel fate."`
`"...Certainly, by carrying that out, you would probably be praised as a good witch.`
` ...However, the new Beatrice-sama already views you as hostile, Milady.`
` ...If you were to be seen by her again, ...you would not have any method of escape this time, correct?"`
`"..................`
`...When I reunited George and Shannon,`
` ......I finally understood what a witch is...`
`and what magic is."`
`"......I am a witch.`
` I must act as a witch.`
` And I must be acknowledged as Battler's opponent, ...and make Battler accept me as a witch this time around."`
`"...The road to that goal may be long and difficult.`
` ...However, if I do not take a step forward here and now, ...I won't be able to call myself a witch."`
`"I understand your feelings, but how do you plan to rescue her?`
` There are not many forms of magic that your body is capable of now, Milady.`
` Did you not have to borrow George's power even back when you revived Shannon?"`
`"...Indeed.`
` ...And for that very reason, I may be able to save Jessica.`
` ...Right now, she is begging for Kanon to save her.`
` ...If I can borrow the power of that emotion, my magic may be able to knock on the doors of the Land of the Dead once again."`
`"You may be able to knock.`
` However, you would use up all of your magical energy.`
` ...If you were to be spotted by the new Beatrice-sama, you would truly be without a method of escape.`
` ...I am no longer your butler, Milady.`
` ...Understand that I cannot assist you if the situation worsens."`
`"...I know.`
` ......By now, I have toyed with and taken more lives than I can count.`
` ...So, I may not be able to make up for it...except by saving the same number of lives, bringing them through that door."`
`"...I have had nothing to lose in the first place.`
` ...I am just a gold butterfly who has passed its name and magic power on, and who is no longer acknowledged as a witch."`
`"......What about Battler-sama?`
` You are partway through a game with him.`
` He has said that he would wait until you returned.`
` ...Are you truly satisfied to end it here?`
` ...You have a duty to return to the seat across from Battler-sama, Milady."`
`"For that very reason...!`
` If there's a life that only I can save, I will save it.`
` And I will be accepted as a witch.`
` ...I must become a witch...!`
` If this is training, it is a very childish thing, nothing that compares with the evils I have committed before now."`
`"...Vanish, Ronove.`
` Watch what may be the final magic of a single butterfly who used to be called a witch...!"`
`"...Certainly.`
` ...Please show me magic...`
`...that will not disgrace the name of the Golden Witch.`
` ...And I pray that it is not your final spell."`
`"Go, my friend.`
` ...If you can find enough ink, write down the story of my foolish life...and hand it over to some fool who is about to walk down the same path.`
` So long, Ronove...!"`
`'!s1`
`...where are you...?`
` Where are you...?`
` ...Help me, `
`...help me, `
`...aaaaaaaaahhh..."`
`......Milady,`
` I am...always there by your side.`
`"...K-Kanon-kun...?`
` Kanon-kun...?!"`
`It seemed to Jessica as though she'd heard Kanon's voice just then.`
`She looked around with unseeing eyes, but of course, she saw nothing.`
`...On the contrary, that action caused her head to hit the desk again.`
`"...Kanon-kun, ......Kanon-kun...`
` ...Help me, ......help me......"`
`Yes, Milady.`
` ...I will...help you.`
`"...K-Kanon-kun...?!`
` Y-You survived...?!"`
`This time, she thought she heard his voice clearly.`
`Jessica jumped up in surprise, banging her head against the desk once again.`
`...Milady, please, calm your heart and listen.`
`...Unfortunately, I am not alive.`
`"......Huh...?"`
`I have already...died.`
`...However, ...that witch came to me to tell me of your peril.`
`...And...she gave me just a little bit of time...so that I could save you, Milady.`
`Please, calm your heart even more.`
`If you do, ...my form will become visible even to you, Milady...`
`Jessica obeyed those words.`
`She chased all idle thoughts from her head and relaxed her breathing.`
`...Of course, her heart felt like it was going to explode after hearing the voice of the one she'd liked and had thought was dead.`
`She resisted the excitement with all her strength.`
`...When she did, ...she felt as though Kanon-kun really was right in front of her.`
`...Even though she shouldn't have been able to see him with her eyes, ...she was able to sense him clearly.`
`"...Can you...see me?`
` Milady..."`
`"Yeah...`
` I can see. ...I can definitely see you, Kanon-kun..."`
`"......I exist only as as a soul now.`
` So I cannot touch you, Milady.`
` I cannot do anything except talk to you like this.`
` ...With my current weak existence, I can do nothing more than that, ...but I should be able to be of some aid to you, Milady."`
`"...So, ...we can only talk...?`
` I can't...touch you, Kanon-kun...?"`
`"I am now more fragile than smoke from a candle.`
` ...So much so that if one of the living such as you were to touch me, I would be wiped away instantly.`
` ...So please, don't try to touch me.`
` ...Because I am also...holding back my desire...to touch you, Milady."`
`"Ah, ......o-okay..."`
`"More importantly, Milady,`
` ...please listen well.`
` ......The new Golden Witch has a cruel heart.`
` ...She surely plans to make you meet with a horrible fate.`
` ...You must escape from this room and hide."`
`"...H-How...?`
` I can't...see anything...!"`
`"Quiet...`
` ...I will be your eyes, Milady.`
` Please move in accordance with my instructions.`
` ...First, please crawl three steps from there, then stand up.`
` You are now under the desk, Milady.`
` If you stand there, you'll hit your head."`
`"...Th-That was under the desk...?`
` Okay, 1, 2, 3...`
` ...I'm gonna stand..."`
`"Well done...`
` Next, please turn to face towards 9 o'clock.`
` ......Yes, well done."`
`"Ha, ...haha...`
` This is pretty...embarrassing...`
` ...Ah, ...ack, ...owowow..."`
`"Are you okay? Does your wound hurt...?"`
`"N-No, ...I'm fine...`
` What next...?"`
`Jessica thought that if this was a dream, she didn't want to wake up.`
`...And, if she were allowed to, she would've wanted to take off the bandage covering her eyes and see him.`
`...However, if she did that, Kanon might vanish like frail candle smoke, just like he himself had said...`
` ...She was afraid of that.`
`So she satisfied herself with just listening to his words once more, `
`repressing her desire to see him, to hold him.`
`Therefore, what hurt her eyes now were tears of gratitude.`
`...Tears of gratitude for the god...or maybe the witch...who had given her this miraculous moment.`
`"...Is this okay...?`
` If we keep talking like this, won't we be noticed by her?`
` Won't our voices be heard...?"`
`"...I have erected a secrecy barrier.`
` As long as we don't make any loud sounds or speak noisily, no one will notice us.`
` ...That's why people can't tell when I'm around."`
`"...I-I don't really get it, ...but anyway, we'll be fine as long as we stay quiet, right...?`
` ...Wh-What should I do next...?"`
`"Please walk 10 steps in that direction.`
` You will touch the sofa.`
` Please continue along that.`
` ...Do it slowly.`
` ...Stay calm.`
` Believe in my words."`
`"...S-Sure.`
` ......Heheh, ...it's weird...`
` ...Even though it's so scary not being able to see, ......I'm not scared at all if you're with me, Kanon-kun..."`
`"......Yes, that is the sofa.`
` Trace it to the left while advancing slowly...`
` There is a table just to your left.`
` Be careful not to bump into it with your shins..."`
`...It was a very, very strange and bizarre team effort.`
`Even though she would have been killed in an instant if the terrible witch noticed her, `
`...there was no fear in Jessica's heart.`
`She was being protected and guided by Kanon, someone she thought she'd never be reunited with.`
`...It would probably be just a momentary miracle.`
`...Even so, Jessica was deeply grateful for it.`
`If she hoped for too much, she was sure that he would disappear, so she tried not to ruin this faint miracle.`
`And, trying to engrave this moment into her heart for all eternity, she slowly, slowly...continued to walk, obeying Kanon's voice...`
`"...Okay, if you walk 10 more steps, you will exit the servant room.`
` Then, please turn to face 9 o'clock, and keep walking very slowly.`
` Put your hand on the wall to your right, and keep on following that.`
` ...I will take you to a safe room."`
`'!s1`
`...will you...`
`leave, Kanon-kun...?"`
`"............"`
`Kanon didn't answer.`
`...But his lack of an answer was enough to tell her the truth.`
`"...Then, ...no way.`
` ......I don't want to go..."`
`"If you stay here, you will be killed by the witch."`
`"I don't mind...`
` If I'm killed, I can go to the world where you are, Kanon-kun..."`
`"...Milady,`
` please listen to me.`
` ...The human world is too bright and painful for the dead, like me...`
` So I cannot stay for long."`
`"So Milady, ...please allow me to use what time I am allowed...to guide you to a safe place.`
` ......Because after that, ......I will stay with you until my time runs out."`
`"......Is that...the very best you can manage, Kanon-kun...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` ......In exchange, I will stay by your side as long as possible.`
` ...I will stay with you...and talk with you, Milady."`
`"Talk...about what...?"`
`"......What do you want to talk about...?"`
`"...I don't care what, as long as you're willing to tell me, Kanon-kun..."`
`"...Well then...`
` ......I will tell you the story of a cowardly servant boy who lacked all courage.`
` ......The story of a foolish and pitiful boy who fell in love with a young lady as radiant as the sun. ...Even when the lady confessed those same feelings to him,`
` ...he lost to his cowardice...and was never able to be honest with his feelings while he still lived."`
`"......Yes...`
` Then, ...I want to tell you a story too.`
` ......It's the story of a cowardly girl...who couldn't muster the courage...`
`to tell the boy she loved how she felt...much, much more often.`
` ......The story of how that girl, after being reunited with that boy by a miracle from god,`
` ......used that chance to finally muster up her courage."`
`"......I also...want to hear that.`
` ...So, for that reason as well, let us go.`
` ...To a safe place."`
`"...Yeah...`
` If I could be with you, Kanon-kun, I would walk however far, however long it took...`
` I don't need eyes anymore.`
` If you tell me to step forward, I will take that step, even if it leads off a cliff."`
`"Thank you.`
` ...Come, Milady.`
` Let us go.`
` The first 10 steps."`
`"No, I don't like it.`
` ......I won't do it...unless you call me Jessica."`
`"...Understood.`
` .........Well then, Jessica.`
` ...Take the first 10 steps."`
`"Yes,`
` Kanon-kun..."`
`Very quietly, Jessica and Kanon slowly snuck out of the servant room.`
`Just around the corner, the witch could be seen cruelly looking down at Nanjo's corpse, `
`but she didn't even notice their presence.`
`However, Ronove, who stood at the ready by her side, met Kanon's eyes.`
`...Kanon thought 'Oh no', grimacing and blocking Jessica with his back.`
`"............"`
`However, Ronove did not inform his master.`
`He played dumb, just as though he hadn't spotted Kanon in the first place.`
`...No, maybe he did appear to chuckle.`
`From a finger on Ronove's hands, which were joined behind his back, a single small gold butterfly appeared,`
` flying in front of Kanon as though guiding him.`
`It went unnoticed by the master he served.`
`Kanon was surprised at the magic that butterfly held.`
`Because it was far more powerful than the secrecy barrier Kanon possessed.`
`...He may not have known it, but that power of his had originally been Ronove's.`
`...Kanon's ability was an imitation of that, which Kinzo had made and given to him.`
`As that butterfly of secrecy magic scattered gold scales, it grew smaller bit by bit.`
`...It probably wouldn't last long.`
`...But without a doubt, even that would buy them enough time to get them far away from the cruel witch.`
`"Okay, Milady...`
` Let's follow that wall and keep walking.`
` ...Keep going.`
` Keep going."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...If I can be with you Kanon-kun, ...I'll keep on going, on and on..."`
`Led and protected by the small gold butterfly,`
` ...the pair separated by the wall of life and death slowly walked away, towards the end of the corridor...`
`...There was no way that the evil witch could have had magic to notice their flight.`
`Until they disappeared at the other end of the corridor, the witch didn't realize that Jessica had vanished...`
`By the time the gold butterfly Ronove had sent evaporated completely, ...Jessica had reached the parlor.`
`Even though it would have been a quick trip if she'd been able to see, as she was now, it had been a very long adventure.`
`"...Come, Milady.`
` We've reached the parlor.`
` I will now take you to the bundle of curtains by the window.`
` If you hide in there, you'll surely be safe."`
`"Inside the curtains...`
` Not bad.`
` I used to hide in there a lot, long ago."`
`"......Beatrice-sama..."`
`"...Huh?"`
`Kanon called out the witch's name.`
`Jessica looked around in surprise, but she obviously couldn't spot the witch when she couldn't see...`
`Beato had appeared once again with a faint form.`
`Kanon squared off against the figure of the evil witch, but Beato's expression was soft, ...or even pitying.`
`"......I don't know what sort of whim led you to revive me, nor do I understand what you're thinking now."`
`"...Oh, it was nothing more than a whim.`
` ...No, ...this is how witches should be.`
` ...It took me a thousand years to realize that.`
` ...That is how...foolish it is."`
`"Wh-Who is it?!`
` Who's there...?!"`
`"...Milady, be quiet.`
` ...She is the witch, ...Beatrice...`
` ......I owe her, ...because she let me be with you one more time."`
`"......The witch, ...Beatrice..."`
`"...Forget about me.`
` More importantly, you should quickly hide that girl in the shadows of the curtains.`
` ......You probably do not have much time left.`
` You may spend it having a final conversation with Jessica."`
`"...A secret meeting inside a bunch of curtains? ...How clever you two are.`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`"U-Umm, ......thank you, Beatrice...!!`
` Thank you for letting me be with Kanon-kun...!!"`
`Jessica didn't know where Beato was, so she said that while facing in the wrong direction.`
`Perhaps because she found that funny, Beato snickered.`
`"I will now leave this room to the pair of lovers.`
` Evil witches have no need for tales of love.`
` Allow me to depart."`
`"...Beatrice-sama, `
`...thank you very much."`
`"Hmph, `
`......there is no need to thank me.`
` You know that something like this cannot compensate for all of the evil I have done."`
`"I offer my gratitude to this good witch as a parting gift.`
` ...I don't know what has happened before or what will happen later.`
` ...However, at this very moment, `
`...you are without a doubt...a good witch."`
`"...You flatter me, furniture.`
` The next time we meet, I may be an evil witch who doesn't betray your expectations.`
` ...And with that, farewell."`
`Beato left the parlor and closed the door.`
`And, mustering the last of her remaining magical power, she sealed the door.`
`The fact that those two had escaped into here would eventually be noticed.`
`...And now that the ninth twilight had been reached, no matter how much they struggled, their inescapable fate had already been decided.`
`However, until that final moment, they should be given the chance to speak with each other of their love.`
`The witch poured out all of her magical power to protect their time together.`
`...So that no one would be able to defile their time alone until the last possible moment.`
`At that time, ...Beato noticed something.`
`...Her body had been detected by a magical searching technique.`
`...The evil witch's furniture had sniffed this place out.`
`"......So, boorishness is the witch's way of doing things after all...`
` To think that she doesn't even intend to let those two young ones speak together of their love......`
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!!"`
`"45, Data Received.`
` Checking Target, Confirmed as the Predecessor Lady Beatrice.`
` Analyzing Parlor Defensive Wall.`
` 72-Layered Multilayered Defensive Wall, Attack-Proof Barrier and Anti-Magic Armor.`
` Sniping into the parlor will be impossible.`
` Data Link to 410."`
`"410, Data Received. Nihi!`
` Then we've just gotta kill Predecessor-sama first, nyeh.`
` Great Lady Beatrice, your Firing Permission please!"`
`"Go ahead and shoot.`
` ...Oh, and avoid her vital areas.`
` There's something I want to ask that old hag."`
`"410, Firing.`
` Nihi!"`
`The Chiester Sisters' gold bow released a gold snake.`
`...It crawled down the corridor starting from the front of the servant room, aiming for the parlor as it drew a soft, snake-like curved line trajectory, `
`...and pierced Beato's chest.`
`".........Gwaah...!!!"`
`Gold butterflies gathered, and the cruel witch appeared along with her furniture.`
`"...Predecessor-sama,`
` no further obstructions will be permitted."`
`"...Ugh...uu...... I didn't think they would be...`
` ...Still, the Chiester Sisters really have gotten rusty.`
` To think that they failed to bring me down.`
` ...And twice, at that...!"`
`Ronove spoke in a manner befitting the witch's butler.`
`As she pushed her pain aside, Beato grinned and spoke back.`
`"M-My apologies, Predecessor-sama...!`
` We were ordered to avoid vital areas...!"`
`"As soon as we get the order, we can pierce you at any time.`
` We can pierce a hole in your ears, a hole in your belly button, any hole you like.`
` Nihi!"`
`The gold snake that had pierced Beatrice grew even longer, drawing a funnel-shaped helix and awaiting its next order.`
`...It was prepared to pierce a vital spot as soon as the evil witch told it to.`
`"......For what reason would someone like you, who is no less brutal than I, `
`make them avoid my vital areas?`
` New Beatrice...!!"`
`"I wanted to ask you something.`
` ...I don't know what kind of trick you used to escape, but we thought we took you out, right?`
` Why is it that even though you could've escaped by hiding, you took the risk of appearing again?`
` ...It can't be that you came back just to protect those two young people, riight?"`
`"...Well, ...who knows?`
` ...*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"And just a second ago.`
` Why'd you do something as soft as reviving the lovers and reuniting them?`
` ...The more I hear about you, the more I learn that I don't even reach up to your feet as an incarnation of evil.`
` If you're like that, why did you suddenly start acting so mildly?`
` ...That's what I wanted to ask."`
`"......*cackle*cackle*!`
` I am brutal, therefore I am fickle.`
` What purpose could questioning that possibly serve?"`
`"Chiester Sisters, sew her."`
`When she ordered that, the gold snake that was curled in a helix and suspended in space...`
`moved as fast as a real snake going after its prey...`
`and pierced Beato's body multiple times from both sides, its gold tail drawing a x shape.`
`As the cruel witch had ordered, it drew a cross-stitch through Beato's chest.`
`The gold thread made a squeaking sound and tormented Beato...`
`Rather than a gold snake searching for its prey,`
` it waited for orders like a sewing needle ready to sew Beato.`
`"If it's you we're talking about, there's no way it could've been a whim.`
` ...I've heard about you.`
` And I've learned.`
` You're such an incarnation of evil that I don't even rise up to your feet.`
` I thought I was truly a fitting successor to you."`
`"...But you've always been in the way.`
` You always say warm, pleasant things that shock me.`
` ...What changed you?`
` You explored the depths of evil for one thousand years,`
` and I let you live...because I wanted to know what happened to make you change so much."`
`"...If you really want to know, then I suggest you waste a thousand years as well.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Sew."`
`"Gwaahhhh!!!`
` Ackkah, ...gah!!"`
`Beato's chest was once again sewn with a golden cross-stitch.`
`It tightened once again, squeezing fresh blood from Beato's chest.`
`The intense pain it caused ran in conflict with its beauty to the eye.`
`"......You might be one of those things that disappear when they die and don't leave a corpse.`
` So I'll kill you slowly.`
` But if you answer my questions honestly, I'll let you die easy.`
` I'll give you a splendid, gorgeous death, perfect for my Predecessor-sama.`
` I'll sink you in a coffin filled with water and roses.`
` Isn't that wonderful?`
` ...And you still won't talk?`
` About the reason for your change of heart?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!!`
` Not answering when she is asked is another one of an evil witch's pleasures."`
`"Sew. Twice."`
`"Gyoah, gwuaahh......!!"`
`"Of course, you don't have to answer.`
` After all, that way I get to torture you.`
` Kuukuhihihihihihihihihihi!!"`
`"The Endless Magic truly is wonderful.`
` ...When you think about it, this world is limited in every way.`
` The endless cannot exist in the human world.`
` Because gods are without limits, the human world is deprived of all limitlessness, so that they can be looked down upon."`
`"...So, in other words, this endless power is the power of the gods!`
` A wonderful power where, the more you play with it, the more fun ways of playing you find!`
` You used that power as you pleased for one thousand years and went on a rampage!`
` Why are you having a change of heart only now?`
` You aren't gonna say you regret handing it over to me, are you?"`
`"How could I regret it?`
` The Endless Magic you believe in is no magic at all.`
` ...True magic lies in a deep abyss that you most certainly cannot reach."`
`"And this is what you realized...?`
` Then what...is it?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Wander about for a thousand years without realizing, foolish witch."`
`"Sew. Three times this time."`
`"Gwoah, gyuooh, ...gu...!!!"`
`Beato's chest had been embroidered with the gold thread.`
`It tightened even more, causing Beato more and more pain...`
`"...Well, that's fine.`
` I'm no longer curious about what kind of revelations an old hag who refuses to die might've had.`
` I'm bored now, so I'll just kill you.`
` If I do, the barrier around the parlor will dissolve."`
`"...Then I'll torture Kanon and Jessica to death a whole bunch of times.`
` ...Being able to have two lovers as my toys at the same time...sounds pretty fun, right?`
` Kuhhihihhihhihihihhihihihihi!!"`
`"Kill her...!!!"`
`Without missing by a millimeter, the gold sewing thread shot through Beato's heart...`
`That intense pain was worse than all of the pain before that put together.`
`Beato finally remembered the actual feeling of dying, which she had forgotten over the course of a thousand years...`
`But......she couldn't die.`
` She must not die.`
`If she died, it would mean handing over the two in the parlor to the cruel witch.`
`So she definitely couldn't die.`
`She resolutely...refused to die...!`
`"......New Beatrice, `
`...I have a request.`
` ......The lover's meeting between the two in the parlor will not last long.`
` ......In the amount of time an hourglass can measure, Kanon will probably vanish into the Land of the Dead.`
` ...Would you please allow them at least that much time...?"`
`"No waay.`
` Isn't tearing apart two who love each other fun?`
` You said it yourself.`
` So I want to try it!"`
`"...*cackle*cackle*...`
` In that case, I mustn't allow you that pleasure...`
` *cackle*cackle* Yes, it can be fun, tearing apart lovers."`
`"Really?`
` I'm sure it is fun.`
` So don't get in my way!!`
` Sew more!`
` Sew, sew, sew!!"`
`"Nihi!`
` 410, Understoood!!"`
`The merciless gold sewing needle sewed the gold thread through Beato's heart over and over again.`
`...However, no matter how much it tightened, that heart did not stop...`
`"Nng, ...aaaaahhh, ...this isn't nearly enough...`
` I won't die by something like this...!!"`
`"What are you doing?`
` Make this old hag shut up.`
` Kill her quickly!"`
`"...W-We're killing her...!!`
` Even though we've sewn her heart in place several times,`
` ...this person's heart...w-won't stop...!!"`
`"...Are you...immortal?"`
`"Of course not.`
` ...I've handed the endless over to you.`
` My heart will not beat many more times."`
`"...However, if by making it beat just once more, I can give the two in this room a bit more time, `
`...I'll continue that resistance for all eternity!!"`
`"Sew!!`
` Keep sewing until her heart stops moving!!"`
`"Guuh, guooooh, gwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!"`
`"...Wh-Why doesn't she die?!`
` It's impossible...!!"`
`"Why...isn't her heart stopping...`
`even though it's been sewn in place?!"`
`"Who cares, we'll make the heart explode from the inside nyeh...!`
` How pitiful, and you could've died cleanly if you hadn't resisted us!!"`
`As they said that, even though the gold needle and thread made round trips over and over again, Beato still didn't die...`
`The cruel witch eventually grew pale at how bizarre that was.`
`"......What in the world...are you...?"`
`"...*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` ...You probably cannot understand.`
` ...Even I didn't understand.`
` ...And yet,`
` ...somehow or another, it seems that this is true magic.`
`'!s1`
`...I have now...`
`become it.`
` ...I have become...`
`a true witch!!"`
`"Fixing Explosion Center in Heart Interior.`
` Fuse Preparations Ready!"`
`"Explode!!!"`
`There was a terrible sound......and gold leaf was scattered around the area, along with a cloud of gold butterflies.`
`Beato's chest had opened wide from the inside, `
`...and from that, gold butterflies and gold leaf poured out, staining the surrounding area gold...`
`Then, Beato's flesh crumpled.`
`Like a puppet whose strings had been cut, ...she crouched down...and crumpled.`
`...However, a gold heart tied by gold threads floated in the air...and continued to beat...`
`"......Wh-What the......eeeeeek..."`
`"M-Monster, ...eeeeeeeeep...!"`
`When the Chiester Sisters saw that, they fell on their butts in shock.`
`...Somehow, even though Beato had become nothing more than a heart, it still kept beating, `
`continuing to protect the barrier to the parlor.`
`...It was an immeasurably vast magical power.`
`...Impossible to measure.`
` In other words, endless.`
`"......I-I'm the Endless Witch, right...?`
` ......Why is this old hag...still alive...after all this...?!!`
` Chiester Sisters!!`
` Smash that heart!!`
` Quickly!!"`
`"I-It's impossible, my apologies!`
` We can't do it!!"`
`"......Indeed, it probably will be impossible.`
` No number of people could crush that heart.`
` ...And certainly not the soldiers who serve under His Highness the Dragon King."`
`"In that case,`
` an Endless Witch like me should be able to crush it, right?`
` My power is that of a god!!"`
`"I am afraid to say...`
`that your power cannot`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` leave a single wound on the Endless of ~ib~Beatrice-sama~ib~."`
`"...Just what...do you mean by that...?"`
`"Just as there can be no light without knowledge of shadows,`
` ...there can be no infinite without knowledge of the finite.`
` ......Before Milady Beatrice's true endless power, your frail magic is quite, quite lacking."`
`"What is......that...`
`...aah-"`
`The cruel witch was surprised and stepped back.`
`It was thinner than a lace curtain...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`...no, ~ib~Beatrice~ib~'s form was still standing there.`
`Even after being laid bare so tragically like this, ...she refused to let evil through that door.`
`At that time, ...a shadow just as thin as Beatrice stood behind her.`
`It was Kanon.`
`"......Beatrice-sama,`
` ...thank you very much.`
` ...I won't forget what you've done for us."`
`"...Hmph.`
` ...I'll hear those words of yours once the number of my blessings has surpassed the number of grievances I have caused.`
` ...Was that long enough?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Truly, thank you very much.`
` ...And Beatrice-sama, `
`...you have also done enough.`
` ...Please, `
`...be at peace..."`
`"...Is that so?`
` ...Is this...enough...?`
` ......Ha, ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*..."`
`"What's going on...?`
` ...Why are you guys calling that old hag Beatrice?!`
` Beatrice is my name, right?!`
` It's got to be, since I'm the new Golden Witch and Endless Witch, right?!"`
`"......How rude.`
` How dare you claim Beatrice-sama's name."`
`"I am afraid to say...`
`that the name of Beatrice-sama belongs to the one crowned as the Endless Witch.`
` Right now, you are the Predecessor.`
` ...Pukkukukukuku."`
`"What...did you say...?"`
`"......Farewell, Kanon.`
` ...I'm sure I'll see you soon enough.`
` In a new nightmare."`
`"......In the nightmare of a new night, I will once again be your companion, Beatrice-sama...`
` ...With that, ...if you would excuse me..."`
`Kanon's form grew faint, ...and he disappeared into thin air.`
`After watching him go, ...Beatrice's form also grew faint, ...and before disappearing, it slumped over onto the floor.`
`Then, ...there was a *splat*.`
`The golden heart that had been floating in midair...lost its sparkle, became bloodstained flesh, and fell to the ground.`
`...How frail it was.`
`It was ragged and full of holes.`
`...But until a moment ago, it had sparkled so much, had continued to beat so forcefully.`
`That heart still just barely managed to beat.`
`...However, it was only a matter of time before it stopped.`
`Beatrice, whose form had become fragile and faint like incense smoke, lay on the floor,`
` ...steadily watching her own heart...`
`There, the cruel witch could be seen...`
`"...Wh-What do you mean, endless...?`
` Aren't you actually collapsed in a heap right there?!`
` How can there be a finite infinity? ...That's a contradiction, it couldn't exist!`
` This is the limit of your magic!`
` The endless is better than the finite!!"`
`"............"`
`Beatrice no longer even had the will to respond.`
`...No, on the contrary, it was doubtful that the words of the cruel witch even reached her ears...`
`"If you're a real Endless Witch, try standing up!!`
` How's it going?`
` You can't stand, can you?!`
` Why do you think you can't stand?!`
` It's because you aren't the Endless Witch!!"`
`The cruel witch poked Beatrice's heart with her fingernail.`
`Beatrice had no words with which to respond to that provocation.`
`...However, ...instead of words, she returned a single expression.`
`...It felt humiliating only to the cruel witch.`
`Because she had gently curved her mouth...and smiled.`
`...Footsteps were approaching that place.`
`There was no way she had misheard it.`
` ...That rough squeaking of heels was the sound of Battler's footsteps...`
`"......Battler, is it......?`
` ......Ha, ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*...`
` ...After talking so tough, ...I ended up like this..."`
`".................."`
`"......I've been trying to become...`
`...the true witch you talked about...`
`...in my own way..."`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...I was watching."`
`'!s1`
`...have I...`
`...been able to become...`
`...a witch...?`
` ...Have I earned...`
`...the right to become your opponent...?"`
`"It's useless."`
`Battler said it unbelievably bluntly.`
`As Beatrice breathed painfully, she saw this and sneered at herself, as though she should have expected it.`
`"......Ha, ...*cackle*...`
` ...I see.`
` ...Yes, the road to becoming a true witch will be much, much longer than this..."`
`"...However, ...I will not surrender...`
` ...Just like you never surrendered to my torture, `
`......I will definitely...become a true witch...`
`and be...accepted as your opponent..."`
`"Yeah, it's useless.`
` It's all useless.`
` You aren't my opponent."`
`The cruel witch raised her foot high...`
`...Below it was Beatrice's frail heart.`
`"Die, you old hag!!`
` Let's see how endless you are when you've been crushed to a pulp!!`
` I'm the witch!`
` I am the Golden Witch, Beatrice!!!`
` Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieee!!"`
`'!s0`
`"Wh-What...`
`...is this...?`
` ...Wh-Where is this...?"`
`"Get in your seat.`
` Beato isn't my opponent.`
` ......You are."`
`"...B-Battler...?!`
` What kind of magic is this?!`
` Who cares, it doesn't matter!!`
` Chiester Sisters!!"`
`"45, understood, attacking everywhere!!"`
`"410, understood. Die, Battler!!"`
`The Chiester Sisters each readied their own golden bows and fired golden arrows.`
`The two only pulled the bowstring together when using precision guidance.`
`If they were fighting against an enemy before their eyes, they fired their bows at the same time.`
`And their might did not suffer in the slightest.`
`"Wha, ......i-i-it was deflected?!?!`
` There's no barrier, it was deflected by resistance alone...`
` Uh, 45, Target Analysis!!"`
`"45, understood...`
` ......Huh, ...whaaaat...?!`
` D-Did I...break down?`
` Am I insane...?`
` A-Anti-Magic Resistance Power, Endless Nine...`
` E-Even mythical-class magical attacks won't be effective against the target!!"`
`Golden bow warheads could penetrate any magical armor through reciprocal corrosion.`
`When one tried to block them with anti-magic resistance power, even eight digits were not sufficient to prevent their penetration.`
`...By the way, even famous gods that appear in myths rarely reach as high as nine digits.`
`For that reason, nine digits were enough to measure pretty much all sensible values.`
`...Battler had buried all 9 of those digits with nines...`
`"...How foolish.`
` When Battler-sama gets serious, magical arrows and the like aren't enough to even make his hair tremble."`
`The Chiester Sisters dropped their golden bows in shock...`
`...To Battler himself, it was as though a pair of dragonflies had flown past his shoulder.`
`"......What are you doing?`
` Is that some kind of game?"`
`"...Eeeeeeek, `
`...m-monster..."`
`"Stay back, small fries!!`
` Get in your seat, fake witch!!`
` I'll tear off that mask of yours!!!"`
`""E-Eeeeeeeeeeeeeek!!""`
`The Chiester Sisters couldn't hide their fear at Battler's ferocity, and they backed up as though they'd been struck.`
`Beatrice watched this scene in shock...`
`"...B-Battler, `
`...what...is this supposed to be...?"`
`"Just like you see.`
` You aren't my opponent.`
` She is!!`
` That impostor over there, who's using your name!!!"`
`"Ack...!"`
`"...I'm fighting against a witch.`
` ...I face off against an opponent who claims to be a witch, and I deny witches by defeating them.`
` ...I've seen more than enough of your arrogance."`
`Then, Battler's eyes grew as sharp as blades as he stared down the cruel witch.`
`"...What are you calling magic?`
` What are you calling witches?!`
` You're no witch!!`
` I'll rip that mask off and tear it to shreds!!`
` Virgilia, get ready to fight!!"`
`"Understood.`
` Preparations are complete, so go whenever you're ready.`
` ...Beatrice,`
` stay back and rest."`
`"I-Indeed..."`
`Beato looked at Battler timidly.`
`...She still hadn't been acknowledged as his opponent.`
`Was she qualified to watch the game board from the sidelines...?`
`"Beato, stay back and watch!!`
` I'll tear it off!!`
` I'll thoroughly dismantle this fake witch!!`
` I won't let someone like this call themselves a witch!!`
` You protected the honor of true witches!"`
`"I-I, umm..."`
`"You don't need to say anything.`
` On your behalf, I'll teach her that the name of the Golden Witch definitely isn't that cheap!!"`
`"......B-Battler..."`
`"Those are the general rules."`
`"......Thank you, Ronove.`
` I get most of the rules now.`
` ...I see.`
` You can't win with magic, so you came to face off with me in a world where victory is decided by something other than magic."`
`"...Foolish people.`
` Do you really think you can win against me with twisted logic?!"`
`"Yeah, I do.`
` I'll crush all of your twisted logic, Aunt Eva!!"`
`"I-I am not Eva...!!`
` That is the name of the old shell I shed.`
` I am a true witch, born inside of her...!!"`
`"Don't try to trick me! Your true form isn't a witch or anything like it, but a flesh and blood human.`
` The human culprit, Ushiromiya Eva!!!`
` Virgilia, reconstruct the second twilight!!"`
`"Understood.`
` On the second twilight, Rosa and Maria were killed in the rose garden.`
` We begin by applying the 'Eva Culprit Theory' for that case."`
`"Huuh?`
` Ridiculous!`
` Come, arise, try to remember!`
` What form did Ushiromiya Hideyoshi have?!!"`
`"Whaat?`
` What's this supposed to be?"`
`"...It's a summoning of the dead.`
` A witch can easily bring even the dead up to the stand for testimony..."`
`On the opposing side, a transparent Uncle Hideyoshi was summoned.`
`...Talk about convenient.`
`He looked as though he couldn't see what was going on here, almost like a person on the other side of the TV.`
`"Witness summons.`
` Ushiromiya Hideyoshi's testimony.`
` Come, Hideyoshi, speak...!"`
`"...I was taking care of Eva in our room the whole time.`
` Of course, Eva didn't leave the room."`
`"Aunt Eva.`
` Around here, testimony that isn't red isn't worth crap.`
` I demand that he repeats it again in red!!"`
`"Oh yeah, that's right.`
` Sure, say it in red!"`
`"#ff0000I was in the room the whole time#ffffff.`
` #ff0000Both before and after the time of the crime#ffffff."`
`"See, look.`
` This makes it impossible for Eva to be the culprit, right?!`
` How will you counter this?"`
`"Ridiculous.`
` That move's so lame, I could yawn.`
` ...Beato never used such childish tricks, not even once."`
`"......Battler..."`
`"Repeat it!!`
` 'Aunt Eva was also in the room for the entire time before and after the crime'!!`
` Uncle Hideyoshi was just there to create an alibi.`
` You made him stay in the room and stealthily snuck out.`
` ...If that isn't true, this guy should be able to say so in red!!!"`
`"I-I refuse to repeat it...!`
` Hideyoshi's evidence is sufficient!!`
` There's no need for me to repeat that, right?!"`
`"...She has refused.`
` You need show no mercy.`
` This is check."`
`"Yeah, I'll take it. This opponent's slow!!`
` Check!!`
` Maybe Uncle Hideyoshi didn't leave the room the whole time.`
` But saying he was taking care of you the whole time...is a bright-red lie!"`
`"Therefore, no alibi exists for you!!`
` You had a chance to slip out of the room and kill Aunt Rosa and Maria!`
` If you think you can dodge that, try proclaiming in red that 'Aunt Eva didn't take a step outside of her room'!!`
` You can't, right?`
` Checkmate!!!"`
`"...Wh-What the hell...?!`
` ...I-I don't get it...!!"`
`"Sorry, Aunt Eva.`
` ...Even if you aren't used to the rules, beating your opponent down with all your strength is how this game is played.`
` ...Right, Beato?!"`
`"I-Indeed..."`
`"The witch side resigns.`
` Let us continue on to the next game.`
` Next is the fourth through sixth twilights."`
`It seemed that the witch still didn't understand how to make a winning move, and she lost her composure in irritation.`
`She was probably also angry that a shot had been taken at her while she still didn't get what was going on.`
`...However, I won't go easy on her at all.`
`Just like she didn't go easy on the victims at all, I won't go easy on her...!!`
`"Virgilia, next crime!`
` Let's reconstruct the case with Dad and the rest!!"`
`"Understood.`
` Three people: Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi, went to the mansion and were killed there."`
`"My move won't change.`
` Aunt Eva, you are the culprit!!`
` This time, you don't even have an alibi from Uncle Hideyoshi!!`
` You claim that you were sleeping in that room all by yourself.`
` But that's not true!!`
` If you can proclaim it in red, just try it!!"`
`"...I refuse.`
` ...So tell me!`
` Eva is just a woman.`
` And the people who died were three adults with two guns, right?`
` How did she kill them all by herself?`
` How did she do it with those stakes as weapons?`
` Like everyone keeps asking, how is this stake-shooting device constructed?!"`
`"Explain that!!`
` Unless you can explain it, even if Eva doesn't have an alibi, `
`that doesn't mean that it was possible for her to commit the murders!"`
`'!s0`
` It's a 'Devil's Proof'!`
` Just because I can't explain it, that doesn't deny the existence of an unknown murder technique, or maybe an unknown weapon!!"`
`"In short!!`
` Even if I can't explain how the stake-shooting device is constructed, that doesn't prove that it doesn't exist!!"`
`"Wh-What the hell?!!`
` Does that ridiculousness even count?!"`
`"...Your 'Devil's Proof' is valid."`
`"Agreed.`
` It's a valid 'Devil's Proof'.`
` ...Battler-kun can claim that a stake-shooting device exists without bearing the responsibility of explaining how it is constructed.`
` The witch side cannot object to this move."`
`"...N-Not bad...`
` How pushy..."`
`"Heh!`
` Well, there's this ill-natured witch who trained me well.`
` This is check, okay?!`
` Try saying in red that Aunt Eva didn't take a step out of that room!!"`
`"That's right, you shouldn't be able to say it!`
` If you can't say it, it's over, checkmate!!"`
`"...Th-That's so irrational......!`
` This is...messed up...!"`
`"Those are the rules of this game.`
` ...How about some black tea first?`
` And some delicious cookies as well."`
`"I don't need all that!!`
` Ah, that pisses me off...!`
` So you fight like a coward just because you can't win with magic...!!"`
`"Don't get irritated.`
` Drink some black tea or something.`
` I'll take mine straight.`
` What about you, Beato?"`
`"I-I am fine...`
` ......More importantly, Battler, don't let your guard down.`
` Your opponent is only unfamiliar with the rules.`
` ...This will only really start once your opponent gets the gist of it..."`
`"But I'll crush her.`
` I'll thoroughly crush her.`
` Because she isn't a witch."`
`"If I accept her as a witch, ...all your stubbornness will count for nothing!`
` I don't care what kind of irrational argument or twisted logic I have to use, `
`I'll crush her with all my heart and soul!!"`
`Battler's side then stuck with the 'Eva Culprit Theory' to explain Krauss and Natsuhi, `
`the seventh and eighth twilights, in the exact same way.`
`At the time, there had been no one on the first floor except for Eva and the victims.`
`...As before, no one could establish an alibi for Eva.`
`Back then, Eva had claimed that they'd disappeared while she went to the bathroom, `
`but there was nothing to support that, and the witch side couldn't repeat it in red either.`
`Using the same style of argument as that question regarding the stake shooting machine, `
`the witch side asked once more how Eva could have strangled both of them at the same time all by herself, `
`but of course, Battler splendidly counterattacked by refusing to explain because of the 'Devil's Proof'.`
`Under the storm and stress of Battler's spirit, the witch side was completely swallowed up,`
` having to resign three times during the short period of time she had to grasp the rules...`
`"......Kuhhihihihihyahhyahhhya...`
` Hah, I see!`
` I'm finally starting to get the knack of it.`
` I won't let you have things your own way any more!`
` This time, let me take the initiative.`
` Ronove, reconstruct the fourth through the sixth twilights!`
` Pick out Ushiromiya Kyrie!`
` ...For now, let me return to the murders of Rudolf, Kyrie and Hideyoshi during the fourth through sixth twilights."`
`"...Wh-What is she thinking?`
` Why would she return once more to a situation where she's lost?"`
`"I see...`
` ...This is an unusual attack, and one you do not use.`
` Be careful."`
`"At the time, the survivors were barricaded in the guesthouse.`
` They didn't have food, but out of concern for their safety, they were at least prepared to go without eating until the next day.`
` ...However, in the end, three of them went out for food."`
`"......That's right.`
` In the end, three people went outside to get food."`
`"It's a pain, so I'll add in some red and say it.`
` #ff0000Kyrie didn't think that they needed food#ffffff.`
` Since going without food for about a day wouldn't kill them, `
`#ff0000she claimed that they should not leave the guesthouse#ffffff.`
` And yet, she herself`
` #ff0000suggested that they leave the guesthouse to get food#ffffff.`
` ......Isn't that a contradiction?"`
`"Yes, a spectacular contradiction.`
` A contradiction exists in Kyrie's pattern of behavior."`
`"That contradiction `
`'was created by me with magic'!`
` In other words, I controlled Kyrie using magic and made her say that to lure the sacrifices outside!!"`
`"R-Ridiculous!`
` There's no way that kind of magic exists!!"`
`"It's a 'Devil's Proof', right?!`
` Just because you don't know about that magic doesn't deny its existence!`
` And I don't bear the responsibility of acting out that magic for you.`
` And yet, you have even less room to counter this argument!!`
` ......*giggle*giggle*!`
`"Yes.`
` It is truly a spectacular move.`
` ...Battler-sama, your response, if you please."`
`"That's a weird strategy she's taking.`
` ...So just what is this?"`
`"She has placed a piece attacking Ushiromiya Kyrie's pattern of behavior.`
` ...As has already been explained,`
` Kyrie's pattern of behavior had her saying that they should not go outside or head to the mansion in order to get food.`
` And yet, she herself took the initiative, `
`taking the contradictory action of going out to get food.`
` Unless you can explain this contradiction, she will use this violent move to claim that magic was the cause."`
`"...Well, that's probably what Kyrie-san thought in the beginning.`
` But she probably...uh...thought through a few things midway, `
`then changed her mind and decided that food really was necessary...`
` It'd be bad if, when things got tough, we were so hungry that we had no energy, ...and, well..."`
`"...She is claiming that this change of heart was due to magic.`
` In short, ...while it might be extremely difficult, you must explain the reason for Kyrie's change of heart."`
`"...Wh-What are you saying...?`
` ...You're talking about the inside of Kyrie-san's head, right...?`
` Can I also summon Kyrie-san's ghost and question her?!`
` Beato!`
` Can't you call Kyrie-san here or something?!"`
`"She cannot.`
` That is a move permitted only to the witch side."`
`"...S-Sorry..."`
`"...Aaaaaaahhh, fuck!!`
` She was probably...umm...thinking of us kids and...umm...on the whole, thought that food was necessary and..."`
`"You must present your claim through objective means.`
` ...You'll need concrete proof that Kyrie changed her mind and decided that food really was necessary for some specific reason.`
` ...For example, if someone heard her say that, or if it was written down somewhere."`
`"Too bad, `
`#ff0000the reason she changed her mind was not passed on to anyone, nor was it written down#ffffff!`
` Therefore, you can only speculate as to what was inside Kyrie's mind!`
` So it's impossible to explain!!`
` You don't have a single counter to my move!`
` Isn't it your turn to resign now, Battler-kuuun...?!?!"`
`"...It is possible to hypothesize endlessly as to the reason behind her change of heart.`
` And, it is impossible to crush all of those endless possibilities."`
`"A detestably spectacular move.`
` ......If Battler-sama were to have a method of countering, ...it could probably only be that move."`
`"...Wh-What move is that...?"`
`"...Well,`
` I wonder what kind of move it could be.`
` I have the feeling that it was Milady's specialty, but I cannot remember."`
`".........Nnggg...`
` Quit being stingy and tell me...!"`
`"Beatrice,`
` no answers will be given to those who stop thinking for themselves.`
` ...Think.`
` Think in your own way!"`
`"Why don't you resign right now?`
` And I'll corner you even more with red.`
` #ff0000Until the last instant before she died, Kyrie's behavior pattern of 'not going to get food = not going to the mansion' was maintained#ffffff!`
` And yet, she took the initiative and headed towards the mansion.`
` She was pushing a cart, ready to carry food.`
` Why that contradiction?"`
`"...`
`Because I controlled her with magic!!!`
` This is proof that my magic exists, and that I am a witch!!"`
`"......Shut the hell up...!!`
` A-Are you saying that she never even changed her mind?!`
` ...That the whole time until she died, Kyrie-san thought 'we don't need food', and 'we won't go to the mansion'?`
` Then why did she step forward herself and say that they should go to get food, and go to the mansion...?!!"`
`"Are you saying that Kyrie-san was being controlled with magic?!`
` That's stupid...!!`
` How...how should I break through this magic?!"`
`"...If only Kyrie were here, and just told us the reason behind her change of heart...`
` No, I've already been told in red that she never even changed her mind...!`
` What should I do...?!!`
` There's no move that the human side can counter with!!"`
`"The more I learn about this game, the more advantageous the rules seem for the witch, right?`
` Even if I lose in a lot of areas, if I can win in just one, that alone can display the existence of a witch."`
`"...In other words, Battler-kun has no way of denying witches other than a complete victory!`
` How truly funny that even though you thought you could corner me and call me Eva, `
`it's all been spun around by nothing more than the inside of your respected Kyrie-san's head, right?!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ahhahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Just do it, resign!!`
` If only you'd just accept it!`
` If only you'd just lose!"`
`"......Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiit...`
` It's impossible for a human to prove...`
` I can't do anything but guess at what the dead were thinking when they acted.`
` Furthermore, I can't deny the magic based on conjecture alone.`
` ...To break through it, I need objective proof as to why Kyrie-san had a change of heart..."`
`"...But damn it, `
`it's been said in red that no proof exists as to why she changed her mind and wanted food...`
` ...What should I do, damn it, damn it...!!!"`
`"......Battler-sama,`
` is this...your resignation?"`
`"............Nggg...!`
` 'Not going to get food = not going to the mansion'.`
` But then how should I understand Kyrie-san's thoughts, which actually do contradict each other...?!"`
`"You can't understand!!`
` It's impossible to understand, and impossible to interpret!!`
` That darkness is all of the witch!`
` Come on, it's useless to think, so quit, okay?!`
` You just can't deny witches!`
` After all, I exist right here."`
`"I am the Golden Witch!!`
` I stole that name from the former witch over there!!`
` You can't deny that I am Beatrice!!!"`
`"Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit...!!!`
` You have no right to use that name...!`
` ...And yet, ...I can't think of a move to deny it......!!!"`
`Battler could no longer counter this witch, who was laughing insanely in triumph...`
`He didn't want to give up, but no move appeared.`
`He ground his teeth, making fists with both hands.`
`...But even so, he couldn't think of a brilliant counterattack...!`
`"Battler-sama,`
` your time limit is over, so will you resign...?"`
`'!s0`
`"......The human side has no move in response.`
` It will resi`
`"Wait!`
` ...Th-There is...a counter."`
`"Wh-What did you say...?"`
`"Huh?!`
` What kind of move could possibly exist, Predecessor-sama?!`
` Won't you tell me what kind of move could deny this magic of Beatrice's?`
` You can't, it's impossible!!"`
`"...If the proposition that 'not going to get food = not going to the mansion' cannot be explained by itself, `
`...I will explain it with the contrapositive.`
` In short, you can also explain it with 'she still went to the mansion = she had a goal other than food'."`
`"...Th-This is less my specialty, 'Hempel's Raven', ...than it is Battler's specialty, 'chessboard thinking'.`
` ...If it was impossible for Kyrie to have gone to the mansion with food as a goal, `
`then we can only explain it by saying she had another reason that got her to go outside despite that.`
` In other words, if we can prove that she had such a goal, we can defeat this magic...!"`
`"I-I see...`
` So, she didn't go to the mansion with food as a goal, but she had a different goal,`
` and she said she wanted to go and get food in order to disguise her real goal..."`
`"...T-True enough, it might be possible to find an explanation that way.`
` ...But...how?!"`
`"Teacher, reconstruct the scene of Kyrie's death...!`
` We cannot summon a ghost, but inspecting the corpse ought to be a right allowed to the human side..."`
`"Yes, there is no problem.`
` I shall reconstruct the scene where Ushiromiya Kyrie died.`
` We cannot call Kyrie's ghost here, `
`but by finding out what Kyrie left behind, we may be able to use that as a weapon."`
`"Ha, hahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Fine, search as much as you want!!`
` There's no way you'll learn anything!`
` I just said it in red a short while ago.`
` #ff0000Kyrie did not leave anything written down#ffffff!`
` No matter what you find, how could you possibly figure anything out?!!"`
`"......We may find nothing...`
` ...But, ...Battler is grinding his teeth, fighting to think of a move to break through you.`
` ......This is all that I can do..."`
`Beatrice landed on her feet in the reconstructed hall,`
` approached Kyrie's corpse, and wandered around, observing.`
`"I-I am completely clueless when it comes to fighting on the Human side...`
` ......We need to find evidence, right...?`
` ...Then what should I search for?"`
`"The Great Lady Beatrice is getting down on her knees and crawling around!`
` And she's even indecently searching a corpse?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle* That look suits you...!!"`
`"...Say whatever you wish...`
` ...I cannot do any more than this...`
` ...I care not how I am despised...`
` ......However, I cannot throw Battler away, as he is fighting for my honor...`
` ...Even if I must crawl on the ground and search through dead flesh, `
`...I must answer to that responsibility..."`
`Bathed in the witch's sneers, Beato searched through Kyrie's corpse.`
`...She fished through the pockets, taking what was inside out and laying it on the floor...`
`Laid on the floor...`
`was a handkerchief,`
` tissue,`
` a key to her house,`
` the stub of a boat ticket,`
` a lighter,`
` a cigarette butt,`
` and a single hundred yen coin...`
`There was no special, suspicious object...`
`Although Beato was down on all fours and being sneered at, that was all she could find.`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` What's with that seedy looking trash?!`
` How do you think you can break my magic with that stuff?!`
` Worthless, worthless, are you a moron?!!`
` How can you be so lame, and right after you cut in between us, talking so tough?!`
` Aaah, how pathetic, how embarrassing!!`
` If only you'd just give up and die!"`
`The witch fell over laughing, lambasting Beato.`
`...Beato hung her head, trying to withstand this shame.`
`"...Milady,`
` are you finished with your inspection?"`
`"......I-Indeed...`
` ...I will not find any more than this..."`
`"Can you make any counter from this evidence?`
` If not, then the human side must resign."`
`"............Nnnnn......"`
`"Obviously, you don't have any room to argue back!!`
` I am a witch.`
` You cannot break through my magic!!`
` You're no longer anything but a former witch.`
` A loser who isn't even allowed to take the name Beatrice anymore!!`
` Come on, pile up as much trash and rubbish as you like, and just try to break my magic!!"`
`"...You can't, right?`
` You can't, can you?`
` Kuhhihihihihi, and why's that?`
` It's because I'm a witch.`
` ...It's because you're just a loser without a name!!`
` Kuhhihhyahhyahhyahhyahhyah!!!"`
`"......Something, ......something should be here...`
` ......I won't lose heart...`
` ...I will not lose heart...`
` No matter how much I am sneered at, ...Battler is fighting for my honor, `
`...so for the sake of his honor, ...I must not lose heart......"`
`As Beato held back tears at the words of humiliation she was being showered with,`
` she tried to find if Kyrie was holding something else, ...to find something that could save Battler from his plight, `
`...searching earnestly.`
`...However, nothing more came up...`
`"......Damn it...`
` ...Please, ...Ushiromiya Kyrie...`
` You must save your son from his plight... `
` ......Please, ...after death, lend me power for his sake..."`
`However, Kyrie's body did not answer.`
`...It was only natural that a corpse would remain silent.`
`No dead person existed that would answer Beato, who had lost the Endless Magic...`
`"It's pointless, pointless, pointleeess.`
` Toying with the dead is a privilege only for witches.`
` For you, who is neither a witch nor even a Human, no one exists who will lend a hand!!"`
`"You'll be alone for all eternity!!`
` You have no witch or Human allies, and no one will save you!!`
` If that's frustrating, why don't you cry?!`
` If only you'd just apologize, saying 'I'm sorry I'm so useless'?!`
` Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"......Sorry, ...Battler......`
` ...I...couldn't help you...at all..."`
`"............`
`...No, that's enough.`
` ...Thanks, Beato.`
` I won't waste your efforts..."`
`"I-I don't need consoling...!`
` Just how could you possibly argue back with this pile of rubbish...?!!`
` Just how could you possibly strike back with this rubbish I scraped together while she sneered at me...?!"`
`In front of Beato, who was still crawling on all fours and hitting the pile of objects Kyrie had left behind with her fist, Battler also crouched.`
`And, ...after patting her on the shoulder in thanks, `
`...he moved that hand to the ground, picked up the cigarette butt, and held it up over his head.`
`"......What are you trying to say with that trash...?"`
`"Kyrie-san doesn't smoke."`
`But Kyrie also had a lighter on her.`
`True, she didn't have an actual box of cigarettes, `
`but at a glance, it naturally looked as though Kyrie had a smoking habit...`
`"...Dad smoked, but Kyrie didn't.`
` ...But she did walk around with just a lighter to light Dad's cigarettes."`
`"Ha!`
` So what?`
` If the husband smoked, then even if the wife didn't, it wouldn't be strange for her to be holding a cigarette.`
` Maybe she just picked up the cigarette butt of her husband, who had bad smoking manners?`
` What are you trying to say?`
` What does this have to do with my magic?`
` Nothing at all!!!"`
`"I'll say more.`
` ...This is a different brand of cigarette than what Dad smokes.`
` ...Sorry, Beato.`
` Could you look in the pockets of Dad's corpse too?"`
`"......I-Indeed.`
` ...You mean this...?"`
`"...Checking the brand.`
` The brand is different from the cigarette butt.`
` ...The cigarette butt Kyrie is holding is not of the same brand that Rudolf smokes."`
`"And so what?`
` Maybe Kyrie is just a good girl who likes things to be clean, so she couldn't leave a fallen cigarette butt alone and picked it up?`
` I wouldn't though!!"`
`"...Beato, sorry, but one more time please.`
` ...Uncle Hideyoshi's pockets.`
` ......In this family, only Dad and Hideyoshi smoke cigarettes."`
`"...I-It's here...!`
` Is this it...?`
`Beato found a cigarette box in Hideyoshi's pocket, took a single one out, and held it up.`
`"...Checking the brand.`
` We acknowledge that the cigarette butt is of the same brand that Hideyoshi smokes."`
`"A-And so what?!!`
` How can you break my magic because you found Hideyoshi's cigarette butt in Kyrie's pocket?!!"`
`"......That's right.`
` This cigarette butt is a message from Kyrie-san.`
` No, ...this cigarette butt itself is the reason that Kyrie-san left the guesthouse.`
` Beato, thank you.`
` ...If you hadn't found this, I would've given up here."`
`"......Virgilia!!`
` Reconstruct the situation!`
` The guesthouse after it came to light that Aunt Rosa and Maria had been killed on the second twilight!!"`
`"Understood.`
` Reconstructing now.`
` ...After Rosa and Maria's deaths, the remaining survivors rechecked all of the doors and windows in the mansion.`
` They constructed a barricade.`
` They re-confirmed that their defenses were solid."`
`"There's nothing suspicious about that at all.`
` What are you trying to say?`
` Why are you bringing up the second twilight when we're talking about the fourth twilight and after...?!"`
`"Dad carried a portable cigarette butt holder with him.`
` I'm finally starting to see why Kyrie-san went out of her way to put a cigarette butt in her own pocket."`
`"......It was because that cigarette butt meant something.`
` That cigarette butt was itself a message left by Kyrie-san for us...!!"`
`"Th-Then let's hear it!!`
` How do you plan to deny me `
`with that single cigarette butt?!!"`
`"...As we've heard,`
` after the second twilight, an inspection was done of all the rooms in the guesthouse.`
` ......At that time, Kyrie-san found something that shouldn't exist, in a place where it shouldn't be."`
`"...S-Something that shouldn't exist...?`
` ...What do you mean by that?"`
`"It's this.`
` This cigarette butt.`
` This was set in the ashtray of the guest room that Uncle Hideyoshi was in."`
`"Whaah?!?!`
` What's wrong with there being a cigarette butt in an ashtray?!!`
` Are you sure there isn't something wrong with your head?!"`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, but_3e1646:`
`"However, there was a cigarette butt in the ashtray.`
` When she saw that, Kyrie-san noticed immediately.`
` ...Uncle Hideyoshi was lying.`
` She realized that Aunt Eva hadn't really been sleeping,`
` ...and that she'd snuck out of the room!!"`
`"Repeat it!!`
` 'This cigarette butt was crushed out in the ashtray of the room where Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi were resting!'"`
`"......I-I refuse...!"`
`"I've finally got it......`
` Thank you, Beato."`
`'!s1`
`Was I...`
`...of some...`
`use...?"`
`"Yeah, you were!!`
` Tear it, we'll tear the mask off of the fake witch!!!"`
`From that cigarette butt, Kyrie realized that Hideyoshi was creating an alibi for Eva's sake.`
`Hideyoshi had been tasked with watching over the room to create an alibi,`
` ...and during that time, he was unable to withstand the tension and smoked.`
`Then, Kyrie had confessed that to Rudolf.`
`She confessed that there was a good chance Eva was the culprit, and Hideyoshi was an accomplice.`
`"......Next, Kyrie-san proposed that they go to get food.`
` She then asked Uncle Hideyoshi to lend a hand!!`
` This could only mean one thing."`
`"Kyrie-san planned to isolate Uncle Hideyoshi and question him about the truth!!"`
`"Your 'Hempel's Raven' is valid.`
` Unless the witch side counters this move, the existence of the magic that supposedly controlled Kyrie has been denied."`
`"Wh-What did you saaaaaaaaaaaayy?!?!`
` I-I deny it, anyway, I deny it...!!`
` It wasn't me, noooo!`
` It wasn't Ushiromiya Eva, Eva was sleeping in her room!!!"`
`"Then try saying it.`
` Yeah, you can't say it!`
` You can't say it this time either!!`
`'!s0`
`@:dwave_eng 0, but_3e1666:`
`'!s0`
` I'm the one who was attacking, right?!`
` Why am I the one being attacked now?!`
` When did offense and defense get reversed?!`
` I'm the one questioning you, right?!`
` The witch, me, so whyyyyyyyyyy!!!"`
`"Again!!!!`
` Repeat it!!`
` 'Ushiromiya Eva did not leave the room'!!`
`'!s1`
`it's checkmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate!!"`
`"Does the witch side have a move in response?"`
`"...There cannot be one.`
` There is no truth that can be accepted from a false witch dressed up with truths and falsehoods."`
`'!s0`
` You aren't the Golden Witch!`
` You're a human!`
` Ushiromiya Evaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`'!s0`
`The witch howled.`
`Her entire body was burned with the tremendous heat that denied her own magic and existence, and she let out a howl like a dragon...`
`Her body flickered repeatedly, `
`flashing as though Eva's figure and the witch's figure overlapped.`
`However, that yell was sucked into the flicker, ...making it return to the original form of the cruel witch.`
`"...*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ...kuhhihhahhahahahaha...`
` ...Sure.`
` ...If you want to call me Ushiromiya Eva, then go ahead and do that..."`
`"...That's right, I actually can't repulse all moves related to Ushiromiya Eva being the culprit.`
` ...I may have been dragged down from the position of Golden Witch, `
`...and you might call me Ushiromiya Eva now...`
` ...But you know what? That by itself doesn't mean that witches and magic have been denied!!`
` ...I'll teach you starting now...`
` I'll teach you that I am not Ushiromiya Eva, nor a Human, `
`...but a real witch...!!!`
` Take a look at this red truth!!"`
`When the witch clapped her hands, time advanced in the world of the game board.`
`Battler and Eva dashed to the front of the parlor, calling out Jessica's name.`
`...They were searching for Jessica because they had gone to the servant room, found Nanjo's corpse, and didn't know where Jessica was.`
`"......So, what's your point?`
` ...What are you trying to say?"`
`"...Y-You couldn't be...`
` ...Oh no..."`
`Beato went pale.`
`...In other words, the move the evil witch was about to make was bad enough to make even Beato go pale...`
`"This time, `
`...I'll give you a fatal move that you won't be able to talk yourself out of.`
` ...No, I'll make this move against all Humans who support you.`
` Listen carefully to my move."`
`"...St-Stop it, ...that move is......!"`
`"Beato, stay back...!!`
` I'll take it!`
` Come on, you fake witch!!"`
`"#ff0000After Jessica was injured, `
`Eva was constantly under Battler's supervision.`
` Battler is neither the culprit nor an accomplice.`
` By this, we can establish a perfect alibi for Eva#ffffff."`
`"...Wh-Whaat......?"`
`"I'll seal you,`
` and Humans as well, `
`...in a red barrier that most certainly cannot be escaped from.`
` Farewell, lowly Humans.`
` Sleep for all eternity in a absolute closed room of magic with no exits.`
` ...Come on, listen carefully.`
` Listen to the red truth."`
`#ff0000There are no more than 18 humans on this island#ffffff.`
`Throw away your foolish thoughts of mysterious people hiding and committing crimes.`
`...But if I say it that way, you might also suspect animal culprits.`
`I couldn't stand to hear some irrational theory about how an orangutan trained to commit murder wouldn't count as a human.`
`So, I'll change it like this.`
`#ff0000No life forms other than humans have any connection to this game#ffffff.`
`That's how it is.`
` Next, I'll explain the situation of all 18 people who exist on this island.`
`#ff0000Kinzo is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Krauss is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Natsuhi is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Hideyoshi is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000George is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Rudolf is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Kyrie is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Rosa is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Maria is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Genji is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Shannon is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Kanon is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Gohda is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Kumasawa is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Nanjo is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Those 15 are all dead#ffffff.`
`And.`
`#ff0000Battler is alive#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Eva is alive#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Jessica is alive#ffffff.`
`That's everyone, all 18 of them!`
`"Which means that when the last victim, Nanjo, died, `
`only three people, Battler, Eva, and Jessica, were alive, right?"`
`"......Wh-What did you say...?`
` ...D-Dammit, ...you don't mean......"`
`"#ff0000Eva was with you the whole time.`
` So committing a crime was impossible for her.`
` Of course, Battler-kun isn't the culprit.`
` He wasn't forging an alibi for her, and he took the possibility that she was the culprit into account, watching over her actions carefully.`
` No chance existed for her to do anything suspicious!`
` In short, at the time of the crime, only Nanjo and Jessica were in the servant room#ffffff."`
`"...And I know what you're thinking.`
` Your next move will be this, right?`
` There's also a chance that Jessica is the culprit!`
` But too bad, I'll slice it up in red before you try!!"`
`"#ff0000Ushiromiya Jessica has not committed murder#ffffff!`
` #ff0000She was not involved with Nanjo's murder#ffffff!!`
` #ff0000Her eyes were completely covered.`
` It'd be impossible for her to carry out a murder like that#ffffff!`
` And here's a bonus.`
` Neither Eva nor Battler killed Nanjo, nor were they involved#ffffff!!"`
`"W-Wait a second!!`
` That doesn't make sense!!`
` There were only three humans, then a murder occurs, ...and none of those three were involved?! That's insane!!"`
`"I'll state it clearly.`
` #ff0000The culprit who killed Nanjo was neither Battler nor Eva nor Jessica#ffffff!!`
` In other words, it wasn't one of the survivors.`
` Get iiit?"`
`"No, umm, ......th-that's right!`
` What about multiple personalities...?!`
` Just like how you were originally another personality of Aunt Eva's, `
`...let's say Jessica had another, witch-like personality,`
` which took the name of 'someone other than Jessica' and killed Doctor Nanjo...!!"`
`"Moron.`
` I've already said it in red.`
` #ff0000Jessica's eyes were completely covered, and murder was impossible for her#ffffff!`
` No matter what kind of personality she was possessed by, murder could not be carried out with her body!`
` I wonder if you'll be satisfied if I say it this way?`
` #ff0000No actions caused by Jessica's body had any relation to or influence on the murder of Nanjo#ffffff!`
` #ff0000This also applies to Battler and Eva#ffffff.`
` In other words, no matter how much you try to struggle and interpret it,`
` #ff0000neither Jessica nor Battler nor Eva is the culprit who killed Nanjo#ffffff!"`
`"Y-You've got to be kidding me!!!`
` I mean, everyone else is definitely dead, right?!!`
` Then...all that's left...is the 'Doctor Nanjo Suicide Theory', right?!`
` And the trap theory!`
` The culprit was already dead, but a trap that they had already prepared went off..."`
`"#ff0000Nanjo's death was a homicide#ffffff.`
` ...#ff0000Of course, it was with a direct method of murder, not a trap#ffffff.`
` #ff0000A weapon was readied, and he was killed with it from point-blank range in front of him!`
` The culprit appeared openly before Nanjo's eyes, and as they both looked at each other's faces, the culprit killed him#ffffff...!!"`
`"But wait!!`
` There are only three survivors!`
` You said in red that everyone else is dead!`
` You basically confirmed the life or death status of all 18 people.`
` Furthermore, the existence of a 19th person has already been denied in red...!!"`
`"In other words, no one can exist except the three survivors!!`
` And yet, a fourth person other than those three appeared before Doctor Nanjo!!`
` How could a person other than us appear and murder Doctor Nanjo when no 19th person exists?!?!`
` Insane!!`
` You're lying!!`
` You're lying with the red!!!"`
`"#ff0000The red only tells the truth#ffffff!!!`
` Isn't doubting that the same as betraying the honor of that witch who's behind you, shriveling up in fear of me and hiding behind your back?!"`
`"D-Damn it......!!!"`
`"Right now, `
`I'll state it clearly.`
` ...The one who appeared in front of Nanjo was me.`
` A witch.`
` ...The Golden Witch, who can't be explained away with the 18 humans!!"`
`"V-Virgilia!`
` Ronove...!!`
` Isn't there a contradiction in this situation?!`
` Is she really telling the truth with red?!"`
`"...Yes.`
` Her 'red truth' is valid."`
`"......What an...elaborate and precise cornering..."`
`"H-How should I make a move against her...?`
` Virgilia...!`
` Aren't there any moves...?!"`
`".........I...cannot think of anything..."`
`"...And you, Ronove?!"`
`"............`
`......My apologies.`
` ...However, in these last thousand years,`
` ...I have never seen...such an elaborately beautiful game board layout."`
`'!s1`
`......but it's beautiful......`
` ...What a...`
`beautiful...`
`checkmate made in red......"`
`The witch's teacher and the demon butler were both stunned, ...and an expression of ecstasy rose to their faces...`
`......Forget surrendering, `
`...they were impressed at this perfect checkmate, `
`...which simply had to be admired...`
`When people accept defeat from the bottom of their hearts...`
`...It gives rise to neither regrets nor humiliation.`
`...Nothing is born except feelings of respect...`
`I......no longer knew...what was what anymore.`
`There were absolutely no weak points in her red.`
`She had said in red that all of 15 people had died.`
`She had said in red that no people existed other than the 18.`
`In other words, no more than three people: me, Jessica, and Aunt Eva, existed.`
`And even though none of those three people were the culprit, Doctor Nanjo was killed.`
`And without a doubt, Doctor Nanjo's death was a homicide, he was murdered by 'that person' openly from in front of him...!`
`And she's saying that 'that person'...is a witch......?!!`

`"#ff0000A human, with their feet on the ground, held up a weapon and killed with it!`

` Oh, did you kneel...?`
` That's right, you're already starting to understand.`
` ...The Golden Witch does exist.`
` ......And that Golden Witch, Beatrice, is me...!!"`
`"Come on, praise me.`
` Now, praise the resurrection of a true witch.`
` Now, praise the resurrection of the Golden Witch, Beatrice!!`
` On the ninth twilight, the witch shall revive, and none shall be left alive...!!!"`
`"Daaamn iiiiiiiitt......`
` ...I don't...understand...!`
` After...being so thoroughly immobilized by the red,`
` ...I don't...have a clue anymore...!"`
`"...B-Battler...`
` D-Don't lose heart...`
` ...You and I...promised that we would fight each other again, right...?`
` Will you surrender here...?!`
` Will you disappear in a place like this before fighting with me again...?!"`
`"I don't want to break that promise...`
` ......However, ...I can't think of any move to deny her...!!`
` In the first place, ...this isn't even a puzzle!`
` Nothing exists outside the suspects, and all of the suspects are innocent!`
` I was told that they were innocent in red, right?!`
` And also that it was a real homicide, and that the culprit was human, and that they did appear before Doctor Nanjo's eyes and kill him!`
` I give up, ...there's nothing I can do...!!!"`
`"Please, Battler, don't give up, don't lose heart...!`
` ...If you stop thinking, it automatically becomes your loss.`
` ...I'm begging you, don't lose heart...`
` ...I'm also cheering you on, ...so don't lose...!"`
`"I can't think of anything anymore...!!`
` I find myself thinking she's gotta be a witch, who must've done it with magic, which makes all thinking pointless...!`
` It's useless, my head hurts, my brain's tired...`
` I'm starting to think that thinking's pointless, so I should just stop...!!"`
`"Battler, listen...`
` ......In the game of chess, both sides do all they can to make the other lose, so a single game takes a long period of time.`
` ...However, if one side throws away victory from the beginning and makes moves harmful to themselves, the game can end in the blink of an eye.`
` ...That is called a fool's mate."`
`A fool's mate is, simply put, a strange way of playing chess, in which the fastest methods of losing are considered.`
`...Opening the area in front of your own king and inviting the opponent's queen in.`
`Even though the average game time in chess is several hours, a game can be resolved in a scant four moves.`
`...In other words, if both sides try to win in a fight, they are compelled to take a painfully long period of time,`
` ...but if one side decides to lose, the game can be ended far too easily, at any time...`
`"...When the human side stops thinking, it hands the problem before its eyes over to the witch, `
`and even an apple falling from a tree can be immediately resolved as the work of magic."`
`"......It is the same for the witch's side.`
` ...Witches use the red truth.`
` ...By using that, they can explain the true form of magic with humans...and immediately lose."`
`"......You don't have to tell me that...`
` ...You're telling me to not stop thinking, right...?`
` However, `
`......how should I counterattack that person's perfect bright-red move...?`
` For me, `
`...for humans, `
`......it's no longer possible......"`
`'!s1`
`...impossible...?`
` ...Is it really...`
`...impossible for you, Battler...?`
` ...Please, ...don't lose heart......"`
`".........Sorry......`
` ...I've...`
`...reached my limit......"`
`Battler scratched at the floor, crying heavily.`
`...Beato watched that with a distressed face...`
`Then she stood up and spoke to the witch.`
`"......I will make a move as a counter to yours."`
`"Huh?`
` I wonder just how you plan to cut up this perfect checkmate.`
` How can this checkmate, one totally impossible for Humans to break,`
` be defeated by the likes of you?!"`
`"......B-Beatrice, you don't mean to..."`
`"Indeed.`
` ...If a Human cannot make a move, `
`...I will assault you with a move I can use precisely because I am a witch..."`
`"A move you can use because you're a witch...?`
` ...Wh-What are you planning to do...?"`
`'!s1`
`to deny witches."`
`'!s0`
`The teacher and the butler were both startled.`
`...I also immediately understood what it meant.`
`To use the red that only witches could use.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`...`
`~ib~To use the red to deny witches~ib~`
`.`
`It was like using her own sword to slit her own throat.`
`"......Wh-Whaaat...?!`
` ...H-Hey, what are you saying?`
` Deny witches with red...?`
` ......Q-Quit talking like an idiot.`
` If you do that, ...you won't get away unscathed either...!!"`
`"......You are not a witch.`
` And I am not a witch either.`
` ...The road to becoming a true witch is difficult, and I have much, much farther to go..."`
`"......Very well then.`
` Right here, right now, there have never been any witches in the first place.`
` I will strip this deception away myself."`
`"Aren't both of us real, obvious witches?!!`
` Being able to use red is itself proof of witches!`
` I don't know what the definition of a witch is to you, `
`but if you think that you alone will be able to get away unscathed, then-"`
`"How could I make such a mistake?`
` I care not."`
`"Wh......What did you say...?"`
`"I never did manage to become a witch.`
` ...I've done nothing more than finally begin walking down the road to becoming a true witch.`
` ...If what I am right now is a witch, `
`...then I'm a false witch like you, one who is merely drunk on power."`
`"...Rather than existing in that shabby form,`
` I shall erase this form of mine along with you, `
`without any regrets...!"`
`"...A-Are you insane?!?!`
` S-Stop it...!`
` I still wanna be a witch! I hate being Human...!!"`
`"......Witch-sama, please return to your seat.`
` Please, receive the human side's counter from your seat."`
`"Wh-What are you doing?!`
` L-Let go of me!!`
`'!s0`
` Make her stop!!`
` Let gooooooooooooooooooo!!"`
`As the witch stood from her seat and tried to spring upon Beato, Ronove pressed down on both of her shoulders, forcing her back into her seat.`
`And, even after that, he didn't remove his hands from those shoulders.`
`Denying witches was the same thing as denying magic.`
`...That included demons such as Ronove.`
`However, instead of running away, Ronove chose to act as the facilitator for the game,`
` ...and to carry out that duty for his master's sake.`
`"...Beatrice,`
` ......you have...no regrets, right...?"`
`"That's my line.`
` ...Sorry, Teacher.`
` ...Even though you taught me so much about fun magic and magic that brings happiness,`
` ......I wasn't able to use it well at all.`
` ......So I'll study from square one...`
`and start over again.`
` ...I am truly sorry......that you had to suffer for your stupid disciple's misconduct."`
`"...I had a good disciple in the very end.`
` ...Go, do what you believe in."`
`"......I-I don't have a clue what you guys are talking about...`
` ...But I do understand one thing.`
` And I can say this...`
` ...Beato, I don't know what you're trying to do, `
`...but stop trying to do it...!"`
`"You have no moves.`
` But I have one.`
` ...If we let that move get away, she will be revived as a witch in the truest sense, and this time, she will control this whole island.`
` ...All nightmares will be hers to do with as she pleases,`
` and this island will fall into the deepest hell of the evil witch's repeating delusions, for all eternity."`
`"......Can you permit that?`
` ...Don't you care if your dear relatives are toyed with for all eternity in that witch's nightmare?"`
`"S-Still, ...you shouldn't have to sacrifice yourself...`
` Th-This is a game between me and her.`
` You shouldn't have to make your move and sacrifice yourself!`
` I-I'll think of something!`
` I'll surely think of a miraculous move...!!"`
`"So don't rush into it!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhh, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit,`
` I'll definitely think of one, ...so don't rush into iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`"......This game is cruel.`
` The time limit for your consideration has already run out.`
` ......I am now the only one who can do it.`
` ...Calm yourself, Battler.`
` ......I'll defeat her.`
` ...I'll defeat that cruel witch with my own hands..."`
`"W-Wait, Beato!!`
` Stop it, quit it!!`
` There's absolutely no need for you to sacrifice yourself!!"`
`"Weren't you fighting to deny me?`
` ...What a strange person.`
` Hahahahahahahaha."`
`"...Let that child do as she likes.`
` And please, watch her until the end."`
`"...B-But..."`
`"Battler,`
` ...there's only one thing I ask.`
` ...Would you...cover your ears?"`
`"My ears...?`
` Why...?"`
`"......Starting now, I will deny witches in red.`
` I will slice up the game board that she has laid out with her red.`
` ...By doing that,`
` ......I will probably lose my form as a witch as well.`
` ...If you also hear the red truth I speak, you will understand my true form."`
`"......If you alone cover your ears, that truth will not change at all.`
` ...However, `
`...even so, I want you alone to cover your ears.`
` .........I at least want to be a witch...in your eyes.`
` ...Please."`
`"...Beatrice-sama,`
` ...there are no problems on the witch side.`
` Please, your move."`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, ev2_3e1170:`
` She's insane!!`
` Do you plan on dying and taking us with you?!`
` Stop it, don't deny it!!`
` Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!"`
`"...How unsightly for a Golden Witch.`
` ......Okay, are you ready?`
` ...I will remove your check in Battler's stead.`
` What happened on the chessboard where 15 died and only three remained?`
` ...Starting now, I will expose it in red.`
` With that red truth, ...I will pierce and kill both fake witches!"`
`Beato turned around and smiled at Battler.`
`...Most likely, no one would believe that the witch who had gone to the limits of cruelty...`
`would try to leave a smile as the last expression she showed Battler.`
`And that smile signified her last wish, that she wanted him to cover his ears...`
`Denying witches in red...was the same as knowing her shabby form.`
`Battler put both of his hands against his ears...`
`...To protect her final...`
`bit of honor as a witch, he put his hands against his ears, ...rejecting the truth.`
`And he howled.`
`So that not even a bit of what she was saying would slip into his ears.`
`After that...was a world where Battler could hear nothing.`
`Beato was saying something in red.`
`Even the evil witch covered her ears at those bitter contents.`
`...That was...the red truth.`
` Words of power.`
`...Words that denied her own existence.`
`Unique words that only witches could use, which denied witches.`
`Beato spoke.`
`With the red truth, she cut up the bright-red game board that the witch had released.`
`She explained difficult problems that could not be solved by humans, with moves that could only be solved by witches, and began cornering the witch.`
`The 'truth' that Battler was not permitted to hear.`
`If Battler had broken his promise and sneakily eavesdropped...`
`...In an instant, Battler would probably have been able to become the victor in his game with Beato.`
`...He would probably have understood all the riddles on the island, all of the magic and tricks, closed rooms, spells, curses, legends,`
` ...and this entire tale of anger and sadness.`
`However, ...Battler would only learn what that was when he reached the truth by himself.`
`Yes.`
` ...From the beginning, ...Beatrice had wished that Battler would reach that truth by himself.`
`It was something one shouldn't reach by being told it.`
`It was a truth that Battler would have to drag himself to by his own power.`
`A brilliant light gathered with Beato and the evil witch at the center...and grew gradually stronger...`
`It was...the power of truth.`
`......Its heat and brilliance like the sun...`
`shone on all the falsehoods that hid in the darkness, trying to deceive, ...and burnt them to nothing.`
`"Gwoooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!`
` Why?!`
` Why can you die?!`
` Why can you throw away your life...when you have such incredible power?!`
` You who hold the power to control gold, magic, and everything at will, `
`why can you so readily throw that away?!"`
`"...Learn that even with a mountain of gold, `
`even with magic to split the sea, `
`there are some things you can never obtain.`
` ......Come, show yourself.`
` Show your true form, ...Ushiromiya Eva!!!"`
`When the sun exploded and blew everything away...`
`...Eva could be seen there, holding a gun.`
`"...Y-You're the culprit,`
` Aunt Eva...!!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle* ...Ahhahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Took you long enough to notice, Battler-kuun!!"`
`Without any hesitation or mercy, Eva raised her gun and pulled the trigger.`
`...As an explosive sound rang out, Battler's heart was shot through, and he fell to the floor.`
`'!s0`
` ...with blood dripping from his mouth,`
` ...Battler died...`
`But in his last moments, he realized without a doubt that she was a murderer.`
` And not just for killing him...`
`......There have been many murders, and I don't have a clue how they were carried out.`
`However, ...while my ears were covered, `
`...Beato exposed all of them with the red, blasting away all magic.`
`...In other words, ......even though I didn't understand it,`
` ...was that nothing more or less than proof that magic can all be explained with humans?`
`......Beato made me cover my ears.`
`...So I myself don't know the whole truth.`
`...However, ......now that it's been denied in red, `
`I can see one fact which is extremely unfair for us, ...that 'It is possible to deny all magic'.`
`So, in other words, .........`
`...No, `
`...I must not think of that.`
`......If I do, ...then the time I spent covered my ears would be made pointless.`
`If I'm going to regret, I can only regret my own actions.`
`...If, at that time, I'd thought of some move to spin things around and counter the witch's final move, `
`there would have been no need for Beato to sacrifice herself.`
`It was...my own worthlessness...that brought about this conclusion...`
`...Even though it was a pitch-black world where nothing could be seen,`
` ...for some reason, I felt Beato's presence right next to me.`
`...So I tried calling out to her.`
`...You can exchange words with someone whether they're a human or a witch.`
`...So even in a world where witches have been denied, ...I should be allowed to talk to her...`
`"......Beato..."`
`"...Battler, is it...?`
` .........It is done.`
` ...I...did it."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...I didn't hear it, `
`......but I watched you until the very end...`
` I definitely saw you...boldly stand up to that evil witch..."`
`"......With this, ...I am no longer a witch.`
` .........But I will definitely...become a witch again...`
` ...And then, `
`...I will make it so that I can be called the Golden Witch again,`
` ......and once again, `
`......return...`
`so that I can be accepted as your opponent......"`
`"No.`
` ......You...were a witch."`
`"......Huh...?"`
`"...I...saw it.`
` ......When you took that evil witch,`
` ...and blew her away with that awesome magic, exposing her true form, `
`...I saw it with my own eyes..."`
`"Th-That wasn't magic, `
`...but the red-"`
`"No, it was magic.`
` ......You were definitely...the Golden Witch.`
` ......Even if you deny it yourself,`
` ......I'll acknowledge it.`
`'!s1`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`'You are definitely...`
`the Golden Witch'."`
`...When Battler said those words...`
`In the world that had been dark, ...there was suddenly a single grain.`
`...A small grain of gold, like a wheat seed, shone brightly.`
`And...even though it was small, it had a strong, gold-colored sparkle.`
`Then, ...it shone on the two of them, sitting with their backs together...`
`So, they each became aware of their own form.`
`...They did not exist only as consciousness.`
`...They became aware that they had bodies and definitely existed.`
`...No, perhaps we should say that they each had been given an existence called a body.`
`When Battler looked at his own form, he wasn't that surprised.`
`...But when Beato looked at her own form, she was a little startled.`
`...From Battler's perspective, she looked just like normal,`
` ...but for a short while, she was surprised by that form...`
`"...What...`
`...is going on......?"`
`"The sparkle from that grain of light...is slowly getting stronger..."`
`That grain of wheat was no longer simply gold-colored, but was like the light of the sun.`
`Then, it softly......began to approach Beato's chest.`
`When that grain of the sun...was sucked inside her chest-`
`...The world was wrapped in a deep blue sky, and then a deep blue ocean was spread out below them.`
`An island rose up, trees sprouted and created a forest, walls surrounded us and a ceiling swallowed us.`
`And was adorned with more and more things, `
`...made to be like the hall in the Ushiromiya mansion.`
`In the middle of the fantastical hall where many gold butterflies beat their wings, `
`...many tables were set up with white tablecloths, like it was a party,`
` and beautiful cooking and fruits were set out.`
`...And over there...were a great many shapes.`
` It was everyone talking together and smiling.`
`"...E-Everyone......"`
`There was Dad and Kyrie-san, Uncle Krauss, Aunt Natsuhi and Aunt Rosa, and of course, even Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi.`
`...George-aniki, Jessica, Maria, ...wait, wait, even Shannon-chan, Kanon-kun, Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san are here.`
`Everyone, everyone was at the party, clapping their hands and celebrating our return...`
`"Wh-Why...?`
` Even though everyone was dead...!`
` Why are they alive...?!"`
`"...In the Golden Land, the souls of all the dead can be revived.`
` ...Welcome back, Beatrice.`
` And welcome, Battler-kun.`
` Welcome to the Golden Land."`
`"......I...made it?`
` ...I made it...`
`to the door of the Golden Land?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...Milady, you have finally managed to invite everyone here.`
` Welcome, Battler-sama, to the Golden Land."`
`"Battler.`
` ......So, you have finally made it this far."`
`"G-Grandfather, `
`......where in the world...am I...?"`
`"My...blood, which is incompatible with magic, runs most deeply in your veins.`
` ...Therefore, you were the only one who could not reach the Golden Land, and Beatrice has been searching for you this whole time.`
` ...She tried everything to bring you here."`
`"......What did you say...?"`
`"Battler-sama, if you would take your seat.`
` Tonight's dinner is my very best work.`
` If you would, please relish it."`
`"You should be honored!!`
` Normally, I would've eaten all of it, but I left you some out of gratitude!"`
`"...The Seven Stakes nee-chans..."`
`"In the Golden Land, all of those with minds are equal.`
` ...Here, there is no distinction between us furniture, Humans, and witches."`
`"...Battler-sama,`
` we were waiting for you.`
` Welcome to the Golden Land..."`
`"Shannon-chan, ...George-aniki...!!"`
`"...I still feel like this might be a dream...`
` We should have died.`
` ...But...I'm alive.`
` And everyone...everyone is here...and happy.`
` ...I can't believe it."`
`"That's right, this place must be a dream wooorld!`
` So it must be a dream that George is acting so friendly with a maid girl!`
` Whaaaaaah!"`
`"Could you give it a rest, Eva?`
` For now, you gotta stay quiet and bless the two young'uns.`
` The Golden Land is a city of bliss.`
` We should never quarrel here...!"`
`"Here, any people are free to love each other.`
` ...No one needs to hesitate over it."`
`"Jessica-chan, Kanon-kun, you look so wonderfuul!`
` I'm jealo-us!"`
`"...H-Hey, Battler...`
` I'm a little, umm, wahahahaha..."`
`"Battler-sama, welcome.`
` And welcome home..."`
`Jessica was probably embarrassed because she was holding hands with Kanon-kun.`
`Kanon-kun wanted to act humbly like a servant and bow, `
`but since neither of them could let go of the other's hand, he couldn't do it so well, and the whole scene looked fairly comical.`
`"With a servant child...?!!`
` You can't, our Jessica cannot do such a thing...!!"`
`"It's hardly a big deal, correct?`
` Let her at least choose the person she likes."`
`"She can't, she can't, aaaaaaaaaahhh, Jessicaaaaaaaaa!"`
`"You can't eitheeeeeer, Geooooooooorge!"`
`...As Aunt Natsuhi and Aunt Eva hugged each other, they cried tears of regret for their adorable children.`
`...Even though they had always been at odds.`
`...It was a very bizarre scene.`
`"...It isn't really a problem, right?`
` It doesn't matter who likes who."`
`"That's right.`
` It's proof that a parent's too attached to their child."`
`"Battleer, `
`no matter what kind of woman you bring home, I'll give her a warm welcome, okay?"`
`"Don't you dare introduce her to this man, okay?`
` He'll get his hands on her immediately.`
` They'll run off together right away."`
`"......Battler.`
` You finally came here.`
` Kihhihihihihihihihi."`
`"Maria, `
`......from the very beginning, `
`...you knew we'd be coming here...?"`
`"Uu-!`
` That's why I wasn't scared at all.`
` Everyone was being a coward and trembling.`
` It was funny!"`
`"...What the hell.`
` ...Even though I thought you were the most screwed up, `
`...you actually knew the truth from the beginning."`
`"H-How rude...!`
` I simply cannot forgive you for speaking of Lady MARIA in that way!"`
`"Formulating Firing Curve, Attack Preparations Ready.`
` Lady MARIA, we can attack at any time.`
` Nihi!"`
`"Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi...!`
`'!s0`
`"...Be quiet.`
` You are in the presence of Beatrice-sama."`
`"Come now, no need to be so stiff.`
` Let's be considerate of their desire to joke around and have fun.`
` More importantly, why don't we begin preparing for the toast?"`
`"Yes, preparations for my excellent mackerel cooking are complete.`
` I can serve it at any time."`
`"Hey!! You people!`
` Work a little more like furniture!!"`
`"Nooooo!!`
` I'm gonna stuff myself some mo-re!`
` Uu-aaah!"`
`"Come on, let's work.`
` Don't keep the guests waiting.`
` Let's work studiously and attend to them.`
` Don't let the guests do anything.`
` Make them lazy, make them slothful, fatten them like pigs.`
` Ahhahaha!"`
`"...Beatrice.`
` Battler-kun.`
` This way."`
`Grandfather and Virgilia were standing on the landing at the top of the staircase, beckoning to us.`
`Beato and I turned our heads to see what was going on, then climbed the stairs together.`
`From the hall, it looked like a very high stage.`
`A small table had been set up there, as well as a piece of parchment and an old-fashioned quill pen.`
`I saw that strange magical characters and Japanese were written side by side.`
`...And below it, many names were written.`
`There were 17 of them.`
`...Grandfather was the first, and everyone's names had been signed all over it.`
`The people who arrived at the Golden Land probably signed this one after another.`
`"Battler,`
` now that you are here, everyone is gathered.`
` Listen carefully."`
`"The Golden Land is not a world supported by the power of magic alone.`
` The cooperation and approval of all humans who receive happiness here is required.`
` For that sake, we must gather the signatures of everyone here."`
`"Last time, `
`the door to the Golden Land was finally opened, but you refused to sign.`
` ...Although you probably don't remember it.`
` Because you refused to sign, this world was once again sealed in darkness."`
`"...Just hearing it like that, ...it kinda sounds like I'm the only stubborn one, `
`and that I've been a bother to everyone in various ways..."`
`"That's because your stubbornness is the real deal.`
` It seems you received more than just blood from Kinzo."`
`Beato laughed amiably.`
`I should've felt like she was making fun of me, but without thinking, I went along with her, laughing and smiling.`
`"Magic is a miracle.`
` ...Miracles cannot be made complete unless everyone believes.`
` ...And, when you believed in the end, this miracle, ...the Golden Land, was completed."`
`".........It looks like I've been a real pain.`
` ...So, what should I do...?"`
`"First, sign here.`
` Then, Beatrice, you sign here."`
`"...Quill pens are pretty hard to use, huh?`
` ...Whoa, it shot."`
`"You klutz.`
` Shooting ink is a bad omen.`
` Can't you at least write your name quickly?`
` Your pen's wriggling all over the place like a worm.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"You should talk...!`
` Don't write it in #fefefekatakana#ffffff!`
` Beatrice is a stylish name, so write it in cursive!`
` You're making the quill and your name cry!"`
`"Sh-Shut up, in school, didn't they tell you not to use cursive on tests?"`
`"Hey, this is a solemn ceremony. Be silent."`
`"Very well.`
` We have gathered the two signatures, as well as the form for the covenant.`
` ...Both of you, your oath please.`
` We'll start with Beatrice.`
` Put your hand on the covenant and take the oath."`
`"...'As a good witch, Beatrice swears to continue her studies from this point forth to bring happiness to the people'.`
` ...Say it."`
`"...I-Indeed...`
` ...I-It's a little embarrassing.`
` ...As a good witch, `
`Beatrice swears to continue her studies from this point forth to bring happiness to the people.`
` ...Will that do?"`
`"Acceptable.`
` Battler is next."`
`"In the same way, Battler-kun,`
` put your hand on the covenant and take the oath.`
` ...'As a member of the Golden Land, Ushiromiya Battler swears to serve for the sake of his own happiness and that of his neighbor'."`
`"Ah, `
`...as a member of the Golden Land, `
`Ushiromiya Battler swears to serve for the sake of his own happiness and that of his neighbor.`
` ...I'm embarrassed too..."`
`"Listen, everyone...!!`
` Here and now, we have gathered the oaths of all 18 humans who accept the Golden Land...!!"`
`When Kinzo proclaimed that, everyone applauded at once, praising us.`
`...Since I had been the only stubborn one and had just been a pain, I felt a little bad about being the most celebrated one.`
`"And with that, in accordance with the ancient rites, we ask Battler-kun, the last to make the oath, to sign the invitation to the Golden Land.`
` ...This is something that invites the Golden Witch, Beatrice, to the Golden Land.`
` The Golden Land welcomes the Golden Witch through a consensus of those who have acknowledged it...and becomes complete."`
`"Battler, I will read it out loud.`
` Listen carefully.`
` ......'The 18 of us accept Beatrice as the Golden Witch and welcome her to the Golden Land'."`
`"What's going on with you? You won't be invited unless I send an invitation?"`
`"That does seem to be the ceremony.`
` It feels stiff even to me.`
` Why don't we end it quickly?`
` I've been so hungry for a while now."`
`"...Come to think of it, I've only been pecking at canned food and haven't eaten anything good.`
` Let's quickly finish this signing."`
`"What's this?`
` 'I acknowledge you as a witch'.`
` ......Huh?`
` That's pretty simple.`
` Damn you Grandfather, exaggerating it so much."`
`"Come on, come on, quickly."`
` "Sign, right here."`
`"......Huh...?"`
`"Quickly." `
`"Sign."`
`...With slightly weird and uncomfortable smiles, the two of them started demanding that I sign...`
`At that time, an incredible sound like that of a glass window breaking reverberated through the hall, `
`and the bustling tumult faded back into complete silence.`
`I dropped the quill pen and turned around, trying to see what had happened.`
`When I did, `
`......where had she come from?`
`...A human who clearly hadn't been there a short while ago was in the very center of the hall, ...looking up at us.`
`Who's that...?`
` ...A girl?`
`She's probably about the same age as Jessica and me.`
`...But I didn't know that face.`
`None of the other people here knew that face either.`
`"...Wh-Who are you?!`
` Who is this?!`
` Where did you come from?!`
` Those without invitations are not needed at my party.`
` Servants, kick her out!!"`
`"As you command!!`
` Surround her!!"`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory surrounded her from seven directions, taking out magic blades that drew purple curves and blocking her.`
`And from out of nowhere, shuffling goat-head servants appeared in great numbers, surrounding that girl.`
`On top of that, the Chiester Sisters stood in front of Beato like a wall, readying a golden bow and pulling back the bowstring...`
`"............"`
`But the girl didn't move at all.`
`...On the contrary, she was still staring at us on the landing, as though she didn't mind at all.`
`...Who is she looking at...?`
` Beato?`
` Grandfather?`
`......Could it be...me......?`
`Yes.`
` ...The girl was staring straight into my eyes, ...glaring.`
`Then, after our eyes met perfectly, she yelled.`
`"You mustn't sign that!!!`
` Are you going to accept your own defeat?!`
` Don't be tricked by the witch!!!"`
`"...Huh?`
` By the witch, `
`...huh?!"`
`At that time, something incredibly strong lifted me by the nape of my neck.`
`...Wh-What's going on...?!`
`And after being made to turn around behind me,`
` ...I saw Virgilia, with an eerie smile on her face, and the muscular forms of goat monsters...`
`A goat monster that looked about 2 meters tall was grabbing me with an arm as thick as a log...!`
`"Hohhohohohohohohohohohoho...`
` There is no need to listen to an uninvited guest.`
` Come, offer your signature as well.`
` On this written oath.`
` 'Ushiromiya Battler acknowledges the existence of witches'.`
` Come now, sign the written oath...!!"`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, but_3e1825:`
`As the goat monsters held me down with the power of a vise, they forced me to grab the quill pen.`
`...I couldn't even touch the floor with my feet, much less resist...!`
`"Battleer, why are you resisting?`
` Weren't you just about to sign willingly...?`
` Don't change your mind now, after all that, okaaay?`
` Didn't you think for an instant...that it might be okay to acknowledge witches?`
` You thought that, riiiiiight?`
` Kukkikikikkakkakakakakakakakakaka!!"`
`'!s1`
`I was...`
`t-`
`tricked...?`
` That's insane......`
` Beato isn't that kind of..."`
`"............"`
`"...H-Hihhihahhahhahaaaaaaaaah!!`
` Sorry, Battleer, I am that kind of persooooooooooon!!`
` Aah, it's useless now, it looks like sentimental sob stories don't suit meeeeeeeeeee!!`
` Teacher, I'm counting on you to use all your strength!!`
` That was such a plain role to play, and I got so bored!"`
`"I don't know who you are, girl,`
` but I'll beat you to death, mash you and crush you until threads start trailing, okaaaaaaaaaaaayy?!`
` I'll make you regret being born a womaaaaaaaaaaaan, `
`hyahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!"`
`As Beato waved her gold pipe, `
`the massive chandelier hanging in the hall was electrocuted, and from that, a terrible purple thunderbolt fell...!`
`It should have been a direct hit on the girl right below it, turning her to ash.`
`However, ...not a single hair was singed.`
`"Hoh...!!`
` So, your sudden appearance here wasn't just a fluke...!!`
` Tell me! State your name!!"`
`"I don't have any name to give you.`
` ......More importantly,`
` ...you idiot!!!`
`  How long are you going to be tricked?!!`
` You softy!!`
` Figure it out already!!`
` This is all the witch's trap!!"`
`Those words were aimed at me.`
`...This is all...`
`the witch's trap, she says...?`
`That can't be...`
`Beato reformed and swore to become a good witch...`
`"......Beato.........`
` ...All this about traps...`
` ...It's a lie, right...?`
` Please, ......tell me it's a lie..."`
`"...Sorry, Battleer.`
` It was pretty fun.`
` ...Sure, I just did what Teacher told me, but look how great it turned out!"`
`"Apparently, if you start out all hostile and needlessly brutal, then turn incompetent and soft at just the right moment, you can spark a huge bump on your affection meter, riiight?"`
`"I've heard villains who start all lovey-dovey and then freak the shit out are all the rage these days, riiiiiight?`
` Even I've studied a bunch of those manga, anime, and galge that've been so popular lately, you seeee?"`
`"And for you, just as expected, it was 'tears please', and you're down!!`
` Hihhyahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahaha, i-diot, what a truly simple person!!`
` I'll call this 'the North Wind and the Sun Strategy'.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"...That's not......`
`'!s1`
`Damn you, `
`...you bastard...`
`'!sd`
`"...............`
`...Yes, that expression suits you the most.`
` That caring expression of yours really doesn't suit me after all.`
` It made my back itch, and I was frantically trying not to let it get to me.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"Too bad, witches never refooorm☆`
` Hyaahhahhahhahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!!`
` You take care of the signature, Teacher!`
` This uninvited guest is my prey!!"`
`"Come, you can no longer refuse to sign.`
` ...Come on, look.`
` Sign it and offer your body, your mind, and your soul...!!"`
`When Virgilia lifted her chin as a signal, the goat monsters, with an even more vise-like power,`
` forced my arm to approach the parchment...!`
`Owowowow, ...these guys are trying to make me sign, even if it breaks my arm...`
`Then, a bright red light burst open with me at the center, knocking the witches and the goat monsters away.`
`Did that girl save me...?!`
` B-But who in the world is that? I don't have a clue!`
`"How long do you plan to keep playing in a place like this...?`
` Give it a rest.`
` I'm jealous of you."`
`"......I-I'm glad you saved me, but that's a pretty cruel way to say it.`
` ...Sorry, but who are you...?"`
`".........`
`......Witch of Rokkenjima!!`
` Give him back!!"`
`"Kuhhahahahahahahahah!!`
` Who would do that, you fool?!!`
` Battler is my toy.`
` My most favorite toy in the world...!!`
` I won't get tired of him, I won't throw him away, and I won't hand him over to anyone!!`
` Even Battler is enjoying this to the fullest.`
` Together with me, he is having so much fun playing.`
` No matter who you are, I won't let you get in the way...!!"`
`"Yeah, it looks like you're having a lot of fun. It makes me so jealous, it ticks me off!!`
` Here you are, in a place like this, guffawing and having a loud, noisy time with everyone!"`
`"With all these beautiful witches around to pamper you,`
` you must be having so much fun that you don't even want to go back!!"`
`"...A-Are you talking to me...?`
` Wait, wait, you've got the wrong idea...!`
` This is a pain for me too!`
` What do you mean, fun? You don't know what I've been through...!"`

` I'm sorry, but I'll have to turn you down there.`
` I am satisfied with the toy I have.`
` A rude toy like you is not fitting for my toy box!"`
`"Yes, I understand.`
` Who would ever play with someone like you?`
` ...But I will thank you just a little.`
` ...For letting me meet everyone like this."`
`"...Who...`
`...are you...?`
` ............You couldn't be..."`
`"I see, is that it...?`

` How amusing!!"`
`"Why don't I formally invite you to my party?!!`

` Along with Battler, I'll play nicely, break you, kill you, crush you, turn you to ash, mix you with bread dough and bake you until you're fluffy!!`
` Fuhhahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaahh!!"`
`"......Aaah, it's useless, it's all useless!`
` You can't do that!`
` On the Rokkenjima of 1986,`
` ...I'll expose everything that happened to the light of day!"`
`"I'll show you that before the truth, you're like an icicle scared of the coming spring!`
` Prepare yourself, Golden Witch!`
` Beatrice!!!"`
`"Wahahahaha, you all right, Battler-kun...?!`
` We're already on the ground, and you can't fall any further than that, wahahahaha...!"`
`"Uu-, hahahahahaha!`
` Faaall, faaall, hahahahaha!"`
`In the lobby of the Niijima airport, Maria dashed around in excitement.`
`Battler's uproar on the plane must have been hilarious.`
`"Hey, Maria!`
` Cut that out!`
` ...I'm sorry, Battler-kun.`
` Please don't take it badly."`
`"What a pathetic guy you are.`
` Even with that huge body, you still can't handle vehicles?"`
`"Ah, shut up...`
` All humans have one or two things they can't handle..."`
`"Battler-kun, why don't you come with your aunt on an overseas trip sometime soon?`
` How about Europe?`
` I'm sure you could manage a half-day trip on a plane.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"...Stop it, Mother.`
` Battler-kun's dislike for vehicles is probably genetic."`
`"Oh, you mean Asumu-san?"`
`"...For some reason, she just couldn't handle vehicles.`
` Pretty much anything other than a bicycle or a car.`
` Whenever we tried to go far away, that woman was so annoying with the 'not this, not that, `
`I'm scared, I'm scared, fall, fall, gyaah, gyaah'."`
`"Children tend to learn that things their parents can't handle are dangerous.`
` I'm sure Battler-kun saw Asumu-san doing something like that and learned that vehicles are scary."`
`"*giggle*giggle*`
` So it's Asumu-san's genes then, is it?"`
`"Who knows.`
` Those would be some pretty annoying genes.`
` ......That's enough talking about Asumu.`
` Right now, you're the one who's here.`
` Right?"`
`"...You're right, sorry."`
`"Heeey, the cars are here!`
` Exactly three of them.`
` Get in, get in!"`
`"Fall, faaall!!`
` Where's the parachuuute, where's the parachuuute?!!`
` Uu-uu-, *giggle*!!"`
`"Why you little!!`
` Hold on, hold on, stop right there!`
` I'll sentence you to the little girl tickle punishmeeent!!"`
`"Heheheheheh.`
` Being in high spirits is such a wonderful thing.`
` Without Battler-kun and Maria-chan, the atmosphere in that plane would have been pretty grim."`
`"Thanks.`
` I'll assume you mean that literally.`
` ...Hey, brats!`
` The taxis are here!`
` You can play around later."`
`"Uu-uu-!!`
` Taxiii, taxiii!!`
` I'm getting in fiiirst!`
` *giggle*!!"`
`"Hey!`
` Maria, and you too, Battler-kun, stop fooling around!`
` You'll bump into someone!"`
`The tone of Aunt Rosa's voice grew a little frightening.`
`When even Battler realized they were fooling around a bit too much, ...just as expected, he bumped into someone.`
`"Oh, sorry..."`
`"Battler-kun, you guys are going in that car.`
` You're keeping them waiting."`
`After George urged him to hurry on, Battler apologized to the person he had bumped into and ran up to his parents, who were telling him to come quickly.`
`With a clunking sound, the doors on the three taxis were shut one after another, and they departed for the harbor...`
`...As their taxis dashed away...`
`The entire world grew suddenly dull...`
`and slowed to a halt.`
`Voices, the wind, and even sound...`
` All of it stopped, and all the people who were trying to move froze like the instant someone takes a photo,`
` ...coming to a halt.`
`People and machines and clock hands, even the dust dancing in the wind, ...were frozen.`
`Some people who were walking froze with one leg still in the air.`
`Scraps of paper dancing in the wind were pinned in midair, frozen in place.`
`...Then, among the shadows standing still in this unmoving world, a single one stirred.`
`It was a girl.`
`The girl Battler had just bumped into...`
`Though she had moved, it was a truly subtle thing.`
`Her gaze dropped, her shoulders lowered a miniscule amount, and she sighed.`
` ...That was all.`
`In a normal world, that probably wouldn't even be taken as movement,`
` but in this still world, it looked very out of place.`
`...Then, something else moved.`
`It was a black cat wandering around the shadows near the taxi rank.`
`It came up right behind the girl...`
`and leisurely...changed its form into that of a Human.`
`This was no cat.`
` It was a witch.`
`Of course, the girl was also a witch.`
`As the witch stood still, her gaze still downwards, she muttered...`
`"......I can't...`
`stop everyone from going to Rokkenjima, can I...?"`
`"You cannot.`
` On October 4, 1986, you are not here."`
`"...If I were, would stopping everyone really have been possible...?"`
`"Well, I can't imagine what a six-year-old girl could do `
`to make them turn back.`
` ...Still, that's right.`
` If you were in this place, the probability wouldn't have been zero.`
` Whenever there's a probability greater than zero, I can seek out a miracle."`
`"...If I hadn't been sick, `
`...and they hadn't left me behind..."`
`With her head facing downwards, the witch tightened her fists...`
`...They were trembling very slightly.`
`"You were sick in bed starting October 3, 1986.`
` And Beato's game board is sealed off starting October 4.`
` ...You are not given a chance to avoid getting sick.`
` ...In other words, it would normally be absolutely impossible for you to enter her game board."`
`"Thanks for being patronizing.`
` ...I know that.`
` ...I know that just seeing Father, Mother, `
`......and Onii-chan healthy like this...`
`...even that alone...`
`is a spectacular miracle..."`
`Ange had tried to stand in the way of her family, attempting to stop them from leaving the airport...and heading towards Rokkenjima.`
`...However, it was impossible for her to exist in October 4, 1986, so she couldn't do it.`
`Even though her brother had only bumped into her and apologized...`
`'!s0`
`...it had been such a miracle...`
`that she could cry...`
`"......Sorry about the sarcasm.`
` I won't waste the miracle you've given me."`
`"I'm glad to hear it.`
` ...Come, let us go with them.`
` To Rokkenjima.`
` All of the pieces are already gathered.`
` ...The curtain will open on the fourth game.`
` By this time, Beato and Battler will already be seated."`
`'!s1`
`...no, `
`...to where everyone's fates changed, ...the Rokkenjima...`
`of October 4, 1986......"`
`...What happened on that day?`
`I'll expose it.`
` I'll learn what it is.`
` And I'll bring them back...!`
`As she stood there with her fists still clenched, she surely turned her face up to the heavens.`
`A single teardrop from the depths of her eyes dripped down into the air.`
`And when time started moving again, the two witches' figures were swallowed up by a blowing gale and erased in an instant.`
`"Good morning, Milady.`
` My, my, you do appear to be in a good mood.`
` What a pleasant awakening you seem to have had."`
`"What do you mean, pleasant awakening...?!`
` I was so excited, I couldn't sleep a wink.`
` After all, the curtain is rising on the fun, fun fourth game...!"`
`It seemed that she truly had been so excited that she hadn't gotten any sleep.`
`Did she show absolutely no signs of lacking sleep because she was young, or because she had the mind of a little kid?`
`Ronove chose not to say that aloud, and laughed 'pu ku ku' instead.`
`"I really ran that Battler into the ground last time!`
` Ah, the look on his face when he was like 'You tricked me'!`
` That was so patheeetic!`
` Even so, is that guy still feeling down?"`
`"Feeling down, you say...?"`
`"Hmm, well, that's right.`
` ...That man's a bit too trusting for his age, isn't he?"`
`"Indeed.`
` Although you could call that his charm.`
` Pu ku ku..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Ain't it the truth, ain't it the truth?`
` Well, speaking of which.`
` Didn't he totally fall for that one last time?"`
`"Yes, totally and splendidly.`
` ...You violated the purity of one never deceived since the time of his birth, as well as his rosebud-like innocence, all to your heart's content.`
` ......Even the joy of dashing across a field covered with beautiful new snow on a winter morning and trampling it completely wouldn't even begin to compare."`
`"Didn't you take Battler-sama's innocent heart,`
` and quite thrillingly, splendidly, atrociously, mercilessly, and unculturedly go just a little too far...?`
` And you insulted him to the highest degree, enough to make one uneasy.`
` Most people would be crushed after something like that.`
` Pukukukuku, so much so that they wouldn't want to see your face ever again."`
`"I-I know that much...!`
` I also...umm...thought that if he was too disheartened to join us at the table, `
`even though the fourth game is finally starting, that would be such a pain,`
` so I came to you, thinking that it'd be better to prepare a counter-measure for that case beforehand...!"`
`"Hmmmm...`
` In that case, perhaps it really would be best to prepare such a counter-measure.`
` I am sad to say that your 'North Wind and the Sun Strategy' gave Battler-sama quite a shock."`
`"H-Hoh...`
` ...A shock, you say? How bad of one...?"`
`Beato lowered her voice slightly, asking timidly.`
`Ronove followed suit...and lowered his voice in the same way.`
`"...In truth, he has been crouching and clutching at his knees for some time now.`
` I spoke to him several times, but he did not answer.`
` I also brought him some food, but he never even touched it."`
`"...Th-That is...troublesome...`
` Is he really feeling that down...?"`
`"Pukukukuku.`
` It is only natural.`
` ...After all, you `
`'!s0`
`rough・`
`ly`
`'!sd`
`@:dwave_eng 0, ron_4e29:`
`"Hoh, distrust of Humans? How convenient!`
` Let him give up on Humans and trust witches, wahahaha...`
` ......O-Oh, `
`*cough*.`
` Sorry, I shouldn't fool around too much."`
`Beato had tried to joke about it, but the situation seemed to be quite serious, so that even she took the hint and hid her laughter.`
`"...Is it really that serious...?`
` Sh-Should we wait just a little longer before beginning the fourth game...?"`
`"Lady Bernkastel's guest will be arriving,`
` so it may be best to open the fourth game quickly.`
` However, perhaps you ought to show a little concern for Battler's feelings, Milady."`
`"Concern!`
` Show concern, you say?!`
` How should I do that...?!`
` He is feeling down, so...`
`th-that's right, shall I cheer him up?!"`
`"When a person's heart is dark and closed off, interacting with them in a dark manner gains you nothing.`
` Your only option is to shine with a brightness stronger than the dark."`
`"Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiit, quit messing arooooooooouund...!!!"`
`"Kya-hhahaha!!`
` Battler-kuuun, over heeere!`
` A croissant baked by Ronove-sama would be wasted on the likes of yooou!`
` Why don't I enjoy it myself?"`
`Battler's stomach involuntarily growled at the fragrant smell of the croissant.`
`His breakfast plate was empty, but Battler hadn't eaten any of it.`
`...The biggest glutton of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory,`
` Beelzebub, had waited for Ronove to leave, and had then come to snatch the food away.`
`Battler had noticed, and they'd been really noisy ever since.`
`Even though Beelzebub only had to give it back immediately or else throw it into her own mouth right away,`
` she intentionally ran around in circles, making fun of Battler.`
`"Give my breakfast back, dammiiiit!!`
` If you give it back now, I'll let you off with a single flick to the forehead.`
` But just you try eating it!!"`
`"What, are you gonna eat me up insteeead?!`
` Kyaha!`
` If you think you can, just try it! I'll bet I'll be as sweet as honey pancakes.`
`'!s0`
`"Gotcha!!`
` Right now, I want to eat that bread even more than your thighs.`
` Be a good girl and give it heeeeeeeeere, `
`fugagigigigi...!!`
` So, you resist until the eeeeeeeeeend...!!"`
`"Ugugugugu!!`
` No way, no way, I won't give it to yooou!!`
` Even the croissant wants me to eat iiit!!!"`
`"Y-Yaay, yahooooooooo, g'moooooorning, Battleeeer!!`
` Are you still moping so early in the morniiing?!?!`
` It's the beginning of a new day, and a new game, so let's get our spirits uuuuuuuuuup!!"`
`...She flung the door open.`
`Like a marathon runner drawn on a certain caramel box, `
`with her hands held high and an idiotic cheeriness, `
`...Beato appeared.`
`For some reason, flags from around the world and confetti scattered about, perfectly completing this magnificent entrance.`
`...Battler and Beelzebub, who had been fighting over the croissant, completely forgot about their argument, speechless.`
`"K...Kyahahahaha!`
` Good morning, Beatrice-sama!`
` I'll just be on my way now!`
` Here, Battler-kun, say aaah!"`
`'!s0`
` Mmm mmm, *chomp*, ...*gulp*.`
` ...`
`...H-Hey, morning, Beato...`
` ...Glad to see you're cheery this morning."`
`............`
`Beato and Battler looked at each other.`
`...It seemed neither had a clue what was going on with the other.`
`"B-Battleer...?`
`'!s0`
`he looks totally fine, doesn't heeeeeeeeeeeee?!!`
` He isn't clutching his knees!`
` And he's answering!`
` Wait a sec, he was even in the middle of eating!!"`
`"Pukukukukuku!!`
` No, no, he was sleeping like a baby in his futon, clutching his knees.`
` I informed him that it was time to wake up, but he just wouldn't rise.`
` I tried to feed him, but it seems that a naughty cat wandered in and prevented that.`
` Pu ku ku, pu ku ku ku ku!"`
`'!s1`
`Gwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!!`
` You tricked meeeeeeeeeee...!!"`
`"Tch, you should talk.`
` Weren't you the one who played that massive trick last time?`
` I don't have a clue what's going on, but it looks like you got what you deserved."`
`"...By the way, Ronove, nice one."`
`"Pukukuku, thank you very much, Battler-sama."`
`The two men stuck up their thumbs as though they understood each other, chuckling together.`
`For a while, Beato was very energetic, trying to hide her embarrassment...`
`"Heh.`
` Don't take me so lightly.`
` Did you really think I'd still be hiding in a corner, holding my knees?"`
`"*cackle*`
` Then who was that person crying their eyes out in frustration last time?`
` You could've gathered your tears in a jar and called it face lotion."`
`"Sh-Shut up.`
` That was, um, just because I was a little surprised by your crappy act.`
` I might've looked a little lame, but don't think the same move'll work twice."`
`"Of course not.`
` And don't disappoint me by falling for the same move over and over again, okay?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Ihihi, yeah, just you watch.`
` I'll show you that I'm a guy who gets stronger every time he's beaten down."`
`"......But Beato."`
`"Yes, what?"`
`"Don't do it again."`
`"Hoh?`
` Why's that?`
` So you really are weak against a rear attack?"`
`"......You and I are enemies,`
` and we'll certainly never join forces...`
` I now understand that clearly.`
` ...So don't you ever try to trick me about that fact again."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` You say that, but knowing your weaknesses, I'll......"`
`Beato thought they were still joking around, ...but that tone had disappeared from Battler's expression some time ago.`
`Beato felt as though his eyes were like the surface of black tea that had cooled down...`
`"You hear me?`
` Don't do it again."`
`"......`
`...I don't get it.`
` I might do it again when you've forgotten, right...?"`
`"Don't do it again."`
`"......Nnn........."`
`Pierced by his strong and forceful gaze, Beato held her tongue.`
`Maybe she was certain that Battler would break that silence with laughter.`
`...However, Battler's serious expression didn't change in the slightest.`
`So to break that silence, Beato had no choice but to start laughing herself.`
`"*cackle*cackle* Hahhahahahahah, hahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` Very well.`
` You and I are worthy opponents.`
` No matter how friendly our relationship, we'll never be anything more than a pair of enemies.`
` If you have not mistaken this, that is enough for me."`
`"...That's right.`
` I almost forgot you were my enemy for a second there.`
` I won't embarrass myself like that again.`
` ...I won't fall for your rear attack again.`
` Never again...!"`
`"............`
`...Hmph!`
` Hahhahahyahhahha!!`
` It seems I'm not the only one who cannot wait for the fourth game.`
` I am pleased, Battler.`
` Come, take your seat."`
`"...Yep.`
` Just how I like it.`
` ...Clever little tricks won't work anymore."`
`"Stop acting so tough.`
` You remain in a state of surrender for the last mystery in the previous game, the mystery of Nanjo's murder...!"`
`"......My answer for that one's still on hold for now.`
` But that doesn't mean that I've lost heart.`
` I'll definitely break your 'red truth'...and show that I can deny witches...!"`
`"Hmph.`
` A commendable attitude.`
` You truly are a man like a phoenix.`
` Don't betray my expectations!`
` With that, let us raise the curtains on the fourth game.`
` But before that, `
`it seems we must welcome a new guest."`
`"A guest..."`
`"You remember as well, correct?`
` That mystery girl, who appeared at the very end of the last game without an invitation, ruining my fun."`
`"...That person......"`
`"She says she wants to join our game.`
` I sent her an official invitation, inviting her to join this match.`
` Ronove, summon our guest."`
`"...There's no need.`
` I'm already here."`
`The voice that answered Beato's call came from the darkness in a corner of the room.`
`When Battler turned around in surprise, he could now see that mystery girl there.`
`"My, my.`
` How rude.`
` All you had to do is greet us as soon as you arrived."`
`"I don't make a habit of talking to people before punching them.`
` After I punch is a different story though."`
`"Hoh, and what would you say?"`
`"#fefefe<Good night, `
`have a nice dream>#ffffff."`
`"*cackle*cackle* Hahhahhahahahahahaha!`
` How amusing, how truly amusing...!"`
`Beato cackled and clapped her hands.`
`But that was only Beato, and nothing rose to Battler's face except a bitter smile.`
`"...Whew.`
` You sure are a fighter."`
`"............"`
`Battler and the girl's eyes met, and he shrugged his shoulders as he spoke.`
`But the girl didn't answer, giving only a cold stare in return.`
`"...You helped me out at the end of the last game.`
` Thanks for that."`
`"I don't need your gratitude.`
` You were just slacking off.`
` I only told you to open your eyes."`
`"Kuhhyahhyahhya!`
` That's so true, stop slacking off, Battler, hyahhyahha!"`
`Beato tried to laugh as though sympathizing with her, but it didn't reach the girl's ears.`
`She did absolutely nothing except stare at Battler with ice-cold eyes.`
`"......Well, it looks like someone hates me."`
`"I'm just annoyed that you aren't taking this fight seriously."`
`"Are you saying I'm not serious about this...?"`
`"Don't tell me that travesty earlier was you being serious.`
` ...Don't take me for a fool.`
` How long do you intend to play along with the witch's farce like this?"`
`"...I'm fighting Beato in my own way.`
` And doing it seriously, of course."`
`"Seriously?`
` ......Don't make me laugh.`
` You keep on drinking tea and chatting with a witch for all eternity and call that fighting seriously?`
` Keep the jokes to just your hairdo."`
`"...Well, that's because I wasn't used to this witch's game in the beginning, and I've been through a lot of harsh stuff.`
` Still, I'm finally starting to see how to fight, and I'm getting the knack of doing it.`
` ...If the pathetic way I've been acting makes it look like I haven't been serious to you, you're just wrong."`
`"......Is that so?"`
`"Of course, I know I've gotta close in a lot more before I can grab Beato by the collar.`
` But no matter how long that distance may be, it's still finite.`
` And in each game that passes, I'm steadily closing that distance step by step!"`
`"No matter how long it takes, I'll close in on that witch, and I'll definitely checkmate her.`
` ...It might take a thousand years, to use her phrase.`
` ...But even so, I'll definitely win sooner or later.`
` Why?`
` Because I definitely won't accept losing.`
` I definitely won't stop moving forward, closing in on her!`
` In other words, there's just one thing I can say for sure."`
`'!s0`
` That's how it is."`
`"You really don't sound like you're in a hurry.`
` Are you even trying to win?`
` Even the finite can become endless if you treat it the wrong way.`
` By now, you've become an Achilles who couldn't even outstrip a turtle.`
` ......I get it. So this is why I'm needed.`
` At this rate, there's no way you could win against the Endless Witch even after a billion years."`
`"...Who are you?`
` It's not like you'll be struck by lightning if you just tell me your name."`
`"............"`
`At that point, the girl fell silent, gazing straight into Battler's eyes.`
`At first, Battler faltered under the firmness of that look, and his gaze wavered slightly, but then his eyes gradually began to be sucked into the pupils that were staring at him.`
`...Then, inside those eyes, he saw a light that he'd seen sometime before...`
`Battler was struck by how strongly they resembled the eyes of a girl who definitely couldn't be here, `
`...even though that was completely impossible.`
`"...I know it's stupid, `
`...but for some reason, it feels true to me.`
` But that can't be right.`
` ...That person's supposed to still be six years old.`
`'!s1`
`...Ange, could you......?"`
`".........`
`If I were to say 'That's right', ...would you believe me?"`
`"Nn......"`
`"I'll put it another way.`
` If I said 'I am your ally, so trust me', `
`would you believe it?`
` Would you unconditionally trust some unknown girl you're meeting for the first time just because she looks a little like someone you know?"`
`"...It's because you're such a softy that you got tricked so easily in the last game and cried so bitterly.`
` ...You said it yourself.`
` That kid is six, right?`
` Do I look like I'm six?`
` If I were to claim that I'm that kid despite that, would you just swallow that story?"`
`"...If you say it like that, `
`...there's no way I can argue back.`
` ...Sorry.`
` That's right, I am a softy.`
` And that should've been made clear to me after the last game.`
` ...Is that what you meant when you said I wasn't being serious?"`
`"Yes.`
` You may think you're fighting against a witch, but you're just getting along with her and playing.`
` ...You're just playing at fighting in a friendly game of chess."`
`"That may be a serious contest for you two,`
` but looking at it from far away, I only see you playing around and following the rules like you're good friends."`
`"......`
`...Ihihihi.`
` That's harsh."`
`"But as long as you're unable to win at this game, you won't be released from this place.`
` ...That's why I came.`
` I came to bring this game to its conclusion.`
` ...You claim that you're closing in on the witch, but you're just like a hamster running around in a wheel."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Oh, one of those? Those things that run around and around in place, night after night?"`
`"At a glance, you might think that running around in a wheel is endless.`
` ...The Endless Witch Beatrice.`
` It's just like you.`
` He thinks he's fighting, but he's actually just running around in a wheel while making a fool of himself."`
`"...This isn't a game.`
` This is nothing more than a cage to shut him up in...for all eternity."`
`"Hoh.`
` ...You liken my Endless to something like a wheel that a mouse plays in?`
` Interesting, interesting, *cackle*..."`
`"Something that's endless in a certain dimension can be less than endless in a higher one.`
` The fact that a Menger sponge has infinite surface area only matters in a world of less than three dimensions.`
` In the three-dimensional world of reality, it has zero mass.`
` Not only is it not endless, it doesn't even exist."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!`
` What an assertive woman.`
` It seems you are worthy of being called my enemy."`
`"......Who...are you?"`
`"I am your ally.`
` And an enemy of witches.`
` ......Of course, you don't have to believe it.`
` No one can prove that I really am your ally.`
` On the contrary, it's more desirable that you keep your guard up strongly enough to find me very suspicious."`
`"......That's right.`
` Last time ended up pretty bad.`
` I've got to be at least that careful.`
` ...I don't plan on getting tricked twice."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`Beato laughed in a truly pleased way, which was humiliating only to Battler.`
`"People don't just get tricked out of the blue.`
` That only happens when they fail to check things for themselves and leave it to other people.`
` ...Saying that you thought the light had turned green just because you saw other people start crossing doesn't count as an excuse for getting into an accident.`
` Get it...?"`
`"Yeah, ...I get it.`
` ...You're telling me not to swallow information given to me by others, but to think for myself.`
` ......In the past, I swallowed all the magic Beato showed me.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~I stopped thinking~ib~`
`.`
` So I was useless."`
`Battler grimaced as he remembered his many painful losses.`
`...The witch watched and laughed again, putting on a bold appearance.`
`"I'll offer you advice in a way that works to your advantage.`
` Of course, you shouldn't swallow everything I say.`
` Because no one can provide certain proof that I'm your ally."`
`In the last game, Virgilia, who I thought was an ally, was actually on the witch's side.`
`...Battler couldn't rid his head of that eerie smile worn by Virgilia, a person he'd once even thought of as trustworthy and reliable.`
`"So I don't need you to unconditionally trust me.`
` You might as well take my advice as nothing more than an opinion to be considered.`
` After all, ...the player who's fighting in a game against the witch`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~is you~ib~`
`"...That's right.`
` Saying I lost because I followed the moves of an outsider would be just too pathetic of an excuse."`
`"Oh yes!`
` My opponent is Battler.`
` You are nothing more than an outsider.`
` You should bear that in mind.`
` *cackle*!"`
`"No, I'm not an outsider.`
` With Beatrice and Ushiromiya Battler...`
`and I who gaze down from above, it's almost like a fight in the shape of a triangle.`
` At a glance, it might not look like a united front, but having a united front doesn't necessarily mean fighting together."`
`"Hoh.`
` What an odd thing to say."`
`"Just now, he described fighting with you as closing the distance.`
` But you can't measure distance with a single eye.`
` Only with two eyes are things visible in three dimensions, and only then can distance be judged.`
` ...And even when you have two fields of vision, it's pointless if they're in the same place.`
` You can pin down witches more accurately when they're far apart."`
`"...Shooting from different positions and different angles.`
` ...So, basically, it's crossfire.`
` Heheh, interesting."`
`"We're shooting...from different positions...and different angles.`
` ...So I won't get along with anybody.`
` That's how I'll keep my own position separate and catch the witch in a pincer attack."`
`"......Are you okay with this, Battleer?`
` This girl may actually be an ambush I set up, right?`
` She might just be saying something plausible to gain your trust, right...?"`
`"...Maybe.`
` She's been saying that over and over again herself.`
` ...So of course, I can't blindly accept her advice.`
` But as to whether she's worthy of trust or not, I can think for myself and make a decision.`
` As long as I don't stop thinking for myself, I won't be tricked by anyone again...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` What confidence, Ushiromiya Battleer!`
` After you've said so much, `
`it makes me want to trick you all over again, you see......?`
` I can't wait to see what kind of face you'll make when you realize you've been duped once more!`
` How pleasant, kuhhahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"......It looks like you know my name, but I don't know yours.`
` ...Tell me."`
`"............"`
`For a while, the girl remained silent, without changing her expression even once.`
`...She looked as though she couldn't decide whether to say her name or not...or possibly, as though she was deciding on the name she'd say on the spot.`
`"...Gretel."`
`"Ghetto?`
` You are?"`
`"That's my name, dumbass.`
` Call me Gretel."`
`"Then should I call myself Hansel?`
` Ihihihi, just kidding, I'm Ushiromiya Battler!`
` Call me Battler."`
`"......Nice to meet you.`
` ...I hate handshakes.`
` Don't take it personally."`
`"...Ah, really? Sorry.`
` After all, it isn't certain that you're my ally.`
` ...And you just told me to keep my guard up too."`
`Battler drew back his right hand, which he had stuck out.`
`His bitter smile disappeared...and was replaced with a strong resolve directed at this new fourth game.`
`"Battler,`
` ...think deeply about why you must win against this witch.`
` ...You can't stop with something abstract, like 'I'll beat her because I don't like it'.`
` ...Have a deep conviction that you'll definitely defeat the witch and escape from this world."`
`"......Because there is definitely...`
`...someone waiting for you to come back.`
` ...For that kid's sake as well, `
`........."`
`Maybe there was something she wanted to say.`
`Gretel clenched her fists in front of her chest and hung her head in silence, at a loss for words for a short while.`
`As though smashing through that silence, Beato spoke up in a forceful voice.`
`"Good, that should be enough of an introduction for Gretel or whoever!`
` Come, try to remember, what happened on October 4!`
` Kuhhihihihihihihi, let the curtain open on the fourth game!!"`
`At the same time, as though it had been blown by a sudden gust of wind, the clock that had been turned back to October 4, 1986...started to move.`
`While we remained in the witch's tea room, the blue-gray sea and the green Rokkenjima spread out beneath us, `
`...and we could see a boat heading there, its wake trailing behind it.`
`The sky was already cloudy, and it seemed that the barrier of the typhoon would soon shut the island away.`
`There was the boat docked in the harbor...`
`...and Gohda, helping to unload it.`
`Then, `
`...once all of its passengers had disembarked, `
`...the boat began to separate from the shoreline.`
`The relatives were gradually swallowed up by the island.`
`"Ahhahahaha!`
` Looks like you're as cheery as ever, Maria."`
`"Maria-chan, you'll trip if you aren't careful.`
` Look out...!"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Gonna faaall, faaall, siiink, siiink, *giggle*!"`
`...The long-missed cousins I had loved dashed across the beach,`
` ...getting swallowed by the forest path that led to the mansion, and disappeared.`
`And of course, Onii-chan could be seen among them too.`
`"...Daaamn it!!`
` Stop right there, Maria!!`
` You nimble little brat!"`
`"*giggle*! Uu-uu-uu-!`
` *giggle*giggle*!"`
`Maria onee-chan, whom I'd loved, started dashing, and Onii-chan chased after her.`
`They were swallowed up by the forest.`
`Following them, Father and Mother were also swallowed up.`
`The rest of the parents were swallowed up...`
`...They were swallowed up, leaving only me behind...`
`Dumbass...`
`How long are you gonna joke around and play with a witch in a place like this...?`
`Come back quickly, ...Onii-chan...!`
`Don't leave me all alone...!`
`And realize.`
`Realize how cruel and lonely the world I'm isolated in is...`
`"Good day to you."`
`"......G-Good day to you."`
`'Good day to you' is the standard greeting used here.`
`No matter how many years pass by, this style of greeting still feels very awkward...`
`Even though I'd responded to the greeting in order to stifle that awkward feeling, `
`the classmate who had spoken looked at me blankly.`
`"...Huh?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*"`
`"Huuuh, what's that?`
` It seems you're mistaken, *giggle*giggle*..."`
`Their choice of words and manner were certainly what you'd expect from a school for rich girls,`
` but the actual meaning was as innocent and cruel as you'd expect from kids of that age.`
`...It seems they found it funny that I'd mistakenly thought the greeting was directed at me.`
` No, it might be the opposite.`
`...Maybe they didn't know how to react after being suddenly greeted by a gloomy, quiet kid like me.`
`No, judging by the gazes of my classmates, who were looking this way over their shoulders and whispering to each other,`
` it looked as though some of them considered this refreshing morning ruined.`
`...I was...dark.`
` Because I was disliked.`
`So, trying not to get in the way of everyone's refreshing morning any more, I stooped lower and entered the classroom.`
`...Almost like I was cutting through the aisle in a movie theater while the movie was running.`
`This is an all-dorm school, Saint Lucia Academy.`
`It's not a school that anyone can get into by taking a test.`
`...It's a hidden rich girls' school, known of only by a select group of celebrities from various fields.`
`For lofty nobles who truly wish their daughters could be raised like saints,`
` this is probably the ideal school in which to protect them from the impurities of the common world.`
`...But at the same time, it was probably also convenient for nobles who wanted to confine daughters they didn't want out in public.`
`As well as an academy isolated from the impurities of the common world, it also held excellent potential as a prison school.`
`I was truly among the latter...and was confined in Saint Lucia Academy,`
` ...forced to live my life in dreariness.`
`Of course, there weren't that many students like me, and you couldn't tell us apart at a glance.`
`However, even if we never fessed up about it, you could usually figure out who we were by watching how we acted.`
`...After all, we were always hanging our heads, with an expression on our faces as though the whole world had abandoned us.`
`Anyway, every class had one or two kids like that, so even if they didn't speak up about it, you could guess who they were.`
`Therefore.`
`Even though I never confessed that I was one of those kids, at some point, everyone in my class knew about it...`
`Just like how the seriousness of an injury becomes a sign of status in a hospital room, how noble a birth one had became a sign of status here.`
`Those girls who couldn't be acknowledged in public were probably nothing more than filth to the others.`
`They must've thought that getting involved with such students would dirty them as well.`
`When a rumor sprang up about a particular student, `
`those fastidious girls would grow cold and distant, chasing that student out of all social groups.`
`Thanks to that, I led a quiet school life like this, all by myself...`
`Well, that's only if hearing people whisper behind my back, finding my things lost or broken all the time, and having everyone pretend like they didn't know anything...`
`can be called a quiet school life.`
`Even this early in the morning, I must look worn out.`
`...I can almost understand why my other classmates, who had a refreshing morning, looked at my face and wanted to click their tongues.`
`Consciously trying to do as I should and avoid tainting my classmates' morning, I quietly took my seat.`
`...Then, unusually, someone came to talk to me.`
` It was the class leader.`
`"Good day to you, Ushiromiya-san.`
` ...You seem to be in a bad mood this morning.`
` Were you able to get enough sleep?"`
`"......Is there some business you have with me?"`
`"You're the only one who has not submitted her questionnaire for the class presentation, Ushiromiya-san.`
` Did you forget that the deadline was yesterday?"`
`...I'm pretty sure I heard something about that last week.`
`But I'd thought that the questionnaire hadn't been passed out yet.`
`The details would be written there, so there shouldn't have been any need to remember them beforehand...`
`"...I wasn't given a questionnaire..."`
`"That can't be.`
` I believe the dormitory leader handed them out to everyone.`
` If you lost it, all you have to do is honestly say so."`
`"......I lost it.`
` I'll fill it in right now, so could you give me a sheet?"`
`Again.`
` ...Either someone lost my sheet, or they intentionally didn't tell me about it.`
`But I have no way of knowing who was behind that.`
`In the end, treating it as though it was my own carelessness would settle everything more quickly...`
`"Once you've filled it out, drop it in the questionnaire box in the student council room yourself.`
` Our class is the only one that didn't get everyone's in by yesterday."`
`As I hung my head at the class leader's scolding,`
` I could hear the giggles and whispers of people watching, coming from no direction in particular...`
`Ushiromiya-san did it again.`
`She's just so careless.`
`She doesn't deserve to be in this school.`
`She has no dignity, and no manners either.`
`...Sorry girls, but I've dealt with much worse when it comes to unfair personal attacks.`
`As I froze my heart and let those arrows of ridicule pass by, I quickly filled out the questionnaire...`
`When I learned that Father and Mother and Onii-chan...and all the rest of my family had died, `
`I was at the house of my Grandpa on my mother's side.`
`The only survivor of the accident was...Ushiromiya Eva.`
` ...Only Aunt Eva.`
`Even at the time, I hadn't really liked Aunt Eva.`
`At a glance, she would act kindly, `
`but even as young as I was, I could see that she was somehow making fun of Father and the rest, and I hadn't liked it.`
`So when it was decided that Aunt Eva would take care of me, I was pretty miserable.`
`Maybe it wouldn't have mattered if that gentle Uncle Hideyoshi and George onii-chan had been with me,`
` but I hated the thought of living all alone with Aunt Eva.`
`I'd frankly said that to Grandpa, hoping to live together in his house.`
`However, Aunt Eva had been very insistent that she should be the one to look after me.`
`She had no desire to remarry, so as her successor, I was essential if the Ushiromiya family was to continue.`
`Aunt Eva felt very strongly about the family.`
`She insisted that she take charge of me right away, so that she could give me an education and lifestyle fitting for a successor.`
`After that, it seems that confusing negotiations with lawyers took place.`
`...But in the end, I was forced to go live with Aunt Eva.`
`After doing that, Aunt Eva told me something.`
`You must bear all of the glory and history of the Ushiromiya family.`
`And in order to make you a fitting successor to bear that, the rest of your life will be dedicated to frantic studying.`
` Sacrifice the rest of your life for the Ushiromiya family.`
`...That's what she said.`
`At first, I thought she meant that literally.`
`But I quickly realized that wasn't the case.`
`Because even now, in Aunt Eva's eyes,`
` the one most fitting to succeed her was the late George onii-chan.`
`At our first meal together, I received strict instructions and questioning about table manners...`
`and was forced to listen to her abuse Mom and Dad as though they'd been neglectful in their discipline.`
`I also received the same strict instructions regarding manners at my first party,`
` and my clumsiness had been disparaged in front of everybody, forcing me to endure insults to Mom and Dad as well.`
`After that repeated over and over, I eventually began to understand.`
`Aunt Eva didn't really want to make me her successor.`
`She thought George onii-chan was the only one truly suited to be her successor,`
` ...and she couldn't forgive the fact that it was to be me instead.`
`So she insulted me in front of lots of people.`
` She humiliated me.`
`And she made it known exactly how I was inferior to George onii-chan to both acquaintances and strangers,`
` ...surely in place of a memorial service for her dead son...`
` ...Or rather, ...she must still be mourning his death.`
`...However, that wasn't something I could endure.`
`I couldn't possibly live together with Aunt Eva.`
`...I was kept like a pet, my life continually compared with her dead son's.`
`I understood that even when I was still in elementary school.`
`I tried to escape the Ushiromiya house and run off to the house of my Grandpa on my mother's side.`
`However, Aunt Eva had already foreseen that.`
`...No, thinking back on it, she might've lured me into escaping.`
`I was caught by the guards and brought back,`
` ......and for being a coward who had smeared the Ushiromiya family crest with mud and tried to throw it away,`
` ......in a way that makes my whole body shake and shiver just remembering it, `
`......I was punished.`
`How should I describe what Aunt Eva was like when she punished me?`
`In a frenzy?`
` Gleeful?`
`...I saw the anger and sadness of losing her beloved son, and well as the hatred and pain from me stealing that inheritance from the son who should've received it.`
` And the dark pleasure at being able to let those feelings out on me.`
`...I was hit with all those negative emotions at once.`
`Then, all of my free time and freedom to act was stolen, and I was put under surveillance around the clock.`
`I may have lived in a gorgeous mansion, dressed in expensive clothes,`
` ...but my heart and my dignity had been trampled upon, and I was the Ushiromiya family's slave, `
`...its cattle.`
`Compared to that lifestyle, the derisive laughter of my classmates here was calm and pleasant.`
` ...It caused my heart no trouble...`
`After burying almost all of the fields of the questionnaire with 'nothing in particular', I folded it and put it in my pocket.`
`...Because if I left it in my desk, it might 'disappear' again.`
`During lunch break, after dropping it off at the postbox in the student council room, `
`I finished lunch by myself, as usual, and headed behind the school building, where no one could be seen.`
`...Only my time by myself could protect me from the derisive laughter and gossip.`
`Since I was hated and didn't have a single friend, my time alone was the most kind to me.`
`After checking the surrounding bushes to see whether some malicious classmates were hiding and threatening my time of quiet, `
`I finally relaxed the tension from my entire body, knowing that I had gained some true peace.`
`Then, ...I let out a sigh.`
`...It faltered, heavy, as though it was the first time I had breathed out today.`
`My old favorite place behind the vegetable garden storehouse...`
`had been found out by my classmates, and I'd been teased, so this was my new lunchtime hideaway...`
`There was nowhere to sit behind the school building.`
`As I crouched near the wall in the shadow of the bushes, I opened my bag and took out a book with an elaborate, old-fashioned binding...`
`Just glancing at it, you'd probably think it was a religious book or something written in the Middle Ages.`
`But this wasn't a book.`
` It was a diary.`
`Of course, it wasn't my diary.`
`......There weren't any special things worth writing about in my daily life.`
`Every single day was just gray, ...cold and dry.`
`In those completely unchanging days, there aren't any changes worth writing down.`
`This was...the diary of Maria onee-chan, a girl I'd been very close to.`
`She'd been a bit strange and three years older than me, but Onee-chan was always a warm, wonderful cousin.`
`She would always grab me by the hand and let me join in on some fun game.`
`...I remembered that being able to see her was the most fun part of our family gatherings...`
`When I opened the diary, the characters, which were made fairly skillfully considering that this was an elementary schooler,`
` were packed close together, though they were written on every other line.`
`Was she just hopelessly obsessed with jotting everything down in her diary?`
` ...Probably not.`
`To her, writing her daily life down in a diary was probably like having a conversation with another part of herself.`
`So rather than an object on which the events of her day were written down,`
` Maria onee-chan's diary was written like a letter to another part of herself, telling of the events of that day.`
`I found this diary among her belongings after her death and secretly took it home.`
`At first, I'd felt that reading someone else's diary might be boorish...and satisfied myself with just keeping it by my side,`
` ...but I couldn't help flipping through the pages and reading through it bit by bit.`
`And by now, she had `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~become my only friend~ib~`
`.`
`I gently opened to the page with the bookmark.`
`"...Sorry to keep you waiting, Maria onee-chan.`
` ...Could you let me hear your story again...?"`
`At the same time, `
`...a very, very soft breeze blew, tickling the paper.`
`I thought the open diary might have sparkled faintly.`
`...The weather's good today.`
`Maria onee-chan loves the wonderful rays of sunlight.`
`So I'm sure she's in a good mood.`
`On the pages of the open diary...no, in the world of the diary, Maria onee-chan showed herself...`
`I'm pretty sure she was nine when she died.`
` ...So her form was already younger than me.`
`But I call her Onee-chan, so she affectionately calls me Ange.`
`"Uu-.`
` Ange, you were slow getting here today.`
` Was it packed at lunch...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` It's always packed.`
` Groups of friends set up camp in the seats, and they stay there even after they've finished eating.`
` It's pretty fatal if you get to the dining hall late.`
` ...I was on cleanup duty today."`
`"...Uu-!`
` I eat fast!`
` The faster you eat, the more you can play!`
` Uu-!"`
`Maybe she realized I was holding a grudge because that duty had been forced upon me and shortened my lunch break by a bit.`
`Maria onee-chan brightly changed the subject.`
`Grateful for that act of kindness, I responded by saying I was a slow eater.`
`Maria calmed me down, saying something about teaching me the trick to eating fast.`
`I read about it in her diary.`
` No, I heard it from Maria onee-chan.`
`She was ranked number 1 among the girls in the speed-eating ranking for her grade's newspaper.`
`She was apparently very proud of that, but a little disappointed that her mother, Aunt Rosa, hadn't praised her very much for it.`
`"Uu-!`
` Then, let's start our story for today.`
` How far did we get yesterday?`
` Uu-?"`
`"Umm...`
` This far.`
` Until you got Sakutaro as a present, Maria onee-chan.`
` ...You promised that you'd tell me about Sakutaro."`
`"Uu-!`
` Let's talk about Sakutaro!`
` You know, Sakutaro is a reeeally cute stuffed animal!`
` I'm sure you'd like him too, Ange!`
` Uu-!"`
`"Yeah.`
` Tell me that story.`
` ...The only time I can relax at school...is when I'm listening to your stories during lunch break."`
`"Uu-!`
` I'll tell you about it!`
` Sakutaro was really, umm, umm!"`
`When I looked at Maria onee-chan, who was always in a good mood, it made my heart feel warm as well.`
`As I listened to her tale, I began to get absorbed into her world...`
`"Happy Birthday, Maria.`
` Sorry I got back so late."`
`"Uu-!`
` Good job with your work, Mama!`
` I know you're busy, so even though you were late, I waited without crying.`
` I was good and waited, watching TV!"`
`"Yes, you're such a good girl, Maria.`
` As a present for waiting politely, you can order anything you want today.`
` Of course, only as much as you can eat, okay?"`
`"Uu-uu-!`
` Today, can I change my corn soup to onion gratin soup?!"`
`"Yes, that's fine."`
`"Uu-uu-!`
` It's 200 yen more expensive, but can I change it to prosciutto pizza?!"`
`"Yes, that's fine.`
` If you really can eat it.`
` ...But that's okay.`
` It's your birthday, after all.`
` There must be a reward for the good girl who waited so patiently."`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!`
` Then, then, can I have enchilada cheesecake for dessert?!`
` And then, and then, the chef's choice fruit salad and kids' french fries!`
` I want to drink melon soda too!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!`
` I'm a good girl, I'm a good girl!`
` Mama praised me, uu-uu-uu-♪"`
`"*giggle*`
` You're getting a little too excited.`
` If you don't quiet down a bit, you'll disturb the other customers."`
`When Rosa gently admonished her, Maria stuck her tongue out and eased up a little.`
` ...But it seemed that she was having a hard time repressing her excitement at being able to eat out with her mother after such a long time.`
`Today was Maria's birthday.`
`Rosa always tried to let Maria spend her birthdays at great restaurants.`
`When Maria had been in kindergarten, they sometimes invited other kids from the neighborhood over and had a party at home.`
`Rosa would make a wonderful cake and snacks and decorate the house herself, making it a huge celebration.`
`But when they moved and Maria no longer had friends in the neighborhood, Rosa had started splurging at expensive restaurants instead.`
`However, today, they were in a normal family restaurant.`
`It was also a little late in the day for a kid like Maria to eat there, even with a parent.`
`Actually, she had gotten reservations at a fantastic place that would surely have pleased Maria.`
` Of course, she had also prepared a wonderful cake with Maria's name written on it.`
`...But Rosa just hadn't been able to finish up her business...and had been forced to cancel.`
`Since that plan had been traded for a local family restaurant, Rosa felt a little indebted to Maria.`
`So she was prepared to spoil Maria a bit and let her have whatever she wanted tonight...`
`"...You never used to eat much, did you, Maria onee-chan?`
` Was it really all right to order that much?"`
`"Uu-.`
` I can't eat very much, but I like to have a lot lined up.`
` You know, like on a birthday table?`
` If it's colored all over with red and blue and green and yellow, it makes you really happy!"`
`"...You're right.`
` Having your birthday table be colorful can make you feel happy.`
` ...Birthdays at my place were no match for yours, Maria onee-chan, but the cakes we bought at the Fumiya store in front of the station were always gorgeous..."`
`Ange thought back to her own birthdays nostalgically.`
`Even though Dad was busy, he sometimes came home just to show up at my birthday party...and then went right back to his company.`
`At the time, I was sad, but now I understand how important I was to Dad.`
`Of course, Mom also took very good care of me.`
`In particular, her birthday presents were always in excellent taste,`
` and she sometimes arranged for them several months in advance.`
`Even though we always sent an invitation to Battler onii-chan, he didn't get along with Dad or something, so he kept not coming.`
`...So when he did come, I was really happy...`
`...The birthday parties when the whole four-person family gathered made for fun memories that I'll never forget...`
`"Uu-.`
` Ange's birthdays sound like a lot of fun too.`
` Battler and Uncle Rudolf are really lively.`
` Yay, yay, *giggle*.`
` Battler got covered in cola, ahahahaha."`
`Maria onee-chan peeked into my happy memory.`
`As I sat quietly, wearing the origami helmet that Dad had made for fun, I was a little embarrassed.`
`In my hand was a paper gun that Battler onii-chan had folded for me.`
`...And Mom was taking a commemorative photo.`
` It was the happiest moment of my life.`
`"But your birthday's no worse, Maria onee-chan.`
` And this is the day you get him, right?`
` Sakutaro."`
`"Uu-!`
` I was reeeally looking forward to it.`
` I got so excited, wondering when Mama would show me the wrapped present in the corner of her bag."`
`'Sakutaro' is the name of a stuffed animal that Maria was to receive that day.`
`For quite some time before then, Aunt Rosa had been making a stuffed animal to give Maria as a present today.`
`Hearing that it was a cute lion stuffed animal, `
`Maria onee-chan had already given it the name Sakutaro, even though she hadn't received it yet.`
`Today, she was looking forward to meeting Sakutaro even more than her own birthday.`
`Aunt Rosa ran a clothing design company.`
`It seemed to be some kind of brand name.`
` ...What was it, Anti-Rosa...?`
`It seems their catch phrase was 'I can't forgive the me of yesterday'.`
`...Unfortunately, I've never met someone who knew of that brand name.`
`Maybe it wasn't that famous.`
`So Aunt Rosa was pretty skilled with her hands.`
`I heard that she made some of the clothing she wore herself.`
`So making a stuffed animal had to be well within her capabilities.`
`"...A hand-made stuffed animal... That's pretty amazing.`
` By the way, why did you call it Sakutaro?"`
`"Uu-.`
` Actually wanted to call it 'Sakura'.`
` But it's a male lion, so she told me to give it a boy's name.`
` So I added a boy-like 'tarou' and called him 'Sakutarou'.`
` Eventually, the last 'u' disappeared!"`
`"Why 'Sakura'?"`
`"Uu-!`
` The main character in Card Master Sakura!"`
`It was the name of the main character in a TV anime that was popular at the time.`
`...The fact that she'd simply borrowed the name of a character she liked was...how should I say it...as innocent and cute as you'd expect from someone that age.`
`"Uu-!`
` Mama, Mama!`
` Still no Sakutaro?`
` I wanna let Sakutaro join in on my birthday too."`
`"Presents always come at the end, right?`
` If you open it now, it'll get dirty.`
` Hold on until the meal is over."`
`"Then I'll finish eating quickly!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!"`
`As soon as she proclaimed that, she started tearing into her meal.`
`Aunt Rosa got mad at her, saying that was rude.`
`It seemed that she'd expected this would happen right away.`
`I also thought that, given how straightforward Maria was, that was probably what she'd do,`
` so it was kind of pleasant when my expectations weren't betrayed.`
`In the end, Aunt Rosa lost to her daughter's eyes, which were sparkling with anticipation,`
` cleaned up the table, and took out the long-awaited wrapped present.`
`"Happy birthday, Maria.`
` ...I wasn't able to spend much time on it, so I couldn't make it very well..."`
`"Uu-!`
` If you made it, I'll be happy with anything!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!`
` Sakutaro-, Sakutaro-uu-uu-!"`
`Aunt Rosa spoke a bit humbly, but Maria onee-chan was happy even before opening the wrapping.`
`...I could really understand that feeling.`
`It's not a problem of quality.`
`Just the fact that it was a handmade present was more pleasing than anything.`
`"Can I open it?`
` Can I open it?!"`
`"I wanted to wait until we got back home before doing it, `
`...but...just for a bit, okay?`
` We'll just take a look and say hello, then put it back.`
` You can give him a proper greeting once we get home.`
` We're in public, so you can't fool around, okay?`
` Can you promise?"`
`"Uu-!`
` Promise, promise!`
` So can I open it?`
` Can I open iiit?`
` Mamaaa."`
`"Yes, yes, just for a bit, okay?"`
`"Yaaaaaaaaaaayy...☆"`
`Before Aunt Rosa finished talking, Maria started unwrapping it.`
`As soon as she did, ...yellow and orange peeked out.`
`What appeared was a slightly blank-looking lion stuffed animal, `
`with cute round eyes and a white chest.`
`It was about the size of a small pillow.`
`It looked pretty big next to someone as short as Maria onee-chan, but it probably wasn't that large.`
`From the perspective of someone who didn't know better, it would probably look like something cheap bought from a department store or something.`
`But to Maria onee-chan, it was her mother's handmade stuffed animal, the only one of its kind in the world and irreplaceable.`
`"Sakutaro, Sakutaro!!`
` *giggle*giggle*!!`
` Cute, cute, sooo cute...!`
` Thank you Mama, thank you Mama, thank you so much for making such a cute stuffed animal, even though you're so busy with work...!"`
`"...If you praise me that much, it's actually embarrassing.`
` I couldn't take much time, so I couldn't make anything that good.`
` I actually wanted to make one so big that you couldn't wrap your arms around it..."`
`"No, this is good!`
` With this size, we can always be together.`
` We can go out together.`
` Sakutaro, I'm your Onee-chaaan, uryu-☆"`
`"It really is an adorable stuffed animal.`
` So this kid is Sakutaro, your best friend."`
`"Uu-!`
` We can't go to school together, but me and my best friend are always, always together at home.`
` You know, Sakutaro is reeeally innocent and cute, and always nice to me.`
` He supports me when I'm feeling down, and plays a lot with me when I'm feeling good!"`
`"So I'm never lonely anymore.`
` Not lonely when Mama's busy with work and I'm all alone, not even when no one plays with me at school.`
` Isn't that right, Sakutaro, uryu-☆"`
`...At school, Maria onee-chan had lived in the same kind of environment as I did.`
`Compared to the other kids in her class, Maria onee-chan's tempo was always a little slow.`
`Her sensibilities and ways of viewing things were a little peculiar...and a little too idiosyncratic for her to blend in.`
`Her grades were low as well, and since she was talkative about everything related to the occult, her specialty, she was treated like a weirdo by everyone else in class.`
`If you were touched by Maria onee-chan, you'd be cursed... Stuff like that.`
`Apparently, everyone in her class acted like she was disgusting, made fun of her, and avoided her.`
`If a boy bumped into Maria onee-chan, `
`he'd start rubbing that part against the other boys, as if he'd gotten some scum on him.`
`They'd pick up her stuff like it was something filthy and chase the other boys around with it.`
`It seems the girls thought even speaking to her was unpleasant, `
`so they ignored her all the time, only giggling and sneering at her whenever she made a mistake.`
`"......It looks like bullying is the same in all eras.`
` Humans really don't advance at all, do they?`
` If only they'd just get wiped out."`
`"...I'm sad when I'm bullied, but I think it can't be helped."`
`"It can't be helped...?`
` Why not...?"`
`"After all, there's a rule that says every class has to have a single bullied kid."`
`"...That's a horrible rule.`
` I'd like to find the person who made it and hit them over the head with a brick.`
` Using the corner, of course."`
`"If I wasn't there, then there'd surely be a new bullied kid chosen in my place.`
` By staying strong, I can protect that kid."`
`As she said that, she smiled faintly.`
`......Maria onee-chan's way of thinking really is unusual.`
`According to her, from the beginning, a witch had resided in that place called a school.`
`No, she says that any place where a lot of people gather will have a witch residing there.`
`The witch tries to steal the students' souls through death by disease or accidents.`
`Apparently, she sometimes also corrupts those souls, leading them down that path of evil.`
`She says that an angel came, not content to let that continue.`
`"...And the angel...tried to finish off that witch.`
` The witch was powerful, and the fight took seven days and seven nights, but even then, it still wasn't over.`
` The tired-out witch asked for a truce and proposed this."`
`"I heard about that one before.`
` ...'Until now, I've made half of the students in the class become sick or injured.`
` But in exchange, I've protected the remaining half of the students from sickness and injury.`
` Therefore, if one member of the class becomes a sacrifice to me and is made into the 'bullied kid',`
` I shall protect all of the other students from sickness and injury', `
`......right?"`
`"Uu-.`
` The angel thought about it.`
` Compared to half the class meeting with misfortune, having only one person be unfortunate would be much better.`
` Then, the witch said that she'd protect the safety of all the other students, using her powerful magic."`
`"If there are 40 students in a class...`
`and the 20 victims are reduced to 1, then 19 people are saved.`
` ...It's actually a reasonable proposal."`
`I wonder if there's some theme behind this fairy tale.`
`If it's a creation by Maria onee-chan, a nine-year-old girl, that'd be pretty impressive.`
`"The angel decided to accept that proposal.`
` So, through that single sacrifice, 19 people were saved.`
` ...That's why my role's important.`
` The witch is protecting 19 people."`
`"...Because we become sacrifices?`
` ......Well, I don't remember ever being thanked by those 19 people."`
`...Maria onee-chan's idea was too compassionate.`
`Both of us are suffering from a very similar type of misfortune.`
` ...And yet, maybe a small difference in our way of thinking changes how peaceful our hearts are.`
`"So, you aren't sad, Maria onee-chan...?"`
`"Uu-.`
` I'm not sad at all.`
` After all, I'll be together with Sakutaro from now on.`
` Right,`
` Sakutaro?"`
`『Uryu-! If I can be with Maria, I'll be happy too!〝`
`"Look, Sakutaro says he's happy too.`
` Uu-☆"`
`Maria onee-chan hugged the Sakutaro stuffed animal, playing both sides of the conversation herself.`
`I don't understand it.`
`...But that's exactly why I want to reach Maria onee-chan's level.`
`...So I was intensely drawn to her tale and her words.`
`"Ange, is it tough because you're all alone...?"`
`"...It is tough.`
` But...just the time I can be like this with you is different.`
` Because I'm not...all alone."`
`"Then, if Sakutaro also becomes your friend, it'll be even more fun.`
` Uu-!`
` Then starting today, Sakutaro is Ange's new friend!`
` Right, Sakutaro?"`
`『Uryu?`
` I am...Ange's friend...?`
` Uryu-, Ange-!〝`
`Skillfully moving the stuffed animal like it was a puppet, Maria onee-chan expressed Sakutaro's emotions.`
`She was controlling him, but the charming way he waved his short hand and cocked his head to the side...`
`made it feel like he really was a new friend called Sakutaro.`
`Of course, looking at it with cold eyes,`
` it would only appear that Maria onee-chan was comforting me when I was grumpy.`
`...But a soul had definitely been sent into that stuffed animal.`
`The soul of Maria onee-chan's love.`
`So I acknowledged the existence of a being called Sakutaro inside that stuffed animal.`
`"Come on, say hi to Sakutaro too, Ange.`
` Come on, you say hi too, Sakutaro-☆"`
`『Uryu...?`
` Is Ange...`
`a scary person...?〝`
`As Sakutaro timidly looked at me, `
`he unexpectedly met my gaze...and hid behind Maria onee-chan's back in surprise.`
`...Maria onee-chan really is good at playing with stuffed animals.`
`"It's okay, Sakutaro.`
` Ange isn't scary, she's a really nice girl.`
` Uu-☆"`
`『...H-Hello.`
` I'm Sakutarou...`
` ...Uryu...〝`
`"*giggle*`
` ...Pleased to meet you, Sakutarou.`
` I'm Ange.`
` I'm glad to have a new friend."`
`I held out my hand as though asking for a handshake, `
`and Sakutaro's short hand was stuck out towards me, lightly touching my index finger.`
`After all, when a human and a stuffed animal shake hands, their sizes are too different.`
`This greeting by touching each other's fingers was our handshake.`
`"Uu-☆`
` Now, Ange and Sakutaro are already friends!`
` Two people are more fun than one, and three people are more fun than two.`
` Uu-!"`
`『Uryu-!〝`
`Maria onee-chan had given the name 'Sakutarou' to the stuffed animal she was to receive on her birthday...`
`and had warmed and expanded his existence in her heart for a long, long time.`
`Therefore, even before she met him, his existence was sublimated into a personality.`
`Even at the first moment they met, they were already friends.`
`Of course, that wasn't anything extraordinary in Maria onee-chan's eyes, `
`although I don't think she'd personified and loved anything quite as much as Sakutarou.`
`She loved the things she owned very much, treating them just like friends or beloved pets.`
`Maybe Aunt Rosa hadn't let her keep a pet at some point in time,`
` so she felt like treasuring objects instead.`
`...And maybe she was so isolated that she'd been forced to find a friend nearby.`
`Because of all that, what happened that day wasn't anything extraordinary from her perspective.`
`Even so, Sakutarou...no, maybe I should call it 'Sakutaro' like Maria onee-chan.`
`There's no doubt that Sakutaro was a stuffed animal...`
`no, a friend...whom she loved more than anything...or anyone.`
`"Hello, ...it's Mama.`
` You're in a good mood. Is a friend over?"`
`"Uu-!`
` Playing with Sakutaro!`
` Sakutaro, knock it off, *giggle*giggle*!"`
`It was already about 9:00 at night.`
`Rosa had asked because this wasn't a good time to have a friend over, and she'd been just a little surprised, `
`but when she thought about it, Maria didn't have any friends who would come over to play, did she...?`
`Even so, to think that she'd have so much fun playing with that stuffed animal.`
`Rosa was very pleased that Maria had liked her birthday present so much.`
`"Sorry.`
` Mama just can't get her work finished tonight...`
` The next season's lineup is having a tough time.`
` It looks like we're finally starting to get orders bit by bit, and I want to somehow give it a bit more impact so we can answer to their expectations..."`
`"So, you're spending the night?`
` Sure, okay.`
` Do your best, Mama!"`
`"R-Really?`
` Thank you, Maria...`
` Thanks for being understanding about Mama's work..."`
`Rosa was surprised that Maria had accepted so easily that she wouldn't be able to come home from work.`
`To Rosa, having to tell Maria that she'd be coming home late or staying overnight was a huge burden.`
`Maria would start crying about how lonely she was on the other end of the phone, and it took a lot of time and effort to calm her down.`
`To think that Maria would accept it in such high spirits...`
`Is this also thanks to Sakutarou?`
`...Rosa was once again pleased that she'd given her daughter such a good present.`
`"I'll make sure I come back this time tomorrow.`
` Let's eat dinner together then.`
` You haven't eaten dinner yet, have you Maria?`
` Buy a bento at the convenience store and eat it.`
` No sweets, and no soda.`
` I'll check the receipt and the change, understand?"`
`"Uu-!`
` Shopping with Sakutaro, shopping with Sakutaro...!"`
`"H-Hey!`
` Not Sakutaro, have him watch over the house!"`
`From Maria's manner of speech, Rosa got the feeling that Maria might've gone shopping with that stuffed animal without her knowing about it.`
`Rosa's forehead creased, and after sourly saying that Maria definitely mustn't do that, she hung up.`
`"Uu-...`
` Mama said I mustn't go shopping with Sakutaro..."`
`『Uryu-...`
` Can't go shopping with Maria...`
` Staying home alone...will be lonely...〝`
`"Why did Mama say not to go shopping with Sakutaro...?`
` Uu-..."`
`『Uryu...`
` ...I'm sure that if Maria was seen with me, it would be embarrassing...〝`
`"...Embarrassing?`
` Why?"`
`『Mama says not to take me outside a lot.`
` And she usually says Maria can't do it because she's too old...〝`
`"Uu-?`
` But I'm not embarrassed at all to be with Sakutaro, right?"`
`『I'm a lion, ...but I'm a stuffed animal.〝`
`"You're a lion and a stuffed animal, but you're my friend.`
` So let's go out together☆`
` Just when Mama isn't around, as a secret.`
` Uu-?`
` You aren't saying that you're embarrassed, are you?"`
`『I'm not embarrassed, but...`
`...uryu, ...the people outside are a little scary...〝`
`"Is that it?!`
` Then, I'll make it so that you can go outside without being scared!`
` Leave it to me, I've got something that's really useful...!"`
`Maria started fishing around her messy room.`
`Rosa often told her to clean it up, but Maria apparently didn't like doing it.`
`However, Maria herself knew more or less where everything was.`
`So much so that if it were to be cleaned up, she would have trouble finding where anything was.`
`"Here it is!`
` Hey, look, Sakutaro.`
` A knapsaaack!"`
`Maria proudly held it up high.`
`Sakutaro looked at the knapsack, which was gaping open, squirming as though saying 'Are you serious...?'`
`『Uryu, ...Maria, you aren't saying...〝`
`"Uu-!`
` This way, we can go shopping together, and Sakutaro won't be scared!"`
`Maria held Sakutaro up and started stuffing him into the knapsack.`
`At first, she tried to stick him in head-first, but then he'd be upside-down and suffocate.`
`So she pulled him out and tried pushing him in again, feet-first.`
`『Uryu-...!`
` Tiiight, craaamped, daaark.`
` Uryu-!`
` Urk.〝`
`"Look, it's all right.`
` If you stick your head out, it isn't cramped, it isn't dark, and it isn't scary.`
` And it's a good view.`
` Uu-!"`
`『Uryu, you're right.`
` ...Is it okay for me to go shopping with Maria like this...?〝`
`"Yeah, it'll be fine!`
` What should we get for dinner tonight?!`
` Come on, let's go out, Sakutaro!`
` Uu-!"`
`"*giggle*`
` Looks like you're having fun, Maria onee-chan."`
`"Yeah, it's a lot of fun.`
` Even things that would be lonely and boring alone all become fun with Sakutaro.`
` Any Human friend would have to go home when it gets late."`
`"But Sakutaro doesn't go home, so we can be together all the time.`
` He'll watch TV with me,`
` be together even in the futon,`
` and even hold my hand on scary nights when there's thunder.`
` He'll chase away the monsters in the closet and under the bed.`
` Sakutaro is reliable!"`
`『Uryu.`
` Since I'm a lion, I'll show my courage and chase away any monsters that scare Maria.`
` Uryu-, rooar.〝`
`They were so close that it made me a little envious.`
`I'm supposedly older now than Maria onee-chan was then.`
`But Maria onee-chan really is my onee-chan, and I still haven't reached her level.`
`...If only I had a friend close by like Sakutaro.`
`"Sakutaro and I are your close friends, right?`
` We're aaalways by your side.`
` It's just that your magic is weak, so you can't perceive us unless you open my diary like this."`
`"...Perceive?`
` You know some pretty difficult words, Maria onee-chan."`
`According to her, this world is full of magic and spirits.`
`And they're as natural and nearby as a light breeze.`
`"You don't normally notice or see the wind,`
` but when incense smoke or something draws trails, you can see it, right?"`
`"...Right.`
` And even if you can't see it, it's always nearby."`
`"That's it.`
` We're always really close by to you, Ange.`
` Gods and spirits and guardian spirits...are always right next to us.`
` But if you aren't conscious of them, you can't feel their existence.`
` Like wind that can't be seen with the eyes.`
` But they certainly are near us, and if they draw trails in the smoke called magic, anyone can see them."`
`I thought I'd only be able to meet Maria onee-chan while this diary was open.`
`But from what she says, she's always with me, and I can meet her at any time if I truly desire to.`
`"Along with a record of my life, I left a Fragment of my own soul in my diary.`
` So the power of my magic resides in this diary.`
` But it's very faint, so only you can feel it."`
`"...Only I...can tell it's there?"`
`"Yes.`
` After all, the power of a witch resides in you, just like me!`
` If you study hard, you too will definitely become a great witch in the future."`
`"......A witch.`
` I wonder if that'd be fun."`
`"Uu-!`
` It is fun.`
` If you do that, you'll be able to know that Sakutaro and I are always by your side, even without opening the diary.`
` If you do that, every day will become fun!`
` If you do that, I'll introduce you to many other friends.`
` If you do that, every day will get busy and very lively."`
`"That might be fun.`
` ...I do have the grimoire you left behind, Maria onee-chan.`
` I'll try reading it seriously sometime soon.`
` ...If I do that, I won't be all alone anymore, `
`right?"`
`"Uu-!" 『Uryu-!〝`
`Maria onee-chan and Sakutaro said that at the same time, happy that I had developed an interest in the world of witches.`
`With her knapsack on her back and half of Sakutaro's face peeking out of it,`
` she triumphantly walked through the shopping district late at night.`
`Well, it was that time of day, after all.`
` Everyone in the shopping district was either a shop owner lowering the shutters on their shops, or an employee rushing, or else staggering, on their way home.`
`Amidst all that, Maria, who was in a good mood like someone on a hike, probably looked quite merry.`
`Every once in a while, passing employees would glance at her back with the eyes of someone seeing something out of place.`
`Office ladies giggled at the cute stuffed animal poking its head out of the knapsack.`
`The supermarket had been closed for a while by this time.`
`However, convenience stores, which had been growing in popularity lately, stayed open until midnight.`
`It was very convenient for Maria, whose mother's return was often late.`
`Maria lowered the knapsack from her back and, carrying it like a child in her arms, she headed over to the sweet buns corner.`
`She pointed to a sweet bun she had eaten before, explaining to Sakutaro that this one was delicious, and that one was pretty good too.`
` Sakutaro seemed to be enjoying it a lot.`
`"I'm gonna have the three-colored one!`
` With just this one, you can eat bean jam and cream and strawberry jam!`
` But there's sometimes greenish-brown bean jam or white bean jam.`
` There should be one kind of bean jam."`
`『Uryu-!`
` Looks like having different things inside makes them interesting.`
` Uryu-!〝`
`"Next, I'll have a fruit yogurt!`
` There's fruit in it, but it isn't a sweet, right?`
` Yeah, I'm sure Mama will be fine with it.`
` Do you want one too, Sakutaro?"`
`『Uryu?`
` Is that really okay...?`
` What about the money?〝`
`"Uu-, no problem!`
` Look, it's #fefefeShotoku Taishi-#ffffff, uu-!`
` So I can buy you whatever you want too, Sakutaro.`
` Let's eat together!`
` Would you like some yogurt too, Sakutaro?"`
`When Maria made to grab another one of the same fruit yogurt, Sakutaro bent his head slightly, worried.`
`『Uryu...`
` But...I can't eat a big one, so a small one will be fine.〝`
`"Uu-.`
` Then how about a small yogurt?`
` It's 30 yen.`
` That's cheap."`
`『Uryu!`
` That's good enough for me.`
` Yogurt with Maria!〝`
`"Yogurt with Sakutaro!`
` Uu-!"`
`Maria put the three-colored bread and the two yogurts into a shopping basket and brought them to the register.`
`The man running the register had been in charge of the tobacco shop that had been here until last year.`
`"I seem to be seeing you a lot at this time of day, little lady.`
` You're a good girl, but maybe you'd better come with your mother if you're going to go shopping at this time in the future, okay?"`
`"Mama said it's okay, so it's fine!`
` Mama always comes home late because of her work, but we aren't lonely.`
` Right, Sakutaro?"`
`『Uryu-!〝`
`"Really? That sounds tough.`
` Here, I'll give you some free soda."`
`The man working at the store took a can of leftover soda or something from behind the register and packed it into the bag with everything else.`
`"Thank you mister!`
` Uu-!`
` Isn't that great, Sakutaro?!"`
` 『Uryu-!〝`
`Since she had been told not to buy soda, she couldn't take it back home.`
`So she decided to drink it on her way back and not bring the empty can back home.`
`With the vinyl bag with the sweet bun in it around her elbow,`
` holding the knapsack with Sakutaro in it with that same arm and drinking her soda, the two of them walked home...`
`"...Uu-.`
` Yuzukoshou soda isn't really good...`
` You wanna try too, Sakutaro...?"`
`『Uryu?`
` ......Uryuuryuuryu, uryu-!!`
` Gaah.`
` ...Uryuuuu, you're mean, Maria...`
` Nasssty...〝`
`"It sure is, uu-uu-."`
`Of course, it's not like she could actually make a stuffed animal drink soda.`
`She just put the can to Sakutaro's mouth and pretended to tilt it.`
`But it was fun for Maria to share the taste of this weird drink that she had gotten for free with Sakutaro...`
`There was a huge moon in the sky.`
`At times, that moon had been clouded by tears when she'd been unmanageable during Rosa's overnight stays...`
`and when she'd been scolded by her mother.`
`But this moon was very warm, and it seemed to watch over the two of them as they enjoyed their trip home by themselves...`
`Maria and Sakutaro.`
` ...Ange watched the two of them go from behind.`
`"............"`
`She looked so...warm from behind.`
`After looking at the backs of Maria onee-chan and Sakutaro together,`
` it became very hard to remember all of those long nights when she'd cried because her mother hadn't come home...`
`...I couldn't say it to Maria onee-chan,`
` ...but if I'd been in the same position, I may have given a stuffed animal the name Sakutarou, `
`...but it wouldn't have been anything more or less than a stuffed animal.`
`Anyone can make a relationship that only distracts you from your loneliness.`
`But Maria onee-chan was different.`
`Sakutaro isn't a stuffed animal or a toy.`
`...He was a real friend, and far from just distracting Maria from her loneliness,`
` he changed the nights without her mother into a fun time where they could play all by themselves...`
`Was it because Sakutarou was a special stuffed animal?`
`Because her mother had made it herself?`
`Because it was very, very cute?`
`...Probably not.`
`If there's a secret here, it doesn't lie within Sakutarou.`
`...I think it probably lies within Maria onee-chan.`
`"......This is the power of magic you were talking about, Maria onee-chan...?"`
`"Uu-.`
` Knowing magic means that you notice a lot of friends right beside you that you didn't notice before.`
` It's as fun as having a bunch of new toy shops pop up all over the neighborhood!"`
`...If even I, locked up in an academy without a single friend,`
` ...had power like Maria onee-chan, I wonder if I could make my days just a bit richer.`
`I wonder if I'll be able to honestly shed tears on nights I feel like crying, to smile on gray nights.`
`"Yes.`
` You can.`
` You can do it.`
` After all, you also have what it takes to become a witch."`
`"......What it takes...to become a witch."`
`"I have what it takes to become a witch too.`
` So I've still got a lot more studying and training to do.`
` I'll definitely become a wonderful witch, flying in the sky on a broom, drawing rainbows with my cane, making candy fall from the sky.`
` I can definitely do it.`
` Then, I'll show you too.`
` It'll definitely be like a scene from a wonderful dream."`
`Maria onee-chan said that, making an absolute promise with her smile.`
`...There's no way I can become a witch.`
`But if Maria onee-chan says that, it makes me feel that maybe, I really can become a witch.`
`Because, in reality, ...on that desolate night, when no flower of a smile could possibly have bloomed, her magic surely gave birth to a smile.`
`"...I wonder if...`
`...I can become a witch."`
`"You can.`
` ...You're a bit older, so your soul is bound a bit more by gravity.`
` That might make training tougher than it is for me.`
` But you definitely can.`
` After all, you're already touching a small piece of magic."`
`"I am?`
` ...Magic...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Come on, look. In a world where I don't exist, you summoned me, and you're talking with me."`
`"......This is...magic...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` You've expanded the Fragment of my soul that I left in my diary, and you're reviving me right now.`
` I also said it a short while ago, right?`
` Since you managed to reunite with me and have a conversation, since you're able to smile every once in a while, you must have some magical talent, Ange.`
` Your Maria onee-chan guarantees it.`
` Uu-!"`
`"...You said it a second ago, Onee-chan.`
` I thought I could only meet you while the diary was open, but you're really nearby all the time, right?`
` ...If I had more of the power of magic, would I be able to see you...?`
` And, just like now, ...would I be able to talk with you, Onee-chan...?`
` At any time...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` We can talk at any time.`
` I'm there by your side to say good morning, and even during class.`
` Let's talk together during dull classes to distract you from your boredom.`
` I'll also be there to talk to you during meals, so let's always be together like this during lunch break."`
`"We're with you after school too, and of course, I'm always by your side even after you return to the dormitory.`
` ...It's just that you don't`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~ 'see' me except when the diary is opened~ib~."`
`'!s1`
`...Maria onee-chan, `
`...you'll be by my side, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` I'll be there.`
` So if you try to 'see' me and try to talk to me, I'll definitely be able to answer.`
` ...If you 'look' strongly and try to talk, that is."`
`"......I'll...`
`...give it a try."`
`"It isn't easy, okay?`
` It isn't going to go well all of a sudden, got it?"`
`"......I understand.`
` I'm sure it won't be easy.`
` ...But I...`
`...want to be like you, Maria onee-chan......"`
`"Uu-.`
` I understand.`
` ......Then, look at me well.`
` Look closely."`
`"...Okay."`
`"Slowly open and close your eyes.`
` ...You can't shut them for a long time all of a sudden.`
` After burning my form into your eyes, try to make it blend into the inside of your eyelids..."`
`"......Yeah, `
`...I'm doing it."`
`"Once you can visualize me even when your eyes are closed,`
` ......without changing anything, slowly and softly close your eyes again.`
` ......How is it?`
` Can you still 'see' me?"`
`"...Y-Yes.`
` ...I think...I can probably see you..."`
`"Then try opening your eyes for a second.`
` ......Now for the real thing.`
` Calm your heart, and close the diary.`
` ...At that time, my form may disappear for a second.`
` But calm your heart, and don't get anxious.`
` ...And then, try to make the me that's blended into the inside of your eyelids blend back into your eyes.`
` ...Slowly visualize me in the empty air.`
` ...In the empty air, ...'see' me."`
`".........`
`...Yeah, I'm okay.`
`'!s1`
`...I'll close...`
`...the diary."`
`"Uu-."`
`Slowly, `
`...I closed it.`
`When I did so, ...a gray reality filled with dull air unfolded.`
`Of course, Maria onee-chan's form disappeared.`
`...Give it all you've got, have courage.`
` ...Take the first step into the world of witches.`
`I felt like Maria onee-chan was cheering me on inside my heart.`
`She's cheering me on?`
` Really?`
`Or do I just think that she is...?`
`No, that's wrong.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`It's because I think this that ~ib~I cannot 'see' her~ib~`
`Maria onee-chan is always by my side.`
`And even now, she's definitely there, cheering me on to do my best...`
`That...reached my ears.`
`So I mustn't ignore it like it's my imagination or the voice of my own heart...`
`...I believe...`
`that Maria onee-chan is there.`
`I mustn't doubt.`
` ...I believe.`
`Onee-chan said she'd always be by my side.`
` I must not doubt that...`
`But looking at that empty space, by the empty back wall of the school building,`
` amidst those almost heartlessly boring rays of sunlight, calling out her name was unexpectedly difficult...`
`The chains of common sense that had clung to me until today sneered at me, telling me that calling out to the empty air was ridiculous...`
`It was almost like being told to take a step forward off the roof of a skyscraper overlooking a sea of lights.`
`...It's Maria onee-chan saying it.`
`...It's all right, she's saying that I'm someone who can do it.`
`Stop thinking that you might fall, or that it'd be foolish to take a step off a roof,`
` ...and free yourself from those chains of common sense.........`
`".........Whew......`
`......haaah, ......`
`............okay..."`
`I steadied my breathing.`
`I concentrated my mind.`
`Make the vivid form of Maria onee-chan in the empty space before you...rise to the surface.`
`......Understand magic, `
`...and 'see' Maria onee-chan...`
`"......Maria...onee-chan......!"`
`'!s1`
` Is someone there?!"`
`At that time, I was answered by a rustle in the bushes and a wild cry, and I came to my senses.`
`It looked like I wasn't the only one behind the school building.`
`No, since I'd been so immersed in the world of the diary, I hadn't noticed someone coming.`
`I recognized a group of three beyond the bushes.`
` ...They were kids from my class.`
`From their appearance, it felt as though they'd come behind the school building to gossip about someone or talk in secret.`
`I hurried out of that place.`
`Because if it became known that I'd been alone in a place like this, mumbling to myself, it'd become a pain again...`
`"...She said it, right? She said it, right?`
` She said Maria onee-chan or something, right?!"`
`"Isn't that creepy? She isn't seeing spirits or something, is she?"`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!`
`I could hear the shrill, loud laughter from behind.`
`Irritated and feeling that Maria onee-chan had been made fun of, `
`I left that place at a quick pace, and then a jog once I turned the corner.`
`...And I might've made it to Onee-chan's world with just a little more time...`
`It was frustrating, aggravating...`
` Why does everyone get in my way...?`
`I haven't gotten in anyone else's way, not even once...!`
`I ran and ran, but it still felt as though I could hear their shrill laughter...`
`"Rumor has it, Ange-chan,`
` that you jumped off the top of a skyscraper?"`
`"The groupies were getting annoying, so I thought I'd give them the slip."`
`Ange and an old gentleman wearing an expensive suit were alone in a massive, modern conference room.`
`All of the newest machines for presentations were installed there,`
` but they didn't upset its refined and composed atmosphere,`
` and that alone was enough to make the business-like theme of the room abundantly clear.`
`However, that didn't matter at all to Ange.`
`She carelessly sat on a high-class chair that executives making a salary of several ten million yen probably sat in, looking aloof from the world.`
`"It's because I knew they were remodeling on a lower floor and had a safety net out."`
`Ange talked about it like it was no big deal, but in reality, it had been a 'miracle' among miracles.`
`To think that she'd shot through several layers of safety netting for the remodeling project, `
`been caught in a multi-colored banner adorning the atrium and slipped off,`
` ...only to be softly caught by a final banner, land on the ground without a scratch,`
` and then briskly leave that place...`
` It put Hong Kong movies to shame.`
`"Whether you knew there was a net or not, this is a 200-meter tall super-skyscraper we're talking about, right?`
` If things hadn't gone as you planned, there'd be a mess to deal with now."`
`"...I figured that if I died, then I'd be dead and that would be that, more or less.`
` Well, still, I was testing my luck a bit.`
` Call it youthful zeal."`
`As though saying that she'd had enough of that topic, Ange shrugged coldly.`
`Seeing that, the old gentleman, who was looking at the world below through a crack in the blinds, cackled.`
`"So, you were testing your luck, is that it...?`
` My, my, you truly are Kinzo-san's grandchild.`
` The nerve to trust your life to chance.`
` ...The Chairman was also a woman who could stake her life on a bet like it was nothing, so maybe this really is the Ushiromiya blood at work.`
` ...You really will make it big in the future.`
` Please, let me be blunt.`
` Why not give up this running away from home act and return to the Sumadera family?"`
`"I heard that Mom had a bad relationship with her family.`
` I don't want to go to the house of people I first met at a funeral."`
`The Sumaderas are Mom's family.`
`They're an old family from Kyoto, and compared to Mom's frank attitude, unbelievably strict.`
`The only Sumadera I'd been on good terms with was Grandpa, who was living apart from his family under the guise of retirement.`
`Mom kept in touch with him too,`
` but she avoided the rest of the family completely, almost hostilely so.`
`So when I went out to play with the Sumadera family, it was always Grandpa's house I visited.`
`When I was young, I didn't really understand it,`
` but I hear that Grandpa was in an extremely weak position, as a man who'd moved into his wife's family register, and his relationship with Grandma was also bad.`
`...You might even say that Grandma hated him and confined him to the house.`
`It isn't hard to imagine that, because she had a soft spot for Grandpa alone,`
` Mom was also hated by the Sumaderas.`
`Since I was her daughter, they probably hated me quite a bit too.`
`And yet, they appeared for the first time at Mom's funeral, `
`shamelessly going on about how big I'd gotten, like they could actually act like family after all this time...`
`When Aunt Eva died, I would inherit all the wealth of the Ushiromiya family.`
`If that wasn't what they were after, there's no way they would've been able to say such disgusting words.`
`"...Well, it's not as though I can't understand your desire for self-abandonment, now that you're all alone."`
`"This isn't self-abandonment.`
` I'm just taking a carefree stroll now that that annoying Aunt Eva has finally kicked the bucket.`
` ...Everyone else is just making too big a deal out of it."`
`Of course, everyone's after the vast Ushiromiya wealth I bear.`
`They must think that becoming my guardian means they'll be able to do as they please with that wealth.`
`Just how many people have tried to get close to me, acting like they want to be a substitute parent?`
`"If you ever find that you're hurting, please talk with me if it will help, okay?`
` After all, I think of you as my own grandchild, Ange-chan."`
`"............Haah.`
` ...I'll say <no, thank you> for now.`
` ...More importantly, let's return to what we were talking about."`
`"Ange-chan,`
` no matter how many times you ask, I am hiding nothing.`
` The Chairman was the only survivor on Rokkenjima that day.`
` And she passed away without saying anything.`
` I myself know nothing.`
` Everything is wrapped in darkness, you see."`
`This old gentleman was one of those leaders who had been entrusted with the business group Eva had built up after she passed away.`
`The one he called Chairman was the former Chairman, Ushiromiya Eva.`
`His company once had friendly ties with Hideyoshi's business,`
` and he'd had a close relationship with both Hideyoshi and Eva.`
`For that reason, when Eva lost Hideyoshi, he became the only person to whom Eva might have let her true intentions slip.`
`Whenever Eva's heart was torn by the loss of her family, whenever she took it out on Ange, `
`he had acted as a buffer between the two, so although Ange didn't trust him, she found him a very easy person to question...`
`"That crime was...`
`no, that accident.`
` If I call it a crime, I'll get in trouble.`
` ...I had the same questions about it as the public and the talk shows."`
`"...At the time of the accident, why was Aunt Eva in a place 2 kilometers away from the mansion, all alone?`
` And on the night of a storm."`
`"Back then, Kinzo-san was unsure as to whom he should select to be his successor.`
` ...Officially, he'd decided on his son, Krauss-san, but he didn't have much trust in that man."`
`"...So, to fairly determine a successor from among the four siblings, he made this game-like test called the riddle of the epitaph...?"`
`"Ostensibly, yes.`
` ...Kinzo-san probably planned to make Eva-san the Successor from the beginning.`
` He wanted to withdraw his own rule that the eldest son be the Successor, and instead of Krauss-san, leave the family to the extremely diligent and brilliant Eva-san."`
`"...The new rule about giving the inheritance to the one who solved the epitaph...`
`was probably nothing more than a farce to snatch the position of Successor away from Krauss-san."`
`"What do you mean...by farce?"`
`"There was no need for anyone to solve that epitaph.`
` Once it had been displayed for an appropriate amount of time, Kinzo-san could just call Eva-san, whom he truly wanted to succeed him, `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~and give her the answer~ib~`
`.`
` In other words, that itself would provide proof of her succession to the Headship."`
`".........This isn't something they've brought up on the talk shows, is it?"`
`"Well, once you bring up the succession of the Headship, conspiracy theories tend to rise to the surface.`
` I'm no fool myself.`
` I won't go out of my way to say things that could invite misunderstandings, you see?"`
`This was his theory.`
`At that time, the Ushiromiya Family Head, Kinzo, whose remaining life was announced to be short, was troubled by the problem of who was to succeed him.`
`Normally, the Successor would be fixed as the oldest son, Krauss, whom Kinzo had chosen himself.`
`...But in his later years, Kinzo began to think that Eva would make a more fitting Family Head.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`However, Kinzo, who was stubborn even against himself, was stymied by the title of Successor that he'd already given to Krauss,`
` and he'd searched for an ~ib~official stance~ib~ by which he could skip over Krauss and select Eva as his successor.`
`That official stance was the riddle of the epitaph.`
`The primary successor was still Krauss,`
` but there was a new rule, saying that if someone appeared who could solve the riddle, they would be chosen as the Successor to the Headship.`
`Then, on what would probably be his final family conference, Kinzo told Eva the answer to that riddle himself.`
`...In short, it was the same as proclaiming that Eva herself was the Successor.`
`"On that day, Eva-san was summoned by Kinzo-san, who revealed the answer to her.`
` And, so that she could succeed the Headship, he called Eva-san to the hidden mansion Kuwadorian, which only the Head knew about."`
`"......And because Aunt Eva arrived at the hidden mansion one step ahead, she escaped harm in that accident, you say?`
` Maybe Aunt Eva just killed everyone and made it look like an accident, so she could steal all of the wealth for herself, `
`and maybe that's why only she escaped unharmed."`
`"Well, that's what the papers are shouting about.`
` However, I believe Eva-san.`
` ...I'd say there are several points that justify trusting her."`
`"For example...?"`
`"That ring of the Ushiromiya Family Head, which is on your finger now, Ange-chan.`
` That ring is the only one of its kind in the world, which Kinzo-san had made specially.`
` And the artisan who made it acknowledges that the object on your finger is, without a doubt, that ring."`
`The Ushiromiya Family...Head's Ring.`
`That ring, with the heft of gold and the one-winged seal on it,`
` had a diamond arranged on a pedestal, and felt both sturdy and reminiscent of the dark hobbies of the rich.`
`Kinzo had worn that on his finger without removing it even for a moment.`
`This man was saying that the fact Eva had it proved that Kinzo had acknowledged her as the Successor.`
`"After all, Eva-san certainly did have that ring.`
` And, if you take into consideration that Eva-san actually was talented, and that Krauss-san had made a fool of himself several times on the business scene, `
`I cannot imagine that Eva-san's story is completely made up."`
`"......Although there's the possibility that she murdered Grandfather in order to steal that ring.`
` Then Aunt Eva, using some kind of trick, massacred everyone and made it look like an accident."`
`"Ah, yes.`
` It seems the papers were saying something about her massacring everyone, with keeping all the wealth to herself as a goal.`
` True, Eva-san was a person capable of holding back nothing when she was determined to accomplish something.`
` Or, ...she may have committed murder just once in her life...if a chance for keeping all the Ushiromiya family wealth for herself presented itself.`
` ......However, I don't think that happened."`
`"So, what's the second point that justifies your trust in her?"`
`"Eva-san's family.`
` Hideyoshi-san and George-kun.`
` ...It might be difficult for you to believe all of a sudden, Ange-chan, but Eva-san was a person who treasured family greatly."`
`...True, part of me didn't want to believe it or acknowledge it.`
`But I did understand vaguely.`
`Aunt Eva certainly had been a person who highly treasured her family.`
`After all, the root of her twisted personality had been nothing more than the sadness of losing her beloved husband and son.`
`After getting hit with her angry outbursts as she tried to distract herself from that pain, I have no feelings of sympathy at all,`
` ...but it's not like I can't imagine how the incredible shock of losing her whole family must've changed her character.`
`"...You're saying there's no way Aunt Eva, who loved her family, would throw away her husband and her son?"`
`"That's right.`
` Even if Eva-san really was the culprit and massacred the entire family, making it look like an accident,`
` ...she most certainly would have spared her husband and her son."`
`"She would quibble that, by coincidence, only her family had been in the hidden mansion.`
` If Hideyoshi-san and George-kun had been safe, even I would probably suspect Eva-san."`
`"...I truly cannot imagine that Eva-san's wailing at Hideyoshi-san's funeral was an act."`
`"......Sounds like both points so far are just circumstantial evidence.`
` That isn't the same as physically proving Aunt Eva's innocence."`
`"Hahahaha.`
` If you say that, then you're stuck right away.`
` Eva-san was the only survivor.`
` And she says that this is the truth."`
`"But no one can prove her innocence."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` And no one can prove that she committed a crime either."`
`"............"`
`"And the final point that justifies trusting her...is the police.`
` After all, it was such a flashy crime.`
` The police were being pushed forward by a public in an uproar over conspiracy theories, so they must have investigated Eva-san thoroughly."`
`It was easy to feel something unnatural about the claim that Eva had avoided the accident by coincidence...`
`because she alone had escaped to a hidden mansion.`
`Furthermore, at the time, Hideyoshi's company had been right in the middle of a takeover struggle, and in order to buy off the big stockholders, she'd wanted a large sum of cash.`
`It shouldn't be too hard to find a motive there.`
`But as a matter of fact, there had been nothing at all that implicated Eva as she went to the family conference.`
`Nothing unnatural was found on her that could've been used to brutally murder her family and make it look like an accident.`
`The servants who escaped harm by being off-duty on that day also stated that they hadn't seen anything strange regarding anyone related to the event, Eva included.`
`Putting all of that together, `
`it could only be concluded that Ushiromiya Eva had headed to Rokkenjima for a normal family conference, without any change,`
` and had encountered an accident...`
`"The police looked so intensely, and they still couldn't find evidence that it was a crime.`
` ...They reached that conclusion themselves.`
` Doesn't this resolve the Rokkenjima Suspicion?"`
`@:dwave_jp 0, enj_4e258:~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"...That just means that the police `
`~ib~couldn't find~ib~`
` evidence that it was a crime, right?"`
`"There's nothing I can say to counter that.`
` It becomes a Devil's Proof.`
` To expose it as her crime, you would simply need to find evidence.`
` But what could you possibly find to prove her innocence?`
` It's impossible to prove a negative fact."`
`"...Did Aunt Eva commit a crime, or did she not...?`
` Because we can't find any materials that'll let us say for sure, the truth will remain a mystery... That's what you're saying, right?"`
`"......That's it.`
` Phrased in a manner you would prefer, that's what it amounts to.`
` It was impossible even for Eva-san to prove her own innocence.`
` On that island, an unfortunate accident occurred.`
` And Eva-san survived by chance.`
` And we don't know any more than that!"`
`"In short, it all comes down to whether you believe the story of the only survivor, Eva-san, or not.`
` ...I believed.`
` The ring and her praiseworthy love for her family.`
` And the tears she shed at the funeral.`
` Taking all of that into consideration, I decided to believe her story."`
`"...But I don't believe.`
` If she wanted to steal the ring, there were probably many ways for her to do it, and no one knows if her relationship with her family really was that good.`
` No one can prove that tears at a funeral are real."`
`"...Anyway, I hated Aunt Eva from the very beginning.`
` So I don't even want to believe her."`
`"Hahahaha...`
` How does one view the truth of the crime?`
` You and I are on completely opposing sides.`
` Even though the information we are given is exactly the same, we interpret it in completely different ways."`
`"......This happens often in politics and business.`
` The exact same enterprise will always be assessed in multiple, differing ways.`
` Do you know why?"`
`"......Why?"`
`"It's a question of whether one has love.`
` ...Whether you feel love for someone or not completely changes how you view them.`
` If a person you like gives to the poor, you respect them for it, right?`
` But if someone you hate starts donating, you fiercely protest that it's a publicity stunt or that they're handing out favors."`
`"No matter what they do or don't do, you thank them if you have love and criticize them if you don't.`
` That's how the world works."`
`"Can Aunt Eva be trusted, or can't she...?`
` ...You're saying that's all that really matters?"`
`"Those who suspect her will probably take anything she does or doesn't do and truly see it as something unnatural.`
` And it works in reverse.`
` ...As for me, `
`I think that, barring certain extreme cases, truth might not exist in this world at all."`
`"No, even if truth does exist, `
`whether you believe it or not is determined by whether you have love or not.`
` ...Can you really call truth without certainty truth?`
` Even if Eva-san had been able to show physical proof that she had an alibi, would you have been able to believe it?"`
`"........."`
`It's hard to counter that.`
`...I hate Aunt Eva, so I'll probably deny any information beneficial to her...`
`and interpret any neutral information in a negative way.`
`...In other words, the truth is already decided inside me.`
`So just what in the world is this 'truth' that I'm still searching for, unsatisfied...?`
`"That's how it is.`
` So, no matter what you hear from me, since you still suspect Eva-san after all this time, `
`nothing will change.`
` At the very least, even if you were to grasp a piece of hitherto unknown information, I don't think you'd be able to reach the truth the way you are now."`
`"......So I can't...`
`reach the truth?"`
`"After all,`
` no matter what kind of new information or proof you find, Ange-chan, it won't change your stance that Eva-san is the culprit, right?`
` So it's pointless to investigate anything more.`
` Because`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~the truth inside of you is already decided~ib~`
`."`
`"............"`
`"However...`
` If you stop assuming that to be the truth, if you wish to struggle further towards the deeper, real truth, there is a single way.`
` I believe I already mentioned it,`
` but do you know what it is?"`
`"...Is it...love?`
` I don't really know what you mean."`
`"Right now, you're considering this under the assumption that Eva-san is the culprit.`
` But that's no different than looking at something with a single eye.`
` With one eye, no matter how much you squint, you cannot see an object in three dimensions, right?`
` That's why we have another eye.`
` And of course, it's in a different position from the first eye."`
`"......You're telling me to look at things based on the supposition that Aunt Eva isn't the culprit,`
` ...or else, that it was a real accident...?"`
`"Yes, yes, that's correct.`
` When thinking about anything, you should always try to look at it from different perspectives.`
` If you don't, you won't understand anything about what is real."`
`"It's the same with newspapers.`
` You can't see anything from the single viewpoint of a writer who wrote an article in a single newspaper.`
` Sometimes you can only process information composedly and in three dimensions when you read multiple newspapers."`
`"...Without love, the truth cannot be seen.`
` ......Hmm, sounds nice, wahahaha."`
`Maybe he thought it interesting that such a flashy phrase would pop out of his mouth.`
` For a while, he laughed, looking pleased.`
`...At the same time, he was telling me that he'd said everything he knew...`
`and that it was about time to leave.`
` I understood that and got to my feet.`
`"I do understand your feelings, Ange-chan.`
` You should do as you like for a while, until you're satisfied."`
`"...You were six years old at the time.`
` I understand how you must feel after losing your family before you could even understand what that meant...and how you must still be unable to sort out your heart."`
`"............"`
`"You may learn the truth, and you may not.`
` Eva-san may be the culprit, and she may be a victim.`
` ...I pray that you find the 'truth' you believe in, Ange-chan.`
` A journey at such a young age may prove to be a valuable experience."`
`"Thank you very much...`
` ...I'm truly sorry to be such a bother when you're so busy, Okonogi-san."`
`"No trouble, no trouble.`
` What are you going to do now?"`
`"Well, whatever works.`
` ...I've made appointments with several specialists and people related to the crime, and I plan to go visit them."`
`"I see.`
` I hope you find an answer you can accept."`
`At that time, company president Okonogi's secretary came in, handing him a memo over his shoulder.`
`He read it, then looked between it and my face.`
`"...Ange-chan,`
` my apologies that this comes right after telling you to try going on a journey, but I have some information you should lend an ear to.`
` ...It looks like you're in a bit of a nasty fix right now."`
`"People after my money?`
` This is why money's stupid."`
`"Yes, but if you sell off all of the wealth, trying to donate the whole sum to the public welfare,`
` you'll make the eyes pop out of those people optimistic about their chances with your fortune."`
`"Oh, the Sumadera family?`
` Those guys act so proud, like they're my guards or something."`
`I haven't forgotten Aunt Eva.`
`There's no way I'll put myself in the care of the Sumadera family.`
`They probably want to, as Aunt Eva often threatened in the past,`
` cut off my arms and legs, throw me in a warehouse, and suck the Ushiromiya family's wealth dry.`
`"Apparently, a messenger from the Sumadera family is coming here.`
` They're saying to hand you over...no, no, that they want to protect you."`
`"A messenger, you say?"`
`"It's your aunt.`
` Kyrie-san's younger sister.`
` I believe she told me earlier that she thinks of you as a little sister."`
`"She's gotta be joking.`
` At least call me a granddaughter, you old hag."`
`"Judging from the context, it seems they have no wish to listen to your desires.`
` I have a car waiting in the parking lot two stories underground.`
` Go."`
`"...The Sumadera family is telling you to hand me over.`
` Is it really okay to let me go?"`
`"You will definitely become something big in the future, Ange-chan.`
` Let us call this a favor to be repaid upon your success.`
` ...Go, quickly...!"`
`After bowing silently and deeply, Ange left that place at a dash.`
`After watching her leave, the female secretary straightened her glasses and whispered.`
`"The Sumadera family told us to stall her...`
` Is it really all right to let her go?"`
`"We did stall her, more than enough.`
` If they still don't make it in time, that's their own fault.`
` ...I told Ange-chan to run for it.`
` I informed the Sumaderas that Ange-chan would be coming.`
` Whether she's caught or not, I will not be blamed."`
`"...Everything in this world...is love, you see...`
` Don't worry, she'll escape.`
` After all, that child's capable of leaping off a building to shake pursuers."`
`...Okonogi looked down again through a crack in the blinds,`
` muttering 'Nope, definitely couldn't do it...'`
`Ange wasn't a fool herself.`
`She got off the elevator, but on the third floor.`
`A taxi in the second level of the basement?`
`That's so neat and clean that I don't like it.`
` It's probably better to refuse for now.`
`But my enemies aren't fools either.`
`They're probably waiting in the first floor lobby, as well as the underground parking lot.`
`It's such a massive building.`
`Instead of getting anxious and escaping outside, maybe it's better to stay inside and wait it out.`
`No, that's useless.`
`If they get their hands on a security room in a modern building like this, I'll have nowhere to run to.`
`This entire building is like a massive dead end.`
`The third floor is the business floor.`
` A young girl like me will clearly stick out.`
`Trying not to stand out any more than I had to, I walked at a brisk pace, searching for an emergency exit.`
`...It'd be perfect if that staircase was an outside one.`
`I found the door to the emergency exit.`
`After opening that heavy door, I found the outside staircase I'd hoped for.`
`I bumped into a man who looked like an employee skipping work and smoking a cigarette.`
`After glaring at me, he quickly crushed out his cigarette and went away.`
`It looked like there was no one below.`
` ...If I'm gonna escape, now's my only chance...!`
`Just when I thought that, a black car slid right under me and came to a sudden stop with an incredible squealing of the tires.`
`...Judging by the sound of tires, it seemed they had several other allies, and that one of them had come here to block this path.`
`"...Not bad, Aunt Kasumi.`
` To think you'd even send a car to pick up your little sister when she's trying to get out through the emergency exit."`
`*bam*bam*! The doors of the car were forcefully opened and three black-suited men jumped out, looking up at the emergency staircase.`
`...Crap, our eyes met.`
`"12, target found.`
` Northwest side emergency stairs, third floor, send support."`
`"Ange-sama!`
` Try not to move from there!`
` Forgive our roughness...!!"`
`The three of them began to clamor up the emergency exit.`
`...They've already announced that they plan to be rough.`
` This is pretty bad.`
`As long as I don't stop breathing, they've probably been ordered to grab me no matter what, even if they've gotta rip out one of my arms.`
`*clank*clank*clank*clank*!!`
`Their heavy, wild footsteps became a helix and began to rise from the lower floors, getting closer...!`
`In the entrance lobby of the building, a woman with seven black-suited guards behind her advanced at a leisurely pace.`
`Seeing this ostentatious entrance, the security guards for the building ran up to them, asking if they had an appointment.`
`"......How typical of Tokyo people.`
` Don't you understand the status of the person you are talking to without her having to say her name...?"`
`"M-My apologies...`
` At our company, guests are to take a securi-"`
`"...Back down, scum.`
` I came because I was called by your president.`
` Call Okonogi Tetsurou here.`
` To think he would call me here and then not welcome me... How typical of Tokyo people..."`
`"My apologies.`
` Welcome to the Ushiromiya Group, Sumadera Kasumi-san."`
`With his secretary behind him, Okonogi dashingly appeared from the elevator.`
`Even though both of them wore bold smiles, they were wrapped in a tension reminiscent of the smell of gunpowder...`
`"......Where is Ange?`
` I came to greet that adorable daughter of my big sister's."`
`"Strict observance of time is our motto here at the Ushiromiya group.`
` The former Chairman herself said that those who can't keep time can't keep contracts."`
`"...You call me all the way to Tokyo, and this is all you have to show for it?`
` You let her go, didn't you."`
`"Please, she escaped from us.`
` We did stall her for quite some time,`
` but unsurprisingly, she did eventually smell a rat.`
` Of course, this wouldn't have been a problem at all if you had arrived on time, Sumadera-san."`
`"Ah, these provicials and their loose concept of time.`
` Wahhahahahahahahaha!"`
`"......What was that...?`
` What did you say to me...?"`
`You couldn't sense any of Kyrie's open frankness in Kasumi's face.`
`She wore the arrogance of the ancient Sumadera family towards the ruined Ushiromiya family,`
` ...as well as pride, because she didn't want anyone to notice that her family was declining so much that they couldn't ignore the Ushiromiya family's wealth.`
`Even at a glance, it was easy to understand why Ange hated her aunt so deeply...`
`She couldn't stand even a slight insult, and though she still smiled, her eyebrow twitched.`
`At that time, the black-suited man behind Kasumi whispered to her.`
`"Ange-sama has been found.`
` We are currently dealing with her."`
`"...Oh, I'm glad we made it in time.`
` ...Thank you, Okonogi.`
` It seems I can finally take my mischievous niece home.`
` ...I've waited so long to talk with that girl in my tea room, with all of the tools prepared.`
` Heheheheheheh...!"`
`*clank*clank*clank*clank*...!!`
`As the violent sound drew a helix, it rushed up at me from below, threatening to swallow me up.`
`Of course, even if I fight, there's no way I'll be able to win.`
`And yet, running into the building would be like jumping into a dead end of my own accord.`
`My enemies will increase in number with time.`
`If I don't do something here and now, I won't have any more chances to escape.`
`Then, three muscular black-suited men came into view below me.`
`1, 2, 3.`
` Three people.`
` In other words, everyone who had gotten out of the car.`
`If there had been just one of them, I might've been able to dropkick them or something and smash them in the head, which might work out.`
` ...But it really would be impossible with three of them.`
`Wait, ...three...?`
` ...If there's just three, I should be able to make it...`
` ...I can do it...!`
`"Take a deep breath......`
` ......Haaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!"`
`"What?!`
` Y-You idiot, stop!!`
` Look ooooooout!!`
` Waaaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`"01 calling 12, is the package secure, we received a response.`
` ...What happened?!`
` Respond!"`
`"...Sh-She's crazy... Damn it..."`
`......Nnnggg...`
` ...Owow...`
`See, ...that worked out perfectly, didn't it? There was just the three of them, after all.`
`I've already tried that once from a higher place.`
` I knew I'd be able to jump down just three floors...!`
`It's a good thing the car they came in was right beneath me.`
`Even if it wasn't as pleasant as a trampoline, it broke my fall...a little gently, a little roughly.`
`"...How rude.`
` You didn't have to dent that much."`
`The roof of the car broke my fall, leaving a massive dent around my body.`
`Car roofs are surprisingly delicate.`
` I don't think it's because of my weight.`
`Apparently, the three people on the stairs hadn't planned on me jumping down.`
`It seemed they now realized that they'd been outwitted, and they were rushing down the stairs.`
`I've gotta run and escape while I have the chance.`
`I moved my body, making clunking sounds on the car roof.`
`But I'd been naive.`
` Of course they wouldn't all rush up the stairs without leaving one person behind.`
`There was one black-suited man left in the driver's seat of the car that had broken my fall.`
`He stuck his head out the window, and when he realized what had fallen on him, he jumped out.`
`In a rush, I jumped off the roof, but the black-suited man's reaction was really fast.`
` ...Either there was a massive reward for capturing me, or there'd be some harsh punishment in store for them if they let me get away.`
`"15, secured, secured...!"`
`"Owowowow...!!`
` Ack, don't touch me like that, let go!!"`
`I was mercilessly held down against the asphalt.`
`I was being crushed face-down, covered and pressed upon from above.`
`It was a hold without a trace of elegance, but it was extremely practical and left me no room for resistance.`
`I tried to push back with both hands, searching for a way to resist,`
` but I was being pushed down solidly, and I couldn't even tear myself off the asphalt.`
`Then another car came, squealing its tires as it slid to a sudden stop.`
`Is it all over now?`
`'!s0`
`The man that had been crushing me let out a sharp cry.`
`...He was yelling straight into my ear, making my left ear ring.`
` What in the world?!`
`Along with the black-suit guy, I fell with a *thunk*.`
`After landing face up, the first thing I saw...was an arm stuck out right in front of my eyes.`
`"......Amakusa...?`
` What are you doing here...?"`
`"Let's talk about that after we've lost them.`
` To the car, quickly, lady...!"`
`Amakusa grabbed my arm, easily pulled me up, spinning me around with himself as the center of gravity.`
`Just when I thought it was a little like a dance, he flung me through the open door into the driver's seat.`
`I climbed over the hand brake and slid into the passenger's seat.`
`Pushing me in, Amakusa also got into the driver's seat.`
`Since we suddenly accelerated while I was still on all fours, I had to kick and struggle around on the chair for a while, like a turtle that's been flipped over...`
`Amakusa checked the rear-view mirror for cars in pursuit, but he flew into the artery of the big city without lowering his speed in the slightest.`
`We sewed our way between cars one after another.`
`Just like a chase scene in some action movie.`
`...I was shaken by this horrible driving and had trouble sitting back down.`
`"Are you hurt, lady?"`
`"I'm fine.`
` Humans are surprisingly durable.`
` Next time I try to a escape a downward moving elevator, I'll jump out a window instead."`
`"Hyahhahaha, I guess air dives are a hobby of yours, lady.`
` Still, I'd recommend you grab a parachute next time."`
`"Sure, if I remember to do it after leaping."`
`"Hyahhahahahaha, <cool>!"`
`He smacked the steering wheel, guffawing.`
`Need an explanation for this flippantly-talking man?`
`His name is Amakusa Juuza (天蝉坝三).`
`He was originally one of Aunt Eva's guards.`
` Didn't she start to hate him because he chatted too much?`
`He was much younger than the rest of the guards, but contrary to his outward flippancy, he'd hopped from the First Airborne of the JSDF to the French Foreign Legion, `
`placing himself in overseas private military companies and high-class security companies one after another, making for a pretty incredible and unique career.`
`...But I heard he deserted both the JSDF and the French Foreign Legion, and that he'll be arrested if he enters France again.`
` Both of these flippant episodes were very typical of him.`
`The guards were sternly told not to chat with me unnecessarily, `
`but he came and took a pass at me, didn't he?`
`Aunt Eva was apparently particularly put off by that...and had supposedly dismissed him shortly before she died.`
`"It's been a while since I've heard that carefree tone.`
` What happened after you got fired?"`
`"I was coaching some people at Blackwater.`
` When I came back to the country during my time off, President Okonogi offered me a high wage."`
`"...So, you deserted again?`
` I wonder how a man like that can be useful for anything."`
`"Doesn't count as desertion as long as I come back by next week.`
` I talked with him yesterday.`
` I was told that some troublesome people might come to call on you, lady."`
`"Sorry that turned out to be exactly right."`
`"My name probably came up since I know you, and I've got lots of crazy experience.`
` Thanks to you, it looks I'm in for a happy vacation plus some pocket money."`
`"...So, Okonogi-san employed you as my guard?"`
`"He probably wants to buy some gratitude from you, lady.`
` ...After I got fired, I was indebted to President Okonogi in various ways.`
` He's got some dirt on me here and there, and now I can't say no to him.`
` Hyahha!"`
`"...Seems that getting indebted to Okonogi-san can be pretty costly later on.`
` ...So, where are you planning on taking me?"`
`"Anywhere.`
` I'm employed until the weekend.`
` Anything after that'll cost you extra."`
`"How much per day?"`
`"I'll take 50 thousand.`
` Plus expenses."`
`"If you stop cracking jokes, I'll double it.`
` The period of employment isn't fixed yet.`
` It might take several weeks."`
`"...That'll be tough.`
` I'll have to call my boss to get an extension on my vacation."`
`"More than anything, I want to investigate that day."`
`"...Oh, is this about Rokkenjima?"`
`"Exactly.`
` What happened on that island 12 years ago?`
` ...I want to investigate it with my own hands to my satisfaction."`
`"Do you really expect to find anything new investigating something that old...?"`
`"True.`
` But this is a journey for my own self-satisfaction.`
` ...Once that's over, I'll just throw my hands up and go over to the Sumadera family.`
` ...Didn't Aunt Kasumi say something about how she wanted to serve me some matcha?`
` Maybe she'll serve me tea as I kneel on sharp wooden blocks, clutching stones or something."`
`"Damn that sounds freaky, hyahhahahaha...!"`
`"My apologies, we lost sight of them...`
` A single man thought to be an associate assisted in her escape.`
` Judging by his possession of a stun gun and his driving skills, he's no amateur."`
`"......I see, thank you.`
` ......What a shame, Okonogi.`
` Shall I take this as your answer...?"`
`"Letting her get away was your blunder.`
` It has nothing to do with me."`
`"......I do wish to prepare some matcha for you as well in the near future.`
` The next time you're in Kyoto, please stop by.`
` ......I'm going."`
`"Oh, are you leaving already?`
` I could offer you some chazuke first."`
`".........*cackle*cackle*`
` ...Hohohohoho...!!"`
`With her back still facing Okonogi, she laughed softly, but with an increasingly shrill and hateful tone, using that as a substitute for a sharp parting remark.`
`Just as she stopped laughing, her features suddenly changed to look like a demon's,`
` but because her back was facing him, Okonogi couldn't see that expression.`
`Okonogi watched her go, laughing cooly.`
`His secretary whispered over his shoulder.`
`"...Are you sure about this?`
` Milady Ange is our company's primary stockholder.`
` If the Sumadera family becomes her guardian..."`
`"I get it.`
` But you know, we're the world-famous Ushiromiyas.`
` We can't let them take us lightly.`
` ...Still, it looks like that guy managed it pretty well.`
` ...All that's left is to let Ange-chan do as she pleases.`
` I'm counting on you, Amakusa."`
`"...Kasumi-sama,`
` the escaping car was a rental.`
` The license plate they displayed was a fake.`
` We're clearly dealing with a pro.`
` They'll probably abandon the car.`
` Pursuit will be difficult.`
` ...Should we have the police chase them?"`
`"......Hmm, yes.`
` Shall we have them search for our runaway daughter?`
` They are getting paid with our taxes, so the police must be of some use every once in a while.`
` Hohohoho......"`
`"When I left the mansion, I boldly told mother to leave it to me, didn't I?`
` Do you intend to embarrass me further...?`
` It looks like it might be better for me to serve some matcha for everyone at once, doesn't it?`
` ...Our underground tea room is cramped, so you'll have to wait in line..."`
`"N-No...`
` We will search with everything we have."`
`"...Ah, she really is a cute kid, just like Nee-san.`
` ...Especially that way she freewheels and does as she pleases.`
` ...Ah, now I can't see anything but Nee-san.`
` Ah, I'm truly looking forward to it.`
` If only I could invite Nee-san's daughter to my tea room, right...?`
` Hohohohoho...!!"`
`"...The Sumadera family sure moved quickly.`
` Did Okonogi-san sell me out...?"`
`"You're joking.`
` He's my client.`
` If he'd sold you out, he wouldn't have hired me, right...?"`
`".........`
`...I guess that's true."`
`"...Ah, so that's why you got off the elevator at the third floor."`
`"Him having a car waiting in the underground parking lot was just too convenient.`
` I figured Okonogi-san sold me out.`
` ...Though I guess by now, it's impossible to prove whether there was an ambush set up in the parking lot or not."`
`"I see, that poor president guy.`
` Looks like you don't trust him a bit, lady.`
` That car in the basement...was mine."`
`"Huh...?`
` He was talking about you, Amakusa...?"`
`"I freaked when the elevator came and was empty.`
` I wonder what would've happened by now if I hadn't been listening in on their radio."`
`"......So what's going on?`
` If I'd obediently believed Okonogi-san and gone to the parking lot, `
`there would've been no need for me to do that jump off the third floor...?"`
`"Pretty much, yeah.`
` Well, it turned out okay in the end."`
`"............"`
`......What the hell.`
`If I hadn't suspected President Okonogi,`
` ...I could've easily escaped without getting caught in a tough spot.`
`'President Okonogi might have sold me out'.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`No, since paranoia told me that it was better to assume that he'd sold me out, I supposed and ~ib~concluded~ib~ that 'He sold me out'.`
`Because of my inability to believe in him, regardless of his truth,`
` my truth became 'He sold me out'...`
`I thought back on President Okonogi's words.`
`Can you really call truth without certainty truth...?`
`Truth can change completely depending on whether you have love or not.`
`In the end, ...perhaps truth itself doesn't exist.`
`There are as many interpreted truths as there are people who speak of the truth.`
`If I can't accept something that fluid as truth,`
` ...where does the truth that I really want to find exist?`
` ...And is it something I'll be able to see with my eyes?`
`...Even if someone sticks the truth right there in front of me and says it's the truth, `
`I might not be able to 'see' it...`
`"...Without love, it cannot be 'seen', huh?"`
`"......This Fragment of yours is very lively.`
` It doesn't bore me."`
`"You told me something.`
` You commanded me to search for the truth of 12 years ago.`
` ...But there's something I'm not getting."`
`"What's that?"`
`"...What is truth?`
` There are as many truths as there are people.`
` There are as many interpretations as there are people.`
` And those can be twisted by opinions and changed indefinitely.`
` ...Is truth really that unfixed and vague?"`
`"That's right.`
` ...Truth is unfixed.`
` It can be like a particle, or like a wave, and it can hold conflicting forms at the same time.`
` You are free to believe that the cat in the box is alive or dead.`
` ...But the truth is very delicate.`
` It can change its appearance just by being observed."`
`"You're talking about stuff like Schrodinger's cat box?`
` ......Nonsense.`
` If you open the box, you learn the truth.`
` Discussion about what happens before you open it is just an armchair theory."`
`"That's right.`
` And yet, in order to deny that abstract theory, you need to open the box.`
` ...It is impossible to negate any idea about the contents of a box that cannot be opened.`
` This is what truth is."`
`"......As long as truth isn't denied, it keeps its form."`
`"That's right.`
` As long as truth isn't observed, it keeps its form."`
`"In other words, if it isn't exposed, any reckless statement can suffice as truth."`
`"Yes.`
` ...Even if they contradict each other, endless ideas can exist as truth at the same time without being negated."`
`"......So even something as screwed up as my family being captured by the Rokkenjima witch and shut up 12 years ago for all eternity...`
`can exist as truth as long as we don't know what happened 12 years ago..."`
`"This witch called Beatrice...forcibly made room for 'Endless' imaginings in the Rokkenjima of 12 years ago, enveloping all of it inside a cat box.`
` Everything inside the unopenable box is truth."`
`That's right.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~We don't know what happened on that island~ib~`
`, so it becomes endless.`
`"...That's assuming no one opens it up.`
` I just have to wrench it open.`
` ......But that box was closed up 12 years ago, and I don't even know where it is.`
` ...Even if I visit Rokkenjima, just what can I learn about what happened 12 years ago on that desolated island?"`
`"Who knows?`
` I wonder what you could learn.`
` ......This is something that can only be done by the person who is able to walk around freely in the world of 1998, 12 years in the future:`
` the final witch, ANGE Beatrice."`
`"........."`
`"Beatrice's game board lasts two days, from October 4, 1986 to the 5th.`
` In other words, you're a piece who can move freely outside her game board.`
` ...And even Beatrice cannot influence this future that lies outside the game board."`
`"...If you say it like that, it sounds like I'm a pretty overpowered piece."`
`"The future of 12 years later in which you are placed certainly is distant.`
` However, the further a piece is placed in the future, the stronger power it holds.`
` ...I told you, didn't I?`
` The truth changes its appearance when it is observed."`
`"Come to think of it, I heard something like that once.`
` ...Even if one day, all of a sudden, a star in the constellation Centaurus were to explode,`
` the light from that explosion would have to cross 4.4 light years, so it would take it four and a half years to reach the Earth."`
`"That's right.`
` In other words, even if the sun in Centaurus has already died, people on Earth won't be able to perceive that fact for four and a half years.`
` ...Because no method of perception exists that is faster than the speed of light."`
`When we learn that the sun in Centaurus has exploded...`
`We Earth people will paint over our history of four and a half years ago with a new truth.`
`We will revise history with a new fact: that it exploded four and a half years ago.`
`However, for the four and a half year period until we learn that, despite the fact that it has already died, `
`the mistaken truth that the sun of Centaurus still exists will be able to exist as truth.`
`The truth of the future wins against the truth of the past.`
`"......That's right.`
` By itself, the Rokkenjima accident gave rise to nothing but `
`suspicion of a conspiracy involving Aunt Eva and the Ushiromiya family assets.`
` ...But later on,`
` ...it was dramatized and linked to the occult, and the conspiracy was painted over by the Legend of the Witch."`
`Even though it was clambered over as a conspiracy at the time of the crime,`
` later on, strange occult theories, which claimed that it was the work of the witch, ran rampant and began to paint over the truth of October 5, 1986...`
`The conspiracy theories will probably be forgotten over time.`
`...And only the more bizarre, impressive witch theory will continue to remain as superstition, eventually covering up the conspiracies.`
`"That's right.`
` The false truth that exists before the light from an exploding star reaches Earth is almost like the conspiracy theory, which is a human theory.`
` ......The wine bottle with a letter in it that drifted ashore several years later, the 'message bottle', painted over that theory and made things return to the occult theory, which is a witch's theory."`
`"...That's right.`
` A witch didn't exist during 1986.`
` The witch took control of Rokkenjima because she was 'observed' several years later by us humans of the future, thanks to that message bottle...!"`
`"...A small revision is necessary.`
` The witch could have existed even during 1986.`
` As one of many endless possibilities that can exist."`
`"Certainly.`
` She'd disappear if she were observed, so she curls up inside the cat box.`
` ...That's what makes the message bottle so nasty."`
`"...The witch tried to get out of the box.`
` She made it so that she'd be observed, weeding out possibilities that conflicted with the witch theory.`
` ...In other words, to make it impossible to negate her, she negated all possibilities other than the witch theory."`
`"......What the hell.`
` So in other words, Beatrice satisfied the Devil's Proof with a frontal attack.`
` And, that was part of the witch's plan from the beginning."`
`"The message bottle is information observed in the future after 1986.`
` ......It cannot be observed by Beatrice or Battler.`
` ...It can only be observed by ANGE Beatrice."`
`"...I really didn't want to investigate the message bottle.`
` ...After all, reading that would be like listening to the witch's say.`
` I thought the witch theory was just a crazy fantasy, so I thought of it as nothing more than a waste of time."`
`"...But Okonogi-san told me.`
` You can't see things in three dimensions with only one eye."`
`"You mean that while looking at it from the viewpoint of denying witches, you must also look at it from the viewpoint of accepting witches?`
` ...That's a correct way of thinking.`
` The number of viewpoints is like a denominator.`
` If you have one viewpoint, the mystery in the numerator doesn't decrease in the slightest.`
` However, the more your number of viewpoints increases, the more the mystery begins to be divided."`
`"I understand.`
` ...There was a message bottle that washed up on a neighboring island several years after the crime.`
` That passed into the hands of a dilettante.`
` I made an appointment with him, just in case."`
`...I was able to hear Aunt Eva's say from Okonogi-san.`
`Next up is...the witch's say.`
`Why don't I listen?`
` To Beatrice's say...!`
`"3 months left to live.`
` It was last year when you said that, right, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"...I-I only spoke of what I could comprehensively determine from his physical condition at the time.`
` As a result, this year too, it just so happens-"`
`"So, even though it's doubtful whether Dad'll last until the end of the year, he's still totally focused on his occult research.`
` And you still say he has only three months left, Doctor?"`
`"L-Like I said, Kinzo-san's-"`
`"Shouldn't you be happy that our respected father is still in high spirits?`
` Out of a sense of parental respect, each one of you is so eager to greet Father.`
` I can see how upset you are that he's unwilling to meet with you."`
`"...Considering that everyone has started aiming for the inheritance while the sun is still in the sky,`
` I can understand why Father wouldn't want to see you."`
`"Y-You've got it wrong, Natsuhi nee-san.`
` ...We just, umm-"`
`"Dad isn't immortal, and he'll die someday.`
` We aren't telling him to die. We're just saying that he will die sooner or later.`
` We're just talking together about how to prepare for that."`
`"And that is precisely what is so disrespectful!!"`
`"Stop it.`
` You'll make your headache worse."`
`Krauss told Natsuhi, who had risen from her chair in agitation, to sit down.`
`Trying to smooth over the atmosphere, which had suddenly become filled with suspicion,`
` Hideyoshi put on a forced smile and motioned for everyone to calm down.`
`"...Natsuhi-san, don't misunderstand.`
` People say you should always clean up after yourself, right?`
` We're just talkin' about seein' him off.`
` We're discussin' this so we can see Father off neatly when he takes off on the journey he's eventually gonna make."`
`"Hahaha...`
` That's just like you, Hideyoshi-san.`
` Even though you're saying the same thing, you make it sound so intellectual."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` Unlike you, Nii-san."`
`"Quit it.`
` We aren't getting anywhere.`
` ......So like we're saying, Aniki,`
` forget all this about the inheritance.`
` I don't even care if Dad hits us."`
`"To make a long story short, we wanna meet Dad directly and say hello.`
` Even if he says he doesn't want to.`
` If he's locked up in his study, we don't care if we have to borrow a key from Genji-san.`
` Right, Rosa?"`
`"...Oh, ...well, umm...it's not like we're forcing you...`
` ...It's just...we haven't said hello to Father in such a long time.`
` If his remaining life really is short, then there's a chance we might never be able to see him again...`
` ...Today might be our final opportunity to exchange words with Father..."`
`"That's right, just like Rosa says.`
` If he only has three months left, it wouldn't be odd for him to pass away any time now, right?`
` Are you saying that despite that, we don't even have the right to talk with him one last time?`
` ...Regardless of the circumstances, isn't that just a bit too much...?"`
`"...If greeting Father were truly what you wished to do, I'm sure he'd happily allow you to meet with him."`
`"But Father has already heard about the disrespectful topic you hope to raise!`
` No one would want to meet with you under those conditions.`
` The reason you cannot meet with Father is because of your own doing and nothing else, is it not?"`
`"Heheh.`
` Exactly.`
` You shouldn't have to rack your brains to understand why Father doesn't wish to see your faces, right?`
` Father has seen through all of your tight financial situations."`
`"......What are you talking about?`
` ...I don't have a clue what you're going on about, Nii-san."`
`"Heheheheh!`
` Did you really think I didn't know about the state you're in...?"`
`Eva and the rest realized that he had seen through to their current lack of funds,`
` and alternating between bluffing and returning to the point at hand and arguing back, `
`they repeatedly pressed Krauss to let them meet with Kinzo.`
`...The sweet smell of the black tea Rosa had gone out of her way to buy had been completely wasted.`
`The only thing she was glad about now was that the children weren't here for this.`
`...The fact that they'd gone to play at the beach right after lunch had been their only salvation.`
`Eva made as though to tackle Krauss, and Hideyoshi and Kyrie cut in between them, trying to calm both sides.`
`...Then, Kyrie took a deep breath and spoke.`
`"......I'm sorry, Krauss nii-san.`
` I know I'm an outsider, but I wonder if you'd let me say one thing.`
` I have a proposition."`
`"What is it, Kyrie-san?"`
`"...First, and this includes my husband as well,`
` for many years, we have belittled the efforts you've made by living with Father and taking care of him.`
` ...Isn't that right?"`
`"......That's...well...`
` ...We've got it easy since we get to go outside, but Aniki's been babysitting Dad for decades now, and that must've been a lot of work.`
` ...I'll accept that, but what's your point, Kyrie?"`
`"We must acknowledge that Krauss nii-san is Father's caretaker.`
` ...Isn't that right?`
` We've always feared Father...and have pushed the task of caring for him onto Krauss nii-san.`
` Everyone should acknowledge his efforts.`
` Isn't that right,`
` Eva nee-san?"`
`"......`
`...And so what?`
` Nii-san is Father's caretaker?`
` Don't decide things on your own, outsider!"`
`"H-Hey now, ...calm down.`
` ...Kyrie-san, what are you talking about?"`
`"............`
`...Kyrie, please continue."`
`"We should be more grateful towards Krauss nii-san and Natsuhi nee-san.`
` ...We should thank them for always taking care of Father.`
` It's our lack of gratitude that's to blame for these wasteful conflicts we keep having.`
` ...Isn't that right, Krauss nii-san?"`
`"......I'm surprised.`
` I did not think you, Kyrie-san, would be able to understand our efforts,`
` which even my true siblings have not stopped to consider."`
`"...It's a natural duty for the Successor to the Ushiromiya Family Headship."`
`"That's right.`
` It's your responsibility as the Successor to the Headship, isn't it?`
` ...It's because you take care of Father that we must acknowledge you as the Successor."`
`"Hey!!`
` Why are you bringing this up all by yourself?!!`
` You're just an outsider-"`
`"Wait, Aneki!!`
` ......That's right.`
` It's just like Kyrie says.`
` Because you take care of Dad, you're the Successor, Aniki.`
` It's just like you said."`
`"......Oh-"`
`"......Nn-"`
`Rosa noticed, and then Eva did.`
`Eva's barking demeanor towards Kyrie for advancing the discussion on her own disappeared in a flash,`
` and she instead stared at Krauss and Natsuhi.`
`...Natsuhi couldn't understand that sudden change and was slightly flustered.`
`"Krauss nii-san,`
` ...if you'll accept just a few conditions, `
`we won't ask you to let us meet Father again until he dies.`
` Of course, we won't demand to be present at his deathbed.`
` ...We wouldn't even mind being absent at the funeral."`
`"...Oh?`
` ......Where are you going with this?`
` But I may as well listen for now.`
` Let's hear your terms."`
`"First.`
` ...The term Successor to the Headship refers to the caretaker of the current Head, Ushiromiya Kinzo."`
`"......Hmm.`
` And then?"`
`"Second.`
` The duty of the caretaker is to look after Ushiromiya Kinzo for the rest of his life.`
` ...To make things simple, the caretaker's job is to care for him until his final moments.`
` You were prepared to do that from the beginning, Krauss nii-san, so that won't cause any problems."`
`"Naturally.`
` I have no objections to either of those terms.`
` I am already carrying them out."`
`"Third.`
` On the off-chance that the caretaker is neglectful in his responsibilities of supervision, he shall be deprived of his rights as a caretaker."`
`With that sentence, all slack disappeared from Krauss's face.`
`...Natsuhi alone was still having trouble figuring out what it meant.`
`"...Hoh.`
` And just what are these...`
`responsibilities of supervision that the caretaker bears?"`
`"It means supervision so that Father can live the rest of his life in the best possible health.`
` ...I'll be more detailed than that.`
` In the case that Father dies anything other than a natural death, the caretaker will be deprived of his rights as caretaker, and his status as the Successor to the Headship will be lost.`
` If that happens, the next highest in rank, Eva nee-san, will be selected as the Successor."`
`"......Wh-What did you say...?`
` How can you shamelessly speak such nonsense?!!"`
`"Hohoh.`
` My, my, the caretaker certainly has a heavy responsibility...`
` However, people can die in many ways.`
` For example, senile old people sometimes die when food gets caught in their throats.`
` Normally, this is called death by old age in its broadest sense."`
`"But with your argument, that becomes a death by accident, and I bear the responsibility of supervision.`
` ...This is unjustly disadvantageous to me."`
`"I have no intention of forcing such an unfair argument on you.`
` I'm referring to the kind of thing that the caretaker could have prevented beforehand by taking good care of and keeping his eyes on Father."`
`"It may be the caretaker's job to carry food to Father's mouth, but whether he swallows it or not is clearly outside the caretaker's responsibility.`
` I would have absolutely no problems with the example you raise, Krauss nii-san."`
`"......Hoh.`
` So, what kind of case are you referring to that might cause the caretaker to be blamed for making a blunder?"`
`"For example, `
`'!s0`
`"......`
`......Oh?"`
`"It seems that right now, Father is in firm control of himself,`
` but dementia might begin to set in."`
`"...He might wander around when you aren't looking and get into some kind of accident,`
` ...or he might get lost in the forest and go missing.`
` ...Wouldn't this type of case clearly be the responsibility of the caretaker...?"`
`"Father's mind is perfectly healthy!`
` There is no need to bring up dementia...!"`
`"'One day, suddenly, I saw Father go into the forest.`
` I chased after him, but I couldn't find him.`
` I called the police and searched, but after being unable to find him after seven whole years, I had him declared legally dead.'`
` My point is that we won't accept it if you use a story like that to treat him as dead."`
`"............"`
`"When Father passes away, an autopsy will certainly be carried out,`
` and we will confirm that he died of old age in the most general meaning, within the bounds of common sense.`
` ...A death of any other cause will be held as the caretaker's responsibility.`
` .........See?`
` These are all things you have toiled away at all this time, Krauss nii-san.`
` These aren't strange conditions or anything of the sort, right...?"`
`"Y-You are mocking us, disgracefully so!!`
` I find it hard to imagine why my husband must be coerced into a rule that disgraces him in this way!!"`
`"......Actually, I've been suspecting it since last year.`
` No, everyone here probably suspects it as well.`
` Eva nee-san and Hideyoshi nii-san.`
` Rudolf-san and Rosa-san too.`
` Everyone has suspected it the whole time, but it was so frightening to imagine that no one actually said it."`
`"Hmph.`
` ...Heheheheh, hahahahaha...!!`
` I see, so this is what you're trying to say?`
` ...That Father is already dead, and that I have been hiding it!"`
`"...Ah, that's right.`
` That's one of the theories I thought of as a key to solve the last mystery in the previous game."`
`"......You mean the very last bit,`
` the mystery of who killed Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"That's right.`
` ...The witch definitely said a lot in red.`
` ...She mentioned the names of all 18 people and announced whether they were alive or dead, and then she claimed that there were no humans besides them.`
` ...But with this theory, I can weave my way through that gap...!"`
`"......`
`...I see.`
` So, this is one of the answers that doesn't cause those two to contradict.`
` ......Makes sense."`
`"See what I'm saying?`
` ...You catch on pretty quick.`
` It's nice that I don't have to explain."`
`"No 19th person exists on this island.`
` And yet this trick lets us mix in an unknown new character.`
` ...In other words, 'the names of all 18 people' don't necessarily correspond to 'the 18 people on the island'."`
`"That's it...!`
` The witch mentioned the names of 18 people one after another, and announced whether they were alive or dead.`
` And on top of that, she announced that there were no humans other than the 18.`
` ...There was a single illusion in there."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`It wasn't guaranteed that ~ib~the 18 names of people = the 18 people on the island~ib~`
`.`
`"When she named off all 18 people and announced who was alive and who was dead,`
` she hid the name of culprit X, and instead mixed in someone who wasn't on this island...!`
` By doing that, even though the culprit was on the island, she was able to leave him out of the list of living or dead people!`
` The person who was mixed in wasn't actually on the island, so he didn't count towards the total number of people on the island."`
`"By this, even though the culprit counted towards the total of 18 people on the island, it was possible for his name not to be listed!`
` The two statements in red are completely independent, so this theory creates no contradictions...!"`
`"If someone's name was used to hide the existence of the culprit, that name must satisfy several conditions.`
` ...First of all, even though this person isn't on the island, they've got to be someone we think is on the island.`
` ...Otherwise, she wouldn't have been able to trick us."`
`"And it's best if this person happens to be dead.`
` ...No alibi is more perfect than death.`
` After all, at that point, the mystery was based on the fact that the crime was impossible for all 18 people.`
` ......Is it something like that?"`
`"Yeah, that's it...!`
` And, that person was...`
`...`
`Grandfather.`
` ...Right now, there's only one thing Kyrie-san can be about to say.`
` ...We thought Grandfather was locked up in his study, saying that he didn't want to meet anyone,`
` ...but there's a possibility that he's actually dead already, `
`and that Uncle Krauss is lying when he claims that Grandfather's alive...!"`
`That's right.`
` Grandfather was closed up in his room the whole time, and no one saw his face!`
`Maybe he was already dead, `
`and Uncle Krauss and the others were conspiring together, trying to trick everyone...!!`
`"......If Kinzo dies, the distribution of the inheritance occurs.`
` However, if Kinzo doesn't die...`
`no, `
`if he dies, but `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~it isn't announced~ib~`
`, the distribution of the inheritance won't take place."`
`"In other words, Uncle Krauss could have all of Grandfather's wealth to himself...!`
` That's right, he's got more than enough motive!"`
`Maybe a 19th person X really doesn't exist on this island.`
`But a person X existed.`
`...And that person was the 18th person!`
`"In other words, there were originally 17 people on this island, not 18.`
` Then, an unknown person X snuck in and committed the crime.`
` ...How's that, Beato?!`
` Come out, I've just solved the final, biggest mystery from last time!!"`
`As Battler claimed that forcefully, the crisp sound of clapping came out of nowhere, and their surroundings turned bright,`
` becoming the usual witch's tea room.`
`"*cackle* Hahahahahahaha...!`
` Bravo, bravo.`
` I wish I could deny that someone as incompetent as you has finally gotten a feel for it, but somehow or another, you've managed to come up with a single answer.`
` Even a lump of concrete can stop thinking!`
` So, you have now finally evolved into a being with intelligence."`
`"...You might say you've finally taken a step forward from the crying creature you were before, just licking my shoes and grinding your teeth.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"...I can't believe that stupid wordplay threw me for so many loops last time.`
` My lameness pisses even me off!"`
`"All right, Beato, repeat it!!`
` If you can announce that the 18 people on the island included Grandfather, just try and do iiiiiiiit!!`
` Yeah, you can't.`
` Because he was already dead.`
` This is the end of your deceptiooooooooooon!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* Ahhahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` Well now, what have we here?`
` ......Shall I slice that in two with the red truth?`
` No, no, it might also be good to hold back for now and let you get all excited.`
` If I'm going to push you off a cliff anyway, it would be more interesting to lure you to a higher place first.`
` *cackle*!"`
`As Beato sneered obnoxiously, she looked like she was searching for an expression that would tick me off even more.`
`...As though she was saying that the answer I'd reached was impossibly ridiculous.`
`Compared to me, annoyed as I was with the witch's attitude, Gretel had a blank and composed expression on her face.`
`...Almost as though she'd expected the witch to act that way.`
`".........`
`I see.`
` ...Just like how Battler has learned and grown, so has the witch."`
`"What's wrong, Beato?!`
` Don't act so tough!!`
` I asked if you can repeat it!`
` Answer!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*..."`
`"...Stop it, Battler.`
` The witch won't answer so easily.`
` ...She won't do it until she thinks it'll benefit her."`
`"What?!`
` What do you mean...?"`
`"You've been toyed with by this red truth in the games up until now, so the witch has used it many times.`
` But now, the situation is different.`
` You're trying to draw the red truth out of her...and are instead using it as your weapon.`
` In this situation, there's no way the witch will keep firing off the red without reason.`
` ......Right?"`
`"Gretel, or whoever you are.`
` ...It seems your mind is quite sharp, unlike Battler's.`
` What a fearsome enemy I've welcomed in.`
` That is correct!`
` When Battler hopes I'll use the red truth, do I have any responsibility to do so?!"`
`"No!`
` I don't even have a crumb from that croissant you ate this morning's worth of responsibility to please yooooooou!!"`
`"Y-You bastard......!!"`
`"Yes yes yes yes, that's the faaaaace!`
` I started playing with the red truth just because I wanted to see that face!`
` I have no reason to play around if it won't give me a chance to see you look like that...!"`
`"...Heheh.`
` You just don't like losing, right?`
` Just saying whatever you can to trick me because you can't answer my demand won't work!!"`
`"Don't be so full of yourself!!`
` An answer like that could be cut to pieces without any effort!!`
` But I won't go out of my way to speak in red.`
` I won't say it because that's what you're asking me to do.`
` Do you know why?"`
`"......You just said it.`
` You want to push him off at the sweetest spot.`
` This ill-natured witch is saying she won't use the red anymore, because that's what you want.`
` In other words, she won't go along with this game of telling her to repeat things anymore."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Exactly, exactly!`
` Unlike Battler, everything goes quickly with this girl, with no need for explanations!`
` I will say what I please with the red truth, at the time that I desire!"`
`"That's it.`
` Basically, it's the witch's right to use the red truth as she pleases.`
` She doesn't have to use it at whatever time the human side desires.`
` ......But even that depends on the sitution."`
`"...The situation...?`
` What do you mean...?"`
`"The witch has no responsibility to respond when you tell her to repeat something.`
` But it does become her responsibility if and only if your claim can destroy the witch theory.`
` After all, in this trial court without a judge, that which is not refuted becomes the truth."`
`"...Just like how the witch theory made by the witch......`
`will instantly become truth if you collapse and stop thinking."`
`"Then, ...since she doesn't have a counterargument for my guess, that means it's right?!`
` It's right that the culprit is the mysterious 18th person X, and Grandfather is already dead?!"`
`"...At least, until the witch argues back.`
` Truth always loses to new truths farther in the future.`
` ...The tricky part is that even the timing of the counterargument is up to the witch."`
`"...In other words, maybe your reasoning just now was correct, `
`or maybe the witch is refraining from arguing back even though you're wrong.`
` ...Or, the witch may be ignoring it because it doesn't shake the basis of the witch theory in the first place,`
` but either way, we can't tell the difference at the current time.`
` ......Is that more or less it?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Damn you, Lady Bernkastel, for throwing in such a troublesome piece.`
` Thanks to that, I'm losing all my lines!"`
`"The witch has learned that she can respond to your demands to repeat phrases at a later time.`
` ...Maybe you could even call it a delayed move."`
`"...Sh-She's messing with me...`
` ...So, even if I announce some mistaken reasoning, there's a possibility that Beato will intentionally let me flounder about without denying that guess,`
` and at the very end, when I propose an even more massive line of reasoning, she can cut it off at the base,`
` and spin everything around...?!"`
`A single piece of reasoning becomes a bridge to the next piece.`
`By demanding that she repeat lines, I've been able to strengthen my position and advance bit by bit.`
`But since that bastard Beato learned this strange delay tactic,`
` ...I can no longer confirm or deny my reasoning.`
`This is like finally finding a staff that'll let me search around in the darkness, only to lose it right away.`
` ...I'm just stuck now, right...?!!`
`"Hey, hey, Battler, if you make a despairing face like that, I won't be able to stop drooling, you see♪`
` From the beginning, that staff was nothing more than something I gave you because you were so worthless.`
` All this means is that you can finally challenge me without a handicap, right?`
` Kuhihihihihihihihi!"`
`"...But that alone doesn't change the fact that demanding that you repeat things is one of Battler's ways to fight back.`
` As I already said, as long as it's something fatal that'll destroy the witch theory, `
`the witch is obligated to argue back, and therefore, to speak with the red truth.`
` ...While the timing of that counterargument is up to the witch, it must be performed eventually.`
` ......Isn't that right?"`
`"Hmm, that may be so.`
` If I cannot deny the 'tricks done by humans' theory Battler lays out by the time the game ends,`
` Battler will use that as a reason to deny me, and it will be possible for him to proclaim his victory."`
`"...So, should we view this as a restriction on the witch's side...? That the 'trick theory' laid out by the human side, `
`in other words, what he tells you to repeat, must be countered during the game (during the episode)?"`
`"That is so.`
` ...Battler's goal is to show that he can explain the entire pleasant game I have laid out on this island with humans and deny me.`
` If Battler succeeds in that, at that time, he will become the victor of this game."`
`"Let me confirm the rules.`
` ...Should we view the time the game ends as referring to 24:00 on October 5, 1986, going by the time of the Rokkenjima in the game?"`
`"I have no problems with that."`
`"At the time the game ends, the human side must state a theory using tricks for all of the mysteries,`
` and if the witch side cannot argue back, the human side can proclaim its victory.`
` ...Does that work?"`
`"......Let us be more specific.`
` When the game ends, the witch side will be given a chance to argue back."`
`"Let's decide on an amount of time.`
` One minute.`
` If you cannot carry out your counterargument within one minute, victory will be proclaimed."`
`"Then allow me to impose the same rule on you.`
` At the time the game ends, the human side will be granted one minute to counter the mysteries it has been given.`
` If even a single mystery has not been countered within that time, it becomes the witch's victory, and that game is over.`
` ...It would be such a killjoy to have the game stopped for lengthy consideration, right?"`
`"......You asshole.`
` Moving things along without me...`
` But I more or less get what's going on.`
` Even if the lines I demand that you repeat aren't countered instantly, they've gotta be countered eventually."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ...And that must happen before 00:01 on October 6.`
` ...But be careful.`
` She only has to cut up one of the things you tell her to repeat.`
` You can't proclaim your victory unless you solve all the puzzles."`
`"Just as I can use the red,`
` from now on, I will allow you to use the blue, Battler."`
`"When explaining my magical murders with human tricks, you may state your claims in blue.`
` I am responsible for countering your blue with the red by the end of the game."`
`"Blue...`
` ...So I'll talk in blue when I tell you to repeat things...?"`
`"Not quite.`
` When you told me to repeat lines, you were able to do it for any trivial thing.`
` But the blue is a little more restrictive.`
` Unless it by itself denies witches, it will not be valid."`
`"............"`
`It's starting to get confusing, ...but it's more or less something like this.`
`For example, let's take one of the riddles in the past where I asked her to repeat something.`
`"The actual number of master keys is 5."`
`That had been to confirm that there really were 5 master keys, when she claimed there were no more than 5.`
`But since that by itself wouldn't deny witches, I can't say it in blue.`
`So, in order to speak in blue, I'd need to say something like this...`
`'The actual number of master keys was greater than 5.`
` The culprit entered or exited the room with that extra key!'`
`...Only then would the witch, who claimed that this was a closed room murder made with magic, be responsible for making a counterargument.`
`In other words, I can't demand that she repeat something that merely confirms the premises of my reasoning.`
`......That'll probably be a significant disadvantage for me.`
`Crap...`
` It's enough to make the red Beato used to toy with me until now look extremely merciful...`
`"...Damn it.`
` So even if I create a theory for a particular closed room and speak it in blue,`
` if Beato denies it at the very, very end, I won't even have time to create my next theory...?!`
` This rule's awful, horribly bad for me..."`
`"......Are you gonna surrender before the fight begins again?`
` Calm down.`
` No one said you could only use the blue once for each mystery.`
` Do you know what that means?"`
`"N-No.`
` ...What does it mean...?"`
`"In the pitiful way you've been fighting up until now, you've made a single theory, glanced at the witch's complexion,`
` and if that one didn't work, you'd then start making another theory.`
` You won't corner a witch like that."`
`"Then how should I fight...?`
` ......You don't mean..."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` ...You don't attack her riddles with a point.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~You assault them with a wall~ib~`
`.`
` You said so yourself in an earlier game, that the force of your reasoning should be like that."`
`Assault...with a wall.`
`That's right, I said so myself earlier.`
`Guessing and trying to expose the mystery is like trying to shoot a distant target with an arrow.`
`Until now, I've just been shooting off arrow after arrow,`
` asking the witch if I scored a hit,`
` and then preparing my bow again once I'm told that I've missed.`
`There's no way I'll hit at that rate...`
`Bullets might be a better example than arrows.`
`If you take one shot after another at a distant target with a handgun, you probably won't hit it easily.`
`...So how can you hit it?`
`If a handgun doesn't work,`
` ...use a shotgun!`
`Instead of a single bullet, beat her down with 'shot' comprised of countless projectiles at once...!`
`Shot scatters, so it impacts a wide area.`
`That makes it optimal for shooting small, fast targets like birds.`
`That's right, there's no rule that says I have to guess like a pistol, shooting one shot off at a time.`
`...Making a single theory and just hoping that it hits is no better than stopping your own thinking.`
`Blast away with a massive number of bullets, of guesses, and make them impact like a wall, so that only one of them hitting the target is enough.`
`"......Blue, huh...?`
` ...I get it.`
` If your red truth is a razor-sharp katana, then it looks like my blue is a shotgun.`
` No, ...a machine gun whose firepower'll turn the witch into a honeycomb."`
`"I see, so it's an awkward gun that fires many shots.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` That sort of crude analogy is just like you."`
`"The climax of a detective novel is always the same.`
` ...The famous detective gathers all the suspects at once and displays a single trail of logic that works splendidly.`
` Almost like William Tell spectacularly shooting through an apple with a single arrow.`
` That's why I mistakenly took that to be a virtue."`
`...It probably would be splendid.`
`If I could shoot through the truth with a single guess.`
`But, that isn't realistic.`
`Look at real wars.`
`Do they really have everyone pull long guns out of the trench, aim reeeally well, and take shots at each other one at a time?`
`They don't, right?!`
`They fire rapidly, they fire all over the place, they pin down the enemy with a barrage!`
`Reasoning is the same way.`
`Because of that weird virtue, I've been stuck thinking it's better to take one line of reasoning at a time.`
`We humans can fire off countless guesses and possibilities!`
`The bullet is the power of imagination.`
` Suspension of thought is a clogged barrel...!`
`The pathetic way I've been reasoning up until now is like a peashooter.`
`I've been so lame, weakly firing off shots, getting them denied in red, and then taking the next bullet and reloading.`
`My 'blue truth', which claims that humans and tricks are what's real,`
` will overpower its target, the illusion told by the witch, with its firepower and the force of what I can imagine...!`
`'!s0`
`Ushiromiya Battler's fighting style...!!`
`"......Thanks to you, I've figured out my true fighting style.`
` Thanks, Gretel!!"`
`"You're welcome."`
`"Makes me think of how pathetic I was before.`
` ...Yeah, it's like Beato said.`
` I've had a handicap up until now.`
` I'll acknowledge that...!!`
` New rule, understood!!`
` I have my own way of fighting!`
` I'll show you it!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` That willpower is good, I like it!`
` Then, try using it right away, this blue truth of yours...!!"`
`"...Yeah, I'll use it.`
` With this blue truth, I'll break apart your witch theory, which states that only a witch culprit was possible because everyone had alibis!!"`
`"This is my truth!`
`'!s0`
` Therefore, the true number of people on the island is 17!`
` By adding an unknown person X to that, it becomes 18 people.`
` By supposing that this person X exists, the crimes will be possible even if all 17 people have alibis!!"`
`"...In short, if you keep preventing us from meeting with Father, we will have to accept the following theory.`
` Simply put, Father is already dead.`
` But you're hiding that because you don't want the inheritance to be distributed."`
`".........`
`...Ridiculous."`
`"Th-That is correct, this is worse than ridiculous!!`
` I have never heard such an insult!!"`
`"It'd even be possible for us to check by force whether he's alive or dead, with the police there to witness it.`
` Isn't that right, Eva nee-san...?"`
`"...Y-Yes...`
` That's right, Nii-san.`
` There are all sorts of ways we could set you up.`
` We could easily arrange for a situation where you'd have to hold a meeting with Father under the supervision of a third party...!"`
`"Still,`
` I think that would bring a lot of shame to the Ushiromiya family.`
` That's why I'm making this proposal.`
` Here we have the responsibilities and duties of the caretaker.`
` And a penalty in the worst-case scenario.`
` If you consent to those terms, we'll be able to refrain from doing something like dragging Father outside."`
`"...Yeah, that's right, Aniki...`
` Didn't you just say it yourself...?`
` You're carrying out your natural duties as Dad's caretaker.`
` Kyrie's conditions shouldn't be anything to worry about, right?`
` Why this overreaction?"`
`"...Are you really that worried about having the position of Successor dragged out from under you if Dad dies something other than a natural death?"`
`"Or else, what?`
` Do you have some reason to think Father might die something other than a natural death...?"`
`"How could I?`
` ...I see, now I too understand how Father feels.`
` How pitiful his later years have been for him, unable even to die as he pleases."`
`"Yes, his later years truly have been pitiful.`
` ...And the thought that these 'later years' are already something of the past is exactly what we're suspecting."`
`"...You could completely clear this suspicion away just by letting us meet with Father.`
` ...So, even after being humiliated by us this much, you still won't allow us to meet with him, Krauss nii-san......?"`
`"............"`
`"Father is probably already dead.`
` The corpse may have been disposed of in absolute secrecy.`
` ...And after taking all of the wealth for yourself as Father's agent, `
`you will make it seem that he 'disappeared' until seven years pass, making Father a corpseless member of the deceased."`
`"......I'm sorry, but please don't take it badly, okay?`
` I'm just playing detective here."`
`"...H-How rude can one be?!!`
` You have no right to stay in this mansion!!`
` Leave immediately!!`
` I won't permit you to cross the threshold of this house again!!"`
`"It worked last year, but you've used up your luck if you thought it'd work this year too.`
` ...Father is in a bad mood, so he can't meet with us?`
` That was plenty suspicious last year, and yet you're doing it again."`
`"If you really wanted to fake being Father's agent and grab up all his assets, you should've done it a little more speedily,`
` making him disappear without waiting for today's family conference.`
` You really are naive, Krauss onii-sama..."`
`"......I have no idea what you are-"`
`"However!`
` ...If it's a fact that Father's in a bad mood,`
` and you're preventing us from meeting him as part of your responsibilities as his caretaker, then it's a very wonderful thing you're doing.`
` In that case, if you just accept our conditions, everything will be settled here and now."`
`"......After all, you care so greatly for Father, Krauss nii-san.`
` There's no way Father will die in a manner that leads to trouble during the autopsy."`
`"After all, Father hates hospitals, so he'll pass away in his study, right?`
` An autopsy will certainly be carried out no matter what happens.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ...The only way to ~ib~kill him without an autopsy~ib~ would be for him to disappear."`
`"......Enough, Kyrie-san. I think you've bullied Nii-san enough."`
`Eva rebuked Kyrie in an sickeningly kind voice.`
`...Considering the situation, that was impossible.`
`...Which is why it was sickening...`
`"I'm sure Nii-san has his own difficulties to worry about, as well as his pride.`
` True, Nii-san might consider that one of his natural duties,`
` but if you force him to put it on paper and assign penalties, `
`...I could hardly blame him for getting upset.`
` Don't you agree, Rosa...?"`
`"...Yes, that's right.`
` ......She might have made light of Krauss nii-san's pride as the eldest son a little too much.`
` ...I'd feel bad for him if we were to force him to sign a statement regarding the duties of the caretaker as Kyrie-san has laid them out."`
`"That's right.`
` You're doing a good job, Aniki.`
` Taking that into account, we might consider avoiding all that about signing strange papers and worst-case penalties...`
`and leave everything to you."`
`"...Y-You people......"`
`Not just Eva, but Rudolf and Rosa as well, with unnerving smiles on their faces as though they'd planned this beforehand, began closing in on Krauss.`
`They now understood perfectly how Kyrie had cornered Krauss...and exactly where she was prepared to compromise...`
`"...We were talking about a signed statement regarding the responsibilities of the caretaker.`
` But, even without signing such a thing, you can make it so that we'll never demand a meeting with Father again.`
` ...If you can prove your fitness as Father's caretaker with a form of guarantee other than a signed statement, that is."`
`"Are you telling me......to pay security money?`
` Hehheheheh, hahhahahahahaha...!`
` Hilarious!`
` Wahhahahahahahahahaha!"`
`"The security money will be paid to Eva-san, Rudolf-san, and Rosa-san, 3 billion yen each.`
` As a deposit, you will transfer ten percent of that, 300 million yen, before the year is out."`
`"9 billion?!`
` I don't have that kind of money!!!"`
`"After Father passes away, you should be able to work it out.`
` We've managed to investigate at least that far.`
` You should be able to handle the deposit of 900 million yen in your current financial situation."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"And it should even be possible for you to ~ib~borrow it from Father~ib~, right?`
` ...There's no need for obvious charades anymore."`
`"......H-How unpleasant.`
` Truly unpleasant...!!"`
`"I-It is at that!!`
` Even just the discussion of Father's inheritance was far too disrespectful!`
` Father is already dead?`
` My husband is hiding that and keeping all the money for himself?!`
` I have had enough of this!!`
` None of you are qualified to bear the name Ushiromiya any longer!!"`
`"Calm down, Natsuhi-san...!`
` We've all said all we need to!`
` Why don't we leave it at that for now...?!`
` This is happinin' all of a sudden and on a massive scale.`
` We might even be gettin' agitated ourselves!"`
`"Why don't we take a break for a while and cool our heads?`
` Krauss nii-san probably needs a little time himself.`
` Right, Krauss nii-san?"`
`".........Time...?`
` And why would I need something like that?"`
`"Don't worry, don't worry!`
` We aren't thinkin' of anythin' shady!`
` We're just so eager to see Father that we've started grumblin' a bit...!`
` And Krauss nii-san, I know reeeal well how you're dyin' to get back at us for the things we've said...!"`
`"If you're willin' to go so far, then you just need to let us meet with him!`
` Right?`
` Isn't that right?`
` You just got a bit stubborn, and it felt awkward to say you'd let us see him after sayin' we couldn't all those times.`
` Isn't that it?`
` Right? Right?"`
`"...I-It certainly does seem that my husband has lost his composure slightly, just like the rest of you have.`
` ...We were only refusing stubbornly out of respect for Father's desire not to meet with everyone."`
`".........`
`...Indeed, that's right.`
` It was turning into another sibling fight like the old days, and I started feeling stubborn as well.`
` ......Let us cool our heads.`
` ...I understand how much you all want to meet with Father.`
` ...I will pass that on to him.`
` ......I'll find some way to convince Father to meet with you.`
` ......Will that do?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` I think it'd be okay to give Krauss nii-san some time to persuade Father."`
`"Yep.`
` ...We're counting on you, Aniki.`
` Please persuade him to meet with us.`
` After all, you're Dad's caretaker."`
`"And as for persuading him, ...let's set a limit on it to sometime tonight, okay?`
` When tomorrow comes, we'll confirm Father's well-being, even if we have to break down the door to his study.`
` ......You have no problems with that, I take it?`
` Nii-san...?"`
`"...Do as you like.`
` I see, it seems even the time I've been given to persuade him is short.`
` ...Let us go, Natsuhi.`
` We shall ask him to join us for dinner at least."`
`"R-Right...!"`
`Krauss left the parlor with Natsuhi.`
`Once their footsteps disappeared,`
` Hideyoshi took a deep breath, smirking and flopping onto the sofa...`
`"......Kyrie-san,`
` ...you're...a frightenin' person."`
`"Sorry for speaking out of turn.`
` I apologize."`
`"...No, no. You didn't corner him like we'd originally planned, but in the end, this was even better.`
` ...Just like always, I've gotta bow my head to you..."`
`"But...can he really prepare 900 million...?`
` I believe we estimated that 750 million would be the most Krauss nii-san could afford with his current financial situation...`
` ...Isn't 900 million gouging him too much...?"`
`"If he can't do it, that's fine too.`
` If we do something like lowering it to 750 million so Krauss nii-san can save face, it'll look like we're compromising and it'll be easier to settle, right?`
` And if he really does come out with 900 million, that's even better."`
`"Nii-san is probably having a strategy meeting with Natsuhi-san about now.`
` ...It really will be interesting to see what kind of twisted logic our proud Nii-san comes up with as an excuse."`
`"Convince Father...?`
` There's no way he can."`
`There's no way to convince someone who isn't even there...!`
`"......The siblings have all come, despite their various circumstances, for this annual family conference."`
`Krauss and Natsuhi could be seen in Kinzo's dimly lit study.`
`Every once in a while, thunder could be heard, and the dimly lit room flickered with light.`
`...It seemed that the island would be closed off by the storm very soon.`
`"...Father...!`
` Please, just this once, show those disrespectful people the majesty of the Head...!"`
`"It's useless......"`
`The large shadow of a person standing by the window, his majestic back facing them,`
` ...answered quietly and forcefully.`
`He hung his head and shook.`
`...Eventually, they could hear a mumbling laugh over his shoulder.`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* Hahahahahaha!!`
` It's useless, it's all useless...!!`
` Wahhahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`......Three months left to live...?`
` An almost finished geezer...?`
`To whom exactly are you referring?`
`"You foooools!!`
` Did you wander over here because your siblings threatened you?`
` Know your shame!!"`
`As Kinzo turned and brushed his cape, it flashed forcefully through the room's stale air.`
`That air pressure truly signified Ushiromiya Kinzo's majesty and willpower itself.`
`After being blown back by that wind, it wasn't strange that Krauss landed on his butt.`
`As though showing consideration for Krauss, who looked as though his legs had been swept out from under him, Natsuhi also crouched down.`
`'!s0`
`...with a *thunk*, `
`...*thunk*, `
`Kinzo's footsteps approached with a heft that signified his dignity.`
`"...F-Father......"`
`"Yoou fooooooooool...!!`
` I heard from Kanon. Just how far did you pathetically let your siblings lead you around by the nose?!?!"`
`"F-Father...!`
` My husband is doing his best to protect your honor..."`
`Without lending an ear to Natsuhi's words, Kinzo extended his palm to Krauss's collar, as the latter sat on the floor.`
`...No, he curled his fingers, leaving only his pointer finger out, then took that finger and...`
`'!s0`
`...twisted it, `
`.........and slowly, `
`with just one finger, `
`...picked Krauss up into the air.`
`"...You really are a pathetic fooooooool.`
` ...You let your wife speak in your defense?`
` If you have an excuse, give it yourself!!"`
`"Gaggahh, .........gwah...!!"`
`Krauss clawed at the air.`
`Kinzo's brawny finger was choking him.`
`He couldn't even open his mouth, much less talk.`
`However, even if he had been able to open his mouth, `
`as he was now, there was no way he'd be able to think up an excuse that Kinzo would accept...`
`Still, ...how could this power be described...?`
`No one would call Kinzo an old man after seeing this superhuman strength...`
`"...Father...!!`
` My husband is fighting in his own way...!!`
` Please, forgive him...!!"`
`"......Natsuhii.`
` ...Fighting is a process you go through before winning.`
` ...The process you go through before losing isn't called fighting."`
`"That's called being pathetic!!`
` Wahhahahahahahahaha, you call this my successor?`
` Wahhahahahahahaha, wahhahhahhahahahahahahahhaaaaaaah!!"`
`As thunder roared, Kinzo laughed heartily as though nothing could be more pleasant.`
`And when he finished laughing, he threw his son away like he was scrap paper,`
` slamming him against the wall...`
`"Gwah, ...uuuuuuuuu..."`
`"Dear, dear...!! Are you okay..."`
`Krauss slid down the wall, rubbing his throat as though in pain...`
` Natsuhi ran up to him and looked after him...`
`But without showing any interest in the two of them, `
`Kinzo returned to the space near the window, as though he had been there the whole time, and looked up at the thunderclouds of misfortune.`
`"......I thought I would have no regrets in my life, if only I could meet Beatrice,`
` but it seems it won't go so smoothly.`
` ...It was promised from the beginning that nothing received from the witch would remain.`
` However, the Ushiromiya name is not the property of the witch.`
` ...Who is fit to succeed that name?`
` It seems that this alone must be resolved by my own hand.`
` ...Rejoice, Krauss!!`
` I have changed my mind."`
`"......F-Father...`
` ......So...?"`
`"I have no desire to have dinner with you cowards.`
` However, I will attend the family conference afterwards!"`
`"F-Father...`
` Thank you very much...!"`
`"There, I shall make a great announcement regarding the succession of the Head.`
` I will resolve your foolish quarrel myself!!`
` Uuhhahahahahahaha, waaahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahah!!!"`
`Forcefully opening the door with a clunk, Rosa flew in with Maria.`
`"Is Genji-san or anyone there...?!`
` It doesn't matter who, bring us a bath towel...!!"`
`There was already a full-blown typhoon outside, and it was starting to pour down hard.`
`Even though she'd had an umbrella, Maria had been in the rose garden amid all that wind and rain the whole time.`
`She had grown ice cold.`
`Maria had gotten into a minor fight with Rosa in the rose garden and had been told to stay there.`
`...She had done as she was told and had continued to wait in that spot, even though rain was pouring down.`
`Rosa certainly had gotten a little emotional and angry, `
`but Maria's stubborn whim was probably more to blame.`
`...The cousins, who had seen that exchange,`
` were relieved to see that mother and child were close to each other again.`
`Rosa scrubbed Maria's head with a towel.`
`She seemed overcome with worry that Maria had caught a cold, but Maria herself was nonchalant.`
`"Are you okay?`
` You didn't catch a cold, did you?`
` Maybe we really should go back for now and get a change of clothes..."`
`"Uu-, I'm just fine!`
` More importantly, I'm hungry, so food's better than changing clothes, uu-!"`
`"Hahahaha.`
` She looks okay, Aunt Rosa.`
` She's gotta be if she's this spirited."`
`"It's a really good thing she had an umbrella.`
` ...I was thinking she might be soaked to the bone.`
` The fact that she had an umbrella certainly is a silver lining."`
`"But Maria!`
` Even if you have an umbrella, you've gotta get to shelter when it starts raining so hard, okay?`
` Little girls definitely shouldn't let their bodies get cold."`
`"......Uu-."`
`"It's okay, Jessica-chan.`
` ...It's Mama's fault for telling her to stay there.`
` I'm really sorry, I'm really sorry...!!"`
`"Uu-!`
` I'm a good girl?`
` I'm a good girl for doing what Mama said?`
` I stayed there even though it was cold, stayed there until Mama came!`
` Uu-uu-!"`
`"Yes, you really are a good girl, Maria.`
` You did exactly what Mama said...`
` Very well done.`
` But next time, even if Mama tells you to do something, find some shelter if it starts raining like that.`
` Okay...?`
` Promise Mama."`
`"Uu-.`
` Promise Mama.`
` ...Uu-☆"`
`As Rosa gently held Maria, they joined their pinkies together and promised.`
`Battler and the others realized that by touching her mother's pinky, `
`the warmth had started to return to Maria's body.`
`"Kanon-kun, thanks for the towel.`
` That really helped."`
`"...Then, if you would excuse me."`
`As Kanon bowed with a blank expression, as though he'd done nothing that required gratitude, he left the parlor.`
`"...Okay, it's already dinnertime.`
` Let's all go together.`
` ...I'll even give Maria my dessert for being so good."`
`"Uu-!`
` Really Mama?!`
` Uu-uu-, get dessert, uu-uu-uu-♪`
` Love Mama, love Mama!"`
`"Hey, Maria, don't jump around.`
` Mama loves you too, Maria.`
` Love Maria, love Maria."`
`"I love Mama too, love Mama!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-!"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-uu-♪"`
`Rosa and Maria looked really close.`
` Even the cousins who watched started to feel a long-forgotten warmth fill up their chests.`
`"...You know, that might be the age when you're on your best terms with your parents."`
`"It wasn't like that for me.`
` Mom was always yelling at me to study, study, study."`
`"That's because they love their children.`
` A parent's love isn't always gentle and indulgent.`
` My mother was strict with me too, but now I realize that it was because she treasured me so."`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!`
` Love Mama, love Mama!"`
`"Love Maria, love Maria♪ So, shall we get some food?`
` Let's be friends and hold hands."`
`"Uu-!`
` Be friends and hold hands!`
` Mama and me, friends, friends♪"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` Mama and Maria are friends.`
` We'll aaalways be like this.`
` I love you, Maria..."`
`"......What's going on, all of a sudden?`
` ...What's up?"`
`The sudden sound had come from the teacup Gretel had been holding, which had fallen and smashed.`
`"......Sorry.`
` I got careless.`
` Sorry for dropping it."`
`The cup on the floor had smashed to pieces.`
`...Would it really have made such a sound and smashed to pieces just by being dropped from that height?`
`Even someone as thick-headed as Battler could realize that she was in a bad mood over something,`
` but he couldn't understand why she had suddenly grown so displeased.`
`When she made to bend over and pick up the fragments of the cup, Ronove appeared out of nowhere and stopped her.`
`"You will injure yourself.`
` Leave the cleaning up to me.`
` Shall I bring you another cup of black tea...?"`
`"...I don't need it.`
` ......I guess a demon's black tea just doesn't match my tastes."`
`"Hoh.`
` To think there's someone whose tastes aren't satisfied even by Ronove's tea.`
` I must respect your discerning palate."`
`"......I'm getting bored, so I'll go out for a second."`
`"Bored?`
` Wait a sec, this is where things start to get interesting.`
` About now, Maria is probably going to say that she got an umbrella and a letter from Beatrice again, right?`
` This is the essential part..."`
`"Excuse me.`
` Sorry, I'm counting on you to clean this up."`
`"Leave it to me."`
`Without saying anything else, Gretel disappeared of her own accord.`
` Her form literally melted and disappeared into thin air...`
`There was definitely a displeased expression on her face.`
`But neither Battler nor Ronove, and of course, not Beato either, could understand why her mood had so suddenly worsened.`
`All that remained was the scent of the black tea she'd spilled...`
`......I don't like it.`
`No, to be more blunt, it disgusts me.`
`"Uu-...?`
` ...Why are you so irritated, Ange...?"`
`"Why, you say?!`
` Isn't it obvious...?"`
`"Uu-.`
` ...I don't understand..."`
`Even Maria onee-chan, with that blank expression on her face, ...irritated me.`
`As I held my hands palms up in the empty air, from out of nowhere, a single book landed on them.`
`......It was Maria onee-chan's diary.`
`Even though I didn't turn the pages, the pages were flipped through, despite there being no wind,`
` and the door to Maria onee-chan's world opened.`
`"...Why do you think I'm not happy, Ange?"`
`"......Think about it objectively."`
`"By objectively, you mean from your viewpoint, right?"`
`".........`
`...Are you trying to say that the truth is different for me and you, Maria onee-chan?"`
`"Truth can change its form depending on the observer.`
` And observers from the future always overwrite that form.`
` ......Ange, what are you trying to do to my happiness...?"`
`"............"`
`The pages of the diary were flipped through at greater and greater speeds...`
` Then, a brilliant light poured out from the depths of the diary, ...swallowing everything up and painting over everything with white.`
`"......Sorry, Maria.`
` Mama has to take care of some urgent business that's piled up, so I need to stay holed up at the company for a while.`
` ...I probably won't be able to come back home until late at night the day after tomorrow."`
`"...Uu-.`
` ...Then, what about your promise to go to the movies with me on Sunday...?"`
`"The movies...?`
` Umm-"`
`Judging by Rosa's tone, she had clearly forgotten that promise.`
`But Maria's response to that was an apology for asking...`
`......I'm sorry.`
`Maria apologized for troubling her mother by asking that question...`
`"......I'll stay home.`
` I'll definitely wait patiently.`
` ...I'll take a bath every day and change my underwear.`
` ...And I know where the money is.`
` ......I'll go to a different store every day.`
` I'll try not to go out too late.`
` If a policeman asks, I'll say I'm running errands for Mama.`
` ...I'll do what Mama says, like Mama says."`
`"............`
`...That's right.`
` You really are being a good girl.`
` If you do that, I'll buy you a present.`
` Okay?`
` Go to bed by 9:00.`
` You mustn't tell the teacher or any adults that Mama isn't coming home.`
` Okay...?"`
`".........Yes.`
` ...So Mama, do your best at work.`
` ...Do your best, finish your work, ...and come back as soon as you can...`
` I...won't cry all night and annoy the neighbors anymore...`
` ...So come back quickly......"`
`"......`
`...Well then, I'm busy, so I'll hang up.`
` ...Be a good girl and wait.`
` Don't do anything you shouldn't.`
` Goodbye."`
`*click*.`
` ...With a tone of finality in her voice, Rosa hung up the phone without waiting for Maria's answer.`
`Maria politely set down the receiver and returned to the sofa.`
`There sat the stuffed animal Sakutaro, with whom she'd been watching TV until a second ago.`
`Sakutaro was holding the remote control to the TV.`
`...The TV had been turned off because of the phone call.`
`He looked like he was telling her to push the switch because he wanted to watch TV again quickly.`
`"......Sakutaro,`
` ...wanna watch...TV?"`
`『...Uryu?`
` You don't want to watch anymore, Maria...?`
` If the actors' team gets all the questions right, they can still make a huge comeback.`
` Uryu-!〝`
`"......No.`
` ......That's enough...TV."`
`Again, ...Mama was busy with her work and didn't come home.`
`Mama works so much overtime that she doesn't come home until late.`
`...Because she has 'dates' or something, she always comes home after drinking a lot of alcohol, even though she's not good at drinking,`
` and with a pale face, she'll go straight into the shower and then to bed.`
`And because she has overtime even on the weekends or something, she says she has to spend the night there, and almost never comes home.`
`...Recently, she started saying something about how she's got a big job she's working on, so this sort of thing happens a lot...`
`...The pictures I did my best on during drawing time were laughed at by everyone,`
` but even so, I wanted to show them just to Mama, ...and once again, she won't be able to look at them for me.`
`And I could talk about the time everyone pushed the job of cleaning up onto me, but I did my best by myself and was praised by the teacher.`
`Or the time I went shopping, and the man at the shop said I'm always such a good kid and gave me a free canned coffee.`
`Then there was the time I wanted to encourage Mama because she worked so hard on her job...`
`and hid a card for her under her pillow.`
`"......And there's a lot...of other things...I wanted to talk about."`
`『......Mama's working really hard at her job.`
` She's working with all of her strength so that we can eat every day.〝`
`"...I hate her job.`
` ...If only she'd just quit."`
`『A job is an important thing for adults to do.`
` ...It lets Maria eat, `
`buys clothes, `
`pays for school lunches, `
`and pays the deposit for summer camp.`
` ...All that happens because Mama works and earns money.〝`
`".........`
`...I don't need food.`
` Don't need clothes.`
` Don't need school lunches and don't want to go to summer camp.`
` ...It's not like any of the groups will let me join in."`
`『Uryu...`
` ...Just now, on the phone, Mama promised that she'd buy a present when she comes back from work, right?`
` I think she made that promise because you're important to her, Maria, `
`and she'd feel bad if she made you lonely.〝`
`"...You think so?"`
`『Uryu!`
` It definitely isn't a pain for her, or annoying, or anything!`
` ...Mama also wants to be by your side all the time, Maria.`
` ...It's also painful and sad for her, since she can't do that.`
` ......I remember when she spent the whole night by your side, crying.〝`
`"......Yeah.`
` ...I didn't understand why she was crying, ...but she was so sad,`
` ...and I couldn't do anything but stay silent by her side."`
`『I remember the last thing Mama said then.`
` ...She said 'Thank you, Maria'.`
` ......She said that just by being by her side, you were her only ally in the world.`
` ...Uryu, do you remember?〝`
`"Yeah...`
` ......I'm her only ally in the world, `
`...she said."`
`Sakutaro set the remote control on the table, crawled up onto the sofa,`
` sat on my lap, ...and spoke to me, gazing into my eyes.`
`『...I'm sure Mama feels the same way you do, Maria.`
` ......The designs Mama draws are the only ones laughed at by her clients.`
` ...Only Mama's company has troublesome jobs pushed onto it by other companies.`
` Mama is the president, so she has to take care of everything by herself.`
` ...Only Mama's company never gets included in the business of other companies.`
` ......Mama's only ally is Maria.`
` ...If you tell her to stop doing her job, ...where in the world could she find an ally......?〝`
`"......Nnng, `
`......Sakutaro..."`
`『The only person I have in the whole world is Maria.`
` ...The only person Mama has in the whole world is Maria.`
` ......What about you, Maria?〝`
`"...I've got Mama, and I've got you too, Sakutaro..."`
`『So, Maria, you aren't lonely at all!`
` Uryu!〝`
`"......Uu-."`
`『Since Mama's busy with her work, she can't be together with you very often, but please, don't blame her for that, Maria.`
` ...In exchange, I'll always be here, will be by your side forever.`
` ......So don't cry, okay...?`
` ......Uryu...`
` Can't your sadness be stopped......if I'm with you...?〝`
`"......Uuu, ...uuuuuuuuuuu, Sakutaro...`
` ...Uuuuuuuuu!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaahhh, waaaaaaaaaaaahhh..."`
`......From the corner of Maria's heart, which she had been doing her best to seal up, ...drops of sadness finally dripped down.`
` ...*drip*drip*.`
` *drop*drop*.`
`...*drip*drop*drip*drop*.`
`...Even though weekends when Mama didn't come home weren't that rare a thing.`
`...It wasn't as though that night was particularly painful or sad compared to other nights.`
`...And yet, Maria's tears poured down.`
`『Uryu-...!`
` Maria, don't cry...`
` I'll always be with you...`
` Even if you cry, Maria, I won't.`
` I'm a lion cub, so I won't cry even if I'm lonely.`
` ...Even though I want to cry too, I won't...!〝`
`"Why won't you cry, Sakutaro...?`
` Even though you're so sad that you can't hold back the tears, you won't cry...?"`
`『Uryu.`
` But if I cry, who will make you feel better...?`
` So I won't.`
` After all, I want to get your spirits up.〝`
`"If I get my spirits up, ...will Mama come back...?"`
`『When Mama comes back, if she's welcomed by a happy Maria, ...I'm sure she'll be happy.`
` Uryu.〝`
`"...Mama...will be happy...?"`
`『Uryu.`
` If you do that, then I'm sure her fatigue from work will also be healed.`
` Then, I'm sure she'll start feeling better sooner and will play with you a lot.〝`
`"............"`
`『When you come home and Mama's waiting for you there, and she's in the kitchen in high spirits, don't you feel really happy?`
` I'm sure Mama feels the same way.〝`
`"...So if I watch over the house in high spirits, ...Mama will be happy too?"`
`『Uryu!〝`
`Sakutaro nodded deeply with his big head.`
`The tears couldn't keep falling from Maria's eyes.`
`...If she greeted Mama with a tear-stained face, Mama would probably get sad too.`
`『You know about it, Maria.`
` You can't use the magic that creates smiles if you aren't smiling too.〝`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...I know.`
` So, I won't cry anymore."`
`『Hey, Maria.`
` I have an idea for how to have a fun time.`
` ...Uryu, wanna hear it?〝`
`"...What?"`
`『Mama won't come back until late night Sunday.`
` So let's have a pajama party and keep it a secret from Mama.〝`
`"A pajama party...?"`
`『Until you get tired late tonight, eat candy and drink soda in bed, and play with me.〝`
`"A pajama party.`
` ...Yeah, sounds fun.`
` ...I don't have to go to bed at 9:00, right?`
` Mama won't get mad if I don't sleep?"`
`『This is a secret between me and you, only for when Mama isn't around.`
` So tonight, until you get sleepy, let's have fun the whole time.`
` Let's eat jellybeans and try to guess what color we'll get next.`
` Let's split open peanuts and try to guess which half is the Grandpa.`
` Let's search for treasure in the closet.`
` And more, and more!`
` I wonder what it'll taste like if we mix cola and melon soda.〝`
`"Uu-.`
` I wanted to try it once, but asked Mama if it was okay and she got mad."`
`『Uryu-!`
` Let's keep it a secret from Mama and try it out♪`
` Tonight, let's play a lot, laugh a lot, and blow away our tears with happiness.`
` Don't worry, it'll definitely be fun if I'm here!`
` I'll definitely make you happy, Maria.〝`
`"Yeah, yeah!`
` It'll definitely be fun if Sakutaro's there.`
` I'll definitely be happy.`
` Thank you, Sakutaro.`
` I won't cry anymore.`
` Let's play all we can, get happy all we can, and say welcome back when Mama gets home."`
`『Uryu-!`
` Tonight, let's play a lot and feel a lot better♪`
` Let's have the kind of secret party we can only have when Mama isn't here.`
` If we're noisy enough, I'm sure plenty of friends will come to play from the land of the looking glass and wonderland.`
` Then, we'll have so many friends that we won't be able to get bored.`
` Uryu-!〝`
`"Uryu-!!"`
`...Then, Maria began her pajama party all alone with Sakutaro, having fun until late into the night.`
`She played by sticking her hand into the bag of jellybeans without looking, trying to guess which color she'd pull out next.`
`...Sakutaro had good intuition and got it right a lot.`
`Maria also had a brilliant streak where she guessed right four times in a row.`
`The game where she split peanuts open and tried to guess which was the Grandpa...`
`was easier than guessing the color of the jellybeans, so she got it right a lot.`
`Sucking her salt-covered fingers was impolite, but that was the yummiest part.`
`She liked both cola and melon soda on their own.`
`She hoped that by mixing her two favorite drinks, there might be a flash of light like alchemy,`
` and a new drink that no one had ever tasted before would be created.`
`She got excited about how, if it turned out really delicious, she'd call it Sakutaro Soda and sell it.`
`But, unexpectedly, it had a weird taste that she hadn't hoped for.`
`And the color was somewhat dull and thick.`
`...Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised that black and green mixed together would make this.`
`...Too bad. I imagined that it'd become a sparkling pineapple color.`
`But, it was an awesome, incredible, fun night.`
`If it's this fun here, maybe Mama will feel like coming home and drop by out of the blue.`
`...So, I got the feeling that Mama might suddenly come home and went to the front door many times to check, `
`but there was no way Mama would be able to come home when she was this busy with work.`
`But rather than a feeling of loneliness, `
`it felt just a little disappointing that Mama couldn't join in on this fun late-night party.`
`Sometime soon, I'll do this when Mama is around and let her join in.`
`Mama likes some things I don't think are yummy,`
` so maybe she'll really like Sakutaro Soda.`
`When Mama comes back tired, I'll serve her some.`
`And more than anything.`
`...I want to at least write about this fun night in a letter and tell Mama about it.`
`So that these feelings of happiness will reach Mama too.`
`Her work is always so tough and she comes home so tired, so I hope I can share this happiness with her.`
`Mama will almost certainly come home tired late Sunday night,`
` and I hope I can brighten her day even just a little by sharing this happiness...`
`I gently placed that letter on Mama's desk.`
`'To Mama.`
` Good job with your work again today☆ Let me share my happiness with you.`
` ——From Maria'`
`Then, I decided to give a present to Sakutaro for proposing this wonderful party.`
`It was a small, red muffler I found when searching for treasure in the closet.`
`When I was still very young, Mama knitted this tiny thing.`
`'Maria' was embroidered on it with knitting wool.`
`...I softly wrapped that muffler around Sakutaro.`
`It really suited him, accenting his yellow with red very well.`
`『......Uryu.`
` ...Does it look good on me...?〝`
`Sakutaro looked embarrassed as he wore his first present ever.`
`...Yeah.`
` It really looks good on him.`
`"Uu-.`
` Sakutaro, thank you so much for everything.`
` It was so fun tonight.`
` I can't even remember why I was crying.`
` ...Let's be together from now on.`
` And let's always play and laugh together."`
`『Uryu-!`
` Love you, Maria!〝`
`"Me too.`
` Love you, Sakutaro."`
`After playing so wildly, Maria's room was a mess.`
`Maybe she played a little too much.`
`...But I'm tired for today, so let's sleep together.`
`And tomorrow, we'll clean up together and welcome Mama with a clean room.`
` ...All right, Sakutaro?`
`Uryu-♪`
`"...See?`
` I am...no, we are so happy, right?"`
`"......`
`Is this your happiness, Maria onee-chan...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I'm happy."`
`"...Even though you were looking forward to that movie so much, and Aunt Rosa promised that she'd definitely take you, she completely forgot."`
`"She just happened to forget because she was so busy with work.`
` ...Even if she remembered, with her work, there'd be nothing she could do.`
` Whether she remembered or not, Mama would've spent the night at work.`
` She couldn't go to the movies.`
` ......Whether she remembered or not is a minor issue."`
`...There's no way that's a minor issue.`
`After all, ...when Aunt Rosa answered 'Movie?' on the phone, `
`it was obvious that she'd completely forgotten her promise.`
`And when she heard that, Maria onee-chan's mood definitely darkened.`
`"Well, ...like you say, `
`even if Aunt Rosa had remembered her promise, you wouldn't have been able to go to the movies in the end.`
` ...But even so.`
` ...To think that your mother just forgot her promise to spend one of her few days off with you, ...it's sad.`
` I'd be mad."`
`"............`
`...Yeah.`
` It was sad.`
` Because even if she had remembered, we wouldn't have been able to go to the movies.`
` ...But after that, I had a very, very fun night with Sakutaro.`
` You must've thought that pajama party looked really fun too, Ange."`
`".........`
`There's no way that would be fun.`
` ...I mean, all that messing around you did that night...`
`was just intentionally making a big fuss about nothing, all so you could forget that you were lonely and that your mother wasn't coming home."`
`"That's not true.`
` I really did have a fun party with Sakutaro."`
`"No, that's wrong!`
` You were just so sad, and you hated your mother so much for forgetting her promise, that you made a mess of your room...!!"`
`"......Where was something like that ever written in my diary?"`
`"It isn't written anywhere!`
` But...by reading in the gaps between every line, I can understand your feelings!`
` You didn't have a good time at all that evening!`
` And you stayed up late when you were told not to, broke the strict rule about eating sweets outside of snack time, `
`...and when even that didn't bury your sadness, you went wild in your room......and made a mess of it, right...?!!`
` And after you made a mess of your room and were all tired out, `
`......all you did was claw at the bed sheets and cry yourself to sleep, right...?!"`
`"......The diary does say that Mama probably forgot her promise about the movie...`
`and that I stayed up late having a pajama party with Sakutaro...and made a mess of my room searching for treasure."`
`"Yes.`
` And......this is what it means!`
` You were starving for Aunt Rosa's love, Maria onee-chan...!`
` And Aunt Rosa always put her work and her public image first, always keeping you on the back-burner...!"`
`"That's what disgusts me!`
` Because I know just how superficial Aunt Rosa's words of love for you were!!`
` You should realize this yourself!"`
`"So, ...how can you say you're happy despite that?!`
` I don't understand...that part of you, Maria onee-chan!!`
` Even at my age, I can't understand it at all...!!`
` Why aren't you sad?`
` Why is it that you can experience a reality filled with misfortune and can call yourself happy?!`
` I can't do it, I can't understand it...!!"`
`"......You're a sad kid, Ange."`
`"I don't get it!!`
` Why are you pitying me?!"`
`"......Even though a 'fact' about a really fun pajama party is written about in my diary,`
` ......if the same 'fact' is observed by different people, it has a different form."`
`I remembered talking about something like this with Bernkastel.`
`Truth is unfixed and changes its form every time it's witnessed.`
`By the way it's perceived...in other words, depending on the person who perceives it, a single truth becomes different truths.`
`And truths of the past are painted over by truths of the future...`
`"In this diary, I wrote that what happened that night was very, very fun."`
`"...You described the events of that night as something very happy."`
`"And yet, when you read the diary, the events of that night sound very, very sad."`
`"...Even though you describe it as a happy scene, I read between the lines and realized that that wasn't true."`
`"Stop it."`
`"............"`
`"This...tells of a happy night.`
` ......This is...the 'truth' of that night.`
` Please, don't take this happy truth...`
`...and paint over it with a new, different truth."`
`"......Are you...happy with this, Maria onee-chan?"`
`"Yes.`
` I'm happy.`
` ......That's why I feel sad for you, since you wouldn't be able to feel happiness in a similar situation."`
`......Right now, I'm like she was then...`
` Just as isolated, with no friends.`
`Ange...had accepted her isolated reality for what it was.`
`But Maria...painted over her isolated reality with a reality of happiness.`
`Ushiromiya Maria took a sad truth...`
`and changed it into happiness.`
`That was...`
`the only, and yet very large, ...difference between me and Maria onee-chan.`
`And, even though I'm unable to accept it, `
`...I'm also jealous of that power.`
`"Yes.`
` ...That's right.`
` This is 'power'.`
` ...I was able to find happiness with that power.`
` Because you don't have that power, you can't find happiness, Ange."`
`"What......is...`
`...that power......?"`
`"I didn't know what to call that power either.`
` ...Not at this point in time, at least.`
` ...Eventually, I was taught its true form.`
` ...I'll talk about it later.`
` On the next page.`
` ......So then, so then, late Sunday night,`
` Mama came back with a present, just like she'd promised..."`
`"......I'm back."`
`"Mama, welcome hoooooooome!!"`
`『Uryu-!!`
` Mama came back, Mama came back!〝`
`Waiting to greet Rosa as she returned home all tired out...`
`was Maria, in an unbelievably good mood, holding Sakutaro.`
`Most likely, Rosa's worn-out expression was partly because she really was tired, `
`...but partly because it would be a pain when Maria, who should've been grumbling after staying home alone for several days, would cling to her, sobbing.`
`However, when she was welcomed by an unbelievably happy Maria...`
`and found that her fears were unbelievably needless, Rosa couldn't hide her surprise.`
`"Wh-What's going on, Maria...?`
` You're in a great mood...?!`
` Is someone here...?!"`
`It was strange enough to make Rosa think that a friend had come over, and that she'd come home right when they were having a good time playing together.`
`But there were no other shoes by the entrance.`
`...Even though Maria was in such high spirits, she had been home alone.`
`At first, Rosa was suspicious that the cause of this unexpected good mood could be nothing good,`
` but that really was a needless fear, ...and in any event, Maria really had been in a good mood while she watched over the house.`
`......Even if Rosa's heart had been as cold and hard as a rock, ...after being welcomed with a smile like this...`
`Rosa started to honestly accept that smile, and a smile rose to her own face automatically.`
`...In that smile, you could no longer see any of the weariness of someone who'd been unable to return home for several days.`
`Maria kept talking about what a fun time she'd had playing with her stuffed animal, Sakutaro.`
`Rosa really hadn't imagined that the stuffed animal she herself had given would be so appreciated, and she couldn't hide her pleased surprise.`
`"I see.`
` So you spent the time together with Sakutaro.`
` Well done, Maria.`
` Here's a present for Maria and Sakutaro for being so good."`
`『Uryu-!`
` A present!`
` A present!〝`
`"Uu-!`
` What is it, what is it?!"`
`Both Maria and Sakutaro started jumping around.`
`There were two presents.`
`One contained an assortment of Western sweets.`
`Inside was a Scotch cake.`
`It looked to be of very high quality.`
`But Maria was more interested in the other one.`
`The other one was an even bigger box, and it was pretty heavy.`
`"Go ahead and open it.`
` They might become new friends for you and Sakutaro, okay?"`
`"Waaaaaaaaaahhh...!`
` What's this?!`
` What's this?!!"`
`Inside, laid there like chess pieces, were about 20 small ceramic figures shaped like animals.`
`Squirrels, rabbits, small birds, dogs and cats.`
`And they were all holding musical instruments.`
`In addition to them, there was also a panorama-style background.`
`A forest scene was drawn on it.`
`The small forest animals were gathered in a plaza and looked like they were having a good time.`
`Rosa set it up on the table.`
`...And when she then lined up the ceramic figures like chess pieces in front of it, `
`......it became a band of forest animals.`
`"Isn't it wonderful?`
` I saw it in a store window, and I was taken with it at a glance.`
` This is a present for you for being such a good girl home alone, Maria."`
`"Uuuu---!!!`
` Thank you, Mama!!!`
` Awesome, Sakutaro!`
` Look how much our friends have grown...!`
` It's just like you said, Sakutaro.`
` It was true that if we had a fun, noisy time, we'd get more friends...!"`
`『Right, didn't I tell you?`
` Look, we have more friends, look, we have more friends!`
` Uryu-♪〝`
`Relieved that her gift had been appreciated, `
`Rosa remembered that she'd been filled with several days of weariness...`
`"Mama, you really worked hard...!`
` Go take a shower.`
` If you take a hot one, I'm sure your weariness will go away.`
` Wanna take a bath?`
` I'll choose what to put in the bath today!"`
`"Thank you.`
` But it's already late, so get ready to go to bed.`
` Mama is tired, so I'll just take a shower and go to sleep.`
` I have to get up early tomorrow."`
`"Yeah, got it!`
`"I can do it myself...`
` ...Oh, thank you."`
`"Mama, your coat is full of smells from outside.`
` ...Uu-?`
` Oh, sorry, something fell out.`
` I'll pick it up, okay?"`
`When she took Rosa's coat, a receipt or ticket stub or something fell out.`
`...It had been in Mama's pocket, so it was probably important.`
`Maria hurriedly picked it up...`
`It looked like a ticket for the Green Car or the Shinkansen or something.`
`......Atami?`
`Wasn't that a place famous for its hot springs...?`
`At that moment,`
` ...with a razor-sharp sound, the warm atmosphere shattered.`
`Instead of the Rosa who had been there just a second ago, enjoying the gift with her daughter and recovering from her weariness with a long-awaited return home,`
` ......there stood a person who looked exactly the same, but who had a completely different, terrifying expression on her face.`
`...In her hand was the ticket stub that Maria had picked up.`
`...She had stolen it from Maria's hand in an instant.`
`Just a few seconds too late, `
`'!s0`
`and her mother's expression, `
`Maria realized that she must have done something wrong.`
`But she didn't know what she had done that had gotten her in trouble.`
`...It was probably because of that ticket stub-like thing.`
`Was she not supposed...to touch it......?`
`Even though she had tried so hard to welcome Mama with fun and happiness,`
` ...she had touched something important to Mama without asking, and had ruined that pleasant atmosphere...`
`...So Maria apologized immediately.`
`"...S-Sorry......"`
`"......!`
` ......"`
`Even though she must have heard those words of apology, Rosa's expression actually darkened.`
`...Maybe those weren't the words she had been hoping for.`
`Maria didn't know what to do...and stared at her mother's reaction...`
`Then, even though it should've been such an important ticket stub, `
`Rosa crushed it up and hurried off to her room...`
`Maria...didn't really understand what she had done wrong...`
`"......Uu-...`
` ...I must've...`
`...done something I shouldn't have...`
` ...That paper must've been something important for Mama's work.`
` And I touched it without asking..."`
`『Uryu...`
` ...You didn't do anything wrong, Maria......`
` ...That's why tonight was so very happy.〝`
`"Yeah.`
` ...Happy."`
`『And when Mama takes a bath and clears her head, she'll go back to being the normal, nice Mama.`
` So you mustn't worry about it.`
` Uryu.〝`
`"You're right...`
` Mama's tired too.`
` ...Uu-, mustn't worry about it.`
` After all, we were so happy tonight."`
`『Uryu.〝`
`"......Just stop it.`
` ...I can't watch this."`
`"You're the one who's wrong, Onee-chan!!`
` How can you call this happiness...?!!`
` It's so...pitiful that I can't watch anymore!!"`
`"What is...?`
` That Mama suddenly got mad?`
` ......That happens sometimes when humans get tired.`
` ...Condemning a person because of a momentary misplaced emotion isn't very adult of you, Ange."`
`"...I can't believe I'm hearing this from a nine year old...`
` But that's not the problem!`
` That ticket stub you picked up was clearly strange!"`
`"What was?`
` There was nothing strange about it, and it has nothing to do with the happiness of that night, right...?"`
`"Aunt Rosa called because she'd be staying over at her company because of work, right?!`
` Why Atami?!`
` Isn't that what you call a vacation?!`
` It means she left you and went on a vacation, right?!`
` And you normally don't go on a vacation by yourse-"`
`"Even if that was a ticket for Atami,`
` that alone doesn't make it proof that Mama lied and went on a vacation, right...?"`
`"She lied on the phone, and then she changed her expression so drastically and grabbed it from you!`
` What more proof could you want...?!!"`
`"......It might have been from a business trip long ago, right?`
` Or maybe she just happened to pick up some trash and put it in her pocket.`
` It might've been a receipt from someone who worked for her, who went on a business trip.`
` ...In that case, it would be important for her work.`
` It wasn't a toy, so I can understand why Mama took it away.`
` ...This evidence you're talking about is only circumstantial.`
` Imagination and delusions.`
` ......I don't know why you're interpreting it in a way that makes our relationship worse."`
`"I'm the one who doesn't understand why you're interpreting it in a way that's so convenient for Aunt Rosa!!"`
`"......As I thought, you're a pitiable child, Ange.`
` ......Even though there are so many Fragments lying about you that could make you happy,`
` you can't find them."`
`"...Instead, you only look at unhappy Fragments and continue to get hurt.`
` ...That's why you're scared of being hurt...`
`and only start looking for happiness after you check to make sure there's nothing around you that could hurt you."`
`".........When I talk with you, Onee-chan, it gets hard to tell which one of us isn't making sense."`
`"You know what?`
` There are lots of happy and unhappy Fragments, and they fill the world up.`
` So people who can't find happiness right beside them won't be able to find it no matter how hard they look.`
` ...Like Tyltyl and Mytyl searching for the blue bird."`
`"......Oh yeah.`
` That story with a moral."`
`"You're the complete opposite, Ange.`
` You're searching for a world without a Fragment of unhappiness.`
` But that's the same as the blue bird.`
` So you'll be unable to find your happiness for all eternity.`
` ......Is Battler Hansel?`
` Or is he the blue bird...?"`
`"...Give it a rest already.`
` ......In any event, I understand that a night of happiness was wasted because of a single scrap of paper."`
`"It sure is scary.`
` That a single scrap of paper could do that.`
` ...In that case, maybe the power to get your happiness back can also lie in a single scrap of paper, right?"`
`Just when she'd finally been able to communicate with Maria after so long...`
`Rosa's face twisted with a mixture of anger, sadness, and a fierce self-hatred as she flew into her room and closed the door.`
`......Maria's 'sorry' had sliced into her chest sharper than a knife.`
`At that time, `
`...she noticed a cute envelope placed on her study table.`
`It was probably something that had come with a girls' magazine.`
`......To Mama:`
` Let me share my happiness with you, ...it said.`
`She took it, ......and after hesitating, opened it...and read what was inside.`
`............`
`'!s0`
`drip down the paper, `
`...she flew out of the room, `
`hugged Maria from behind as she headed for the bathroom, `
`......buried her face into her daughter's back...`
`and cried.`
`'!s0`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`she apologized.`
`Why is Mama apologizing...?`
` There was no answer to that question...`
`"......Look.`
` We already made up.`
` ......Something like that was absolutely nothing to worry about, because of the friendship Mama and I share."`
`".........`
`......To me, your happiness is...too painful, Maria onee-chan."`
`"...I understand how you feel, more or less.`
` ...Before I realized I had that 'power',`
` ...even I was a pitiful child who could only find Fragments filled with misfortune, just like you are now."`
`"......What is that 'power'?`
` This power that I don't have, but you do...`
` ...Are you saying that I'm unfortunate and you're blessed because I don't have that?`
` ......Just what is this thing you can't describe except with an abstract word like 'power'...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` You do want to know that, Ange.`
` ...That's why you've been reading my story so far.`
` ......Of course, I'll teach you.`
` I'll show you the secret to that power.`
` ...And it's something I taught you about long ago, when you were little, right...?`
` Did you forget...?"`
`"It's okay, I remember.`
` ...Now I...`
`...no, she.`
` She will teach you."`
`"......She...?`
` Who's that?"`
`"I shall teach you in MARIA's place."`
`'!s1`
`Beatrice........."`
`"The 'power' MARIA has, but you do not."`
`"Yeah.`
` The 'power' I have, but Ange doesn't."`
`——It's...magic.`
`Maria and Beato said it together.`
`And then they started giggling because they'd said it at the same time.`
`...It was an innocent reaction, one that didn't seem like Beato at all.`
`Black tea was arranged on a table in a peaceful garden,`
` and Beato, Maria, and Sakutarou, who was sitting on Maria's lap, were having fun chatting...`
`"......Hoh.`
` I see, he is called Sakutarou.`
` So this is your best friend!"`
`『Uryu...`
` Nice to meet you, I'm Sakutarou...〝`
`"Uu-, Sakutaro's shy, so he's nervous.`
` It's okay, Beatrice is also a great friend of mine...!"`
`『Uryu.`
` Are Maria's friends...my friends...?〝`
`"Yeah!"`
`『Uryu. ...Then, am I Beatrice's friend too?〝`
`"Yeah!"`
`『Uryu-!〝`
`"...Maria, does something like this happen frequently for you in your everyday life?"`
`"Uu-?`
` What?"`
`"Is breathing a spirit of magic into inorganic matter and giving it life like this...`
`commonplace in your everyday life?"`
`"...Uu-.`
` Sakutaro isn't inorganic matter, he's a lion cub."`
`『Uryu-!〝`
`"Hmm...`
` ...A stuffed animal makes for an excellent vessel.`
` It is not uncommon for spirits to be made to reside in them...when they are spoken to by innocent children with no toxin."`
`According to Beatrice, every time a child plays with dolls,`
` the dolls actually gain a will and converse with them, sometimes even moving by their own will.`
`However, because of their innocence, the power imbued into such a vessel is very weak.`
`If they get struck with even a tiny bit of the toxin from a Human's common sense, which says that there's no way a doll can talk or move,`
` they instantly revert to being non-speaking dolls...`
`"However, ...this Sakutarou stuffed animal of yours is different."`
`"Uu-!`
` Sakutaro is a stuffed animal, but he isn't ooone!"`
`『Uryu-!`
` I'm a lion cub!`
` Ro-, ro-, ...uryu-!〝`
`"Sakutaro is a lion cub, but he's still a kid, so he can't roar sometimes.`
` Uryuuryuuryu♪"`
`『Uryuuryuuryu-!〝`
`Gazing at Maria, who was playing around with Sakutaro by the table loaded with tea, Beatrice let out a sigh of admiration.`
`"......How incredible.`
` This Sakutarou, with a cloth and cotton vessel as a shell, has completely materialized into the human world.`
` He has his own personality, talks with the summoner freely, `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~and even moves by his own will~ib~`
`."`
`"...And even more surprising...is that Maria did not summon him using the name of a person from another world, `
`but created him out of the sea of zero."`
`After that, Maria boasted to Beato that Sakutarou wasn't her only friend, and that she had many more of them back at home.`
`It seemed there were other similar stuffed animals and dolls who could talk and move of their own will like Sakutarou.`
`It was something natural for Maria.`
`It was natural for stuffed animals to talk, move, and become her friends of their own will.`
`...When she saw that Maria accepted this as something natural, as a witch, Beatrice felt a respect bordering on awe.`
`"......Maria,`
` without a doubt, that power of yours is magic."`
`"It's magic...?`
` I'm still a witch apprentice, so I can't use magic yet, right...?"`
`"No, it is magic.`
` ......Because you cannot use it consciously, you are still an apprentice, `
`...but even so, what magical power it is!`
` The materialization of your friend, Sakutarou, is excellent proof of that."`
`"Materialization...?"`
`"Indeed.`
` In your case, it may even be fitting to call it creation.`
` ...A piece of inorganic matter that would have no soul at all in another's hands can have a soul sent into it through your magic."`
`"Furthermore, that strong magical power lies in the human world.`
` ...In this era so filled with the toxin that denies magic, summoning a magical power that can materialize a single life-form is not easy even for me."`
`It isn't hard to give birth to any number of soulless beings.`
`However, giving birth to a being with a soul is very difficult.`
` ...This is what Beato asserted.`
`"......I don't really understand what you're saying, Beato.`
` You're saying Sakutaro is amazing...?"`
`"Both you and Sakutarou are incredible.`
` ...You should be proud.`
` ...I see, that which Kinzo desired above all else seems to dwell most strongly within you."`
`"I don't have a clue why Beato is praising Maria so much.`
` Right, Sakutaro?"`
`『Uryu-!〝`
`"...What should be truly admired is not only that a soul has been made to reside in a stuffed animal.`
` Even more significant is the fact that you have changed your own worldview.`
` ...When it comes to giving birth to something from nothing, you stand out from the crowd."`
`"...It is easy to make 100 from 1.`
` However, giving birth to 1 from 0 is not.`
` ...When you do become a full witch, beyond just becoming a match for me, you might grow into a Great Witch that even I must acknowledge as superior."`
`"A Witch of Origins, perhaps.`
` ......I'm really looking forward to your future."`
`"Uu-!`
` Beato said I have talent as a witch!"`
`『Isn't that great, Maria?!`
` Uryu, Beato, ...thank you for praising Maria.〝`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` No need to thank me, Sakutarou.`
` That red muffler truly suits you.`
` And I am envious of the talent of your master, who was able to give birth to a friend like you."`
`『Uryu-!`
` Thanks for complimenting my muffler.`
` This is a present I got from Maria.`
` It's my favorite.〝`
`"And its size is truly like a muffler that was created just for you.`
` ...I see, I must also give my new friend some kind of present."`
`"Uu-?`
` Beato is giving Sakutaro a present...?"`
`"Of course, a gift from a witch must be something with magical power.`
` In that case, so that he can be your friend for all time, and so that you can have even more fun playing with him, `
`I shall give Sakutarou my magic power.`
` With that, he should be able to materialize even more strongly."`
`"Uu-?`
` I'll be able to have much more fun playing with Sakutaro...?`
` How's that?"`
`『Uryu...?`
` What could it be, Maria...?`
` Is it something scary...?〝`
`"Don't worry.`
` Beato won't do anything scary.`
` Right, Beatrice?!"`
`"Indeed.`
` I believe you will like it.`
` ......So, to make him materialize even more strongly, a stronger image will be necessary.`
` ......Well, well, what to do.`
` Hmmmmmmmmmm..."`
`Beato crossed her arms and thought about what she could do to please them even more.`
`Then, right there, `
`......was the form of yet another witch.`
`It was Beato's teacher, Virgilia.`
`Virgilia truly was a Great Witch.`
`...Since Maria already thought of Beato as a Great Witch, this person Beato called a Great Witch must've been a Great Great Witch.`
`According to Beato, she still didn't even rise up to this witch's feet when it came to magical power.`
`"My, my.`
` I thought I heard some cheery voices.`
` What a fun tea party this seems to be..."`
`"Oh, Teacher.`
` Perfect timing.`
` I want you to look at this lion cub.`
` I hear he's Maria's new friend."`
`"Ho ho ho.`
` What a lovely lion-san.`
` ...I wonder if he can greet me?`
` Hello, nice to meet you...?"`
`『U-Uryu-!`
` I-I'm Sakutarou.〝`
`Sakutaro fell to Maria's lap, greeting Virgilia with half of his face poking out over the edge of the table.`
`...It seemed he was very nervous, since this was a witch that even Beato called Teacher.`
`"Ho ho ho.`
` What an adorable name.`
` ...As a reward for giving such a good greeting, here's a sweet for you."`
`After waving her hands about, Virgilia held the palm of her hand upwards, as though she was lightly grabbing at the empty air.`
`Then, she held her fist out in front of Sakutaro.`
`......When she opened her fist, there was one of those individually wrapped cough drops.`
`『Uryu-?!`
` Maria, it's candy, awesome, awesome...!!〝`
`"Uu-!`
` Isn't that great, Sakutaro!`
` Make sure to thank her."`
`『Uryu.`
` Thank you very much for the candy.`
` ...*gulp*.〝`
`Even though Virgilia was a Great Great Witch, she still treated a stuffed animal like Sakutarou to an elegant greeting.`
`"Still, Teacher. Cough drops? Are you someone's granny or something...?!`
` Can't you at least pull out some strawberry-milk candy?"`
`"How rude.`
` In that case, I won't be giving you any more."`
`"Kuhhyahhyahhya, sorry, sorry.`
` ......Well then, Maria.`
` Take out your grimoire.`
` And, of course, your writing tools."`
`"Uu-?`
` Yeah, I'll take it out.`
` What should I write?"`
`"...Oh, what are you starting?"`
`"I will use a magic I learned from you, Teacher.`
` ...Magic to make a resident of another world materialize into a vessel.`
` I think that by applying that, we may be able to further strengthen the power that makes this friend of Maria's materialize.`
` ...I wanted to give that as a gift to Maria and her friend."`
`"I see.`
` ...For a being that has already materialized, it shouldn't be that difficult.`
` That could become a wonderful gift.`
` Well then, I shall help too, if only a little."`
`"It would be very reassuring if you would sign for this magic as a witness, Teacher...!`
` Be glad, Maria.`
` This will be a wonderful gift...!"`
`『Uryu...?`
` What's happening...?`
` It isn't scary, is it?`
` Is it...?〝`
`"Don't know.`
` But I don't think it's scary.`
` ...What could it be? I can't wait."`
`Beato borrowed the grimoire from Maria's handbag and majestically flipped through the pages.`
` ...Then, she found an empty page among those with magic circles drawn on them...and flattened it out.`
`After gazing at Sakutarou with a grin, she suddenly started moving her pen.`
`...It was something like a written declaration made by witches to a high-order world.`
`It was magic whose effect could be controlled if Beatrice wrote and Virgilia signed.`
`Maria didn't understand what Beato was writing at first, but partway through, she figured out the wonderful magical power of this document, and her eyes began to sparkle...`
`『Uryu?!`
` Uryu?!`
` What is it, Maria, what's she drawing?!`
` Uryuuryu?!〝`
`Sakutarou was on her lap, so he didn't know what was being written on the table.`
`...But even if he had seen, Sakutarou probably wouldn't have understood.`
`"Awesome, Sakutaro!!`
` Wait a bit, almost done, almost done!`
` It's amazing, Beato, amazing!!"`
`"......When it comes to writing documents of power, this child's talent is magnificent.`
` You might even serve well as a Secretary in the spirit world."`
`"How's this...?!`
` Not so bad, right...?!"`
`After finishing her writing with an intense amount of concentration, Beato looked over the document again from a distance.`
`...It seemed she was fairly satisfied with her work.`
`And Maria, who was also peeking in at it, let out a cry of wonder.`
`"...Awesome, Beato!!`
` Cuuute!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"By the name of the Golden Witch, Beatrice, I now acknowledge Sakutarou, MARIA's child.`
` ......Teacher, if you would sign as a witness!"`
`"Yes, yes.`
` ...By my name, I witness and acknowledge this oath.`
` ......It is done."`
`Virgilia signed, completing the written declaration.`
`It was a document with the power to proclaim to the beings of a higher world that Sakutarou had most certainly materialized in the human world.`
`Sakutarou, who had been born from Maria, was nominated by the two witches, Beatrice and Virgilia,`
` and just now, his existence had been acknowledged by the higher world.`
`...That itself was the great magic of materialization.`
`According to Beato, it was apparently quite fortunate that Virgilia was there.`
`After all, depending on the number and quality of witches that signed proclamations to the higher world, the power that resided in them could change drastically.`
`Virgilia in particular had many friends in that higher plane,`
` so her signature gave the proclamation a power with which Beato's couldn't even compare.`
`"By this proclamation, I accept you, Sakutarou, as an individual with his own ego.`
` And I welcome you as a friend in accordance with the contract of Mariage Sorcière.`
` From now on, Sakutarou is our common friend."`
`"And for that, I shall bestow upon you a fitting form as a gift.`
` Accept it."`
`With the grimoire still opened to the page with the proclamation, she turned it around and handed it to Maria.`
`Maria showed it to Sakutarou on her lap.`
`When Sakutarou beheld that proclamation,`
` ......he felt something hot and bright begin to dwell...`
`in his body made of cloth and cotton.`
`Even as he looked around, nervous at this sensation he'd never felt before, that power strengthened, `
`...and eventually, a bright light completely swallowed him up...`
`『Uryu...?`
` Uryuuryuuryuuryu...!〝`
`Then, when that light disappeared...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`......There, Maria's friend Sakutarou held a new form and ~ib~existed~ib~.`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!`
` You're cute, Sakutaro!`
` Reeeally cute!"`
`『Uryu...?`
` Uryu-...`
` Does it really look good on me?`
` It isn't embarrassing...?〝`
`"Ho ho ho ho.`
` It is a very lovely form, Sakutarou-chan."`
`"I figured the muffler was his charm point.`
` And the ears!`
` Animal ears sure are nice, truly cute!`
` Let me nibble 'em later.`
` *cackle*!"`
`"Thank you, Beatrice!!`
` Thank you very much for the wonderful present!!"`
`"There is no need for thanks.`
` This is out of respect for your wonderful magic and your friend.`
` ......And, now that you have reached this level, it would not be odd for you to graduate from being an apprentice at any time.`
` From now on, I shall instruct you on even more new and fun magic.`
` ...From this point forward, you may call yourself MARIA, an Apprentice Witch of Origins."`
`"A Witch of Origins...?"`
`"Indeed.`
` It is the title of a witch who seeks to become a Creator.`
` Right now, you are just an Enchanter (a magician specializing in forms of magical enhancement) who has only enough strength to breathe magical power into the small objects around her.`
` ...But after one thousand years of training, you could conceivably use the magical compendium that resides inside your heart to create a galaxy."`
`"...The talent of a Witch of Origins is very rare.`
` Even though everyone has it when they are young, no one can continue to hold onto it.`
` ...This title is also proof that you have not lost your untainted heart."`
`"Uu-!!`
` A Witch of Origins, awesome!`
` I'll become one!`
` I'm Maria, an Apprentice Witch of Origins!"`
`"Maria, that's so incredible...!`
` A Witch of Origins, incredible, amazing, uryu-!"`
`"Eventually, you will be able to call yourself a full witch: Lady MARIA, Witch of Origins.`
` ...It may be a good time now to give not only Sakutarou, but you as well, an appearance fitting for your rank.`
` ...Here.`
` I shall give a proper outfit for one who, while still an apprentice, is worthy of using the title of a witch."`
`When Beato waved the pipe that was her cane, `
`many gold butterflies that had appeared out of nowhere grouped around Maria, giving her a wonderful dress.`
`It certainly was fitting for the girl who would eventually take the name of the Witch of Origins, combining both cuteness and dignity...`
`"Amazing...!!`
` Awesome awesome awesome awesome!!`
` Cute, cute!`
` I wanna show these clothes to Mama too...!!`
` Can I?"`
`"The full dress of a witch must not be shown indiscriminately.`
` It's value increases if you're stingy with it.`
` *cackle*!"`
`Then, the Great Witch, the witch, the witch's apprentice, and their new friend, Sakutarou, enjoyed a lively tea party...`
`"......See?`
` Look how happy I am.`
` And look how fun this is."`
`"............"`
`"Please, don't be afraid of being happy.`
` Becoming happy isn't the same thing as accepting your current misfortune.`
` It means creating a new happiness out of your current misfortune.`
` That is the Magic of Origins."`
`"...I...didn't want to acknowledge my current world.`
` ...I couldn't bear to accept such an isolated and painful world.`
` ...That's why, even though I was entranced by your world, Maria onee-chan, `
`...I couldn't cross the final line."`
`"......I'll teach you.`
` About my Magic of Origins.`
` No, I taught you before, right?`
` And you used it before.`
` Did you forget...?"`
`"............"`
`"You were also a witch apprentice, Ange, with your name entered into Mariage Sorcière, weren't you?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` That was true.`
` ......Mariage Sorcière...`
` ...That takes me back.`
` ...I also had my name entered in there at one point, didn't I...?"`
`"Yes, I will never forget that.`
` It happened in April of 1987.`
` I received a certain strange request from a friend.`
` ...There was a large collection of books, the former possessions of a very rich man, that were being sold at auction,`
` and it was thought that some of them might've been extremely valuable to the study of archeology and folklore, as well as in an occult sense, `
`so this friend wanted to witness their worth confidentially."`
`"......That was '87.`
` Half a year after the crime on Rokkenjima."`
`"Correct.`
` It was explained that those books had escaped the disaster at Rokkenjima.`
` The owner of the island, Ms. Ushiromiya Eva, had put them up for auction."`
`This was apparently a high-class restaurant.`
`A middle-aged man was sitting across from Ange in a secluded and quiet seat.`
`Amakusa could be seen by the entrance.`
`He was probably keeping a lookout for pursuers from the Sumadera family.`
`The scholarly man across from Ange spoke politely, but with enthusiasm.`
`He didn't lay a finger on the food in front of him, so you could tell how excited he was as he spoke fervently.`
`He was a professor at a certain college, and particularly well-known as an authority on Western folklore.`
`However, among his life works, that was only a convenient exterior.`
`His true life work was...`
`the study of occultism, Western magic, alchemy, and everything else to do with the occult,`
` as well as demonology.`
`In short, he was the person in the best position to understand the details of Kinzo's research...`
`"First, what I learned by appraising those books was that Ms. Ushiromiya Eva had absolutely no education in the study of folklore...`
`and that the original owner of the books, Ushiromiya Kinzo, was certainly one of the top five authorities on demonology in Japan."`
`April, 1987.`
`A major city antique shop obtained a large quantity of ancient documents that were thought to have a high historical value.`
`They were entrusted with them by Ushiromiya Eva, who wanted them to be sold at auction.`
`At the time, it was thought that Eva would succeed the Ushiromiya family and have all the wealth to herself, as the only survivor.`
`However, at that point, not even half a year had passed since the accident, and the others had not been missing long enough to be presumed dead, even under extraordinary circumstances.`
`Because of that, Eva had supposedly been in a very tight spot financially, unable even to collect on her family's life insurance.`
`It seems she tried to sell everything of value, `
`and even the books kept in the place where she'd escaped harm in, Kuwadorian, were used for this purpose.`
`These old books, which would eventually be called 'the Ushiromiya Library', were later gathered from antique shops by authorities in the field so that they could be appraised, ...and those authorities were astounded.`
`"At least speaking from the perspective of occultism, `
`the impact of that discovery on the world was comparable to the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls."`
`"This is because...contained within 'the Ushiromiya Library' were many extremely vital documents that had never been found, `
`though their existence had been known of for more than a millenium."`
`The many dreams of the occult, such as those represented by alchemy, always stirred an intense fascination in dilettantes.`
`It is whispered that many 'magic books' of great historical value, currently unknown to the public, `
`might be in the secret possession of extremely wealthy lovers of the occult.`
`Items such as Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks, which are particularly popular among dilettantes, are said to be prime examples of this.`
`It is said that approximately 5,000 pages of these notebooks currently exist, and that over 10,000 have been lost,`
` but some researchers believe that a large part of this lost portion may be monopolized by certain enthusiasts and members of the extremely rich.`
`It is said that because of this, even now, `
`dilettantes who can't help but seek these spare no expense to search around for quietly hoarded away and unannounced notebooks...`
`There is probably no doubting that Ushiromiya Kinzo was himself one of those dilettantes.`
`No one knows what Kinzo went through to obtain those,`
` but there can be no mistake that he used his vast wealth freely, buying them off of other rich people with the same hobby as him.`
`Those books, which were so valuable that enthusiasts could never satisfy their desire to hoard them away, were discovered in large numbers at the end of the 20th century,`
` and their release to the public had given the entire world a massive shock...`
`"Because of this case, the name <Rokkenjima> became known across the world.`
` The world was also shocked to learn that, in all likelihood, a large number of even more valuable undiscovered books were lost during the accident on Rokkenjima."`
`"...Because of this, the names of Rokkenjima and the Ushiromiya Library will remain in our memories for all time."`
`...Our memories.`
`That 'our' probably meant the occult neck of the woods with the same hobby as Kinzo.`
`Because of that incident, the name of Rokkenjima had taken on a vital meaning in the world of the occult.`
`There certainly had been a lot of reporting about the accident on Rokkenjima itself, but not on an international level.`
`However, this one part had spread across the world, `
`taking the image of Rokkenjima as a small island in the Izu archipelago...and painting it over as a demonic island where riddles, suspicion, mystery and the occult met.`
`In other words, until Kinzo's library was leaked to the public by Eva,`
` Rokkenjima had been merely a nameless island that no one could remember,`
` ...and certainly not the island of a witch.`
`However, when knowledge of the Ushiromiya Library spread all over the planet, Rokkenjima's image immediately took on an occult twist.`
`"What happened next was the discovery of that message bottle.`
` That's what turned that island into a witch's island.`
` A nameless island in the Izu archipelago began to transition into an island of the occult, the island of the mysterious witch, Beatrice."`
`"You might say that, lacking either the Ushiromiya Library or the message bottle, the Rokkenjima Witch Legend would never have been established."`
`"...The message bottle."`
`"Yes.`
` A form of communication to an unspecified target by throwing an empty bottle with a letter sealed inside it into the sea."`
`"It was once famous as a way of sending an SOS from a deserted island, but because of the influence of a certain prominent foreign detective novel,`
` it has also become known as a method of confessing the truth after one's own death, like a time-delayed will.`
` The case of the Rokkenjima message bottle was certainly one of the latter."`
`"...This is the thing everyone says a fisherman on a nearby island picked up?"`
`"Correct.`
` We learned that a young fisherman on Shikinejima picked up a wine bottle with a letter in it.`
` This young fisherman kept it just out of curiosity.`
` Then, because Rokkenjima had fallen under the world's attention due to the Ushiromiya Library, he announced his discovery."`
`"Is there any chance that it was a fabrication made by the fisherman?"`
`"Of course, we weren't able to deny that possibility.`
` The scraps of paper in the wine bottle were signed by a certain member of the Ushiromiya family.`
` A girl named Ushiromiya Maria.`
` However, after looking at the writing left on her former belongings, it was confirmed that this message was written in a different person's handwriting."`
`"......A different person's handwriting...?"`
`"Correct.`
` At the very least, I believe there can be no doubt that it was written by a person more skilled at writing and of a greater age than her.`
` There's a very high likelihood that someone faked her name when they wrote it.`
` Therefore, at that point in time, the contents of those scraps of paper were thought to have a very low credibility."`
`However.`
`Later on, it was confirmed that a similar message bottle had been recovered from the nearby ocean on the day of the accident by the police in their search for lost articles, and this caused a sensation.`
`"It seems that, due to evidence from the surrounding area and the fact that the bottle had been sealed, `
`the police had decided that its likelihood of being a fabrication was low and that it had been abandoned no earlier than a few days before the accident.`
` And the handwriting for both matched.`
` This caused the credibility of the scraps of paper discovered by the fisherman to rise."`
`"It seems magazines and the like have reported on the contents of that message bottle repeatedly, but would you like an explanation?"`
`"...No.`
` I know about it, more or less."`
`Many scraps of paper had been stuffed into both of the wine bottles.`
`It was an extensive notebook written by someone calling themselves Ushiromiya Maria, but who wasn't Maria, and which told of the events starting the day before the accident and up until the day of the accident in a diary-like way.`
`And its contents had been the beginning of 'The Witch's Legend Serial Murder Incident',`
` as well as 'The Golden Witch Beatrice's Puzzle'.`
`"This bizarre, diary-style notebook described how the Ushiromiya family members, nailed down on the island by the typhoon,`
` were caught up in a ceremony for the resurrection of a witch...and killed one by one in inexplicable ways."`
`"And, in the end, the Golden Witch Beatrice revived, and everything was flung into the Golden Land.`
` ...It was written almost as though it was a complete account of the events on those days."`
`"Also, it depicted the current situation on the island at the time in great detail,`
` and the former servants who used to work for the Ushiromiya family gave testimony that it had definitely been written by a human who knew the inside details of the island."`
`"...So, because of a combination of the occult boom from that strange fantasy novel and the Ushiromiya Library,`
` and well as the fact that the truth remained shrouded in darkness, the legend of the Rokkenjima witch was born...?"`
`"Correct.`
` More than 10 years have already passed since that case, and it is still the focus of interest for occult enthusiasts across the world."`
`"No, to the contrary, you could say that it has become increasingly deified as time passes.`
` There are still many enthusiasts who try to secretly land on Rokkenjima, even though it's prohibited.`
` ...Could there be another message bottle that has still not been discovered?`
` And on that day, what really happened on that island?`
` There is still much to be discussed."`
`As though he had finally remembered that he'd been going on and on for some time, the man took a gulp of water.`
`...His potage was getting cold, but it seemed that the man's hunger had already been blown away.`
`"...I'm pretty sure I heard that the fisherman's scraps of paper and the police's scraps of paper had completely different contents."`
`"Correct.`
` Due to that, interest in the Rokkenjima mystery increased even further.`
` Inside both bottles were diary-style notebooks on which was written an account from the day before the accident until the day of the accident.`
` However, while both of their contents described the same two-day period, they were completely different."`
`"It was as though one was the truth and one was a lie.`
` Or perhaps both were lies.`
` In any event, the beginnings and endings alone matched each other.`
` In the beginning, the 18 people including the relatives are sealed up on the island by the typhoon.`
` And in the ending, everyone dies, the Golden Witch is revived, and everything is flung into the Golden Land."`
`The contents of both message bottles wrote about the events of the day before the accident and the day of the accident.`
`But the details were completely different.`
`Both diaries outline a serial murder following the epitaph of the witch, but the order of the sacrifices, the ways they died, and even 'the tale of the two days' were different.`
`However, in both, everyone died in the end and the witch revived, making for the same general plot.`
`"Because the only survivor, Ms. Ushiromiya Eva, has remained silent about what actually happened on that island,`
` the events of that entire two-day period are shrouded in darkness."`
`"These two diaries presented a full two theories to wipe away that darkness.`
` Those two days could be explained with either of those two diaries.`
` However, we don't know which is correct, or even if there's anything correct contained within them."`
`——Schrodinger's...cat box.`
`If it isn't denied, even a mixture of truth and fiction can be the truth.`
`Through the media, these scraps of paper had of course been shown to Eva as well, but in the end, she never broke her silence...`
`"Who sent the message bottles...and why?"`
`"Earlier, in their special issue for the crime's 10th anniversary, a certain magazine took that topic up for discussion in a grand manner, didn't they?`
` That theory seems to be the one garnering the most support lately.`
` But it is rather dull.`
` ...What happened on that island, on that day?`
` Considering this question is the true charm of the Witch Hunt."`
`"The Witch Hunt...?"`
`"Yes, the Rokkenjima Witch Hunt is the name of a group of enthusiasts who try to explain the truth of that crime from an occult perspective.`
` Discussion of the mysteries that surround Rokkenjima, from the Ushiromiya Library to the mysterious two-day period to the Legend of the Golden Witch, is flourishing even today among enthusiasts."`
`"For the 10 year anniversary, an international convention was held in New York.`
` I also participated as a representative of Japan!`
` I was able to intermingle with zealous overseas Witch Hunters in many ways.`
` Witches are a very popular category overseas.`
` The age span of the participants stretched from elementary schoolers at the bottom, all the way to famous cultural figures at the top!`
` Even in Japan, in recent years, there was finally-"`
`...You probably don't need any more explanation, but he's one of the most famous Rokkenjima Witch Hunters in Japan.`
`Even though I didn't ask anything more, he kept continuing on excitedly all by himself.`
`As I swirled the thin film on my potage with my spoon, I shrugged my shoulders and sighed.`
`...Looks like researching about the message bottle really was a waste of time.`
`No, if there's one thing I've found, `
`it's that the notebook supposedly written by Maria onee-chan was actually written by a different person faking her name.`
`And, that person wrote up an occult legend on their own, put it into the bottle as though it was the truth, and threw it into the sea.`
`...I have a question.`
`Why would they go to all the trouble of writing so much in order to prepare a suspicious letter like that?`
`With a message bottle, there'd be no guarantee that it'd ever pass into anyone's hands.`
`If their luck had been bad, it could've sunk in the ocean, never to be seen by anyone.`
`And even if someone had picked it up, they might've not cared about it and thrown it away.`
`...Why would they entrust their confession of the truth to the sea with such an uncertain method?`
`And why would they write up multiple, differing tales?`
`If there'd been one message bottle, claiming that its story was the truth might be reckless, but not impossible.`
`However, because there were two, that made both of them doubtful.`
`If someone was plotting to make out those two days to be the work of a witch, then they really did go one step too far.`
`And because there were two, it suggests that an undiscovered third one, or possibly even more might exist.`
`...In other words, the two differing contents makes both of them harder and harder to swallow.`
`But despite that, the contents of both matched in that they told of a witch in a tale.`
`So, is that the main point the writer wanted to get across to us......?`
`...It seems to me that the only possible explanation...is that someone who wanted to give rise to an illusion of a witch carried out this crime for their own enjoyment.`
`However, the 17 people other than Aunt Eva lost their lives, and a vast wealth or maybe even 10 tons of gold had moved around secretly in the darkness.`
`It doesn't feel right...for a confession occurring after all that to bring up this illusion of the witch.`
`Even if we ignore the magazines' theories, it's very doubtful that the message bottle really was a diary.`
`...After all, the amount of writing was massive.`
`It's hard to imagine that someone actually caught up in the middle of a serial murder like that would be able to calmly write it down.`
`In that case, it's probably more realistic that this diary was written slowly over a long period of time, up until the day prior to the accident.`
`In that case, ......would it mean that everything on Rokkenjima was a 'planned crime', with everything prepared for over a long stretch of time...?`
`...The fact that Aunt Eva left this world without saying anything is...infuriating.`
`She definitely said it on her death bed.`
`She definitely said that her reason for not telling me the truth was because it was her best way of harassing me.`
`...Yeah, by now, it's painfully obvious.`
`Of all the things Aunt Eva did to harass me, this was probably the last and the greatest.`
`......But thinking of it this way, it's pretty doubtful that Aunt Eva is the true culprit.`
`Of course, that's not because the handwriting on the message bottle was different from Aunt Eva's, or anything like that.`
`...It's because in both tales that were discovered, Aunt Eva was included among the victims.`
`If the writer of that diary was the culprit...`
`...Maybe Aunt Eva was also one of the targets to be killed.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`Maybe Aunt Eva survived because ~ib~something went wrong~ib~`
`.`
`......Because I hated Aunt Eva, I came to believe that she had to be the culprit.`
`But the existence of the message bottle...`
`...makes me suspect that the mastermind is a far more profound and unknown person than her...`
`I looked at the clock.`
`I've heard more than enough.`
` It's time.`
`As he continued to speak fervently, I suggested that I wanted to bring this discussion to a close.`
`He seemed to be aware that he'd gotten excited and talked too much, so he quickly accepted this.`
`"Thank you very much for today.`
` I believe I've heard something truly valuable."`
`"...No, no.`
` It was truly fun to be able to welcome a young lady as a new friend of the Witch Hunt.`
` I have many precious materials that I couldn't show you because of this change to a different venue from the usual.`
` I would be glad to show you them at the next chance we get."`
`"Thank you, Professor.`
` ......Could I ask one more thing?"`
`"Yes, what is it?"`
`"Professor, why are you interested in witches...no, in occultism and demonology?"`
`"Well, that is somewhat embarrassing.`
` ...A daydream I had in my childhood, that if I could use a mysterious power, I could take on even the biggest of bullies,`
` went on to become my life's work.`
` After all, the primitive desire of admiring unknown power is as universal today as it ever was in the past."`
`"Professor, if you could do it, would you want to become a witch?`
` Do you still dream of being able to use magic at will?"`
`"But of course.`
` Even though, at this age, I understand logically that such a thing couldn't exist, `
`I cannot forget my child-like dreams, such as flying in the sky and turning scrap iron into gold.`
` ...Hahaha, if you would, please keep this a secret from my students."`
`"......If I told you that I was a real witch,`
` would you believe it?"`
`"Hahhahhahha.`
` My pet theory from my few experiences with women is that they are all witches."`
`Ange snorted at the old professor, who must've been an earnest scholar with barely any experience with women.`
`"Yeah, yeah.`
` And one final question.`
` ...Professor, have you seen the original message bottle itself?"`
`"I have indeed."`
`"In that case, do you know that handwriting well?"`
`"Of course.`
` I am not a specialist in that area, but at least when it comes to the handwriting of the message bottle, I am proud to be the most knowledgeable in Japan."`
`At that point, Ange set a book on the desk with a thud.`
`"......And this is?`
` I have never seen it before."`
`He prided himself on his thorough knowledge of all literature related to Rokkenjima, and he looked bewildered at this binding that he hadn't seen before...`
`Ignoring him, Ange silently flipped through the pages, opened to one of them, and showed him.`
`On that page was a handwritten paragraph beginning with 'To my beloved witch apprentice'.`
`...And at the end, there was a signature in katakana that said...Beatrice.`
`"Th-This is......?"`
`The instant he glanced at it,`
` his face went pale.`
`...She knew the answer before asking, but Ange asked it aloud anyway.`
`"Does the handwriting in the paragraph on this page match the handwriting in the message bottle...?"`
`"W-Well, umm...I-I must take this home and investigate more...`
` ...P-Pardon me for asking, but what in the world is this book?!`
` Where did you get it?!"`
`The man stretched out his hand, but Ange pulled it back.`
`...As though telling him not to touch it with his filthy hands.`
`"Thank you.`
` Just that reaction is all I need.`
` Thank you very much for today.`
` ...Here's the reward I promised."`
`As she stood up, clutching Maria's diary,`
` Ange carelessly tossed a wad of 10 thousand yen notes wrapped with a strip of paper onto the table.`
`As Ange turned her back to him and made to leave, the man raised his voice as though clinging to her.`
`But Ange didn't stop walking.`
`"I-I beg you...!!`
` What in the world is that book?!`
` I don't need a reward, show me that book...!!"`
`"...Both you and I are in the Witch Hunt, but it looks like we aren't pursuing it at the same level.`
` You're entertaining yourself with the outside of the cat box.`
` And what I want to know about is the inside of the cat box.`
` ...And this book is the key to opening it.`
` It's too good for you.`
` Well then.`
` <Goodbye, gentlemen>. <Have a nice day>."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"P-Please wait,`
` ~ib~Sumadera-san~ib~...!!!"`
`His voice didn't reach her.`
` She had already joined up with Amakusa and gone into the car...`
`"Did you find anything?"`
`"...Only at the very end.`
` I was right.`
` The one who wrote the message bottles was Beatrice herself."`
`"<Cool>.`
` So, you've concluded that the witch actually exists?"`
`"Who knows.`
` ......Mind if I sleep?`
` I'll bet that talkative professor gets lost in his own little world in lectures and makes a lot of kids fall asleep."`
`"Please, go ahead, take a rest."`
`"......Still, that went really well.`
` That guy believed I was a Sumadera until the very end."`
`The Sumadera family had set up a web beforehand around any people Ange might try to contact.`
`They had offered a reward to anyone who could take Ushiromiya Ange into custody if she appeared.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`Ange had foreseen that and had ~ib~snatched it away~ib~`
`.`
`She had called herself Sumadera, and after cleverly tricking the man by saying her own subordinates would set up an ambush, so he didn't need to worry about it, she had taken him outside.`
`So, when the Sumadera family pursuers reached the professor's house, there was no longer anyone there...`
`"According to the family, a young man and woman calling themselves Sumadera visited this morning, `
`took the professor out with them and still have not returned.`
` ...There's a chance we were outmaneuvered."`
`".........What a bad child, Ange-chan.`
` ...I wonder if that craftiness is from Nee-san's blood.`
` ...To think she'd casually take on the name Sumadera after saying she'd hate to go by it so often..."`
`"......Hohohohohoh.`
` ...The professor should be returning soon.`
` When he does, we must serve him some tea..."`
`"...Y-Yes.`
` Understood."`
`"......I wonder if she thinks she's leading me around by the nose.`
` What a naughty child.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*, ...hohhohhohohohohohoho!!"`
`With a demonic look on her face, Kasumi violently stamped her heel.`
`I'll teach you.`
`About my Magic of Origins.`
`No, I taught you before, right?`
`And you used it before.`
`Did you forget...?`
`You were also a witch apprentice, Ange, with your name entered into Mariage Sorcière, weren't you...?`
`"......I was also...included among the witches, wasn't I...?"`
`I closed Maria's diary and flopped down on a very high-class-looking bed.`
`I'd slept deeply for a long time in the car, so it took longer than usual for drowsiness to set in, and I read the diary as I waited.`
`This was a super expensive hotel in the city.`
`...Since it was often used by the rich and the famous, they were very big on confidentiality.`
`That made it very convenient for Ange to escape her pursuers.`
`The idea that renegades should spend their nights hiding in cheap hotels is a commoner's way of thinking.`
`...To Ange, who possessed all the wealth of the Ushiromiya family, renegade life was comfortable indeed.`
`Of course, even though he was a guard, Amakusa was a man and therefore in a separate room.`
`Ange used the bedroom of the suite, and Amakusa lay on the sofa in the living room.`
`...According to Amakusa, the sofas here were more pleasant than his own beds had been recently.`
`Poor guy.`
`When I looked at the clock, `
`...I saw that it was almost 2:00 in the middle of the night.`
`I'm still not getting sleepy.`
`......I sighed deeply.`
`At that time, even though there was no wind, I had the feeling that Maria onee-chan's diary fluttered.`
`...Then, Onee-chan appeared.`
`Her form was no longer the normal one I'd known.`
`...She was wearing the dress that Beatrice had given her after acknowledging her as a witch.`
`"......If you don't get some sleep, it'll be tough tomorrow, right?"`
`"If I were a witch too, `
`...I'd be able to use magic, wouldn't I?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` You can use it.`
` I taught you, didn't I?`
` Taught you how to use it.`
` ...And you were able to use it in the past, weren't you?"`
`"......I remember.`
` ...I've started wanting to use it."`
`"Are you starting to feel lonely...?"`
`".........Not really.`
` ...It's not like having a different pillow every night is that tough."`
`"......The first step to magic can be loneliness or boredom, `
`...even small reasons like that."`
`"Even if it's just trying to kill time until you can fall asleep?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I'm glad you remembered about magic one more time."`
`............`
`...It's been quite a long time since I last used magic.`
`At one point, with Maria onee-chan's introduction, ...I touched a corner of it...and opened the door a tiny bit.`
`So, ...I should still remember that sensation.`
`"...Right now, your magical power has declined significantly, Ange.`
` ...If you don't devote yourself to the basics, it'll be hard, okay?"`
`"Sure.`
` ......Checking all directions.`
` Securing a quiet space."`
`"What about Amakusa-san?"`
`"......`
`......He's sleeping."`
`After opening the door to the living room a crack, I could see the blanket caterpillar on the sofa roll over in its sleep.`
`"...With your magical strength as weak as it is now, the anti-magic power is affecting you too much.`
` ...Not just the sight of people,`
` but voices, sounds, and even the presence of people will get in the way of your magic.`
` ...Sever those completely.`
` Like how ancient magicians shut themselves up in ateliers to preserve their isolation."`
`"I remember.`
` ...The very existence of Humans blocks magic.`
` ...Therefore, the very act of showing magic to people is the sign of a high-level witch..."`
`Obtain a quiet space for yourself alone.`
`...That should be enough to prepare a space to use magic.`
`"......Next is the vessel.`
` ...Right now, it's important for your bike to at least have training wheels...no, a chain."`
`".........`
`......This is...`
`...of course...`
`impossible..."`
`Ange rubbed her own head.`
`...She wore hair accessories there, with pink gems attached.`
`They felt a little childish for Ange, but she never took them off, not even for a single day.`
`"......Yeah.`
` ......It really will be impossible for you now, Ange.`
` ...If you'd practiced every single day since then,`
` you might've gained the ability to summon with that by now."`
`".........`
`If I were to start training now, how long would it take?"`
`"......It's said that a year of magical training for a child is worth ten years for an old person.`
` You need a lot of determination."`
`"You mean like Ushiromiya Kinzo?`
` ......So, just like the piano and the violin, getting a special education from a young age is huge when it comes to magic."`
`"As you are now, your power has weakened since the time you were first able to use magic, Ange.`
` ...Don't overdo it, ...and devote yourself to the basics."`
`After stubbornly rubbing those things on my head one more time, I gave up.`
`Then I started fishing through the knapsack.`
`...Looking for anything that might make a good vessel.`
`"......Shouldn't this be a perfect vessel?"`
`"It's been a long time.`
` ...Yes.`
` With this, I think even you should be able to perform a summons as you are now.`
` ...And they have no master now.`
` It should be possible for you to become their new master, Ange."`
`Among the things that looked like good vessels, I took the one I thought might possess the strongest magical power...`
`and set it on the side table near the bed with a clatter.`
`It was...a shady-looking, stake-shaped weapon with an occult design inscribed on it.`
`It was one of the 'Seven Stakes of Purgatory', which the witch used to offer sacrifices.`
`When the police had been searching the family's possessions, they had collected a large amount of junk.`
`After the investigation had finished, these had been politely returned to the Ushiromiya family.`
`...Finding something that I'd seen in the pictures of Maria's diary, I took it home with me.`
`"......Originally, there were Seven Stakes of Purgatory.`
` ...How pitiful.`
` Now, she's the only one left."`
`Onee-chan smiled, looking lonely...`
`I pulled another book out of the knapsack.`
`...This was also old-fashioned, and you could tell that it was an occult book just by looking.`
`But its contents were plain.`
`It was one of Maria onee-chan's elaborate notebooks.`
`This wasn't a diary.`
`...This was a grimoire, which she had written as a witch.`
`The Seven Stakes of Purgatory are Beatrice's furniture.`
`Created by her and employed only for her sake.`
`But since Beatrice is also a witch of Mariage Sorcière, they could be employed by MARIA, a witch of the same alliance.`
`For that reason, the method of summoning the Seven Stakes of Purgatory and how to handle them was written about in great detail in Maria onee-chan's grimoire...`
`And...`
`...As another person with their name registered in that alliance, I was also permitted to employ them.`
`"......Which...`
`...of the Seven Sisters is this stake?"`
`"Their characteristics are written about well in my grimoire.`
` ...The Sisters of the Seven Stakes really hate it when you get their names wrong.`
` Remember their names well before summoning them."`
`A packed page told of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory.`
`...It described the Seven Sisters in great detail.`
`...Yes.`
`I think I memorized almost this entire page once in the past.`
`The more I read it, the more I start to remember...`
`By the pictures and characteristics written on the grimoire, I could tell that the stake in my hand was 'Mammon's stake'.`
`In the past, I hadn't had any stakes, so I'd summoned them without any vessel.`
`...So, this was the first time I'd clearly seen any of the Seven Stakes, let alone Mammon.`
`"Mammon.`
` The fifth sister.`
` Controls the deadly sin of greed.`
` ...An incredible kid."`
`"Greed also controls aspirations, the desire to improve oneself, and the strength to live.`
` It definitely doesn't mean only bad things.`
` ...She's rude, but she's a girl who tries really hard."`
`"...I see.`
` You could say that without desire, there's no reason to live."`
`For a while, I heightened my concentration and digested the information that was written about Mammon.`
`...The more the summoner knows about the target that's being summoned, the better...`
`Knowledge is connected to magical power.`
`...I began to fill my head with knowledge about Mammon, raising a necessary amount of magical power for a summoning.`
`"...Grimoires can be a bit interesting.`
` This might be a much better read than some lame novel.`
` ...It really takes me back."`
`"For a grimoire, it is demanded not only that you understand the letters, but that you fill up the world of the space between the lines, `
`giving birth to a world from the pictures and creating things in various ways.`
` ...The power to give birth to something.`
` For someone who has that, such as you, a grimoire should be more interesting than any book.`
` ...I've always known that you'd be able to understand that."`
`"......That should be...enough knowledge of Mammon for now.`
` ......Yes.`
` I've remembered it, more or less.`
` ...I'll give it a try."`
`"Take care.`
` ...In case the worst happens, here is my talisman.`
` ...The treaty of the alliance won't protect you right now.`
` That Mammon is a bit of a quick trigger.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ...And...she may still ~ib~bear a grudge~ib~.`
` Be careful."`
`"Yes.`
` ...I'll wear it."`
`The Seven Stakes of Purgatory, as furniture used to make sacrifices for a ceremony, were treated as beings inferior even to weapons.`
`But that was only when compared to other demons.`
` To Humans, furniture is something to be feared.`
`I fished through the knapsack again,`
` took out a bracelet charm with a scorpion medal that I'd gotten from Maria onee-chan long ago, and put it on my arm.`
`...In the past, I hadn't needed something like this.`
`But I need insurance...`
`"......It's okay.`
` That has already been fitted with the required amount of magical defense.`
` As long as you wear that, you'll definitely be fine."`
`Maria onee-chan's magic power, which had been specially put into this charm, had been enough to earn even Beatrice's admiration.`
`...While it may have looked like something cheap to a human who couldn't understand magic,`
` its magical worth was incalculable.`
`"............`
`Come, arise.`
` Forgive the sin.`
` ...One of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory,`
` Mammon of Greed."`
`.........`
`I focused my mind.`
`I made the magic-repelling toxin that filled my body zero.`
`Imagine an untainted, vast space.`
`...Doubts and common sense all resist magic.`
`Make the resistance zero...and erase the burden on the magical power...`
`............`
`...Inside my head was the image of a vast space.`
`It was a nighttime world where I floated in the air and the neon stars over the ground sparkled.`
`A world where the stars that should have covered the sky were wiped away by the light from below that covered the ground.`
`In the world of a vast night sky with no obstructions, `
`...I imagined the wind blowing through at will.`
`At that time, `
`...in a room where there shouldn't have been any wind, `
`...the free nighttime wind kicked up a cyclone.`
`The long forgotten sensation raced through my entire body.`
`......It was the unique feeling of exultation that comes from using magic.`
`Mammon's stake, which I held out in my hand, gradually began to make me feel a pale light.`
`A twisting cyclone with the stake at the center.`
`...The hefty stake floated a bit into the air.`
`"......Wonderful.`
` ...Looks like the gap in your training hasn't stolen your talent."`
`"...Come, arise.`
` Forgive the sin.`
` ...One of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, Mammon of Greed.`
` ...Show yourself to me..."`
`After I raised my hands bit by bit, lifting them higher than my head,`
` as though it was being attracted upwards, Mammon's stake once again floated up high into the air...and gradually began to shake.`
`That shaking began to grow faster, `
`'!s0!d900`
`'!sd`
`...The terrible sound of it dancing around threatened to make me flinch.`
`...However, I must not lose my mental concentration.`
`Then, the stake, which had been flying around at an incredible speed, finally stopped and faced me...`
`...It was in the air, just a few centimeters away from my forehead, ...and held back by the defensive barrier created by the scorpion charm.`
`It had tried to break the defensive barrier, eating into it with an incredible power, but Maria onee-chan's barrier wouldn't be broken so easily.`
`"......It's no use, `
`...I can't break it..."`
`The stake muttered hatefully.`
`...It was probably safe to say that the scorpion charm saved me.`
`Without that, my attempt at killing time until I got sleepy would've killed my time for all eternity.`
`When Mammon's stake realized that it was unable to gouge me, it gave up and grew docile, changing its form from that of a stake into a human.`
`...In that same old outfit that I'd never be able to walk around outside in.`
`Although you could say it suited her, in a demonic sort of way.`
`"......Is that Ange-sama?`
` ......But that magical power's pretty shabby.`
` ...Are you really Ange-sama?"`
`"It's been a long time, Mammon.`
` ...Have you been well?"`
`"......`
`...And here I was convinced that furniture that's already fulfilled its function just gets left to rust away in a closet.`
` ...So, what kind of side show is this?`
` You aren't gonna say that you're my owner, are you...?"`
`"......Yes.`
` Ange is your master."`
`"Lady MARIA, `
`......how unsightly of me.`
` Was that barrier just now yours?"`
`"Yes.`
` I thought that as she is now, Ange might just have gotten finished off by you.`
` I lent her a talisman."`
`".........`
`...If Lady MARIA says Ange-sama is my master, I cannot refuse.`
` ......Ange-sama, please, your orders.`
` If it's me you need, are you going to perform a new ceremony?`
` With new sacrifices...?`
` Of course, that's only if you're willing to handle me yourself and get your own hands dirty."`
`"......That role isn't something I'm asking for anymore.`
` ......All you have to do is talk with me like you used to."`
`"............"`
`"........."`
`"......Heheh.`
` ...Yes, if that is what you desire.`
` Furniture is furniture because it is used.`
` It is an honor just to be summoned,`
` Ange-sama."`
`Mammon had a slightly complicated smile on her face.`
`...She accepted her new master because Maria had told her to, `
`but it looked like she hadn't gotten over her discontent at working for Ange, with her frail magical power.`
`...Perhaps she had some other reason for hating Ange,`
` but for now, it seemed that she couldn't disobey, even if she wasn't happy about it.`
`"......So?`
` What should I do?"`
`"I don't know.`
` ......Just do something lively.`
` Like old times."`
`"Well now.`
` This liveliness you're talking about is probably from when we sisters were all together.`
` It may be difficult by myself.`
` ...Did you forget?"`
`"...That's right.`
` The Seven Sisters were really lively when they got together.`
` ...But with Ange's magical power now, I think summoning just Mammon is the best we can hope for.`
` The stakes for the other six have been lost."`
`"My apologies, Lady MARIA,`
` but maybe it would be possible to summon the Seven Sisters via my own stake.`
` ...If I am to be used, I'd hope Ange-sama has at least that much power, right...?"`
`Mammon grinned.`
`...Apparently, she wanted me to summon the other sisters without a vessel.`
`I see.`
`Since she's unable to satisfy herself with being summoned alone, she's asking for the other sisters to be summoned as well.`
`...I get it, greed.`
` Yes, she was like this back then, wasn't she...?`
`......To furniture, the times during which they are used are bliss.`
`No matter how badly they are exploited, being used is furniture's joy.`
`On the contrary, regardless of how nice you are to them, not being given a job is more painful than anything in their eyes.`
`Mammon spoke in a challenging way, but she wanted me to summon the other sisters somehow and rescue them from the world of nothingness.`
`......If that's the case, all she's gotta do is say so.`
`These demon people can never just say what they mean.`
`"......Ange,`
` don't overdo it.`
` You'll need plenty of rehabilitation just from summoning Mammon."`
`"Oh, I'll need to rehabilitate after just one?`
` Well, I'm just killing time anyway.`
` ......Okay, Mammon.`
` I've gone this far.`
` I'll call as many as I can."`
`"Really...?!`
` Not bad, Ange-sama!`
` Okay, quickly, quickly!"`
`Apparently, even though she'd asked, Mammon hadn't really expected Ange to do this.`
`She hopped around, badgering Ange to summon the other sisters.`
`...Summoning Mammon alone consumed a considerable amount of physical and magical power.`
`...It'll probably be pretty tough to do six more.`
`...I'm awed by the magical power of those who can summon sisters like this at will with a snap of their fingers...`
`and who therefore reach the level where they can be called witches.`
`"Mammon, don't make Ange overdo it.`
` She still isn't at her best..."`
`"Whaaat?!`
` Ange-sama said she'd summon everyone!"`
`Actually, I only said I'd call as many as I could.`
`...I guess that's greed for you.`
`"Don't overdo it, Ange.`
` You should rest for today.`
` You're tired enough."`
`"It's okay.`
` I'm just killing time anyway.`
` Let me get tired enough that I can just fall over asleep."`
`...This time, there's no vessel.`
`I'll have to strengthen the image from my knowledge of the grimoire...and materialize them with just that.`
`I held my hands out into the air, replaying in my head the sensation from when I'd summoned Mammon...`
`I'm acquainted with all of the Seven Sisters, right?`
`...I've gotta remember that time, long ago, `
`...when I talked with them......`
`Once again, ...the power of magic began to fill me up.`
`It let off a faint...and yet distinct pale light from both of my hands...`
`"Ange-sama...!`
` Hold on, hold on, good luck...!`
` Hey, Lady MARIA.`
` Ange-sama's definitely gonna summon everyone, right?`
` The Seven Sisters will get to be reunited again, right?`
` Right?!"`
`"Yeah, definitely.`
` ...But there's no guarantee that it'll happen tonight."`
`"Ange-sama can do it...!`
` Please, Ange-sama...!`
` Start with the youngest sister, Asmo...!"`
`"......Asmodeus.`
` The seventh sister.`
` ......Got it.`
` I'll call them in order starting from the youngest."`
`A strand of hot sweat dripped down from my forehead.`
`...This really is gonna be one hell of a burden to carry.`
`The pale light in this space...began to slowly form into the outline of a girl...`
`"......Come, arise.`
` One of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, Asmodeus of Lust..."`
`There was no vessel.`
`...However, as I held a strong conviction that she definitely did exist there as a core, ...her form began to crystallize...`
`Her outline became distinct, ......and the form of the youngest of the Seven Sisters, Asmodeus, was finally created.`
`"Asmodeus of Lust, right here...`
` ......Where is this?`
` Am I alive...?"`
`"Asmo...!!`
` I'm so glad!!"`
`"Mammon nee-san!`
` ...Where in the world is this?`
` Who summoned me?"`
`"Ange-sama did...!`
` Ange-sama said she'd revive all of us...!"`
`...No, I didn't.`
`"Ange-sama, thank you!`
` Do Belz next...!!`
` Please...!"`
`"...Beelzebub.`
` The sixth sister.`
` ...Beelzebub of Gluttony.`
` Come, arise..."`
`At this rate, ...I wonder how many I'll be able to summon.`
`If I can't focus, `
`...this is probably it.`
`The pale light made an outline......and formed into Beelzebub.`
`"Beelzebub of Gluttony, right here..."`
`'!s0`
`@:dwave_eng 0, rg7_4e10:`
`Mammon and Asmodeus jumped onto Beelzebub, celebrating their reunion.`
`...I'd summoned three people at once.`
`...My head was throbbing.`
`Gotta summon the next one, without stopping for a break.`
`"...Come, arise.`
` One of the Seven Stakes, Belphegor of Sloth..."`
`"Belphegor of Sloth, right here.`
` ......To think...that I would be needed again..."`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, rg6_4e18:`
` I mean, I'm so glad to see you again!!"`
`"To think that the Seven Sisters would be able to meet again...`
` Ange-sama, thank you so much!"`
`"Keep it up and do Satan-nee next!`
` And Levia-nee and Luci-nee...!!"`
`"......Yeah, `
`...I get it.`
` ...So please, try not to be so loud.`
` ...Doing four people at the same time...`
`is pretty...tough..."`
`"Ange, don't overdo it any more than this.`
` You did a good job summoning even four of them after such a long time."`
`"...Stop it, Mammon.`
` Right now, Ange-sama is being pressured with the burden of summoning us.`
` Ange-sama, I beg that you do not strain yourself too much..."`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, rg5_4e56:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, rg5_4e57:`
`...No, I...`
`"Right?!`
` Ange-sama?!`
` You said everyone would meet again!`
` You promised that we could meet again right away!"`
`".........`
`......That's right, ......I promised.`
` ...I didn't promise anything about when, ...but I certainly did...promise."`
`"So keep that promise!`
` If you don't, I'll never forgive you for forgetting it until today, Ange-sama...!"`
`".........`
`...Come, arise.`
` One of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, Satan of Wrath..."`
`My mind's getting hazy...`
` ...But...I'll call.`
`Even though I'd forgotten about those days.`
`Even though I've never thought of that time as anything but sad and lonely.`
`...Because the short time I spent with them...`
`...was fun, without a doubt.`
`"Satan of Wrath, right here.`
` ......What the hell are you people doing?!!`
` Don't you realize how much it's burdening Ange-sama just to let us have an idle chat?!"`
`Satan, who had apparently figured out the situation immediately after being summoned, cried out in a loud voice, telling her sisters off.`
`...That loud voice made my consciousness hazy again.`
`"We are furniture who have been granted rest by Beatrice and whose duty has been finished!`
` Not only are you not honored at being given another chance to be of some use, but you're putting a burden on our new master, you disgrace to all furniture!!`
` Erase yourselves right away!!"`
`"Yes, it's like Satan-nee says.`
` I'll erase myself.`
` You all erase yourselves too.`
` In this moment, that's the best way for us to be of use to Ange-sama."`
`"No way.`
` Not until everyone's summoned!"`
`"Same heeere!`
` I'm huuungry!`
` I mean, I'd hate to leave again so soon after being reunited with you all!"`
`"Don't be so selfish!!`
` Come on, erase yourself quickly!!`
` Come on, Asmo!`
` Disappear right now!!"`
`"Waaaah, Satan-nee's bullying me...!`
` It's not fair if you always bully the youngest one!"`
`"......Yes, they really are lively.`
` ...It doesn't......bore me..."`
`"That's enough.`
` You've surpassed your limits for now, Ange."`
`'!s1`
`right...`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, enj_4e718:`
`With five of them summoned...and messing around as they pleased,`
` the load was far too heavy for me, with the meager magical power I had at that moment...`
`...This is.........it...`
`As my consciousness went hazy, I fell over onto the bed.`
`...Have beds always felt this soft...?`
`.........`
`It seemed that the sisters were still squabbling together as much as they liked.`
`...For a way to kill time until drowsiness comes to get me, `
`...this is enough......`
`Feeling something warm and nostalgic in the sisters' liveliness, I sank into a world of deep sleep......`
`At the entrance to my dream world, I felt Maria onee-chan...`
`...and Sakutarou waiting to receive me.`
`"......`
`You worked hard.`
` ...And...good job."`
`『Uryu.`
` ...Welcome back, Ange...〝`
`...Welcome back, huh?`
`Then, I should respond like this...`
`......I'm home......`
`That's right.`
` Just once in the past, I underwent training in order to step into the world of witches.`
`I accepted that the only power that could save me from those sad, painful days at Saint Lucia Academy...`
`was the thing called magic, and I received Maria's introduction to the basics...`
`"......Imagine...a vast space...`
` ...The scene from when I looked down at the mountain's base from a rest stop at the peak...`
` ......Like this...?"`
`I projected that scene from a memory into my mental world.`
`...Normal girls get over their fascination with magical girls when they leave elementary school.`
`So seriously training to use magic at this age...was embarrassing even for me.`
`But even that embarrassed feeling felt pleasant to me now.`
`Right then, I was learning mental concentration from Maria onee-chan, in order to use magic.`
`But it wasn't going very well.`
`...It was about as hopeless as teaching a person to wiggle their ears by showing them...`
`It seems that you need to imagine a vast space to gain the mental concentration for using magic.`
`So I remembered the time from my younger days when my family had gone on a small vacation, `
`when I had looked down towards the base from a viewing platform at a rest stop on a peak,`
` and I tried painting this scene in my mental world.`
`"No, still far too small.`
` Imagine a much, much wider space.`
` And create your own mental world.`
` Your image is still way too foggy.`
` There's no temperature in the air, and there's no wind.`
` No smells either.`
` The world is still very faint.`
` ...You can leave those for later, so for now, imagine an even wider space."`
`『Uryu.`
` ...Why do you have to imagine a vast space?〝`
`"From the time of their birth, Humans have inside of them a toxin that blocks magic.`
` If that toxin isn't purified, you can't use magic well.`
` ...One effective method of achieving this is to imagine a vast space."`
`"......Just now, I thought of the world as seen from the window of an airplane, but that didn't work.`
` ...I can't even think of...`
`a world more vast than that."`
`『In that case, Maria just has to teach Ange about the vast world Maria has...!`
` Won't that make it easy for Ange to imagine as well?`
` Uryu!〝`
`"...That's right.`
` And, I'm interested in the kind of world Onee-chan imagines when she uses magic.`
` ...I'll use it for reference."`
`"Uu-, that won't work.`
` The mental world must be vast and isolated.`
` A world with no obstructions other than yourself.`
` ...So, if you teach someone about that world, it won't be isolated anymore.`
` That's why you mustn't reveal your mental world to anyone.`
` And if you draw up a good mental world, you too must keep it as a secret only for yourself."`
`『Uryu...`
` So stingy, Maria...〝`
`"Thanks, Sakutaro.`
` I guess there are no shortcuts in training.`
` ...I'll make an effort.`
` It's okay, I've been given plenty of hints."`
`『Uryu...!`
` Do your best, Ange...!〝`
`Until recently, I thought there was no way something like magic could save me.`
`After all, magic doesn't exist in this world.`
`That kind of thing's supposedly nothing more than an illusion, a delusion, a daydream.`
`...However, Maria onee-chan showed me that she could fill her own world with happiness using a power that's impossible for me.`
`I used to look down on that happiness as something empty.`
`...Because I didn't believe in magic, I also denied everything else, refusing to believe in the happiness that magic gave birth to.`
`But slowly, bit by bit, Maria onee-chan's world grew happier.`
`In the past, I'd disparaged it, thinking it too pitiful to look at.`
`But...that might've been nothing more than jealousy.`
`I was forced to admit that.`
`And now, this was my first step in my search for happiness...`
`A vast space.`
`A dry wind that could blow without being blocked by anything.`
`...Let me feel that wind blowing through my own hair.`
`...I see, ...even the ground might get in my way as I am now.`
`Then, I don't need a ground.`
`......Brush the ground away, downwards, downwards.`
`In other words, ...it was as though I had floated up, leaving the ground far behind.`
`After pushing the ground further and further downwards, `
`...the ground grew foggy and faint, ...and for the first time, it began to feel like the sky.`
`......Then, I understood its vastness.`
`In that instant, I felt the vivid wind go right through even my body...in other words, blowing through me without any resistance.`
`"............`
`...Yes.`
` Maintain that sensation."`
`"...Yeah, I get it.`
` ...I get that I've been...released from all hinderances."`
`『You did it, Ange, you did it...!`
` You've taken your first step into the world of witches...!〝`
`"......This is...the world of witches...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` So, let's try practicing the magic that you've always wished for, Ange.`
` ......Magic that'll summon friends.`
` ...A magic that'll create allies who'll save you from your loneliness, and thereby bring you happiness."`
`『Will Ange also be able to summon friends like me?!`
` Uryuuryu!〝`
`"...As she is now, it's still far to early for Ange to summon friends like Sakutaro from the sea of zero.`
` ...To begin, let's start by practicing with friends that are easy to summon."`
`"......`
`...What will we start with...?"`
`"Because you're a witch of Mariage Sorcière,`
` you are also permitted to use those employed by other witches in the alliance.`
` ...For example, Sakutaro is my friend, but since you're in the same alliance,`
` he's your friend too, and you can summon him.`
` ...You wanna try summoning Sakutaro one of these days? When you're so lonely it gets tough, I'm sure Sakutaro will cheer you up."`
`I see.`
` You could call Sakutaro a being employed by Onee-chan.`
`So, as a witch in the same alliance as her, it's possible for me to summon Sakutaro too...`
`I met Sakutaro's gaze.`
`...How pleasant it would be to have him just be there by my pillow,`
` so he could talk to me a bit on lonely nights.`
`"...If I call out, will you appear...`
`and talk to me...?"`
`『Uryu-!`
` I can't wait to be summoned by you, Ange!`
` Uryuuryuuryu!〝`
`Looking happy, Sakutaro pressed his head against me like a cat.`
`Suddenly getting a cute younger brother...felt a bit confusing, a bit embarrassing, and a bit nice.`
`......Unable to understand why I couldn't honestly accept this feeling, I felt tears well up in my eyes.`
`"Right.`
` ...I'll give it all I've got, Onee-chan."`
`"Then let's practice.`
` ......Let's try summoning the furniture of Beatrice, a witch from the same alliance."`
`"......Beatrice's...furniture."`
`Hearing Beatrice's name gave me a slightly strange feeling.`
`When it came to the crime on Rokkenjima, the public kept going on and on in a frenzy about how it was a sacrifice ceremony performed by a witch.`
`...And that witch was Beatrice.`
`So, if the witch did commit that crime,`
` ...that would make her the culprit who stole my family from me.`
`However, Maria onee-chan said that Beatrice was a good witch.`
`If I held negative emotions towards Beatrice,`
` she'd get mad, leading to a nasty fight, and refuse to talk for a while.`
`...At this moment, Onee-chan was my only close friend.`
`...So to avoid worsening her mood,`
` I'd decided to think of Beatrice as nothing more than Onee-chan's magic teacher...`
`...Also, I believed that the crime was a conspiracy cooked up by Aunt Eva.`
`...I would definitely expose the truth about that someday......`
`"Ange,`
` obstructions are entering your body again."`
`"......Sorry, I lost my concentration.`
` ...One more time..."`
`I'd expect no less from you, Onee-chan...`
`You instantly noticed that I was being overcome with idle thoughts.`
`After shaking my head just once, I re-imagined the wind blowing through a vast space...`
`"......The Seven Sisters of Purgatory?`
` That's a pretty creepy name."`
`"But they're very energetic and fun kids.`
` They might become your new friends, Ange.`
` ...First, I'll show you how to summon them.`
` Watch."`
`Maria onee-chan lifted both hands up to the level of her head...and quietly unified her mind.`
`...The state I wasn't able to reach except by meditating for a long period of time, she reached in the span of a few quick breaths.`
`Then, a pale light began to gather in her palms, ......and one by one, the girls began to show themselves.`
`1, 2, 3 people.`
` 4, 5, 6, 7 people...`
`The way they were summoned one after another in a line was a masterpiece.`
`...Incredible.`
`Just like the illustrations in Onee-chan's grimoire, ...the Seven Sisters of Purgatory...`
`The younger sisters were behind the eldest, Lucifer, who saluted Onee-chan.`
`"The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here...!`
` Lady MARIA, it has been quite some time."`
`"Yes.`
` Long time, no see.`
` Is everyone well...?"`
`"We furniture are what we are because we are used.`
` To us, being summoned after so long is truly an honor!"`
`"Kya-♪ Sakutaro-!`
` It's been so loong!"`
`"You look as delici-, I mean, cuuute as ever!!"`
`"Me fiiirst!!`
` Kya-, today he's so fluffy, squishy, and cuuute!"`
`"Aaah!!`
` Let me hug him too, let me hug him too!"`
`『U-Uryu-!`
` Can't breathe!`
` I won't run away, so let go of me, everyooone!〝`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, rg3_4e12:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, rg3_4e13:`
`"...Even though you're saying that, it looks like you want to hug him the most, Satan-nee.`
` *giggle*."`
`"Ack!!@:dwave_eng 0, rg3_4e15:`
`"Hey!!`
` Be silent in the presence of Lady MARIA and Ange-sama, you foolish sisters!!"`
`They were so energetic...`
`I was shocked by their sudden burst of activity right after they appeared.`
`And on top of that, I was surprised that the innocent Sakutaro was on such good terms with the Seven Sisters.`
`"...That's unexpected.`
` To think that Sakutaro would be so loved by such shady people."`
`"They're fellow members of the same alliance.`
` There's nothing to be scared of, right?"`
`"But on the off-chance that their mood worsens, it looks like they could finish Sakutaro off in an instant..."`
`"It's all right.`
` The witches of the alliance and their furniture are all friends.`
` So Sakutaro can play without worrying.`
` ...Of course, that goes for you and me too, Ange."`
`It was one of the pacts of Mariage Sorcière.`
`"Mutual nonaggression and noninterference".`
`Member witches must respect each other's magic and creations.`
`Even the sisters, who were normally shady and belligerent, treated fellow alliance members as friends.`
`So, to the Seven Sisters, Sakutarou was a mutual friend.`
`He was loved by all of them, and they were even trying to steal him away from each other.`
`This scene as they squeezed him and loved him was a bit charming.`
`"...I see.`
` They're fellow members of Mariage Sorcière, after all."`
`At a glance, you'd think that Sakutaro's casual atmosphere and the Seven Sisters' shady one would be like water and oil.`
`It looked like they definitely wouldn't be compatible.`
`And yet, they were interacting in a friendly way like it was completely natural...`
`If this wonderful alliance could join all the peoples of the world together,`
` ...I wonder if everyone in the world would be able to become friends right away.`
`"All you Seven Sisters, listen.`
` Right now, Ange is in the middle of magic training.`
` So I want everyone to lend their power."`
`"Certainly, Lady MARIA.`
` ...But what specifically?"`
`"The magical power materializing you will move from me to Ange.`
` In that state, I want you to be by her side all the time.`
` You just have to talk with her."`
`"......My apologies, `
`but I wonder if Ange-sama's magical power will be able to easily summon all seven of us around the clock..."`
`The oldest sister, Lucifer, gazed at my complexion as she advised this, speaking reservedly.`
`...In other words, she was saying that the burden might be heavy for me at this point in time.`
`"That's the kind of training it is.`
` Ange has more talent and magic than everyone imagines.`
` It'll be pretty tough, but I think it's worth it for Ange to take this challenge as she is now."`
`"...Ange,`
` starting now, I'll move the magic power materializing them over to you.`
` ...In other words, it will become as though you had summoned them."`
`So, what Maria onee-chan was trying to say was something like this.`
`To keep the Seven Sisters materialized, you are continuously burdened with a significant amount of magical power.`
`...Maybe you could say it was like training while wearing a weighted wristband.`
`『Uryu...`
` Doing all of the Seven Sisters would be pretty tough...`
` Isn't that asking a lot of Ange all of a sudden...?〝`
`"Thank you, Sakutaro.`
` But this is training to become a witch.`
` I want to see how far I can go."`
`...The seven of them certainly do seem boisterous.`
`But even if this is for training,`
` having them with me will surely distract me from my loneliness, at least a little.`
`I understood it would be an ordeal, but wanted to give it a shot.`
`"Don't overdo it if it gets tough, okay?`
` And everyone, if it looks tough for Ange, take it easy."`
`"Certainly.`
` Get it, everyone?!"`
`""""""Yeees, Onee-samaa!""""""`
`"Well then, Ange-sama.`
` For now, we, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, will become your furniture.`
` ......Lady MARIA, if you would."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...So, Ange,`
` can we start?"`
`"...Sure.`
` ...I'm a little nervous."`
`『Uryu...`
` This might be tough all of a sudden...`
` If you feel like you're getting a headache, lower your magic power immediately...〝`
`"Okay, I'll move the source of magic power over to Ange......`
`........."`
`"......Nnn..."`
`In an instant, the inside of my head felt very heavy.`
`'!s0`
` Yeah, `
`......it's tough...`
`Until then, the inside of my head had only been used for myself.`
`It was almost like it was now being used for seven other people.`
`...If they just stood there and blinked once or let out a single sigh, that would put a strong pressure on my head...`
`"...Lady MARIA,`
` my apologies, but perhaps the burden from all Seven Sisters at once might be too great after all."`
`"...I-I'm okay......`
`...ack......"`
`"...No...`
` It won't work after all.`
` You're using all of your energy to materialize them.`
` There's no point if the burden is such that you can't balance it with your everyday life.`
` And anyway, this is a bit unrefined for a witch."`
`『Uryu...`
` That's why I said doing so many suddenly was impossible...`
` Everyone, erase yourselves for a bit...〝`
`"Right.`
` It seems it'd be better to lower the number of people.`
` Asmo, erase yourself."`
`"Me agaain?`
` I'm opposed to youngest-sister-bullyiiing!!`
` Disappear starting from the top every once in a whiiile!"`
`"That would mean I'd have to disappear second, right?!`
` No, no, nooo!"`
`"Don't make a ruckus, Asmo and Levia-nee!!`
` That kind of disturbance will become a burden to Ange-sama!!"`
`'!s0`
`"Eek!"`
`"......Aah, ......ack...`
`...gah......"`
`The Seven Sisters started arguing over who should erase themselves first.`
`...The energy from that fight all became a burden, forcing Ange to bear an even greater headache...`
`In the end, they decided the order with rock, paper, scissors, and 1, 2, 3 of them disappeared.`
`But even at that level, Ange was still far from comfortable.`
`In the end, once six of them had erased themselves, I was finally able to calm my breathing.`
`With my magical power, forget the Seven Sisters, just one person is my limit...`
`"...Sheesh, this way it's not the Seven Sisters, but just me, right?`
` You're a bit unreliable, Ange-sama."`
`Mammon, who had won all of the rock, paper, scissors matches and was permitted to remain until the end, grumbled.`
`『Uryu...`
` Mammon, you shouldn't say things like that...`
` Ange is still just starting her training.`
` ...Are you all right, Ange?`
` Is your headache okay...?〝`
`Sakutaro stretched up on his tiptoes, trying to pat Ange's head.`
`Watching this, Maria scratched her head, acknowledging that this sudden training had been too difficult.`
`"Uu-.`
` Maybe that was a little too much.`
` I'd be perfectly fine with this much though.`
` The more friends you have, the more fun it is."`
`"......Now I'm even more aware of how incredible you are, Onee-chan..."`
`Apparently, when one reaches Maria onee-chan's class, one can summon enough people to perform in an orchestra.`
`For a witch apprentice, that's awe-inspiring...`
`"Are you okay?`
` Ange-samaa?"`
`"......I'm sorry...`
` It looks like summoning you is the most I can do."`
`"Well, I guess I'm okay with that.`
` After all, of all the Seven Sisters, I get Ange-sama all to myself.`
` ...What do you think, Ange-sama?`
` If it's just me, will it be a burden for you?"`
`"No, I think I'll be able to manage you alone somehow..."`
`"Great!`
` Then please train a lot and cultivate your magic power a bunch.`
` Then someday, for sure, please bring the Seven Sisters together and let us serve you.`
` Promise?"`
`After confirming that, for the time being, her own materialization wasn't causing any issues, `
`Mammon immediately became cheery again and tried to make me promise to work harder.`
`I see, that definitely fits with her being Greed.`
`...But maybe you could also call it having a positive attitude.`
`"...Yes.`
` I promise.`
` ...I have to be able to do at least that much someday."`
`"Thank you, Ange-sama!`
` I, Mammon of Greed, will surely serve you until that day...!"`
`My headache finally abated, and I relaxed both hands, which had been clutching at my head.`
`Then Mammon stuck out her hand, helping me stand back up...`
`『Uryu?`
` ...Ah.`
` ...Maria, Ange, it's about that time.`
` If we don't return to the room, you'll be scolded.〝`
`"......Huh?`
` ......Oh..."`
`I hadn't expected Sakutaro to talk about the time.`
`...I was brought back into reality.`
`As though the light had disappeared, the vast world sunk into the darkness, `
`......and I was in a tiny, tiny bathroom stall, sitting on a toilet...`
`Onee-chan's grimoire was open on my lap.`
`I looked at the clock.`
`...It was almost 20:00, time for lights out.`
`If I show up late for the roll call before lights out, not only will things get pretty annoying, but it'll cause trouble for my roommates and floormates.`
`...I couldn't care less about causing them trouble, but I don't want them messing with me later...`
`*sigh*......`
`My free time by myself is already over for today.`
`I'll sleep, wake up, tomorrow will begin, and another long, long gray-colored day will repeat again.`
`I closed the grimoire and rose from the toilet seat...`
`At that time, Onee-chan appeared again and spoke.`
`"...Hey, Ange.`
` You're forgetting your training.`
` ......Take Mammon with you."`
`I'd forgotten.`
`...The moment I'd returned to reality, Mammon's materialization had stopped...`
`One more time, I created a strong image of the existence of Mammon in my mind...`
`"Sheesh, you're so mean, Ange-sama.`
` Why'd you erase me so suddenly...?!`
` At this rate, you won't be able to call all Seven Sisters easily!"`
`"......I'm sorry.`
` I got careless."`
`"It's been incredibly long since I've materialized in the human world, so I'm interested in absolutely everything.`
` I'm getting a bit excited.`
` Where is this?"`
`"......The Saint Lucia Academy dormitory.`
` This is a stall in the shared bathroom.`
` ...Each room has its own bathroom, so no one comes here.`
` It's quiet, and perfect for reading books."`
`"So in this dorm, you have to hide in a toilet stall even to read a book?`
` Do they burn books or something?"`
`......`
`I have a two-person room, so my roommate is always there.`
`Our relationship is gloomy and it feels like I'm always getting ignored.`
`...The atmosphere's bad, so I really can't relax there.`
`And, as long as I'm not there, she can do what she likes, call her friends over and chat away.`
`It's more convenient for them too if I don't return until just before lights out.`
`There's also a library, but there's a group that uses it as a meeting place, and they're always talking behind my back.`
`So I don't like to go there.`
`...During lunch, it's the bushes behind the school building.`
`During the night, it's the stall in the shared bathroom in the dorms.`
`Those are the only hideaways where I can find peace...`
`I opened the door to the stall...and went out.`
`I turned around, signaling with my eyes for Mammon to come with me.`
`"......I don't really get it, but I realize it'd be hard to call this place pleasant for you, Ange-sama.`
` Let's go out quickly.`
` I hate the air here."`
`"Really?`
` ......I think the air here is the most decent."`
`When I left the bathroom and entered the corridor, `
`because it was near lights out time, several kids who had gone to play in other rooms were dashing back to their own.`
`When it came time for lights out, we had to change into uniform pajamas that we hated and called prison clothes,`
` line up in the hallway, and go through the dorm leader's roll call.`
`...On the off-chance that someone was late, `
`we would take collective responsibility, and all of the floormates would have to undergo punishment in the form of volunteer work...`
`As long as I avoided this, the girls would look at me coldly, but they wouldn't get in my way.`
`...That alone was enough for me.`
`Mammon looked at the passing kids and the furnishings of the dorm with interest.`
`...Without paying her any particular attention, I hurried back to my room.`
`In front of my room was my roommate, who had already changed into her prison clothes, chatting with some kids from the room next door.`
`When they noticed me hurrying back, the topic of their conversation noticibly changed.`
`They lowered their voices, stealing glances at me.`
`I acted like I didn't notice, went into my room, and changed.`
`Then I hastily went out into the corridor.`
`Everyone was already lined up.`
`"......Hey, this is weird.`
` I thought this was a school for rich girls.`
` It's like a prison.`
` It's stupid."`
`"You think so too?`
` That's what I think.`
` And unlike prison, you don't get out early for good behavior."`
`...After bad-mouthing the place, I noticed something.`
`Having someone to listen to your complaints...`
`feels surprisingly good.`
`Fortunately, Mammon's form can only be seen by her summoner, me.`
`And of course, there was no need to speak out loud for this conversation.`
`All I had to do was speak inside my mind, so no one could listen in.`
`......Magic...and the friends it creates...`
`might actually not be so bad.`
`"All of these people are sheltered brats.`
` Feels like they aren't even alive.`
` Kyahahaha."`
`"Stop it.`
` If you're seen by some chance, it'll be pretty bad, right...?"`
`"Humans without a fragment of hopes or dreams are like a lump of anti-magic.`
` There's no way they'll be able to see me.`
` Hah, you lower life-forms can't even see.`
` *giggle*giggle*!"`
`"......Are you okay being around so many Humans with that magic-resisting toxin?"`
`"I'm fine as long as you continue to make me materialize, Ange-sama.`
` ...Although, since you'll probably have to keep concentrating to materialize me, there's a chance you'll neglect your daily life.`
` ...Look, that girl you're sharing a room with is calling you, right?"`
`"...Huh?`
` ......Oh-"`
`"Ushiromiya-san, are you listening?`
` About our weekly duties starting next week..."`
`...She's probably trying to push a few more chores onto me.`
`My roommate, who never even looked me in the eye normally, was smiling at me unpleasantly.`
`But it'll be easier to have the weekly duty pushed onto me alone, rather than doing it together with her.`
`That's a small price to pay to have her continue to ignore me non-stop...`
`Even so, with a completely shameless excuse,`
` she sidestepped the issue for some reason and insisted on flipping the situation around, as though I should've come forward and done it of my own initiative.`
`...One of the special traits of this academy is that it's full of girls who don't know how to ask a favor.`
`"...That kid.`
` She pisses me off.`
` I'd love to just gouge her right in the forehead."`
`"Yeah.`
` I hope you do, one of these days."`
`.........`
`...Yeah.`
`Having a friend nearby all the time to complain to...makes me happier than I thought it would.`
`It really was lively with all the Seven Sisters gathered together.`
`...I'm sure just watching them mess around will be a lot of fun.`
`...I want to gain enough magical power to summon all the Seven Sisters at once, and soon.`
`'!s0`
`......and finally summon...`
`the thing I really want to find.`
`"......?`
` What is it you really want to summon, Ange-sama?"`
`Mammon noticed my conversation with myself inside my head and asked about it blankly.`
`I hesitated to talk about it, but then figured that there was no reason to hide it and told her.`
`".........My family.`
` ......Dad.`
` Mom.`
` Onii-chan."`
`"So you mean...the souls of the dead...?`
` Calling a resident of another world is summoning, but calling back the souls of the dead is called resurrection, and they're completely different.`
` ...Resurrection is supposed to be a very high-level magic."`
`I know.`
`...So much so that even Maria onee-chan can't do it at all.`
`But that's the thing I want to find with magic...the most.`
`...I've been warned that it's a very difficult, high-level magic.`
`...So great that, in the worst case, I might not necessarily reach that point even after training for my whole life.`
`Furthermore, I have no vessel.`
`A vessel is vital for making magic succeed, whether it's summoning or resurrection.`
`Because I don't have that, ......a magic that would already have been difficult is now hopeless.`
`That's right.`
` I have nothing to remember Dad or Mom by.`
`However, ...by an extraordinary coincidence...`
`I do have something to remember just Onii-chan by.`
`And that's......this.`
`"...That hair accessory with the pink jewel?`
` What the hell... I hate to say it, but it looks a little cheap for you, Ange-sama."`
`"Long ago, without telling Dad,`
` I went with Mom to meet Onii-chan, and we went to play at an amusement park.`
` ...This is a prize from the crane game there."`
`I know it's cheap, I realize that it doesn't match my style, and I get that it's too childish.`
`...But this hair accessory is the only thing that makes me feel as though Battler onii-chan is by my side.`
`The glass case had been filled with plastic capsules packed with fun-looking things.`
`It seemed that each capsule had some cute accessory in it.`
`The game was to grab those with the crane, ...but I was young and it was too hard for me.`
`I tried it several times, but I didn't even get close.`
`Mom said that whatever was inside was probably cheap anyway, and we didn't even know what we'd get,`
` so there was no point in getting all upset over it.`
`But whether it was something cheap or not wasn't the problem.`
` ...The process of grabbing happiness with my own hands felt really important and sacred to me.`
`So I wanted the cheap thing inside more than anything.`
`Then, Battler onii-chan came over after finishing a game of shooting soldiers with a gun...`
`and tried to do it for me.`
`...With his arms that were longer than mine, Onii-chan grasped the happiness that I couldn't reach.`
`...Onii-chan really was coordinated.`
`It seems he often played with his friends at the arcades.`
`After only one or two attempts, he grasped that thing on the other side of the glass with the crane that I hadn't even been able to touch...`
`...and threw it into the exit chute.`
`When Onii-chan tossed me that capsule,`
` I remember that he looked very, very reliable.`
`For several days, I felt like opening the capsule would be a waste.`
`Then, one day, I finally opened it up.`
`...And what revealed itself inside...was this pink-jeweled hair accessory.`
`Since that day...`
`It's been a symbol for Onii-chan.`
`Since I was young, I felt that having all four of us gathered, including Battler onii-chan,`
` was a precondition for a happy family.`
`So I wanted Onii-chan and Dad to make up quickly.`
`...In my own way, I'd treated this hair accessory as a charm for bringing my whole family together.`
`So I always used to wear it.`
`I wanted to feel my reliable, fun, and wonderful Onii-chan by my side all the time...`
`and let him live in our house.`
`"But...my memories of Onii-chan...are very distant.`
` ...I can't do it as easily as Maria onee-chan created Sakutarou from a lion stuffed animal.`
` ...One day, I'll surely possess the high-level magic to revive the souls of the dead.`
` And the only key...the only vessel...that can make that successful is this."`
`"............`
`...I see.`
` I did feel an incredible magical power from that hair accessory. So that's what it was."`
`"Magical power...?`
` There's magical power in this thing Onii-chan gave me...?"`
`"Maybe I should say that it resides in you, Ange-sama.`
` ...Your strong desire to call your brother gives you magical power.`
` ...Resurrection certainly is a high-level magic,`
` but there can be no mistake that you're steadily and unconsciously climbing the stairs towards it."`
`"......I'm glad.`
` It's nice to hear someone other than myself acknowledge that."`
`Your own effort isn't something that you can observe by yourself.`
`In that sense,`
` ...even though these words came from a shady demon girl who controls one of the seven deadly sins, `
`...they made me very happy.`
`"Well, I can't guarantee that you'll obtain the resurrection magic before your life is over.`
` ...However, your power as a witch is proportional to the height of the mountain you dare to climb.`
` If you don't lose heart, I'm sure you'll rival even our former master, Beatrice,`
` as a Great Witch someday."`
`"...I wonder if I can.`
` I wonder if I can become a Great Witch and revive Onii-chan...`
`no, my family."`
`"The Witch of Resurrection, Lady ANGE...!`
` Kyaah, wonderful!`
` A Witch of Resurrection is a very rare kind of witch.`
` Having a master like that would make me pretty proud.`
` Actually, I'd love for that to happen.`
` Because furniture's worth is also proportional to the class of its master!"`
`"Please pass Beatrice-sama up and become a peerless Great Witch!`
` As a representative of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, I'll support you from the bottom of my heart! Kyaha!"`
`......I'd thought that if a magical friend were to appear for me too, a cute kid like Sakutarou would be best.`
`But even this fifth sister of the shady Seven Sisters who controlled the seven deadly sins...`
`was enough to calm my heart so much all by herself.`
`...Maria onee-chan has probably known that since long ago.`
`That's why she recommended the world of witches to me over and over and over again.`
`And I kept on stubbornly rejecting her...`
`I should've given in and started my training as a witch sooner.`
`A year for a child is worth ten years for an old person, ...right...?`
`Now I find my past self, which only ever complained, deplorable for wasting my precious time.`
`Long after I turned off the lights and slipped into bed, Mammon continued to talk to me alongside my pillow.`
`...I promise.`
`One day, for sure, I'll develop a magical power that can summon the Seven Sisters.`
`And I'll let them have a lively and fun time.`
`The seven of them make a single whole.`
`...None can be left out.`
`Family must be together.`
`I must...bring them together......`
`"............"`
`My awareness began to return slowly.`
`Unable to stand watching Aunt Rosa and Maria onee-chan's relationship,`
` ...I ran away from Beato's and Onii-chan's game, didn't I...?`
`...I've got to go back.`
`I've got to go back, support Onii-chan, and quickly bring him back from this strange world of the witch's game.`
`After all, as long as I'm here, ...I'm not allowed to call myself Ange.`
`...At that time, I felt someone's presence.`
`When I turned around, ......I could see Mammon there.`
`"Gretel-sama,`
` Beatrice-sama said that if you do not return soon, it will become a hindrance to the progression of the game.`
` I beg that you return swiftly."`
`"......Thank you.`
` ...I'll go back now."`
`"Isn't it great?"`
`"What is...?"`
`"That you were able to meet Battler onii-chan."`
`"......Is that sarcasm?"`
`"Well, if that's how it sounds, feel free to call it that."`
`"......I'm sorry.`
` I should've taken it literally.`
` ...Yeah, you're right.`
` Even in this screwed up world, being able to meet Onii-chan makes me happy from the bottom of my heart."`
`"And you'll win against Beatrice, for your Onii-chan's sake...?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...Can't have him playing around in a world like this forever.`
` ...It's about time for him to return home.`
` That's why I came to call him."`
`"......Please do the best you can.`
` Although I can't support you, since my current master is Beatrice-sama."`
`"I know.`
` Until October 5, 1986, ...you are Beatrice's furniture.`
` And eventually, you'll become my friend."`
`"But eventually, you'll throw that friend away.`
` After all, ...ng, ......gah..."`
`Mammon moaned as if she'd bit her tongue, staggering as she clutched her chest.`
`Apparently, the rules apply to people other than me as well.`
`"Are you okay?`
` It's pretty...painful."`
`".........`
`...Excuse me, `
`G-Gretel-sama."`
`"No.`
` Thank you."`
`"......?`
`"I'm glad.`
` Glad I was able to meet Onii-chan.`
` That's my answer to your first question.`
` ......Well, let's go back.`
` If I grumble too much, you'll get in trouble with your current master."`
`"Yes.`
` I'm glad you understand.`
` Well then, thi`
`".........Mammon?`
` ......Huh?"`
`I'm sure Mammon was about to say "Well then, this way..."`
`But then, ...she stopped, as though the film had been torn off at that point.`
`It looked like she'd suddenly frozen.`
`...Then, I noticed.`
`She wasn't the only thing that had frozen.`
`...Even the air and floating bits of dust had frozen in place in empty space.`
`A world where it seemed even time had frozen.`
`...Yes.`
` This looks like a portent that Bernkastel will appear.`
`But the atmosphere was different somehow.`
`Then, I understood.`
`......It wasn't Bernkastel.`
`...It was the other witch.`
`"How are you feeling, Ange...?"`
`"......Lambdadelta.`
` ...The rules don't apply to you, do they?"`
`"Of course not.`
` Rules exist to bind others.`
` What kind of idiot would bind themselves with them?"`
`Bernkastel is a witch who supports me, ...but this girl is different.`
`This witch supports Beatrice.`
` ...In other words, she's a being on the opposing side.`
`But there's some kind of difference between her and Beatrice.`
`Even compared to Bernkastel, there's something strange about Lambdadelta's existence.`
`...It's...how should I put it...`
` Maybe like she's a being from a higher dimension...`
`In any event, I was still unsure about how to deal with her.`
`...The only thing that was certain was that she was my enemy.`
`...No, just knowing that might be enough, but...`
`"So, ...do you have some business with me?"`
`"Not really.`
` When I listened in on your conversation, it started to get a bit interesting.`
` I thought I'd let you hear something good."`
`"You're supposed to be my enemy.`
` I can't think of a reason for you to tell me something that'd help me.`
` So the moment I start listening to you, I lose.`
` Bye, <see you next time>."`
`"Don't misunderstand.`
` My opponent is Bern, not you.`
` ...In other words, it's possible for there to be a topic that benefits both you and me."`
`".........Sorry,`
` but I don't feel like listening."`
`...Although I said that, `
`I probably won't be released from this frozen time until Lambdadelta is satisfied.`
`...This itself might be proof that she's in a higher dimension than me.`
`I haven't been given the option of not listening to her.`
`All I can do is try not to be shaken by anything she says...and strengthen my mental guard.`
`She'll probably try to make me believe something disadvantageous to me,`
` threatening me...`
`"*giggle*giggle*`
` There's no need to square off like that.`
` I just came to resolve your misunderstanding.`
` ...No, that's not quite it.`
` I came to let you know about the lie Bernkastel told you."`
`"......Bernkastel......lied?"`
`"Didn't Bern make it sound like your big brother would come back if you defeated Beato?"`
`"......`
`Who knows.`
` ...I don't feel like talking with you."`
`My brother coming home...`
` I hadn't been promised anything that dream-like.`
`Getting just one person only if I was lucky...had been a promise without very high hopes.`
`But that's enough for me.`
`...After being promised an eternity of isolation,`
` having a faint but still non-zero chance was like a shining beacon.`
`"In a way, that promise of Bern's wasn't a lie.`
` ...If Bern promised, then I'm sure that if you defeat Beato, Battler and your parents will be released and will come back to you."`
`"Then there's no problem."`
`"......Seriously?`
` ......That kid is surprisingly cruel.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~To think she'd deceive you, even though she knows~ib~."`
`"......How are you saying I was deceived?"`
`Damn...`
`I'm letting her take the initiative.`
`...But I won't be released until I lend an ear to her.`
`...So it's something I'll have to hear anyway...`
`Even though I realized I was falling into a trap, I urged her forwards.`
`"What year is it now?"`
`"...You're talking about the world of the game board?`
` ...In that case, it's October 4, 1986."`
`"That's right.`
` So if you win against Beato, then on October 6, when the typhoon has passed, the people who were trapped on the island will return.`
` ...On October 6, 1986, that is, right?"`
`"......So what?"`
`"How was your October 6, 1986?`
` ......You were at your relatives' house, right?"`
`...I'd been at the house of the only Sumadera my mother trusted, Grandpa.`
`......We got a call.`
`When I was playing with building blocks in the tatami room, we got that call...`
`'!s0`
`...Lambdadelta laughed unpleasantly...`
`and spoke.`
`"HEY.`
` ON YOUR OCTOBER 6, 1986, DID BATTLER ONII-CHAN COME HOME?"`
`'!s0`
`Even though I didn't understand what she was saying, I noticed an unpleasant sweat seeping out all over my face...`
`...Aaah, I don't get it.`
` I DON'T GET IT.`
`...What is...this witch saying......?`
`"See?`
` If you defeat Beato, Battler will certainly be released.`
` And he'll probably return home.`
` To his home in 1986.`
` After all, that's how it is, right?`
` Battler was locked up from the 4th to the 5th of October in 1986.`
` It's only natural that he'd return the next day if he were to be released, right?`
` ...And you?`
` You're a person from the year 1998.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` You're Ushiromiya Ange of the year 1998 where ~ib~Battler did not return~ib~.`
` Know what that means?"`
`"......What...are you talking about?`
` ......If my family came back home on October 6, ...wouldn't that be wonderful?`
` I'd come home from Grandpa's house right away.`
` And then we'd meet.`
` ...Everyone would be happy..."`
`"Yes.`
` Ushiromiya Ange probably would be reunited with her family.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ...~ib~The six-year-old Ushiromiya Ange from 1986~ib~ would, right...?"`
`"......Who am I?"`
`"Ushiromiya Ange.`
` An eighteen-year-old one.`
` ......No, that's not it.`
` You aren't Ushiromiya Ange.`
` You're a witch's piece with that name.`
` Strictly speaking, the name ANGE Beatrice belongs to a completely different person.`
` ...Know what that means?"`
`I don't...really get it anymore...`
`......Huh?`
` ...Huh?`
` ...Who...`
`...am I?`
` ......Huh?`
`"...And thaaat's why I think Bern's cruel.`
` No, I think she's a meanie.`
` Especially since it's not like she hasn't gone through the same thing herself."`
`'!s1`
`...being tricked...`
`......somehow......?"`
`"Yeah, but please don't blame Bern, okay?`
` After all, depending on how you look at it, that kid isn't lying.`
` ...If Beato is defeated, your family will be returned.`
` Returned to Ushiromiya Ange.`
` ...But she probably didn't say that this Ushiromiya Ange would be you, right...?"`
`Was it like that...was it like that...?`
`What did Bernkastel say to me, again...?`
`Your assistance is required.`
`...Your family needs it.`
`Bernkastel started by saying that.`
`Then I spoke.`
`If I save them, does that mean my family will come home?`
`...And how did Bernkastel answer that, again...?`
`Umm, umm...`
`'...I cannot promise that.'`
`U-Umm...!`
`She did make me a promise.`
`In exchange for accepting this fight...!`
`Yes, this is what she said!`
`'In exchange, I will search for a Fragment with the ideal world that you wish for, `
`a world where your family comes home.'`
`......Yeah, that's right.`
`...She didn't say any more than that she'd look for it.`
`She didn't say she'd find it.`
`...But...I was prepared for that from the beginning.`
`But even so, ...that child promised that as long as I didn't give up, there was a faint chance of it happening...`
`And, ...in the end, she said this.`
`'I'm giving you a chance for revenge.`
` ...In exchange, I promise to search for and bring you the happiest resolution among the possibilities you're capable of accepting.'`
`".........`
`...I've known it was a tough bet from the very beginning.`
` ...After all, I have no family in my 1998.`
` Even just a small chance of shaking that absolute zero...`
`would be worth it.`
` I was warned beforehand that even if I succeeded in my revenge, it might be a wasted effort.`
` ...So, ......umm......"`
`"Yeah, there's no lie in that part.`
` Beato's game board is perfect.`
` Even having you around `
`makes the chances of Beato losing so slim that it's doubtful you could even dream of it happening once in your life."`
`"In other words, your chance of winning is almost zero, so absolutely that it could be regarded as infinitely close to zero.`
` So, Bern can be forgiven for saying that part in such an evasive way."`
`"...But I can say for sure that she was tricking you when she let you get your hopes up.`
` After all, even if you could overcome astronomical odds and win, `
`the person your family will come back to isn't you.`
` It's the six-year-old Ange that exists in this 1986, the true Ushiromiya Ange.`
` Not YOU."`
`"...Bern will still probably go around the billions of Fragments, searching for the best world for you.`
` But didn't she tell you?`
` That she planned on bringing it to you as a present, but wasn't able to find it?"`
`"......She did..."`
`"Hehheheheheh, *giggle*giggle*giggle*...!!`
` You're finally starting to notice, aren't you...?`
` No reward has been prepared for you in this battle.`
` No, to the contrary, when smashed, Beato's game board will disappear.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` Then `
`~ib~you, as a piece, will disappear~ib~`
`."`
`"......The sort of goal you'd be capable of accepting is completely...`
`......no.`
` I'll proclaim it upon my name.`
` Upon the name of the Witch of Certainty, Lambdadelta!`
` I proclaim that it 'certainly' doesn't exist...!"`
`".........That can't be......"`
`"That's what Bern lied about.`
` ...Or should I call it speaking in riddllles?`
` She made you misunderstand and think you could be saved.`
` I came to clear that up."`
`"......In other words, `
`...no matter how hard I fight, `
`no matter how hard I pursue victory,`
` ...my family won't come back to me......?"`
`"Right, they won't come back!`
` With 'certainty'!`
` Ohohohohohoh!!`
` The Witch of Certainty says it with certainty!`
` Isn't this incredible?`
` Several ancient kings have dedicated historical buildings to me because they wanted me to give them certainty!`
` And here I am, graciously giving it to you as a present.`
` Isn't this reeally incredible, cute and marvelous?`
` Ohohohohohh!!`
` Buut!`
` I have a single good proposition for you."`
`......Damn.`
`...I'm getting completely overwhelmed...`
`I knew I shouldn't have listened, ...and now I'm starting to be overwhelmed by this witch, Lambdadelta...!`
`"My opponent is Bern, not you.`
` Didn't I just say it's possible for the two of us to talk about something that benefits us both?`
` I've said that from the beginning.`
` So listen to me.`
` You have no choice...!"`
`'!s1`
`...I'll listen...`
` ...I've just gotta listen, right?!!"`
`I finally lost control over my emotions and exploded from the inside.`
`I don't have a clue anymore.`
`...I believed that I was Ange.`
`But at some point, I stopped being Ange.`
`That's right, I'm ANGE.`
` Not Ange...!`
`Who am I?`
`I'm not my parents' child, nor my brother's little sister.`
`...I'm just a piece...in a witch's game...!`
`"There's no need to be so pessimistic.`
` ...I mean, think about it, okay?`
` Right now, you're together with Battler onii-chan.`
` While it's true that you can't tell him your name, `
`at least you're positioned as his ally in a game where he battles a witch, `
`...and you're able to be with him for all eternity.`
` ...Know what it meeeans...??"`
`......I can't stand it, `
`......but I understand...`
`In other words, ......as long as Onii-chan keeps getting a tie in this game, it will continue forever.`
`Continuing to tie means continuing the game for eternity,`
` and it means that I can remain with Onii-chan as a piece.`
`...But if Onii-chan wins...or loses, and the curtain closes on the game...`
`"You, as a piece, will disappear."`
`"............"`
`"How do you define happiness for a game piece?`
` ...Getting used by someone playing the game, nothing more.`
` You won't find it when the game's shut in a closet, gathering dust, right?"`
`...In the past, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory said it as well.`
`Furniture's happiness comes from being used, not being stored away.`
`'!s0`
`@`
`...the witch's...`
`...furniture.`
`"Let's change things around a bit.`
` ...To be honest, I want this game to continue in a tie for all eternity.`
` An unending game is an eternal cage.`
` ...An absolute closed room that never opens for all time and that'll finally make Bern surrender."`
`"...You know, Beato does want to win a bit.`
` Victory by making Battler surrender.`
` But that's actually a problem for me."`
`"After all, if the game ends, the closed room'll fall apart.`
` ...So I'll go easy on Battler a bit, to stop him from surrendering.`
` Don't worry, okay?`
` When Battler's about to surrender, I'll become his ally."`
`"......But you know?`
` I get the feeling that Beato is faintly starting to realize.`
` ...I think she's starting to realize that her victory won't come for all eternity in this game."`
`"But she is, of course, the Endless Witch.`
` Beato's stupid, so she optimistically thinks that even so, she'll surely win eventually, `
`like she just has to repeat this game on and on endlessly.`
` Of course, pretty much all blondes are morons, *giggle*giggle*!"`
`'!s1`
`......there will never be...`
`a victory or a loss..."`
`"I won't let her win.`
` And I won't let her lose.`
` With certainty!`
` ...Bern noticed that.`
` So, she looked for the most powerful piece for breaking that deadlock, found you, and threw you in.`
` To make this game end, you see?"`
`"......To make this game...end..."`
`"What's a piece's role when the game ends?`
` ......I'll state it clearly.`
` Your existence is a contradiction.`
` ...Your reason for existing is to bury yourself in the darkness and despair...!"`
`My goal is to defeat Beato and release my captive family.`
`...And yet, even if I succeed, I won't be rewarded.`
`"You cannot lose.`
` And you won't be rewarded if you win.`
` ...So, I've brought you a third choice.`
` And that choice will make our interests coincide."`
`......Continuing the tie...for all eternity......`
`"Yes.`
` ...As long as the tie continues forever, this world will not crumble.`
` ...What is this world?`
` ......It's the world of the game with the witch.`
` A world where Beato and Battler fight for all eternity.`
` ...And at the same time, `
`it's a world where you get to be with Battler for all eternity...!!"`
`'!s1`
`......aaaah`
`...ah`
`......"`
`My head was spinning.`
`That confusion became a hot liquid, and I felt it pouring from my eyes...`
`It was so hot...that it felt like it'd burn my face...`
`"Riight...?`
` ANGE Beatriiiiice...??`
` Since Bernkastel's goal is to end the game and end the world where you and Battler can interact, why should you be her ally...?"`
`"...That kid tricked you, you see?`
` She made it look like you might be saved if you became her piece.`
` But I won't deceive you there!"`
`"...So I'll say it, ANGE.`
` Become my chess piece.`
` Unlike Bern, I won't offer you rewards based on lies that certainly will never be granted.`
` As long as you become my piece and help me so that this world 'certainly' never ends...`
` Then with 'certainty', I'll swear upon my name that this world will 'certainly' continue!"`
`"That's not all.`
` I'll add on a bonus.`
` This rule that binds you.`
` ...I'll clear it away for you.`
` Well, of course, I'll only do it after you've sworn to become my piece, okay?"`
`In my own throat, ...there was a thick, loud gulping sound...`
`Aah, I shouldn't have listened...`
`If I hadn't listened, I could've remained an innocent little sister, praying for my brother's victory.`
`...But I might be different now.`
`...I might've been degraded into a witch's furniture, `
`......one that cares about nothing but being by Onii-chan's side...`
`"...I'm not telling you to betray your brother, okay?`
` If it looks like Battler's gonna lose, you can save him with all you've got.`
` ...On the other hand, when Battler closes in on Beato too much, I want you to hold back a little.`
` ...That's all I'm asking, all right?"`
`"Don't worry, there's no need to actually betray Battler.`
` ...Battler can't win against Beato alone.`
` That's why Bern threw you in, you see?`
` ...As long as you don't lend a hand, Battler will be unable to win against Beato for all eternity."`
`"See?`
` It's really simple, isn't it?`
` ...*giggle*giggle*, hohhohohoho, ahhahahahahahah, ahhahhahhahhahhahha!`
` Kahhahhahhahha, kyaaahhahahahahaha, hahhhahahahahahahha!!"`
`"Hey!!`
` That's miiine!`
` Giiive iiit baaack!!"`
`"No, no, I'll eat iiit!`
` Asmo, Asmo, pass!"`
`"Kya-hahahaha!`
` Over here, Levia onee-samaaa!"`
`I wonder where they swiped it from.`
`They were fighting over a donut or something, playing around really loudly.`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, rg3_4e21:`
`"Yelling stuff like that makes you the loudest one, Satan! Be silent!!`
` You foolish little sister!"`
`"Y-You're the loud one, Lucifer onee-sama!!`
` I-Is there something you'd like to say to me?!"`
`I was already used to the oldest and the third oldest sister arguing with each other.`
`Even though they're both so quick to anger, it's a bit funny how they're both having to hold back a little.`
`They might be surprisingly like each other.`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` You were told to be noisy, but this is a bit too much.`
` Should I make them lower the volume a little?"`
`"......They can mess around all they want.`
` It's a hundred times more pleasant than that shrill laughter in the classroom."`
`"Ange-samaa, go to the next page quickly!`
` You read really sloow!"`
`"You like to read, Mammon?`
` You looked like you'd be the worst at doing boring things."`
`"Mammon controls greed.`
` ...That also includes a thirst for knowledge.`
` Still, she wants to keep that knowledge all for herself, so be warned that she refuses to let people read any book you give her, and sometimes burns them after reading them."`
`"I like knowing things that no one else knows.`
` I like being able to do things that no one else can do.`
` So I like studying and practicing.`
` Because I want to keep wisdom that no one else knows about all to myself."`
`As Mammon said that, her eyes sparkling, `
`she peered down at the page that was open and read through it again.`
`You could see the greed that made her covet that page even more thoroughly than I did.`
`As you can see, my magical power has grown much stronger than it was on the first day I summoned them.`
`By now, I've gotten so that I can summon all of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory at once and still calmly read a book like this.`
`This place, although I can't recall exactly where it is, is a quiet and calm street-side bench.`
`I'd been young back then, so I don't remember the details of its location.`
`...Still, I remember that my days walking here were a lot of fun.`
`Together with Dad, Mom, ...and even Onii-chan,`
` it was a memory of a very rare and very happy day when everyone had been together...`
`The people who walked by every once in a while didn't notice me.`
`They just pleasantly ignored me and passed by as though everything was normal.`
`Even the Seven Sisters' incredible outfits weren't embarrassing or anything,`
` because it wasn't like anyone was actually watching.`
`Come to think of it, I'm getting pretty used to it.`
` As long as they don't make me wear those.`
`I was sitting on a stylish bench, memorizing a timeline for world history.`
`...In an academy system where everything is based on collective responsibility, there's no tolerance for dunces.`
`It seemed that I was considerably below the average grade for the class.`
`According to those extremely intellectual girls,`
` if I alone improved my grade, the average would rise drastically.`
`...They had been kind enough to show me with a graph drawn by colorful pens on a B4 sheet of drawing paper.`
`...Just thinking of the effort it had taken to draw that was repulsive.`
`But I've already spat out all those complaints.`
`...I've already voiced my constant and furious anger and sadness to these girls here.`
`The Sisters `
`were sometimes indignant, `
`sometimes sympathetic, `
`and sometimes mourned along with me.`
`...I was truly happy to be able to share emotions like that with friends.`
`It's said that they were originally furniture that existed to carry out Beatrice's cruel sacrifice ceremony.`
`...According to the occult message bottle I hated, `
`...it seems that several of them even attacked my family.`
`But I don't believe that, and it's pointless to question them about it.`
`They are furniture, so they only respond to their master's requests.`
`Even if they really did attack my family, I can't hate them.`
`'!s0`
`was the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
`......Or else that ringleader of the Ushiromiya Suspicion, `
`Aunt Eva.`
`"...Ange-sama, quickly, the next page."`
`"Oh, sorry.`
` ......I'm tired.`
` Mind if I take a break?"`
`"Kyahaha!`
` Ange-sama said break!"`
`"Let's play, let's play!`
` Ange-sama, let's plaaay!!"`
`When they noticed that I had interrupted my studying, the most energetic youngest sisters gathered around me.`
`And that wasn't all.`
`Even Maria onee-chan and Sakutaro showed themselves.`
`They had probably been very close by, but they must've hid themselves so that they wouldn't interrupt my studying.`
`『Uryu-!`
` Ange!`
` How's studying? How's studying?〝`
`"Kyaaah!!`
` Sakutaro-!!`
` How are yooooouu?!"`
`"Wait a second!`
` Let me squeeze him tooooooooooo!!"`
`'!s0`
` Kyaa, cute, cute!"`
`『Ukyuu--, you're crushing meee!`
` Uryuu--!〝`
`"Your luck ran out when you showed up while all the Seven Sisters were gathered.`
` Give up and let us hug you."`
`"Come on!`
` It always turns out this way!!`
` I apologize for my stupid older and younger sisters...!"`
`"Ahahahahaha.`
` Sakutaro's happy to meet everyone, too.`
` ...How's it going, Ange?`
` How's the studying going?"`
`"Thanks.`
` Well, not bad.`
` They were nice enough to pass around printouts from a quiz that another class took earlier.`
` Their beautiful sense of solidarity is enough to bring tears to my eyes.`
` ...Well, at least it's probably better to put a timeline into my head."`
`『Uryu.`
` You sure are good at studying, Ange.`
` You'll be able to get a lot of points, uryu-.〝`
`"Good work.`
` I was terrible at studying, so I'm jealous of you for being able to get a good score when you study hard."`
`"You're joking.`
` When it comes to English, Latin, and knowledge of the occult,`
` you're much more amazing for being able to remember so much."`
`"I can remember anything when studying magic, but I can't remember anything boring.`
` So that didn't help at all for tests."`
`"Well, it's true that occult knowledge would be like that, but your grades must've been pretty good in English, right?"`
`"In the first year of elementary school, on a Japanese language test,`
` there was a problem when I was given a picture of a gun and was told to write its name in four squares.`
` It got marked wrong because I wrote the English word 'rifle' in katakana (ライフル)."`
`"Why?`
` Doesn't that fit?"`
`"It was supposed to be the Japanese word for gun in hiragana, ~ib~㝦㝣㝽㝆~ib~.`
` I was told that's wrong, because you don't learn katakana in first grade.`
` ...I didn't really get it,`
` so from that day on, on tests, I wrote everything in hiragana.`
` But I got in trouble with Mama for some reason.`
` Got in trouble with the teachers too."`
`".........`
`...You were probably born in the wrong country, Onee-chan."`
`"Then I'd rather have been born in a country of witches, so I could enter a witch school.`
` Uu-."`
`『If that happened, you might've had much, much more wonderful magical friends!`
` Uryu-!〝`
`"Uu-♪`
` But it's not like I mind it now.`
` After all, I can use lots of magic, and I've got a lot of magic friends.`
` Sakutaro is all I need."`
`『I'm not the only one!`
` There's also Sakusuke and Sakukichi, the animal band, Shimoda-kun the seal, Sanae-san the rabbit, Mr Pig-kun, and plenty more!〝`
`...Incredible.`
`The number of Onee-chan's friends keeps increasing.`
`Every time I ask, the number of names for her friends grows.`
`But there's no doubt that Sakutaro is her best friend.`
`...I'm a little jealous of all those close friends.`
`"...What do you think?`
` How are the Seven Sisters?`
` Do you get along with them?"`
`"Those sisters are really energetic.`
` They sometimes say shady stuff, but they aren't bad.`
` ...I'd wanted to get a cute kid like Sakutaro, but I think being with them now is more than enough."`
`"*giggle*`
` If you learn more of my Magic of Origins, I'm sure you'll be able to give birth to friends you'll like, Ange.`
` Creation is still a bit too hard for you now."`
`"There's a difference between creation and summoning.`
` ...And, resurrection is also different."`
`"......`
`So, your greatest wish really is to revive your family...?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......I have a vessel for it.`
` This."`
`"That's right.`
` ...I'm sure that hair accessory will eventually become the key to summoning Battler.`
` ...The rest is up to your training, Ange."`
`"Although not knowing how long it'll take is enough to make me cry."`
`『Uryu...`
` Stay strong, even if it's tough...`
` If you don't give up, Ange, it will definitely, definitely come true someday...〝`
`"If someone gave me some proof that it'd definitely be granted, at least that would calm my heart."`
`『Uryu!`
` Then I guarantee it!`
` Without a doubt, Ange will surely have her wish granted someday!〝`
`"...Thanks.`
` I'm glad to hear it, even if you're just saying it to console me."`
`『It's not like that, uryu-.〝`
`"Stop it, Ange.`
` That kind of emotion will turn into the magic-resisting toxin.`
` The feeling that your dreams will definitely come true is the best seed that buds into magic power."`
`"......`
`...That's right, sorry, Teacher."`
`"You need to be a bit greedier, Ange-sama.`
` Go however far it takes to get the thing you desire!`
` You're lacking the willpower to never give up until you get it!"`
`『Uryu-!`
` That isn't true, Ange's doing her best...!〝`
`"Thanks, Sakutaro, Mammon.`
` Crying about it won't help anything.`
` There's nothing I can do except hang in there.`
` I'll try hard.`
` I'll grit my teeth.`
` I'll definitely make my dreams come true.`
` With certainty."`
`『Uryu!`
` You're awesome, Ange, do your best!`
` Mammon and I will support you!〝`
`"Yes, we'll support you.`
` The greedier our master is, the more our worth will increase."`
`"More importantly, Ange-samaa!`
` We've finally got 10 people gathered heeere!"`
`"We planned to have everyone play shiritori or something!"`
`"If you lose, there's a punishment game!`
` Let me nibble your eeears!"`
`"Come on, is hunger the only thing inside that head of yours?!"`
`"Please forgive my foolish sisters' stupid proposals...`
` Are you sure it isn't about time you returned to your studying?"`
`"No, no, nooooooo!!`
` I waited so long for you to finish studying, so I can't stand it if you don't play with us!"`
`"I don't think it's a bad idea.`
` Perhaps playing every once in a while is good for softening the mind."`
`"......You govern Sloth, right, Belpha?`
` What you're saying sounds reasonable, but you're actually being sneaky, aren't you?"`
`"Hmph.`
` My apologies.`
` ...You are diligent, Ange-sama."`
`"If it's okay with Ange, I'd also like to play with everyone.`
` Let's make some noise.`
` It'll definitely be fun."`
`『Uryu-!`
` Ange, Ange, let's play, let's play!`
` Let's all do shiritori!〝`
`"In that case, let's start from Sakutaro's 'uryu-'.`
` ......In that case, which sound should we start the next word from?`
` 'Ryu'?`
` Or 'yu'?"`
`"From 'uryu-'?`
` ......I wonder.`
` Maybe it really should be 'ryu'?"`
`"...It's rare for a word that ends like that to come up."`
`"Then I'm first!!`
` I'll do a word starting with 'ryu'!`
` Ryuuzu (watch crown)!"`
`"I wanted to go first!`
` 'Ryuuto' (lute) would've been wonderful!"`
`"'Zu'?`
` Feels like we keep getting tough ones.`
` ...Wait a sec, what order are we going in?`
` Who's next?"`
`『Uryu.`
` I don't think it matters who.`
` Whoever thinks of a matching word first.〝`
`"What's that? Sounds interesting.`
` How about the person who can say the most wins?`
` It's fast-talking shiritori!"`
`"Then I'll go!`
` 'Zucchini'!`
` 'Ninniku itame' (garlic stir-fry)!`
` 'Mekabu with pasta'!`
` All of them delicious!`
` Kyaha, I said three of them!"`
`"Belz takes three points.`
` ...Can you use conjunctions?"`
`"If you could use 'with', then anything would work!!`
` That last one doesn't count!`
` Minus one point!!`
` Let's start from 'me'."`
`"Then I'll go.`
` 'Meringue'-!"`
`『'Ge'??`
` ...U-U-`
`Uryu-!〝`
`"'Gesuidou' (Drainage system), `
`'umetatechi' (reclaimed land), `
`'chikashitsu' (basement).`
` How'd you like them apples?"`
`"Onee-sama, those are all pretty crummy words, *giggle*!"`
`"S-So what? Then why don't you try following up with something refined!!`
` Anyway, that's three points for me.`
` The next one's 'tsu', okay, 'tsu'!"`
`"I've never played such a weird shiritori before.`
` Uu-uu-!`
` It's fun!"`
`『Uryu-!`
` I don't get it at all, but it's fun.`
` Uryu-!〝`
`I've played normal shiritori before, but I've never experienced a shiritori this weird.`
`There's only the lively Seven Sisters, Maria onee-chan, Sakutaro, and me.`
`I'm now surrounded by friends that are so fun to be with.`
`...The courage to accept a world of magic, a world of witches...`
`...That alone didn't change the fact that I was still locked up in an academy,`
` without a single friend in my class.`
`But despite that, I'm able to have such a fun and lively time.`
`......I'll also become a witch, like Maria onee-chan.`
`And someday, I'll add my family to this fun circle.`
`Dad, Mom.`
` And Onii-chan.`
`...And if possible, George onii-chan and Jessica onee-chan.`
` And the other relatives.`
`I'll call everyone, everyone here without a single person missing, ...and we'll all gather together.`
`"...This is my...dream.`
` ...That's right.`
` Until I make that come true, I definitely won't lose heart."`
`"I'm sure you'll become a Great Witch, Ange-sama.`
` As long as you believe in that.`
` We Seven Stakes of Purgatory will always serve by your side until that day comes."`
`"You'll be there for me...?`
` No matter how long, `
`...you'll lend me your strength?"`
`"Of course.`
` After all, I'm your friend. Right, Ange-sama?"`
`".........`
`...Yes, that's right.`
` Let's all stick together and play together.`
` Today, and in the future, always, ...always."`
`"Until the day your dream comes true, Ange-sama."`
`The lively, ten-person game of shiritori, `
`alongside a street cut off from time, under the constantly bright rays of the sun, could have continued forever...`
`"......Wait, seriously? What's going on, Ushiromiya-saan?"`
`"............"`
`...In the end,`
` I wasn't able to get a very good grade on my test.`
`I tried memorizing things in my own way,`
` but if you could manage anything by cramming the night before a test, no one would ever worry about tests.`
`"Normally, when you know the problems beforehand, you should be able to pass easily, right? Easily!"`
`"It's true that we didn't go so far as to write the answers into the blanks for you.`
` We thought you'd studied at least that much."`
`"What the hell?`
` Come on, are you serious? I can't believe it!`
` They're almost all wrong, aren't they?`
` Did you really study properly?!"`
`".........More or less..."`
`"This isn't what you call more or less, Ushiromiya-san.`
` ...It's so horrible that it makes me dizzy, okay?"`
`"Oh, God.`
` Please forgive her for getting a miserable grade on such an easy test...`
`and for making the average score for the entire class plummet...!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*, `
`ahahahahahahaha."`
`...The same test had been given in another class first.`
`That test paper had been obtained, so the average score for our class had been unusually high.`
`Enough to obscure my slight improvement.`
`However, ...there were some things I had no excuse for.`
`If I'd spent that entire day studying like mad, I might've been able to get a slightly higher score.`
`...But I hadn't gone that far.`
`After that on that day, `
`...I spent the whole time having fun playing shiritori with the Seven Sisters, Sakutaro and Onee-chan.`
`As expected, the winner had been Maria onee-chan.`
`She was a strong player thanks to her wide knowledge of trivia.`
`Sakutaro had gotten the punishment game.`
`He spent the whole time cheering for everyone else's answers,`
` completely forgotting to think of any himself.`
`...Because of that, he'd been squished by the Seven Sisters and had his ears thoroughly nibbled, hadn't he?`
`"Heey, are you listening, Ushiromiya-san?!"`
`"........."`
`They were surrounding me, twittering like small birds.`
` They were annoying, smelly.`
`On the outside of that circle was Mammon, an exasperated expression on her face...`
`"This is a messed up school, just like usual.`
` Shouldn't you be more than happy as long as your own grades are good?"`
`"......It's probably because of that collective responsibility thing.`
` Instead of worrying about their own grades, `
`they're more concerned about how embarrassing it is for the class average to be low.`
` Or maybe it's because they really hate the volunteer work they're forced to do as punishment."`
`"So in other words, they aren't studying because they want their grades to be good,`
` but because of collective responsibility and since they hate volunteer work?"`
`"...They're jealous and embarrassed.`
` They don't want to be inferior to anyone, and they don't want to be humiliated.`
` That's the only feeling that drives them to study."`
`"What noisy people. If they want to study, why can't they just do it themselves?"`
`"In the end,`
` without collective responsibility and volunteer work, they'd have no desire to study.`
` ...How foolish it is to study without knowing the meaning of studying."`
`"Still, these guys really are annoying and stupid!`
` Don't you dare disturb Ange-sama's precious day for even a minute!"`
`"Waaah, I hate those people!!`
` Just get lost!!"`
`"I'm hungryyyyyy!!`
` Go away noooooow, waaaah!!"`
`"......`
`......Sorry, everyone.`
` I wonder why Humans are so shameful."`
`"It's probably because, instead of working hard themselves,`
` it's easier to make you work hard and earn them a higher class average to satisfy their greed.`
` ...Humans are all greedy.`
` And they'll burden others with their greed to make things easier for themselves."`
`"...We'll eventually be reunited with them on the mountain of Purgatory.`
` When they get to the fifth terrace, they'd better watch their step..."`
`Mammon controls the fifth terrace of the mountain that reaches to heaven, Mount Purgatory.`
`...Since she's saying this, you can probably be sure that after those girls die, their journey to heaven won't be an easy one.`
`...No, on the contrary, let them just fall into hell.`
`The class committee went to the student council and applied to use a classroom during lunch and after school.`
`The purpose of use was for a class study group.`
`A wonderful little gathering so that they could all surround me and make me study. I'm so grateful I could cry.`
`Which meant that every day, all of my lunch and three hours of my afternoon would be stolen.`
`The academy and its student council, with its theme of student self-government,`
` instantly approved of this pleasant activity that the students were taking up of their own initiative...`
`In other words, I was no longer able to escape after school by leaving the classroom...`
`After school, the first class study group meeting started right away.`
`Would they open a textbook, then kindly and carefully explain so that even I could understand it?`
` Of course it didn't turn out like such a naive illusion.`
`After school in the classroom, dozens of my classmates crowded around my desk.`
`First, before we started studying...`
`Why were my grades so bad?`
`What was the reason?`
`It was decided that we couldn't start until I could clearly answer those questions, become aware of the problem, and show regret for my actions.`
`...Of course, there's no way for me to respond when asked a question like that.`
`They've loathed me all this time.`
`And they've rejected me and kept me at a distance, preventing me from joining in on their community.`
`So, I've avoided their community myself.`
`There shouldn't have been any conflict for either of us that way.`
`So even in this group that was enthusiastic about raising the class average, `
`they obviously kept me at a distance.`
`Even if I tried to join in, `
`they would probably ignore me, like they always did in the past.`
`"If you'd just asked, we would've taught you whatever you wanted.`
` Riiiiiiiight?!"`
`'!s0`
`They were getting themselves all worked up.`
`...I've already had enough of the hypocrisy of their tacked-on excuses.`
`"Ushiromiya-san, your problem is that you're lacking a cooperative personality.`
` You mustn't be satisfied as long as everything's good for you alone."`
`"Those who gather in Saint Lucia's place of learning shall have a cooperative heart.`
` It's written right there in the student handbook, right?"`
`"I think having a cooperative heart is what gives birth to the desire to study together and contribute to the entire class.`
` I believe that itself is the thing you lack before you even start studying, Ushiromiya-san, `
`but what do you say?!"`
`"Heeey, have you even been listening to us?!`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` We went to all the trouble of staying after school to say this `
`~ib~for your sake~ib~`
`, right?!"`
`.........`
`I'm so grateful I could cry.`
`Of course, they didn't like that.`
`'This way, it almost makes it look like we're bullying you', they reprimanded me.`
`Fortunately, I'm normally all cried out anyway.`
`If I'm told not to cry, I can hold it back.`
`First, I was made to write a letter of remorse and read it out loud.`
`Of course, this was to be done by today.`
`The class committee politely applied to the student council and the staff room for an extension on the use of this classroom.`
`...It seems it was accepted right away.`
`Which means that starting now, I'll be forced into self-criticism for at least a full five hours here...`
`——Ushiromiya Ange got a low score on her test and caused trouble for her classmates.`
`'!s0`
`"You getting low grades and causing us trouble isn't the root of the problem, is it?!"`
`"It's a cooperative attitude, right? A cooperative attitude!!"`
`"Come ooon!!`
` Why do we even have to direct Ushiromiya-san on how to write a letter of regret?!"`
`Their abusive jeers flew about one after another.`
`I followed their 'directions' and erased it.`
`——Ushiromiya Ange didn't have a cooperative attitude and caused trouble for her classmates.`
`"Hey, wait a sec, it's pointless if you just write whatever we say, right?!"`
`"Do you really know what 'regret' means?!"`
`"It's pointless if you don't write it in your own words, pointless!"`
`"I always thought you were a bit strange, Ushiromiya-san, but you really are weird!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`Even following their directions didn't change the jeers much, and now it felt like they were mocking me even more...`
`So for several more hours, without rest, without even being allowed to go to the bathroom,`
` much less dinner, I was continuously abused...`
`...I was coerced into writing a paragraph that humiliated myself...`
`At about 9:00 that night, ...I was told to stand up and read it aloud.`
`The contents...`
`were smeared black with tears and eraser marks.`
`'!s0`
`...but it was like a list of soulless letters, `
`whose contents I couldn't even remember.`
`Everything had been copied down according to their orders.`
`So while I had been the one to write the letters, they weren't my words.`
`I'd been coerced into writing them down...and even coerced into reading them aloud.`
`......Even after all this time, I was surprised to learn that, beyond just ignoring people and hiding their things,`
` there are other ways to bully people...`
`"Heey!`
` Read it aloud quickly!!"`
`"Look how many people are staying this late just for you, Ushiromiya-san.`
` Why not thank us a little?"`
`"Isn't the fact that she doesn't feel gratitude a sign that she doesn't have a scrap of a cooperative attitude?"`
`"It's okay, Ushiromiya-san.`
` We'll always be with you from now on.`
` Why not study with us and remake yourself?`
` Okay?"`
`"*giggle*giggle* "Ahahahahaha "Kyahhhyahyahyahya!!"""`
`As I stood by my seat, surrounded by them, ...I dropped my gaze towards the blackened page.`
`And then...I spoke those humiliating words, `
`but right away, jeers flew at me saying that they couldn't hear and to speak up.`
`......I can't read it.`
`I had no idea...`
`that being forced to read a paragraph humiliating me would be so painful.`
`My throat shook.`
` My fingertips shook.`
`...The paragraph of humiliation written in my own handwriting made my eyes burn with a hot liquid.`
`So my world blurred and twisted.`
`I saw the girls surrounding me twist and bend.`
`...I saw them twist and bend into the impression I had of them.`
`In other words, ...that was my true field of vision.`
`Beyond that twisted crowd of people, ...I could see my friends.`
`Compassion could be seen in all of their eyes.`
`"......Ange, ......stay strong..."`
`『Uryu-......〝`
`Maria onee-chan and Sakutaro were looking at me with sad eyes.`
`Probably because they realized that even cheap words of compassion would hurt me.`
`...They kept alternating between trying to say something...and hanging their heads.`
`"What the hell's wrong with these people...?!!"`
`"They're just the worst!`
` Really pisses me off!`
` What's so fun about gathering around Ange-sama and torturing her?!"`
`"It's a resentment they can't voice despite their jealousy.`
` They don't care who it hurts, as long as they can let it out.`
` What horrible people."`
`"Ange-sama!`
` In this kind of situation, it's okay to go mad with rage for your own honor's sake!!`
` Anger is an appropriate emotion and an appropriate reaction!`
` If you don't get mad now, when will you get mad?!!"`
`"Stop it, don't stir Ange-sama up with cheap anger!!`
` If Ange-sama could do that, she would've done it already!!"`
`"......You should only get angry if doing so will improve the situation.`
` However, from a objective standpoint, doing that now would probably only aggravate the situation further.`
` It may be humiliating, but the wisest thing to do now is to withstand it."`
`"Ahha!`
` You really are a sloth, Belpha!`
` Quit fooling around, I can't stand this!!`
` I can't forgive them!!"`
`『...E-Everyone, calm down...`
` It'll become a burden for Ange...〝`
`"A burden?!`
` What are you talking about? Is this the time or place to be calm?!`
` We furniture are not so cruel as to cooly watch when our master is humiliated!!"`
`"Ange-sama!!`
` You have no obligation to read such a humiliating letter!`
` If you can't let out a cry of rage, then at least throw it onto the floor!!"`
`"You don't need to trash talk them, you don't need to yell so loud that they bend over backwards!`
` Just throw the notebook on the floor with all your might...!!`
` By doing just that, you'll be able to show your strong will!!"`
`"Don't start running on by yourself, Mammon!!`
` I told you, right?!`
` If Ange-sama could do it, she would've done so long ago!!"`
`"Nothing will be resolved by the eruption of momentary emotions.`
` Can't you see that doing that will only make their treatment of Ange-sama even more severe?!"`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, rg7_4e30:`
`'!s0`
`"And it's not just tonight, but tomorrow and the day after too!!`
` That's enough, you can't simply sit there bearing this humiliation!!"`
`"Hey!! Are you really listening to us?!"`
`Someone tugged at my hair.`
`...I was torn back into my tragic reality.`
`...I was no longer even permitted to listen to the Seven Sisters speaking on my behalf in my heart.`
`My hair was lifted upwards, one of my hair ornaments came off, and I could hear the sound of it rolling on the ground.`
`...No one picked it up.`
`To the contrary, they casually avoided it as though something filthy was rolling towards them.`
`I tried to follow it with my eyes, but my hair was tugged upwards again.`
`"Why do you neeever listen to us, even though we're talking about something so serious?!"`
`"In one ear and out the other, is it?`
` Does anything get into that thick skull of yours?!`
` Get a grip, okay?!"`
`"Are you really conscious of the trouble you're causing us?`
` You aren't going to start saying that you just wrote it grudgingly because we told you to, right?!"`
`"Until you really show regret of your own will, this seriously isn't gonna end, okay?!`
` It's not just for today.`
` It'll seriously keep on going tomorrow and the day after, you see?`
` Don't you play us for fools, okay?!?!"`
`"I mean, why are you still even alive?`
` Is it normal to go on living like this?`
` If it were me, I'd just die!"`
`"You can't live like this, can you?!`
` 'Cause you being alive just means getting in other people's way all the time, right?`
` If it were me, I definitely couldn't live on!"`
`"Yeah, yeah, I'd die too.`
` If doing that's better for the world, then I'd die right away! Riiiiiiiiight?!!"`
`...Then die.`
`"Ange-sama..."`
`"Kill all of them now!!`
` Lucifer, can you hear me?!"`
`"Uh, ...ah..."`
`"You Seven Sisters of Purgatory are incredible furniture that can massacre mere Humans in a flash, right?!`
` You're always boasting about it to me!!`
` Then do it!`
` Massacre them right now!!`
` Right here, right now!!"`
`"......Well........."`
`For some reason, Lucifer hesitated.`
`...Why?`
` What's wrong?!`
`You're certain-kill furniture that can fly around faster than the eye can see and instantly pierce the hearts of a witch's enemies, right?`
`And I'm giving you an order as your master!!`
`Carry it out right away!`
` Kill!!`
` Kill them aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaall!!`
`".........A-Ange-sama...`
` ...Please, calm down..."`
`If they had immediately followed my brutal order, making heaps of corpses with me at the center...`
`...I was ready to reflect on my own reckless actions of stealing human lives so readily, ...ready to regret and repent, just as they had wanted me to.`
`I was prepared to do that.`
`And yet, Lucifer just let an unsure expression rise to her face...and didn't move to carry out my order.`
`.........I knew it.`
`Yeah, I knew it.`
` ...Vaguely.`
`No, that's not right.`
` ...I've known from the beginning.`
`I've......known that magic was all empty this whole time, haven't I...?`
`"...The Seven Sisters of Purgatory? Yeah, right...`
` ...Stupid, so pointless...`
` ......I've known it the whole time..."`
`"......A-Ange-sama, `
`'!s0`
`I glared into the worthless Lucifer's eyes.`
`...And pain seemed to accompany that gaze.`
`As though she was being assaulted with a violent headache, Lucifer grasped her head with both arms.`
`But it looked like she couldn't tear her eyes off my gaze.`
`...So she was assaulted with a pain that grew more and more violent.`
`"............"`
`"Guhguhguh, ah...gahgaaa, agaa......!!`
` Gyack!!!"`
`Useless, useless...!!`
`I hate you!!`
` Disappear...!!`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~You're nothing but a delusion inside my head~ib~`
`...!!!`
`Hopelessness and disappointment.`
`Resignation and a dream's end.`
`A cracking sound, like you'd hear from a frozen lake's surface during a fierce winter, rang out just once.`
`At the same time, Lucifer's form, which was being tormented by a violent pain, stiffened in place and grew cloudy.`
`...It was almost as though a beautifully polished glass window had been heartlessly smashed and turned white from the countless fissures.`
`And that was an accurate analogy.`
`At some point, Lucifer's form had turned into a glass ornament of the same shape.`
`Countless fissures ran through it from the inside, and as the head and arms collapsed, it crumbled to the floor.`
`"Eeeek?!!"`
`"L-Luci-nee...!!"`
`"......Who's the second sister...?`
` Leviathan?`
` Carry out my order.`
` Massacre them right now!!"`
`"N-No, um!`
` ...Err, Ange-sama...`
` ...Please calm your heart and listen...`
`'!s1`
`......aaah, `
`gwaagahhgguguggah, `
`kyaaggghh!!"`
`I'm not looking for excuses or back talk or an answer.`
`...I want nothing more than a swift confirmation of my order to eradicate the girls who are humiliating me.`
`If you're going to say anything else, there's no need for me to listen until the end.`
`After Leviathan also turned white due to countless cracks throughout her whole body,`
` she fell over backwards, splitting into separate parts along her neck, hips and arms.`
`If she'd been smashed to bits and lost her original form, it probably wouldn't have seemed so brutal.`
`So seeing the two of them halfway left over made the remaining younger sisters shake even harder...`
`"...Why won't you listen to my orders...?`
` Why?`
` Why?!!"`
`"M-My apologies...!!`
` H-Here, under the current conditions, the anti-magic power is...e-extremely strong and..."`
`"What's that?`
` You can't do it because Humans are here? That's your logic?`
` Isn't killing Humans what you do?!`
` If you can't do that, then what use are you as furniture?!!`
` Die!!!"`
`"Eeeeek!!`
`'!s1`
`aaaah, `
`khhagah, gihh, ack!!"`
`As she clutched her head with both arms, Satan also turned white and fell down face first.`
`Apparently the neck is the most slender part after all.`
`Her head slid off and rolled over to Belphegor's feet.`
`"You can't do it because there are too many Humans?`
` Then later on, I'll call them into the shadows one by one,`
` and you can make a bloodbath of all of them, right?"`
`"...With your current magical power, it may be easy for you to converse with us.`
` However, you still lack the training to materialize us in front of all of the Humans here...!"`
`"I deeply understand your anger, but even if you could use us to attack...`
`and murdered everyone here, that would only make your situation worse...!`
` I know it's humiliating, but please control your anger for the time being...`
`......ahgah, `
`...gaaaahaahh, kwaaaagghhgh!!"`
`"......Will I get the same answer from the next three...?`
` Are you gonna tell me you can't do it because the anti-magic power is too great?`
` Are you gonna tell me you can't do it because my magical power is too weak?`
` ...Then I won't ask you to kill all of them.`
` Just one person's fine, so try and kill them.`
` Right here, right now...!!"`
`As Asmodeus and Beelzebub held each other, they crouched down, cringing in fear under my glare.`
`...If they'd been able to obey my order, they probably would've carried it out immediately.`
`And yet here they were, crouching down.`
`...Empty.`
` Sad.`
` And pathetic...`
`That's right, I've known.`
`These girls can't even touch reality with one of their fingers...`
`"N-No, no...!!`
` Belz, I'm scared, Beeelz!!"`
`"Ange-sama, spare us, spare us...!!`
` I don't wanna diiiiiiiieee!!"`
`"Die, useless furniture!`
` Why are you guys even alive?`
` Why are you alive when your lives are worthless?`
` It doesn't matter if you die, right?`
` Die.`
` I'm telling you to die!!`
` Do you think any idiot would leave furniture that has no use lying around?!"`
`""Eeeeeeekkk!!`
` !!!! Gah!!!""`
`"P-Please stop, Ange-sama!!"`
`"...What is it, Mammon?`
` Are you gonna be only one to fulfill my order?`
` That's right.`
` You're my best friend.`
` ......You alone will do it for me.`
` Get them!"`
`"......A-As you are now, Ange-sama, ...even if you use us, you aren't capable of committing murder!!`
` It's furniture's duty to help with things their master can do...!`
` Things that even the master can't do, we can't do...!!`
` Do you hate them, Ange-sama?`
` You do hate them, right?"`
`"I totally understand why you want to kill them!!`
` Okay, in that case, go ahead and kill them, Ange-sama!`
` If you stain your own hands with blood, then we, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, will go along with you however far! However far you go!!"`
`"...I'm...asking you all......because I can't do it myself, aren't I...?`
` ...Isn't being able to do things I can't the thing that makes you furniture?!!"`
`"Yes, we are furniture.`
` Furniture to be used...!!`
` Please, go ahead and use us to kill!`
` You'll be the one killing, Ange-sama!!`
` If you're saying that you want to kill, then go ahead, be my guest!`
` No need to hesitate, go and carry it out right now!!"`
`"And once you've prepared yourself mentally,`
` once you're prepared to dirty your own hands, then we'll help you!`
` But you haven't done that, Ange-sama!!"`
`"Pft, ......*cackle*cackle*, ahhahhahhahhahha...`
` Ahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahha, don't speak, furniture.`
` You delusion!!`
` I get it already, you don't all have to tell me.`
` ...You people can't do anything.`
` You're nothing more than my delusions, illusions, daydreams...!`
` I haven't had a single friend from the very beginning.`
` You're just a phantom, a pretend friend I created in my heart, in my isolation, right?`
` I've known from the very beginning!!!"`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Yeah, that's right!`
` We're an illusion inside your head, Ange-sama, but so what?`
` Yes, that's truue!`
` We're just imaginary friends created to soothe `
`lonely, lonely Ange-sama's heart because she doesn't have a single friend, but so what?`
` If you want to look at reality, just look at it.`
` You can stop looking at us and return to being surrounded and bathed with jeering over there!!"`
`"C'mon, c'mon, go back, welcome home to reality!!`
` Just call on us only when it's convenient for you and pretend you have friends, `
`then spur us on even though you don't have the guts to dirty your own hands, then deny and erase us once you realize that it's hopeless!`
` Yes, please enjoy it, I'll leave with a shriek of anguish just like you want, Ange-sama!!"`
`"Just copy the jeering that you're being showered with right now,`
` and do the same to us to get it off your chest.`
` That's also furniture's duty!!`
` Getting slammed against the floor when someone's pissed off is also a chair's important duty!!`
` If that alone can absorb their master's bad mood even for an instant, `
`there can be no greater honor for furniture.`
` Kill me, deny me, your first and final friend...!!!"`
`At the end, Mammon had a mocking expression on her face,`
` ...but for some reason, it looked splashed with tears.`
`Mammon, Beelzebub and Asmodeus were smashed and fell to the floor...`
`『......U-Uryu.........〝`
`"......`
`Come over here, Sakutaro.`
` Ange is a little agitated right now.`
` ...So you mustn't get close."`
`『What about everyone else?`
` Are all the Seven Sisters alive?`
` Did they die...?〝`
`"...It's okay.`
` It looks gruesome, but those are the remains of their vessels after being deported from the human world.`
` Shells that have been shed.`
` ...So it's all right.`
` They're probably deeply hurt, but they're okay.`
` Everyone is alive.`
` I'm sure we'll be able to meet them again someday."`
`『Uryu...`
` ...Thank goodness, ......thank goodness......〝`
`"...Ange has violated the contract of Mariage Sorcière.`
` ...To do such a horrible thing, ...even though witches of the alliance must respect and accept one another...`
` Even though they were all important friends to you, Ange..."`
`"No witches' alliance has anything to do with this.`
` Magic friends? Give me a break.`
` ......I killed them, erased them.`
` I smashed the Seven Sisters!"`
`『Uryu, ...that's so cruel, ...so cruel......〝`
`"...Just give it a rest with this playing witches thing.`
` ...I'm begging you.`
` Maria onee-chan and Sakutaro, I want you to disappear by yourselves.`
` ......Even in my imagination, ...I don't want to kill and erase you."`
`『...W-We aren't your imagination...`
` We're your friends, Ange, ...uryu......!〝`
`Sakutaro said that as he hid behind Maria onee-chan, sobbing.`
`......Sakutaro doesn't exist.`
`Sakutaro is also...an imaginary creature Onee-chan created to distract herself from her loneliness......`
`『...U-Uryu, ......it hurts, ...it hurts, Maria...`
` ...Why? Why...?`
` Uryu......uryu......〝`
`"Stop it.`
` Denying my friend is the one thing I will not permit."`
`The same power that had smashed the Seven Sisters was probably eating into Sakutaro as well.`
`...But Maria onee-chan was apparently protecting him with some other power.`
`So Sakutaro's form didn't break and scatter.`
`Onee-chan glared at me sharply.`
`...It was a serious expression that I'd never seen before.`
`"Sakutaro is my furniture.`
` You cannot erase him, Ange.`
` ...However, trying to deny someone is the greatest form of scorn for a witch."`
`"Sakutaro didn't exist from the very beginning.`
` He's just a lion stuffed animal.`
` A phantom you personified with the delusions inside your own mind!"`
`"Uu-!!!`
` That's not true!!`
` Sakutaro is my friend!!`
` He was a stuffed animal once, but now he isn't!!"`
`"No, he's a stuffed animal.`
` A stuffed animal made of cloth and cotton!`
` He can't move or talk by himself!`
` You're just talking for him like a ventriloquist, right?!`
` You call that magic?`
` You call that a witch?!`
` You call that...a friend?!`
` I can't accept that!!"`
`『............Uryu...`
`'!s1`
`...not me...?`
`...Am I...`
`...just a stuffed animal that...`
`...can't really talk...`
`...and not Maria's...`
`...friend...?`
`U...ryu......〝`
`As though struck with a high fever, Sakutaro weakened bit by bit.`
`As he clung to Onee-chan's body, he did all he could to continue standing, `
`...but his body began to gradually slip down...`
`As he did, Onee-chan held him, yelling at me as tears streamed down her face...`
`"Uuu--!!`
` Stop iit!!`
` Don't burn Sakutaro with the magic-resisting toxin!!`
` Don't bully him!!`
` Don't insult him!`
` Don't deny him!!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` Maria onee-chan, you're so weeeird!!`
` There is no Sakutaro!`
` Stuffed animals are stuffed animals!`
` I learned from Mama that they're made of cloth and cotton!!`
` There's no way they can walk or talk!!`
` *giggle*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!!"`
`『......Uryu, ............u...yu......〝`
`"Sakutaro!!`
` Sakutaro-!!!`
` You aren't a stuffed animal, you aren't a stuffed animal, you're a friend!!`
` Uuu--!!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` Instead of playing with stuffed animals, it's better to play outside with everyone!!`
` I'm bored with stuffed animals already!!`
` *giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"I hate you, Ange!!`
` Uu-!!`
` Why say something like that, hatehatehatehate!!`
` I hate you!!"`
`You're not my friend!!`
` I won't let you be one of us witches anymore...!!`
`Upon my name, the Apprentice Witch of Origins, MARIA,`
` I hereby expel the Apprentice Witch ANGE from the Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches...!!`
`......And then.`
`...What had been peaceful days to me became a daydream and ended.`
`By now, it's impossible to prove.`
`No one can verify whether that really was magic or whether those really were my friends,`
` or else nothing more than a daydream.`
`...I, the sole observer, concluded that they were a daydream.`
`...So that became the truth.`
`Perhaps, in the farther future, I'll observe it again, `
`and when that happens, maybe I'll acknowledge that it wasn't a dream, ...that the Seven Sisters really were my friends, and that along with Maria onee-chan and Sakutaro,`
` they did everything they could for me in my isolation.`
`......Something so vague is neither the truth nor an illusion.`
`Maybe the reality here and now is the only world with the real me.`
`Where is the real me?`
`The person standing amidst the girls' exposed wreckage that resembles broken glass sculptures,`
` that girl who's breathing harshly, her shoulders heaving, ...isn't me.`
`I'm...over there.`
`The me that's surrounded by a crowd and being showered by jeers...and who's hanging her head, her eyes red......`
`...Isn't the me over there...`
`...the real me...?`
`I won't dream anymore.`
`Because there's nowhere left to run.`
`I'm...going back.`
`...I'll return myself to the cage made of flesh...`
`"Hey!!`
` Are you listening to us?!`
` It's not like anything'll be resolved if you just stand there hanging your head, right?!"`
`"............`
`...I hear you."`
`"Ah, you finally answered.`
` You aren't thinking that this'll end if you stay silent, or that we'll forgive you if you cry, right?!`
` We're asking if you're aware!`
` We're asking if you're aware of the trouble you're causing those around you...!!"`
`......I...slowly nodded.`
`...I acknowledged it.`
`I acknowledged that I had slipped into the world of my daydream, trying to remain separate from the others in my class.`
`...To separate myself from and disgrace those Sisters who spoke to me with reliable and kind words,`
` despite being totally unable to help when I really wanted them to, `
`...I acknowledged that.`
`"...I, Ushiromiya Ange, do not have a cooperative attitude and caused trouble for my classmates.`
` There is nothing to blame for that except my excessive inferiority complex towards all of my classmates because of my inability to study.`
` And, ............"`
`"......It's a shame that I'm alive."`
`Starting there, I was no longer reading the paragraph they'd made me write.`
`...It was me...improvising.`
` And...it was what was in my heart.`
`They noticed that it wasn't what they'd anticipated,`
` but while they did frown, no one spoke.`
`So I continued.`
`"...That's right.`
` It's a shame that I lived.`
` ...I should've had them take me with them on that day in 1986.`
` ...And yet, I was the only one who wasn't taken."`
`"...Why am I here?`
` ...This isn't the world I'm supposed to be in.`
` ......No one will save me.`
` ...For a time, ...I felt as though only the fictional friends I created inside myself could save me.`
` But those friends were nothing more than a delusion, ...and they didn't save me at all.`
` After all, this isn't a world of imagination, but a world of reality."`
`"......So, in short, ...up until today, ...I've been having the same daydream.`
` ...I hated my real classmates and only lived by interacting with the friends in my mind.`
` ......Just now, I split up with those friends.`
` So I am here."`
`"......I have no family.`
` I've thrown my friends away too.`
` ...There's no longer anything left for me.`
` ...Why haven't I died?`
` Someone asked that a short while ago.`
` ...I think they're right.`
` Why......am I alive?`
` ......I should've died......in the year 1986.`
` ...No, I must really have died."`
`"And yet, ......my dead soul is still locked up inside this cage of flesh.`
` So I'll ask someone.`
` If no one answers, ...I'll do it myself."`
`'!s1`
`.........let me die."`
`I spoke that sentence...and looked around.`
`Dumbfounded girls.`
`Shocked girls.`
`Girls whose faces seemed to be saying 'What the heck is this kid talking about?'`
`And, a bit late, `
`more and more girls with faces that said 'Is this girl all right?'`
`*whisper*.`
` *chatter*.`
`And then, *giggle*.`
`......When I ordered the friends in my daydream to kill, they couldn't do it.`
`And so.`
`I asked real Humans to kill me, `
`...but of course, these girls can't do it either.`
`...In other words, both daydreams and reality are the same.`
`Doesn't this mean that, including this world...`
`......Absolutely everything is a daydream?`
`Then, ...there's no problem, right?`
`After all, ...on that day when I lost my family, I was already dead.`
`...Everything that happened afterwards is going on in my head, my life flashing before my eyes after I failed to die.`
`Once I understood that, ......it felt like the scenery surrounding me began to twist and bend slightly.`
`......Yeah.`
`...I'll finally......wake up.`
`...I'll be released from this daydream world.`
`I feel my consciousness sliding away.`
`...That's all right.`
`Fade farther and farther away......and take me to my family...`
`Then, no matter what happens in this twisted, stale world, I won't mind it at all.`
`I saw the crowd get pushed aside as a teacher stepped in.`
`Perhaps a teacher doing the rounds happened to notice a strange disturbance.`
`The teacher was vigorously shouting something, moving to protect me.`
`...Watching that, I knew that an ally had appeared for me, even if there was only one,`
` and I felt my awareness return very slightly.`
`.........`
`...The only ones who can save me in the world of reality...are real Humans.`
`Never again.`
` ...Never again will I seek rescue from daydreams.`
`......This is the world of Humans.`
`Nothing can save a Human...except other Humans...`
`".........`
`...I see.`
` If that's what you think, then that's your world, Ange."`
`『...Can Ange...`
`find happiness this way......?〝`
`"......If Ange believes that's the only way to find happiness, then it is the only way.`
` ...If she can't accept the blue bird in the cage for what it is, `
`...then she must go and search forever."`
`『Uryu...`
` ...Maria, are you...breaking off relations with Ange......?〝`
`".........`
`...No, nothing like that.`
` I only did that because that's what Ange wanted.`
` ...We witches are sometimes persecuted.`
` However, we always remain by everyone's sides.`
` ...And our aid can always be asked for."`
`『...Will the day come......when Ange will play with us once again...?〝`
`"Maybe. Or, she might forget, and it'll never come.`
` ...In the human world, we call that growing up and saying goodbye to your childhood self.`
` ......Still."`
`If Ange just remembers, we'll always be by her side.`
`...And until then, ...we'll be waiting.`
`...............`
`『.........Uryu...`
` ......Maria, ...answer me...〝`
`"............"`
`『......Uryu...`
`'!s1`
`a stuffed animal...?`
` ...I'm made of cloth and cotton, `
`...so there's no way I can...`
`talk...?`
` ...So, `
`...I can't talk to Maria......?〝`
`Sakutaro looked up at Maria sadly.`
`Maria's face was covered with tears, and it looked as though it had even lost all traces of sadness...`
`"......Uu-.`
` ...I hear you, Sakutaro.`
` ...You aren't a stuffed animal made of cloth and cotton.`
` ......You are...my friend.`
` ......I hate Ange.`
` ...Uuuuuuuuuuuu..."`
`『Uryu... Sorry, Maria. Sorry, Maria...!`
` Uryu...!〝`
`Sakutaro regretted doing that.`
`By freezing her heart, Maria had finally been able to escape from her sadness.`
`...By speaking up and calling her back, he'd caused her to be overwhelmed with sadness again...`
`Sakutaro tried hugging Maria, letting go of her,`
` and gazing at her uneasily, lost as to how he could bring Maria's spirits up.`
`...He might've looked a little humorous doing that.`
`In the end, that was enough to distract Maria from her sadness...`
`"Sorry.`
` ......Crying won't help anything anymore."`
`『You got in a fight with Ange, but you still have lots of friends, Maria...`
` I'm not the only one.`
` ......Everyone's here.`
` Sakusuke and Sakukichi, the animal band, and many, many more...〝`
`Maria looked at the many stuffed animals around her pillow, which were gathered together as though they were having an idle chat.`
`『...Everyone...is worried about you, Maria.`
` They're all talking over and over about how to cheer you up, okay...?〝`
`"............`
`...Everyone won't...go away...like Ange...?"`
`『They won't.`
` We'll always be together.〝`
`"......Really?`
` All of you are only with me at home.`
` We can't go out together when Mama's around, and we can't go to school."`
`『You aren't supposed to take us to school, so you'll get in trouble if the teacher finds out.`
` But if no one finds out, we can be together at any time.〝`
`"...Sakutaro, you're big, so you'd be found."`
`『Then you can take one of the kids that are small enough to walk around with.`
` ...For example, ...what about them?`
` If you take the friends in the forest band, `
`...look, they're small, so you can hide them in your pocket and go to school together.〝`
`"......There's a lot of them in the band.`
` I can't fit them all in my pocket."`
`She collected all of the forest band pieces that were scattered across her bed.`
`There were about as many of them as pieces in a chess set, so it'd probably be impossible to fit them all in her pocket...`
`『In that case, you can just take friends that you're especially close with.`
` ...You can take the four rabbits, your best friends in the forest band.〝`
`"...I could fit four in my pockets.`
` ...Yeah.`
` This way, they won't be found."`
`『Now, you won't be alone even at school, Maria.`
` Those kids will be with you even where I can't go.〝`
`"......Yeah.`
` ...Maybe...I won't be lonely that way.`
` ...Maybe I can hold out...until coming home from school..."`
`『As long as we aren't found by the teacher and Mama, we can be with you at any time.`
` So let's be together, play together forever.`
` We definitely won't leave you all alone, Maria.`
` Uryu!〝`
`Maria's expression finally regained a little of its brightness.`
`...That's right.`
`In the beginning, Maria's world didn't have Ange in it.`
`Even without Ange, it was fun with everyone.`
`And yet, strangely enough, it suddenly became sad without Ange, who had come in at the end.`
`...All that's happened is that I've returned to the world right before Ange entered it.`
`...So there's nothing to be sad about.`
`"...Yeah.`
` I'm not lonely.`
` Sakutaro and the others are with me."`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, sak_4e339:`
`"I won't let any more Humans come into my world.`
` ...Mariage Sorcière is an alliance between me and Beatrice only.`
` ...From the start, even Beatrice didn't want to let Ange join.`
` ......It's all right this way.`
` Ange was still too young."`
`『...For now, until you can be friends with Ange again, I think it's okay to forget about it.`
` You can play together once you've regained your high spirits, Maria.`
` Until then, all of us will be by your side.〝`
`"......Thank you.`
` ...Sakutaro, ...everyone."`
`Then, Maria once again regained her former world.`
`She regained the world that wasn't lonely, where she was surrounded by many friends.`
`Just like usual, she didn't have any Human friends at school, but her magic friends were always with her.`
`The rabbit band she hid in her pockets talked with her during class, sounding like they were having fun.`
`Just listening to that greatly embellished the time she spent in class.`
`Maria made it so that, as long as Mama and the teacher didn't find out, her other friends could always be with her.`
`When Mama told Maria to go play outside, Maria would secretly pack Sakutaro and Sakusuke and the rest into her bag and play together at the library or somewhere.`
`Even when Mama was late coming home and Maria went shopping for dinner, she always went with Sakutaro.`
`The man at the convenience store and the other people were nice to Sakutaro.`
`He sometimes gave a second portion free for Maria and Sakutaro.`
`When Mama found out, Maria would get in trouble for bringing Sakutaro and the rest outside.`
`When the teacher found out, Maria would get in trouble for bringing toys to school.`
`The toxin must be strong in Mama and the teacher.`
`That's why Sakutaro looks like a normal stuffed animal to them.`
`After all, the convenience store man and the others say hello to Sakutaro.`
`......Not all Humans are hopeless.`
`There are tons of people who, unlike Ange and Mama and teacher, can say hello to magic friends like I can...`
`"Oh, Maria-chan.`
` Welcome.`
` Was your Mama late coming home tonight too...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...But I've got Sakutaro, so I'm not lonely.`
` Right, Sakutaro?"`
`『Uryu.`
` It's not just Sakutaro today.`
` Some other friends came too.〝`
`"Oh, other friends, is it?`
` What kind of friends did you bring today?"`
`"Today, the rabbits from the forest band are also with me.`
` ...Look, in my pocket."`
`Maria began to line up four ceramic rabbit dolls on the register.`
`As the owner of the shop looked at it, smiling, he sent a signal to a part-timer with his chin.`
`Then, the sign on the other register that said 'closed' was taken down, and a voice called out for everyone to move over there.`
`All of the people in line behind Maria lined up behind that one...`
`"I see, I see.`
` You do have a lot of friends, Maria-chan.`
` But I hope your Mama comes home soon."`
`"Uu-.`
` Mama's busy with work again, so she's spending the night at the company.`
` It's been very busy lately.`
` ...She hasn't even been able to get much time to talk to me on the telephone.`
` But I'm not lonely!`
` I've got Sakutaro and the rest!`
` Right?"`
`『Uryu-!!〝`
`"I've even got all the rabbits from the band.`
` Look.`
` Kyu-kyu-♪"`
`"Is kyu-kyu- the sound a rabbit makes?`
` My, I've never heard that."`
`After smiling at Sakutaro, who was poking his head out of her knapsack,`
` she played around with the rabbit band on the register, making them frolic around.`
`Although the shop manager gazed at this pleasantly, he had slightly pitying look on his face.`
`...This was apparently a single mother household, where the mother had to work hard and couldn't come home very often.`
`On top of that, it looked like this girl didn't even have any friends.`
`As he watched her play around happily with her dolls and claim that she wasn't lonely despite everything,`
` he couldn't help but feel a kind of compassion.`
`And actually, this wasn't limited to him alone.`
`Maria had become quite famous in this shopping district...`
`"Maria-chan, you should eat some oden every once in a while.`
` If you don't eat your eggs and fish paste, you won't get big."`
`"Uu-?`
` Can't get a cream roll...?"`
`『Uryu.`
` If you don't eat certain things, you won't get big.`
` How about oden for today?〝`
`"Uu-.`
` ...Then I'll have some oden."`
`"Yep, yep, that's the ticket.`
` Why don't I stick a whole bunch in there?`
` Want mustard?"`
`『Uryu.`
` I can't handle spicy things...〝`
`"I see, I see.`
` Then, you make sure you don't let it spill on the way home.`
` It'll sure be delicious while it's hot."`
`"Uu-.`
` Thank you."`
`She had planned on getting some sweet pastries for dinner, but since oden had been recommended to her, she would be having that tonight instead.`
`Letting someone else determine the menu makes for an unexpected and interesting meal.`
`...Very often, Maria had to decide what her dinner would be on her own, so it was easy for the menus to get a little one-sided.`
` So, it felt fun to have a meal she hadn't anticipated...`
`『Uryu-!`
` Thanks for giving us extra, Mister!〝`
`"Send my regards to your other friends at home.`
` No stuffing yourself on your way back.`
` Go straight home and eat it there."`
`"Uu-!`
` Thanks Mister!!"`
`Maria raised the bag with the oden container high...`
`"............`
`......Huh...?"`
`『...Uryu?`
` What is it, Maria?〝`
`"......The key isn't in my pocket."`
`Standing in front of the door to her house, Maria searched all over her body.`
`...The key to the house wasn't there.`
`She always methodically put it in the same pocket.`
`So there was no way she had put it in another pocket, but she searched her whole body just in case.`
`...Unsurprisingly, it wasn't there.`
`『Did you drop it when you took your wallet out...?〝`
`"No.`
` When I took my wallet out, I definitely felt it.`
` I also felt it when I searched my pocket partway here.`
` ...It was there until partway.`
` I didn't drop it!`
` Uu-uu-uu-...!"`
`Even though the late autumn wind had been bearable when Maria had been thinking of returning home, where the heater was,`
` now that she was confused and had lost her key, that wind tormented her.`
`But no matter how hard she searched, she couldn't find her key.`
`She turned out all her pockets and even tried taking off her jacket and hitting it, but to no avail.`
`...Of course, she also turned the knapsack Sakutaro was in upside down, but the key didn't come out.`
`"......Uu-.`
` ......Uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`Something that should have been there...wasn't where it was supposed to be.`
`Why isn't the key there, when I didn't do anything wrong?`
`...Why isn't it?!`
`Why?!`
` Why...?!!!`
`Maria was cold and frustrated and angry, and she stamped on the ground...`
`The bottom of her foot throbbed, but that didn't lessen her frustration.`
`...At the same time, her tears poured out.`
`"...Uu-.`
` ...Uu-!!`
` Uuuu---!!"`
`It wasn't her fault.`
`So, it was someone else's fault.`
`But Maria didn't know who that someone was...and could do nothing but continue to let out a moan of anger.`
`『...Uryu...`
` I'm sure you dropped it partway...`
` Let's look for it, okay?`
` Let's return on the road we came by and search, okay...?〝`
`"...Uu-...`
` Even though I went to all the trouble of buying oden...and got eggs and stuff for free...`
` I won't be able to eat it while it's hot...`
` ......Uuuu----!!!"`
`『...Maria, ...I know it's frustrating, but let's search, okay...?`
` It's no one's fault, so let's search...〝`
`Maria finally lent an ear to Sakutaro's words and began to trod back down the road she had come on.`
`...The wind was colder than before, and it felt like it was blowing in through the corners of her jacket in a mean way...`
`『Uryu...`
` Let's watch our feet closely and search, okay...?`
` Then let's get home quickly, let the heater warm us up, and eat oden, all right?`
` I'm sure it'll be delicious.〝`
`"......Uu-.`
` ...Gone.`
` ...Uu-.`
` ...It's gone..."`
`As Sakutaro encouraged her, Maria searched for the key...`
`But she made it all the way back to the convenience store where she'd bought the oden.`
`...She hadn't found it.`
`Just in case, she asked the man at the convenience store whether they had found a dropped key,`
` but they hadn't found anything.`
`...One more time, she returned home, paying close attention to the area around her feet.`
`But, unsurprisingly, she didn't find it.`
`She was no longer frustrated enough to stomp her feet.`
`...But hot tears dripped down her face.`
`The oden had cooled down completely.`
`...Even though she had been told it would be delicious when warm, she hadn't been able to eat it.`
`...Even though that man had given her so much free stuff...`
`『...Uryu...`
` Don't cry...`
` ...Mama isn't coming back tonight.`
` ...Let's do our best and search...〝`
`"......Why can't I find it...?`
` ...Uuuu, ...uuuuuuuu!"`
`『Maria, don't cry...!`
` Let's do our best and search...!`
` ......Maria...〝`
`Maria was no longer able to hold back her tears.`
`Sobbing, she clutched Sakutaro and held the bag of oden, returning once more down the road she had come by.`
`Perhaps because more and more houses and stores had turned their lights off by now, it was even darker and harder to search than before.`
`...And, once again without finding the key, she returned to the convenience store.`
`"Maria-chan, `
`...still can't find your key...?"`
`"...Uu-...`
` ...My key... It's gone..."`
`"Wasn't your mother away for the night?`
` So, you can't get into your house without a key?"`
`"Uu-...`
` ...Can't get in..."`
`"Well, that's not good...`
` Did you try going to the police?`
` They might be able to help you."`
`"......Mama said not to talk to policemen, even if they start talking to me."`
`"Oh?`
` Well, why is that?"`
`"............"`
`It was probably because Rosa would be liable for making such a young girl like Maria watch over the house by herself,`
` and because she knew that this wasn't something that would be permitted by society.`
`So, Maria was indoctrinated into changing the stores she bought things at, so that she didn't catch the eyes of adults,`
` and into saying no more than a greeting to policemen, even if they talked to her.`
`Maria had obediently done as she was told.`
`Instead of considering why she must do that,`
` she was much more concerned with meekly obeying because her mother had told her so.`
`But the manager of the convenience store probably didn't think of it that way.`
`...In the first place, seeing such a young girl being forced to watch over the house alone, and so frequently, `
`...would make anyone worry...`
`...And then.`
`After making the round trip between her home and the store once more...and arriving at the convenience store for a third time...`
`...A policeman was there.`
`"It's that child.`
` ...Maria-chan, did you find your key?"`
`"......Uu-...`
` ...Didn't find it..."`
`"What's your name, miss?"`
`"........."`
`The policeman asked her name, but Maria didn't answer.`
`"Did your mother tell you not to talk to policemen?`
` Heheheh!`
` Don't worry, no need to be scared of me.`
` Have you eaten dinner yet, miss?"`
`"......I bought some, but I couldn't get into my house, so I couldn't eat it."`
`"What's your mother doing?`
` Is she not coming home tonight?`
` Is it her work?"`
`"......Uu-."`
`"Do you know how we can contact your mother at work?"`
`"........."`
`Maria hung her head limply.`
`...She didn't understand why the policeman was getting mad at her.`
`No, he probably wasn't getting mad at her, but if this reached her mother's ears, then she would definitely be in trouble.`
`Even if she didn't understand the reason why she would be in trouble, she at least understood that much.`
`But the policeman wouldn't let Maria go.`
`And her head was swimming from hunger.`
`The policeman noticed that, and it was decided that he'd listen to her story as they ate in the police box.`
`...Maria was taken to the police box.`
`She had her oden heated in a microwave oven, and even salty rice cakes and hot tea were brought out for her.`
`She had been told not to talk to policemen, `
`...but after being asked about Sakutaro, she responded, starting to feel that this wasn't a bad person.`
`...And anyway, she wouldn't be able to return home now, so she didn't know what to do.`
`......She told him Mama's work phone number, `
`...which she had been told to tell no one of and to use only in a very, very serious situation.`
`In the tatami room inside the police box, as she ate the oden that was so hot it felt like it would burn her,`
` she watched the policeman making the phone call, lazily thinking, ...'Aah, I'm probably gonna get in trouble'.`
`"......Will Mama...get mad at me......?"`
`『...Uryu......〝`
`He must have been listening to the phone ringing for a very long time.`
`With the receiver up to his ear, the policeman looked up at the clock, grumbling.`
`"......Maybe they aren't picking up because their business hours are over.`
` ...Hmmmmmm.`
` ...Huh?`
` Hello?`
` Hello?`
` Is this Anti-Rosa Ltd.?`
` This is the Komatsugawa Police Department police box in front of Senbonzakura Station.`
` Is President...umm...Udaikan...no, wait, President Ushiromiya available?`
` ......Yes.`
` ...What?`
` She's on vacation?"`
`"Yes.`
` Starting yesterday, the president has been on a three-day vacation.`
` Umm, is there some business you have with her...?"`
`"Oh no, no, no, never mind.`
` So, do you know where she might be?`
` You haven't heard where to contact her, have you?"`
`"Sure, ...could you hold on for a second?`
` ......Hey, anyone heard where the president went for her vacation?`
` Or how to contact her?"`
`"I heard she was going for all-you-can eat crabs in Sapporo with her boyfriend.`
` Aaaw, I'm sure such a cold place will do wonders for shrinking the distance between them, don't you?`
` I haven't heard how to contact them."`
`"Yep, understood.`
` ...Um, hello.`
` I hear she went to Sapporo, but I'm not sure about how to reach her.`
` ...Should I take a message?"`
`"Hmm, I see, what a shame.`
` Well then, if you manage to get in touch with her again, could you tell her that we called?`
` Sure, yes."`
`...After that, I was taken to the police department, which was even bigger,`
` and ended up spending the night there.`
`Then, they asked me various things about myself.`
`A lady who called herself the district welfare officer came by and asked about a lot of things.`
`And I was told 'You poor thing'.`
`When I heard that, I learned for the first time.`
`"......Am I......a poor thing...?"`
`『...Uryu...`
` That's not true, ...you're happy, Maria...〝`
`"......Uu-..."`
`Then, ...Rosa came back.`
`Maria was told to go to her room,`
` ...but on her way back from the bathroom, she hid by the entrance to the living room and listened in on the exchange.`
`The person who had come to visit...was the female district welfare officer who had asked Maria various questions on that other day.`
`"You can't be so pushy!!`
` Maria's heart is too innocent and delicate, so if there was an insensitive kid there, she could be hurt!!`
` Please stop your pointless meddling!!"`
`"But in that case, Miss,`
` if the child is so delicate, why leave her home all alone?`
` Shouldn't a mother be together with her child?"`
`"I am together with her as much as I should be!!`
` I don't need to take instructions from you for something like that...!!"`
`"Oh, really?`
` She's very well known in this area.`
` They say your daughter frequently goes out at night to buy things and eat.`
` Everyone was worried and looking out for her."`
`"How do you know that was my child?!!`
` There's got to be plenty of children around this town, right?!!`
` Don't just suddenly decide that it's my Maria!!`
` Kids sometimes walk around outside at night, right?!`
` How can you prove that they were all my child?!"`
`"It's well-known around the shopping center...that a girl holding a lion stuffed animal often stops by to eat dinner and buy things.`
` Everyone treated Maria-chan with care out of concern for her.`
` Sometimes, people even escorted her home, thinking the night roads might be dangerous, you see?"`
`"Y-You can find lion stuffed animals anywhere!!`
` It was none of their business, escorting her home!!`
` Are they thinking of kidnapping Maria?!`
` Don't bother her!!`
` Maria is my child.`
` I am raising her!`
` I have no intention of putting her in some strange institution!!`
` Stop your needless meddling!!"`
`『U-Uryu...`
` Does that lion stuffed animal...`
`mean me...?〝`
`"...It's okay.`
` I'm the one in trouble...`
` It has nothing to do with you, Sakutaro..."`
`Maria hugged Sakutaro, continuing to watch her mother fearfully...`
`"I-I also wish I could be with Maria every day!`
` But I'm a single mother, so I have to work!`
` I may not look it, but I'm a president of a company, and I bear responsibility for my employees' well-being!!`
` I'm busy with my work all year round, so there's no time for me to rest!!"`
`"Reeally?`
` But you've been on vacation these last three days, haven't you?"`
`"I-I have not been on vacation!`
` I've stayed at my company all night, working!!`
` There's a mountain of matters to be taken care of that the other unreliable employees can't handle!!"`
`"Why are you lying like that?`
` Someone from your company said that you were taking a three-day vacation, you see?`
` You went to Hokkaido with your boyfriend, right?`
` Leaving your daughter by herself for three whole days...!"`
`"I-I don't know anything about this boyfriend I don't know anything about Hokkaido!!!`
` Where are you getting this nonsense?!`
` Why, why?!`
` Do you have any proof?!`
` What the hell, don't just start butting in on someone else's family matters!!`
` I love Maria I have my own way of loving her so just keep your mouth shut!!`
` I didn't go on a vacation I was just working the whole time!!"`
`"I was trying to finish things up at work with all my strength, all my strength because I wanted to see Maria as soon as I could!!`
` I stayed at the company the whole whole whole whole, whole whole whole whole time!!`
` I don't know I don't know I don't know anything about Hokkaido don't just go ahead and say something like thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!!!`
` Just get out!!`
` Get ooooooooout!!`
` What's wrong with yoooooouuu?!!`
` Get out!!`
` Get ooooooooouuuut!!!"`
`Rosa raged, her hair flying wildly.`
`A teacup was knocked over from the force of her standing up,`
` but far louder than that was the sound of her beating the table with both hands.`
`When faced with this rage that could accurately be described as wide-eyed derangement,`
` the district welfare officer couldn't help but be taken aback.`
`...And the same went for Maria, who was secretly watching this from the hallway.`
`She had already seen her mother in a rage several times before this.`
`But she had never seen her this crazed with anger.`
`When she saw this, Maria was sure.`
`...This was no longer her mother.`
`It was some other evil being that was possessing her mother's body...`
`And then, she herself was discovered by the evil being.`
`Maria knew that she was being reflected in the evil being's eyes.`
`Her mind went blank, and she felt as though her field of vision was racing off into the distance...`
`After fiercely closing in on Maria, Rosa mercilessly slapped her on her small shoulders...`
`and dropped her gaze towards the stuffed animal Maria was holding, Sakutaro.`
`"......Maria,`
` even though I told you so many times not to take that outside, `
`...you brought it with you, didn't you?"`
`『...U-Uryu......`
` I-It isn't Maria's fault...`
` I told her to take me...〝`
`"Th-That's not true...!`
` I brought Sakutaro on my own because I was lonely...!`
` So Mama, it isn't Sakutaro's fault...!!"`
`『Uryu, ...Maria......〝`
`"It's not Sakutaro's fault!!`
` It's not Sakutaro's fault!!"`
`Instead of Maria, the brunt of Rosa's anger was aimed at the lion stuffed animal Maria was holding.`
`...A girl went shopping in the middle of the night, always clutching a lion stuffed animal.`
`Because of that, she had become well known in the shopping center...`
`'!s1`
`...D...`
`Didn't I tell you not to take stuffed animals with yooooooooouuu?!!!`
` Why...`
`can't you...`
`listen to what Mama says?!!`
` Why?!`
` Why, why?!`
` Why can't you follow Mama's ruuuuuuules?!!"`
`With every single word, she stamped her heel and banged furiously on the wall.`
`...Of course, she didn't make direct contact with Maria.`
`However, the violence of the harsh sound certainly beat against her.`
`"M-Miss, ...stop that...!!"`
`"Let go!!`
` I said let go, damn iiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`The district welfare officer had come back to her senses and was pinning Rosa's arms behind her back.`
`But the instant Rosa was touched, she went wild, furiously throwing the welfare officer off.`
`...She hit the table and fell to the ground.`
`A teacup on the table smashed on the floor, making a violent sound...`
`『...M-Maria didn't do anything wrong...!`
` It's my fault!`
` So don't scold Maria...!!〝`
`"I'm the one who brought Sakutaro...!!`
` It's not Sakutaro's fault!!`
` It's not Sakutaro's fault!!`
` So don't look at Sakutaro with those scary eyes!!`
` Don't look at hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiim!!"`
`『Don't scold Maria...!`
` Don't scold Maria...!!`
` Uryuu--!!!〝`
`".........Y-You...`
` What were you doing just now, and a minute ago too?`
` Do you also play with dolls like that...outside?`
` Did you do it in front of the people in the store...?`
`'!s0`
`So that's why they remembered yoooooooou, `
`die you brainless moron!! Why are you such a dumbaaaaaaaaaaaassss?!!!"`
`"Answer me honestly.`
` When you went out, you always walked around with that stuffed animal without telling Mama, right?"`
`『......U-Uryu......〝`
`"Stop using that weird stuffed animal talk!!!`
` Speak with your own words, not a stuffed animal's!!!"`
`"S-Sakutaro isn't a stuffed animal!!`
` He's my friend!!`
` Don't call him a stuffed animal...`
` Doooooooooooooooooooon't!!"`
`"Yeah, yeah, I get it, it was called Sakutarou, was it?!`
` You took him with you all the time when you went shopping, without telling Mama, right?"`
`"...Y-Yeah......"`
`Maria admitted it honestly.`
`If she hadn't admitted it, then Sakutaro would have said something to take the blame,`
` so by admitting it right away, she was protecting her small friend.`
`"Only Sakutarou?`
` Any others?`
` ...You haven't been bringing weird things to school too, have you...?"`
`"...M-Miss!!`
` Surely your daughter has done nothing wrong!`
` Stop this interrogation at once!"`
`"You, stay quiet!!!`
` I'm talking with my daughter, aren't I?!!!`
` ...Come on, Maria, look at Mama when you talk.`
` What's the answer to Mama's question?"`
`"...U-Uu-...`
` ...It wasn't just Sakutaro.`
` ...All the rabbits were with me too..."`
`"......Do you have them with you now...?"`
`"Uu-......"`
`Maria fished around in her pockets,`
` ...pulling out four ceramic rabbits with her tiny hand...`
`The rabbits were her close friends, who could be together with her at school in Sakutaro's place.`
`But when Rosa saw that, she shook her head slightly as though dizzy...`
`On a school notice, it had been written that Maria was apparently bringing toys to school and playing with them,`
` and her family was instructed to try and prevent this.`
`But Rosa had rejected that, blaming the teacher and phoning in a protest of her own to the school.`
`...Saying that there was no way her child would bring toys to school.`
`For nearly an hour, she had shouted at the vice principal to stop making false accusations about her daughter.`
`...To a certain degree, those at the school had grasped that Maria was a pitiful girl.`
`They knew that the small toys she brought in were her only friends.`
`...So they had done their best to overlook it.`
`But when the other students caught sight of them,`
` some of the boys had started complaining that only she could bring toys, and the school had racked their brains on how to cope with this...`
`They had tried to gently send a warning by way of the mother,`
` but after Rosa's overreaction, even Maria's teacher decided to overlook it.`
`......But now Rosa knew.`
`She had been the one who was wrong, ...and her daughter really had been bringing toys to school.`
`......And those at the school...`
`had known that she was a disgrace who brought toys to school and played with them as though they were her only friends.`
`To Rosa, who thought her daughter was just a little different from normal children,`
` having this peculiar side of her daughter exposed and found fault with was, more than anything else, something she couldn't bear.`
`......So she howled.`
`She raged.`
`The district welfare officer tried to cut between Rosa and Maria again,`
` but she only met with Rosa's wrath once more.`
`'!s0`
`and when even that failed to curb her anger, she stomped on the ground over and over again so forcefully that it seemed she might break through the floor.`
`Then, after seeming to come back to her senses for a second, `
`......she immediately froze her harsh breathing...and asked Maria.`
`".........`
`...Maria.`
` Those rabbits in the band, are they your close friends?"`
`"......U-Uu-......"`
`"I see.`
` Isn't it great that you have a full four friends?"`
`As she said that, Rosa grabbed one of the rabbits from Maria's hand.`
`Then, she shoved it in front of Maria's eyes so she could see it very well.`
`...The cute rabbit holding a trumpet was a small doll like a chess piece.`
`She slowly lifted it into the air.`
`...Of course, Maria's and Sakutaro's eyes also followed it...`
`And then, with a speed that the eye couldn't follow, she smashed it against the wall.`
`『......!!!〝`
`She had half imagined that this worst possible thing might happen.`
`So she instantly realized what had been done.`
`...So, Maria let out a short, despairing scream...`
`It was in pieces.`
`It had been small and sturdy, but that hadn't been enough to withstand her mother's fierce rage.`
`"......Because you didn't listen to what Mama told you, I broke one of them.`
` From now on, every time you disobey something Mama says, I'll break another one.`
` ...Remember that!!!"`
`"Miss, ...you think to call yourself a mother after doing something like that?!!`
` You think you can do something like that and not hurt your daughter?!"`
`"Hurt Maria?!`
` I'm also hurting, right?!`
` Who's gonna take responsibility for my wounds?!`
` Weeeell?!`
` Who iiiiiiiiiis?!!!`
` Didn't I tell you to shut uuuuup!!!"`
`"S-Stop it, Mama...!`
` It's my fault...!`
` Don't get mad at this lady...!"`
`『It isn't Maria's fault, ...it's mine...!`
` Don't get mad at Maria...!`

` So give him back!!`
` Give him baaaaaaaack!!"`
`...For some reason, my frantic request just added oil to the fire of Mama's anger...`
`Mama pushed my arm aside as I tried to grab Sakutaro and snatch him back,`
` and in a bizarre way, she stuck her fingernails on both hands deep into Sakutaro, twisting him...`
`The red muffler, which I had carefully wrapped for him every day, came off and fell to the floor...`
`...Sakutarou, who had been so, so precious to me...`
`...Was twisted, smashed, torn at with fingernails so much...`

`his face curving...`
`in sadness......`

`found a stitch on the neck......`

` No `
`no `
`no!!`

`@:dwave_eng 0, mar_4e1030:`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!"`
`"Give it up...!!`
` There is no magic to revive Sakutarou...!`
` Despite that, you must strongly believe that Sakutarou will continue to exist as your close friend...!!`
` That power will become magic...!"`
`"That's not magic, that's not magic!!`
` You have to bring Sakutaro back to life...!!`
` You can't do it because Mama made him herself?`
` Why did Mama make Sakutaro?`
` It was to give him to me as a present, right?`
` It was to make him my friend, right?`
` So why...did Mama make it herself...and break it herself?`
` Why did Mama give birth to it by herself, and try to break it herself?`
` I don't understand, I don't understand!!"`
`"I hate Mama, hate Mama...!!`
` Can't stand it can't stand it too sad too sad...!!`
` Wanna smash Mama up like she did to Sakutaro...!`
` Wanna stick my fingernails in and tear her, turn her into cloth and cotton!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!`
` I can't stand it, I can't stand it, Beatriiice!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, Sakutaroooooooo!!!!"`
`From the darkness behind Maria's back, two massive jet-black arms crept out,`
` twisting around Maria as she sobbed in anger.`
`Then, massive fingernails stuck into Maria's chest and stomach...`
`Maria could not see that.`
`...But Beato could.`
`Anger and sadness without any place to go will tear you apart.`
`...Beato knew that.`
`She could see that.`
`Yes.`
` ...In the end, those massive arms were Maria's own.`
`Those fingernails slowly started to eat into her chest and stomach...`
`...With their immense size and strength, `
`those arms could probably tear Maria into bits easily...`
`But Maria herself couldn't notice.`
`Drowning in a sea of her own tears, ...she couldn't notice that her own arms were trying to tear apart her own chest...`
`"I can't stand it, can't stand it...!!!`
` If Sakutaro can't be brought back to life no matter what, ...I want revenge!!`
` Want to make Mama meet the same end!!`
` Want her to meet the same end as Sakutaro...!`
` Beatrice!!`
` Teach me magic for that!!`
` Teach me magic to beat Mama...!!"`
`"............`
`...Is that truly how you feel?"`
`"Kill Mama!!`
` I'll kill her!!`
` No, that isn't Mama!`
` It's the bad witch possessing Mama!`
` I'll kill the witch Mama!!`
` Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!"`
`".........`
`...Very well.`
` I shall give you that power.`
` ...For tearing you and your beautiful heart apart, `
`...for giving you that pain, it is fitting that your heartless mother be torn apart considerably."`
`"......I shall teach it to you.`
` ...I shall teach you of the abyss in the world of witches, of the depths where no light reaches..."`
`"Uuuuuuuu, Sakutaro, Sakutaro...!!`
` Hate, hate, I haaaate everyone!!`
` I hate Mama too, Ange too!!`
` I hate everyone, everyooone!!`
` Uuuuuuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`I had planned on taking a nap, ...but the boat really was shaking bad.`
`I gave up on sleeping and went up onto the deck.`
`There, I was welcomed by the shining sun and a strong sea breeze...`
`Amakusa had been doing some stretches on the deck.`
`...He must have a lot of time on his hands too.`
`After all, it'll be several more hours before we reach Niijima.`
`It would only have taken a couple dozen minutes by airplane, but there was the chance that the Niijima airport was under the Sumadera family's web.`
`The harbor would probably be the same.`
`For that reason, I had obtained a boat that would let me land while avoiding the harbor, no questions asked.`
`I'd bumped into a cheery boat captain,`
` plied him generously, and he had decided to help me out, amused...`
`"Still gonna be a while?"`
`"I just asked the captain, and it sounds like it'll take a full two hours more.`
` Well, beggars can't be choosers."`
`"......The weather sure is nice.`
` Feels like I'll burn."`
`"Going to read on the deck?`
` You'll damage your book."`
`Amakusa apparently thought this because I was clutching Maria onee-chan's diary under my arm.`
`I'd been reading it half asleep, which was why I'd come back up still clutching it.`
`"How's it going?`
` Think you'll be able to find the truth of Rokkenjima from Maria-san's diary?"`
`"......Who knows.`
` No matter how much I investigate what happened on that island, it won't make for anything more than a theory.`
` There's no truth written in the message bottle or Onee-chan's diary, just a fairy tale with a witch walking around.`
` ...I'm stuck."`
`"Looks like you've got nothing to look forward to except questioning those involved on Niijima."`
`"I imagine the Witch Hunters have showered them with questions over and over, so I'm pretty sure I won't find any new facts."`
`"Hehhaha...!`
` So even though your hopes are that low, you're willing to spend a half-day trip on a boat to go to Niijima anyway! Talk about fickle."`
`"......It's like a journey of self-satisfaction, so that I can say 'I investigated'.`
` I'm not so naive as to seriously think that the truth of 12 years ago will be revealed."`
`"And when you're done with your self-satisfaction trip, what'll you do next?"`
`"Who knows.`
` I haven't thought about it.`
` ......I'll go to Niijima, ask some people who were involved.`
` ...Then, after going to Rokkenjima in the end and leaving some flowers, my journey will be over."`
`......Several days have already passed since this journey began.`
`After being told by Bernkastel on the roof of that building to search for the truth of 12 years ago, `
`I'd left on a journey like trying to grasp a cloud.`
`At the time, I felt as though I'd experienced something mystical...and had the feeling that I might be able to grasp some kind of miracle at the end of this journey.`
`...But after several days passed, my excitement died down.`
`On that day, when I stood on the roof of that skyscraper, my heart was completely cornered and dead.`
`...So I'd wanted from the bottom of my heart to be released from the cage of my body and rise into the sky...`
`and had crossed the fence in order to die.`
`Maybe experiencing the desire to die and actually stepping forwards, throwing my body down...`
`caused some kind of mystical experience inside my head, making me think I had received a message from a witch.`
`......The excitement from my jump lessened over time, and the more I came back to my senses, the more this journey lost its meaning.`
`But I didn't even consider suspending this journey just because of that.`
`If I stop this journey, it'll mean acknowledging that the message from that witch was an illusion.`
`And I felt as though that meant throwing away the promise the witch made...`
`and any chance that someone from my family might come back.`
`So, because it was hard to believe that those events were an illusion, I've continued on my journey.`
`I don't seriously believe that this journey will change anything.`
`...It's even up to me when to end this journey.`
` It's up to me to choose where the final destination is.`
`In the end, this journey is only for my self-satisfaction...`
`"......Self-satisfaction, huh?`
` It sounds bad when you say it, but I think that's actually what life is all about."`
`"...Oh?`
` If that's the answer you've reached after hovering over the line between life and death in the mercenary business, that's probably pretty deep."`
`"Don't take it so lightly.`
` What I'm trying to say...is that the only one who can acknowledge you in this world is you yourself."`
`Amakusa continued stretching as he spoke.`
`In an irritatingly fresh way.`
`Hearing it told to me as though from a teacher made me instinctively want to resist, but what he was saying was extremely sensible.`
`".........`
`...That may be true.`
` People work hard when they want to be acknowledged by someone.`
` ...In most cases, that someone is their parents.`
` Children learn how to work hard because they want to be praised by their parents.`
` ......Although that's why I never learned."`
`"Sorry, that's not how I meant it.`
` ...What I'm trying to say is that there's nothing wrong with self-satisfaction.`
` No matter who praises you, it's meaningless unless you can accept it.`
` ...Turning it around, even if no one praises you, that doesn't matter as long as you can accept it."`
`"......Self-satisfaction tends to contradict a desire to improve oneself, so we're usually taught that it's bad.`
` Somehow, your argument seems like a pretty fresh take on it, Amakusa."`
`"The anguish of the human world comes when you want someone to acknowledge you, but you don't know what it is you should be striving for.`
` I had a time like that too.`
` I wanted to be acknowledged by someone, but I didn't know what I wanted them to acknowledge about me.`
` And since I didn't know what to strive for or how far I should go to be acknowledged,`
` I did a lot of crazy things."`
`"And the answer you reached...was self-satisfaction?"`
`"It sounds bad, but that's how it is.`
` Rich is the one who is content with what they are, they say."`
`"......If I'm satisfied with my life, it doesn't matter what other people say.`
` It's the same for your life, and for this journey.`
` No one has any right to criticize you other than you yourself, Ange-san."`
`"You're the only one who determines the meaning and results of your journey.`
` If it's been a meaningful journey for you, then that's more than enough."`
`".........`
`......I always did take you for a flippant ladies man, but you really do say weird things every once in a while.`
` I'll bet you think saying stuff like that will make you popular."`
`"Of course not, of course not.`
` That's not how I meant it at all.`
` ......Looks like you want to be alone.`
` I'll head over to see the boat captain.`
` Please, take it easy."`
`Amakusa apparently decided I was in a bad mood.`
`...Although I didn't feel that way myself.`
`Or, he might have finished a set of stretches and wanted to cool off in the shade.`
`The sea winds were strong, but not enough to cool the rays of the sun.`
`Amakusa disappeared.`
`Only I remained.`
`"......Self-satisfaction is life itself, huh?"`
`"That's just boring.`
` Life is nothing without greed."`
`I noticed that Mammon had suddenly appeared, her abundant hair fluttering over by the prow of the ship.`
`"It's true that a life of greed would be fun.`
` But unlike you, Humans have a limited life-span.`
` If greed is eternal, that means a person will have desires even in the last moment before they die.`
` Having desires means there's something that you want.`
` Something you don't have, some way you aren't complete."`
`"...I'm sure it's tough to die when you can't think of your life as being a full one.`
` So I'm sure self-satisfaction is necessary."`
`"......I see.`
` Because of the existence of a life span, you have to compromise like that?`
` All of my masters had very long life spans, so I've never thought of it."`
`"I wonder if Humans live for the purpose of becoming satisfied.`
` ...If so, it's probably easiest to live without desires.`
` ...I see, so that's why greed is one of the seven deadly sins."`
`"*giggle*`
` Your praise honors me."`
`Apparently that counted as a compliment in Mammon's eyes.`
`She turned and gave a graceful bow.`
`"Ange-sama,`
` do Humans live so that they can find satisfaction at the moment of their deaths?"`
`"...Wouldn't it be pretty tough if you felt you were lacking something when you died?"`
`"If so, then Humans live only so that they can meet a satisfying death.`
` They live so that they can have a better death.`
` They live so that they can die."`
`......This kid's saying something pretty incredible.`
`...I see, as I'd expect from a demon stake.`
`However, it might be the truth.`
`Humans suffer because they aren't satisfied...and live only to find satisfaction.`
`In other words, that might be the same as a desire to die satisfied.`
`"I can't counter that.`
` ...People live in order to be satisfied.`
` And they hope to die that way.`
` So, it's really painful when you don't know how to find that satisfaction."`
`"Just how can you find something like that?`
` In a Human's life."`
`"......By being acknowledged.`
` By hearing someone say 'You are happy'."`
`"If it doesn't matter who acknowledges them, then I'll do it."`
`"Yeah, that's the problem.`
` ......People don't know who needs to acknowledge them."`
`"So, searching for this person who can acknowledge them is the journey of their life?`
` Hmmmm."`
`"It sounds strange.`
` Whether you're acknowledged or not, it supposedly doesn't change your circumstances.`
` ...And yet, if you are acknowledged, you will be satisfied, while if you aren't, then you won't.`
` ...It's almost like the blue bird.`
` ...Because you can't notice the blue bird even though it's already in the cage, you have to go out on a journey searching everywhere."`
`"What the heck.`
` Kyahhahaha.`
` Human lives sure are stupid."`
`"That's right.`
` Amakusa said something really good.`
` ...Rich is the one who is content with what they are, ...was it?`
` I don't know where that proverb came from, but it's deep.`
` ...Basically, if you can't find enough satisfaction unless someone else acknowledges you, that's the same as not acknowledging yourself.`
` ...The ultimate in self-fulfillment is acknowledging yourself."`
`"That's right.`
` Because, if you can 'know' that you're fully satisfied, there's no need to be acknowledged by anyone.`
` Just by taking notice of the small things, the Humans' foolish journey of life can be ended easily.`
` You can spend the rest of your life playing and having a good time.`
` A Human's life is so ridiculous, kyahhahahaha!"`
`Mammon's choice of words was bad, but it was surely the truth.`
`If most of a Human's life is a journey with the hopes that someone will acknowledge them, `
`so that they can achieve a satisfied death...`
`......Then when they realize that the person doing the acknowledging isn't someone else, but they themselves, that pointless journey can end.`
`Humans who have ended that journey can probably spend the rest of their lives as they wish, with their heads held high.`
`How noble, how praiseworthy would that be...`
`"You know, `
`it seems Amakusa's on pretty bad terms with his parents.`
` ...That makes sense.`
` Any decent parents would want him to get the hell out of the trade he's in."`
`"Does that really matter though?`
` As long as it's fun for the person in question."`
`"......Exactly.`
` That's what it comes down to in the end.`
` Criticism formed by the observations of other people doesn't matter.`
` If your existence is firmly acknowledged by you yourself, that's enough.`
` ...If you can live with confidence in yourself, you'll surely be able to accept and be satisfied with any kind of lifestyle."`
`"I'm sure Amakusa will eventually eat a stray bullet on the battlefield and get seriously injured.`
` ...He might even die.`
` But I don't think he'd view that as something unfair.`
` I'm sure he'd cackle about how that's also part of life."`
`"What a great way to live.`
` I could fall for the guy."`
`"...Pitiful Humans who can't acknowledge themselves...`
`wander about searching for that their whole lives, and without anything being accepted, they do nothing but grumble and die while still unsatisfied.`
` ...How pitiful.`
` Compared to people whose lives drag on without any purpose,`
` Amakusa is more likely to eventually die by the roadside, but I think he's much more noble for living his life with his head held high."`
`"Aren't the winners in life those who achieve enlightenment?`
` If they can do that even a little sooner, they'll be able to live that much more of their life effectively."`
`......With Mammon's words, `
`...I finally accepted a certain fact.`
`In the past, ...I've called that girl unusual, a little strange.`
`However, `
`...that wasn't true.`
`All she did was keep her head held high...`
`...and finish that journey faster than anyone else.`
`".........Maybe that's what made Maria onee-chan...so amazing.`
` When she was at the age where she might or might not enter the first year of elementary school, she had already reached that point."`
`For people like us, looking at her life from the outside, it wasn't something we'd call blessed.`
`But even though days like that were engraved in her diary,`
` ...they always finished up by saying that it was a happy day.`
`Even though the part of her mother that didn't love her daughter came and went, `
`she believed that her mother loved her.`
`The mother's love that didn't exist, she created herself, filling her world with love.`
`Others might observe her as an unsatisfied, pitiful girl,`
` ...but she herself acknowledged that she was satisfied.`
`And so, she was happy that way.`
`It's easy to observe that as something pitiable and sad.`
`But to her, that was an outsider's opinion, so it didn't matter.`
`'Whether or not it was happy for her'...was the only important thing.`
`It's just like how, when people who live in the city point to the lifestyles of those in rural areas,`
` and mourn their inconvenience and feel sympathy for them, it's really none of their business.`
`If those who live there are satisfied with what they have, that's more than enough.`
`"......I've finally noticed something.`
` I noticed it just now.`
` ...I did something horrible to Maria onee-chan.`
` ......And to you all and Sakutarou as well, on that day."`
`"............"`
`"Whether magic exists...or not.`
` ...That's not up to other people to decide.`
` It's up to you yourself.`
` Whether magic exists to Maria onee-chan is a problem for Maria onee-chan to decide, not me."`
`"...And yet, when I was young, on that day, I said it.`
` By saying there was no way magic exists, ...I hurt her."`
`The fact that magic doesn't exist in my eyes...matters in my world.`
`But denying it even in Onee-chan's world for that reason was totally misguided.`
`"Mariage Sorcière is the Witches' Alliance Maria onee-chan created.`
` I was invited into it...and told to become a witch with them."`
`"Thinking it a new, interesting game, I went along with that for a while.`
` ...But, because of the cruelty of youth,`
` I got tired of it half-way through.`
` And, ...I tore her pure heart apart with sharp words."`
`"...At that time, we must've gotten into a huge fight.`
` I forgot about it right away, but she couldn't forget about it.`
` ...After all, to her, magic was a natural power that really existed,`
` and she believed that she'd be able to share it with me."`
`"...To Maria onee-chan, `
`magic is a power that can interpret the world as blessed...no, which can truly make everything blessed.`
` She just wanted to share that with me too.`
` The young me tore that feeling apart.`
` ...So, she closed herself up in a shell, assuming that she wouldn't be able to share her magic with anyone."`
`"......If that's true, then Lady MARIA's journey through life wasn't over after all.`
` If she'd been able to accept herself, then there'd be no need to collapse just because you denied her, Ange-sama."`
`"Onee-chan was young.`
` She still hadn't reached a philosophical viewpoint like Amakusa.`
` ...Yeah, now I understand...`
` That's why the witches' alliance called Mariage Sorcière was necessary."`
`——An alliance where each acknowledges that the other is a witch.`
`"...That's right, I'm pretty sure that was the first article in the agreement of Mariage Sorcière.`
` ...Witches of the alliance would acknowledge each other and respect each other.`
` That's the deepest and only meaning of the witches' alliance..."`
`Maria onee-chan wanted to share with me the secret laws to make the world happy, called magic.`
`But I was young.`
`And she was too.`
`...I hurt her with innocent cruelty.`
`"......On that day, I said...cruel things.`
` To you all and Sakutarou.`
` I said there was no way you exist."`
`"How rude.`
` We acknowledge that we exist ourselves.`
` We're not like Humans, with their souls half-asleep.`
` ...'I think, therefore I am'.`
` Whether you acknowledge or deny magic, the existence of the magic called the Seven Stakes of Purgatory...is a fact.`
` ...As long as we acknowledge it ourselves, to borrow your words."`
`"It truly would be violence for another person like me to deny it.`
` ......I'm sure that'd be like having your true mother yell 'I wish you had never been born'...`
`no, 'Disappear'."`
`...Even after being slammed by all those words,`
` ...Maria onee-chan's magic...`
`...made her believe in her mother's love.`
`Sakutarou, her magic friend, always encouraged her.`
`...He kept saying that her mother loved her, that she was coming home late because of her work,`
` and that she would definitely bring back a present...`
`Even after Maria learned that her mother's work wasn't really the cause, magic allowed her to continue believing.`
`And by believing that her mother loved her, by acknowledging herself,`
` she filled her world with love and peace and serenity, ...establishing it completely.`
`"What happened 12 years ago, ...what happened to my family...`
` ...This was never...a journey to search for that."`
`"......Then what kind of journey is this?"`
`"It was a journey...to apologize to Maria onee-chan for what happened that day."`
`"............"`
`"I don't know why, but that's what I think.`
` ...If I hadn't hurt her,`
` ......the incident 12 years ago might not have occurred.`
` ...That's what I think."`
`I have no basis for it.`
`I don't have a clue how hurting Onee-chan could be connected with that mysterious incident several years later.`
`But, for some reason, I can't imagine that there's no connection.`
`A witch caused that incident.`
`And the culprit is the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
`And Beatrice was part of the Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches.`
`I horribly hurt the other witch of that alliance.`
`I hurt her with the thought that magic doesn't exist.`
`......So, several years later, a crime caused by a witch occurred,`
` and a two-day period that couldn't be explained with anything but magic was thrust in my face, thanks to the message bottle.`
`"...There's no way I wasn't involved somehow.`
` ......I don't get it.`
` It could be coincidence, or it could be fate.`
` ......For some reason, I've starting thinking like that on this journey."`
`"And what's your basis for it?"`
`"I have none.`
` I just think it's true."`
`"Hmmmm...`
` The Japanese sure are interesting.`
` Even when they're the victim, they feel as though they did something wrong and apologize for no reason.`
` ...I could understand if you said 'I hate Beatrice for stealing my family!' or something,`
` but you really are weird, feeling guilty for no reason and apologizing."`
`"Of course I hate Beatrice.`
` I couldn't continue this journey without that feeling.`
` But it's okay to choose yet another purpose for this journey.`
` There's nothing wrong with adding on a goal of apologizing for past sins, in addition to getting revenge on a witch for what happened 12 years ago.`
` I can at least go to Rokkenjima, apologize for my reckless remarks, and offer flowers."`
`"...No, ......there's something better than flowers.`
` And I think that would be more fitting for Onee-chan."`
`I stood up, not minding that the sea breeze scattered my hair, and concentrated my mind...`
`I lifted my palm up to the height of my head...and imagined a vast space...`
`"......Ange-sama, ........."`
`"...Be quiet.`
` .........`
`...Come, arise.`
` ...I am the witch apprentice, ANGE Beatrice.`
` ...I was excommunicated, but I was once a member of the same alliance, and you are the dearly-missed furniture who played with me.`
` Answer to my call......"`
`It was hard to tell in the middle of the day, but a faint blue light gathered around the palm of my hand.`
`......Then, `
`......Sakutarou's form was revived.`
`It truly did bring back memories, that figure.`
`His cute ears, his bright-red muffler.`
`...It came off easily, so Onee-chan faithfully re-wrapped it all the time, didn't she...?`
`"...Sakutaro, `
`...do you recognize us?`
` Do you know who we are...?"`
`『...Uryu...?`
` Uryu...?`
` Mammon...?`
` Ange......?〝`
`With a sleepy face, as though waking up from a long slumber, Sakutarou looked all around him as he spoke.`
`"It's been a long time, ...Sakutarou.`
` I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've summoned you with my own power.`
` ...And now, I'm the only one who can summon you."`
`『.........Uryu...〝`
`Those words might have been a bit cruel.`
`Sakutarou's face clouded over...`
`"In the past, I denied you.`
` ......Now that I've summoned you, `
`...it means I've accepted your existence."`
`『......Are you sure...?`
` Is it really all right...for me to be summoned into Ange's world...?〝`
`His eyes were a bit frightened.`
`...It was only natural.`
`I, who had played with him like a friend before,`
` had suddenly denied him and tried to burn him with the magic-resisting toxin.`
`It was only natural that he was scared...`
`"I apologize...`
`for that day.`
` ......To you too, Mammon.`
` And to the rest of you."`
`At some point, ...the rest of the Seven Sisters had gathered on the deck.`
`No, they're always there.`
`Always by my side.`
`As long as I acknowledge that it's okay for them to be there, they'll always appear.`
`"You certainly do exist.`
` Lucifer.`
` And Leviathan.`
` And Satan.`
` And Belphegor.`
` And Mammon.`
` And Beelzebub.`
` And Asmodeus.`
` ...And Sakutarou too."`
`"...Are you sure?`
` You're one challenging Beatrice-sama, Ange-sama.`
` ...Is it okay for one in a position of denying witches to acknowledge us?"`
`"As to whether magic exists or not in my world, sorry, but let me put that on hold.`
` It's not like I myself acknowledged the existence of magic."`
`"...But then, doesn't that contradict the fact...that you're acknowledging us?"`
`"It's because magic exists for people who believe.`
` Even if I don't.`
` If someone believes, then magic will exist in the human world."`
`"That fact won't change in the slightest whether I believe in magic or not.`
` No, it mustn't change.`
` That person just had to hold their head up high and believe in their own magic.`
` I acknowledge that.`
` So, it wouldn't be strange at all for all of you to exist."`
`"......Quite a play on words, ...but it's an interesting interpretation."`
`"What you're saying, Ange-sama, is probably a Devil's Proof."`
`"A Devil's Proof...?"`
`"Right?!`
` To prove the existence of demons, you just need to find one."`
`"But it's impossible to deny the existence of demons."`
`"Kyahha!`
` And we're here.`
` That means that whether Ange-sama believes in magic or not, our existence is unshakable."`
`『...Uryu?`
` The magic-resisting toxin...`
`...is disappearing...`
`...from Ange...〝`
`"Y-You're right...`
` ...Even though you're in a position of denying magic, ...why...?"`
`"That's probably...`
`...because I learned what it means to respect and acknowledge.`
` Right now, ...I might be able...`
`to understand the depths of Maria onee-chan's...and Beatrice's magic."`
`In the past, I didn't believe in things like magic.`
` Thinking something like that couldn't exist, I acted like I was closing my eyes tightly and couldn't see anything.`
`But now, I'm different.`
`I get the feeling I can look right at the thing called magic...and close in on its true nature...`
`"...How frustrating.`
` It's truly rare to find a Human so free of the magic-resisting toxin in this day and age.`
` And she has such an uncommon genius for being a witch..."`
`"That's right.`
` ...If Ange-sama tried to become a witch right now,`
` ...she could grow to be a Great Witch, maybe even at Beatrice-sama's level."`
`"Even so, she has acknowledged our existence and is our master.`
` ...Most likely, Ange-sama will be our final master.`
` Let us think of this as our final service, and apply ourselves to the fullest."`
`"...Ble-ah.`
` But I just can't staaand that Ange-sama still doesn't believe in magic herself."`
`"...Ange-sama, please believe in magic toooo.`
` It feels like a waste to finally have a master and have it not be a wiiitch."`
`"Even though you have outstanding talent that could make you one of the greatest of witches, your goal is to attack witches.`
` It's so frustrating.`
` ...Well, even so, that's your life, the way you live,`
` and in the world where you've decided that, there's nothing we can do to complain."`
`"Thanks for understanding me.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` Yeah, whether magic exists `
`~ib~to me~ib~`
` or not,`
` that's up to me to decide.`
` Regardless of whether magic actually does exist somewhere in the world or not."`
`When I think about it, this world is so vast...and yet so small.`
`Billions of people live on the earth.`
`But I probably won't meet even 1% of those people.`
`Even so, I will speak of a world.`
`'My world', which doesn't know even 1% of the world.`
`"I'm not qualified to deny the laws of a world I don't know.`
` ...So just because magic doesn't exist in my world, I can't deny that magic exists in a world I don't know.`
` That makes it a true Devil's Proof.`
` No, maybe it's more like 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do'."`
`I can be confident in the world I know.`
`So even if that's denied by a complete stranger who doesn't know a thing about my world, that's nothing to worry about.`
`And in the same way, I've got no right to deny a world I don't know...`
`just because I don't know about it.`
`"Therefore,`
` regardless of whether there's magic in my world or not,`
` ...I can't deny the magic Maria onee-chan taught me."`
`『Uryu!`
` After all, even if you've never seen it,`
` ...magic exists!〝`
`"Yes.`
` That's why, as I've already said,`
` ...you friends of the witches' alliance, Mariage Sorcière,`
` can't be denied by me or anyone else."`
`I proclaimed that most important part again.`
`......Even though the sea breeze and the crashing of the waves were noisy, it was a time of silence.`
`Both Sakutarou and the Seven Sisters of Purgatory...reflected upon my words.`
`And, probably, I did too.`
`Does magic exist?`
`Do witches exist?`
`While ignoring what the answer would be for my own world, ...I acknowledged their existence.`
` That contradiction was what I'd proclaimed so boldly.`
`『Thank you, ...Ange.〝`
`"If you'll acknowledge that much, can't you acknowledge witches too...?`
` ...No, that was a foolish question.`
` You already have a clear answer to it."`
`"Sorry.`
` Though, I do acknowledge that witches might exist somewhere in this world.`
` But that doesn't shake my world."`
`"...You won't acknowledge witches or magic.`
` You'll definitely expose the truth of Rokkenjima.`
` ...Right?"`
`"Yes.`
` That's my world.`
` Even if a real witch exists, I won't acknowledge it in my world.`
` No matter how much that witch tries to convince me."`
`"Your position is to attack witches, Ange-sama.`
` ...And I understand well that you haven't the slightest wavering in that feeling.`
` We are your furniture, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory...!`
` We will always be by your side.`
` We'll always be waiting for the day that we can be useful...!"`
`"Although, since you don't believe in magic, we can never be anything more than people to talk to."`
`"That's enough for now.`
` We've been left room to exist.`
` For that alone, we should thank and acknowledge Ange-sama."`
`"In short!`
` All of us!"`
`『Are all together again...`
` Uryu-!!〝`
`"Kya-h!!`
` Sakutaro-!`
` Let me squeeze youuuuuuuuu-!!"`
`When Sakutarou was overcome with emotion and tears came to his eyes, the Seven Sisters closed in and mobbed him.`
`...They were also celebrating a long-missed reunion.`
`If their existence is permitted, they're definitely capable of existing here.`
`No, even if I don't permit it, they can exist.`
`Because I acknowledged them, they `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~showed their reunion's joy to me as well.~ib~.`
`As I watched over that scene, ......I reflected over what this journey of mine meant.`
`"......I wonder if everyone will forgive me this way."`
`"You've done enough.`
` We are furniture.`
` Just being summoned,`
` just being allowed to be by your side makes us happy."`
`『Uryu...!`
` Ange, thank you very much...!〝`
`"...Come to think of it, why was I able to summon Sakutarou?`
` ...No, it's the other way around.`
` Why wasn't Onee-chan able to summon Sakutarou?"`
`Maria onee-chan had despaired, thinking that Sakutarou had died.`
`Which meant she hadn't been able to summon him like this anymore.`
`In the past, Onee-chan said it was more advantageous in a summoning to have a vessel.`
`However, a vessel is like training wheels, and it shouldn't be absolutely necessary.`
`...In other words, even if the stuffed animal lion that was Sakutarou's vessel didn't exist, it should've be possible to summon him.`
`...No, when you put it like that,`
` it's even a little doubtful whether summoned things can be limited by life and death.`
`Moreover, Sakutarou should have been an especially important friend to Maria onee-chan.`
`She should've been able to strive hard to summon him one more time.`
`It certainly was sad that the original stuffed animal vessel had been torn apart,`
` but why did he 'die' and become impossible to summon again...?`
`『...That's because...`
`...at that time, Maria saw my stuffed animal torn...`
`and `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~decided~ib~`
` that I'd died.〝`
`"It's the same as the existence of magic.`
` ...If Sakutarou has died in Lady MARIA's world,`
` then he can't exist in her world."`
`『......Uryu...〝`
`The shock of having her beloved stuffed animal torn apart...`
`had left a wound in her heart serious enough to prevent her from summoning her irreplaceable close friend.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~In Maria onee-chan's eyes~ib~`
`, Sakutarou died.`
`So even if Sakutarou can exist like this to me, he cannot exist before her.`
`『I...was always with Maria...`
` ...When Maria cried, I was always right beside her, telling her not to cry...`
` ...But my form, my voice, ...nothing of me will reach Maria now...〝`
`Sakutarou hung his head, looking sad.`
`"...After that incident, the nature of Mariage Sorcière rapidly began to change.`
` Before then, the alliance was a peaceful thing.`
` But after that incident, it grew full of shadier things, focusing on how to curse people you hate.`
` ...Onee-chan's diary began to show a clear change."`
`A diary is a mirror that reflects one's heart as it is.`
`It probably showed the personality called Maria die......`
`and be reborn as the evil witch personality, MARIA.`
`When she buried that diary in hatred and sadness, ...her heart surely wasn't satisfied.`
`Because it wasn't satisfied, she had to bury it with hatred and sadness.`
`And while still unsatisfied, she met with death.`
`...I wonder if her unsatisfied soul has a hole opened in its chest from sadness even now...`
`and continually wanders, dripping tears down and calling Sakutarou's name...`
`............`
`"......Onee-chan...needs you."`
`『Uryu......〝`
`"What can I do to revive you in Maria onee-chan's world?`
` If I can learn that method, I'll be able to save Onee-chan.`
` ...That's the method of atonement I've been given.`
` What can be done to revive Sakutarou?"`
`『...To Maria, my vessel had a very important meaning...〝`
`"The vessel.`
` ...In other words, if we could revive the lion stuffed animal..."`
`『But...`
`...Mama Rosa made my stuffed animal herself, so only she could make it...〝`
`Even inside the diary, Maria onee-chan had asked this of Beatrice...and was refused for that reason.`
`The magical significance of a stuffed animal being unique and handmade is very large.`
`Then, if we could make the same thing once more...`
`But Aunt Rosa is already gone from this world.`
`We can't make the same thing again.`
`"...Was there ever another identical stuffed animal made, or anything like that?"`
`"He's a stuffed animal made to be Lady MARIA's birthday present...and is the only one of his kind in the world.`
` ...A handmade and unique vessel.`
` That's why it conceals a great magical power.`
` And, ...if lost, it cannot be obtained again.`
` It won't revive..."`
`『......Uryu......〝`
`...Because she knew that, `
`Maria onee-chan watched that stuffed animal, which was unique in that world, get torn apart, `
`......and despaired.`
`Because it was the only one of its kind in the world,`
` and she couldn't permit a compromise such as buying another one, ...she had despaired from the bottom of her heart...`
`"...But Sakutarou is right here.`
` Even without a vessel, he's here.`
` Because I acknowledge that, he certainly exists in my world.`
` ......Even if Maria onee-chan doesn't acknowledge him, that cannot be denied.`
` Right...?"`
`"Logically, that's true,`
` ...but I think using the same logic to make Lady MARIA accept him could be difficult."`
`『...Maria, `
`...I'm not dead...`
` I'm right here......`
` ...Uryu...〝`
`"I'm sure that on Rokkenjima,`
` ...I'll be able to be reunited with Maria onee-chan.`
` And, ...no matter what, I'll revive the you that's inside Onee-chan...and let you be reunited."`
`『Can you do it...?〝`
`"It'll probably be hard.`
` ...Just like how, after being invited into the witches' alliance, I rejected it without understanding what it meant,`
` she might also reject your existence."`
`"......But, I've got to do it.`
` That's the only way I can atone for my sins."`
`"......Ange-sama..."`
`"What's waiting on Rokkenjima?`
` And what will happen, what will be created?`
` ...Or maybe nothing will happen."`
`『............〝`
`"That island, which was the beginning of everything, is the final destination of this journey.`
` ......You all are the furniture of a witch, so as your master, `
`...`
`I have to take you home~ib~...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`to the witch's island, to Rokkenjima."`
`Even though the rays of the sun had been so strong, at some point clouds had started to hang down.`
`The spray that hit my cheek might not all have come from crashing waves.`
`"Ange-san,`
` looks like we're gonna get a bit of a shower.`
` Maybe you'd better go below deck."`
`Amakusa called out to me with an expression that said 'Oh, you're still here?'`
`When I looked up, I saw that the island's silhouette had gotten much larger.`
`We might reach land very soon.`
`I remembered that the weather report had mentioned scattered rains.`
`The sky wasn't dark enough for rain clouds.`
`It'll probably be just for a short time.`
`Even though the rain was light enough not to be a pain...`
`...Having rain start to fall as we approached the island felt like some kind of fate.`
`It was raining on October 4, 1986 as well.`
`I'm approaching the Rokkenjima of that day...and not just in distance...`
`I went back down with Amakusa.`
`He was carrying what looked like a really large and heavy golf bag.`
`It was something Amakusa had brought back with him on a day when we'd split up.`
`...I didn't inquire as to its contents, but it was hard to imagine that they were anything peaceful.`
`"......I won't go so far as to ask what's inside, but it looks heavy."`
`"Why are these things so darn heavy all the time?`
` A French instructor taught me something interesting about that once.`
` He said they should always be heavy.`
` ......After all, a human life is heavier than the world.`
` So these should be even heavier."`
`"......It'd be nice if you didn't need to use them."`
`"That would be nice."`
`Amakusa set the golf bag-like luggage down beside him.`
`A two-propeller aircraft touched down on the runway.`
`Considering the weather, it couldn't have been a pleasant flight.`
`Everything after this flight had been suspended due to weather.`
`Cutting through the drizzle as she traversed the runway, Sumadera Kasumi entered the lobby with two black-suits as guards.`
`The four black-suits who had been waiting inside the lobby stood up and respectfully lowered their heads in salute.`
`"""Kasumi-sama...!!"""`
`"Propeller planes certainly do shake...`
` I wouldn't want to ride one again."`
`"We have a car prepared!`
` Please, this way."`
`They got into two luxury cars that had been rented...`
`"...Ange should be heading for Rokkenjima.`
` A deserted island... How convenient.`
` ......You've arranged for some tools, I take it?"`
`"Yes Ma'am...!"`
`The black-suit in the passenger seat put a heavy bag that had been set by his feet onto his lap,`
` opened the catch with a *click*, and showed Kasumi what was inside.`
`Inside were several silver lumps of carefully wrapped aluminum foil.`
`...He peeled one open to show her.`
`A black, blunt automatic pistol peeked its face out...`
`It was already approaching 10:00 at night.`
`By now, the typhoon had wrapped itself around Rokkenjima.`
`Even the rose garden that had looked so beautiful midday...`
`was beaten down upon by the fierce winds and resisted with all its might, undulating and trying to keep the flowers from blowing away...`
`In that rose garden...was Shannon in the lead, Battler holding up an umbrella, Jessica, and George carrying the sleeping Maria on his back, all heading for the guesthouse.`
`"We can at least make it to the guesthouse from here.`
` Shannon-chan, it's fine, you should go back and rest."`
`"Don't worry, seeing you off is also part of my duty..."`
`"The family conference is going on inside, and Mom and Genji-san are probably getting stressed.`
` If we keep you, they'll misunderstand and think you were being lazy."`
`"That's right.`
` Just graciously accepting our offer might be the best way to avoid burdening people.`
` ...Thank you, Shannon."`
`"Not at all.`
` ...Certainly, as Milady has said, it is very tense inside the mansion today.`
` Therefore, coming with all of you allowed me a breath of fresh air, and I've been able to relax a bit."`
`"The family conference, huh?`
` ......They went to all the trouble of chasing us kids out, so they're probably talking about something shady."`
`"Probably.`
` I'm sure there's nothing we can do to help out.`
` Just trying to stay out of their way is probably the best way for us to be useful."`
`"Heh...!`
` I'm sure it's all just 'Money money money!'.`
` ...Even though they act like they're so rich most of the time, when it gets tough, they all start getting pushy.`
` Why don't they just be graceful and split it evenly between everyone?"`
`"Ihihi.`
` That'd be awesome.`
` It'd be nice if I got a share too.`
` If I got some too, I'd split it with Shannon-chan right away."`
`"Th-Thank you very much...`
` Well, I appreciate the sentiment."`
`"Shannon isn't greedy at all.`
` Normally, girls of your age would have tons of things they'd want to buy."`
`"I guess.`
` But none of the things I want can be bought with money."`
`"Ooh!`
` How unselfish!`
` If you lined up all the things I wanted, all the gold in the world wouldn't be enough."`
`"That's if you're talking about things that can be bought with money.`
` I wonder what these 'things that can't be bought with money' that Shannon wants are.`
` Do you have any idea, George nii-san?"`
`"W-Well, I wonder.`
` I'm not Shannon, so how could I know?"`
`"I-I don't know either."`
`George and Shannon looked down, their faces red.`
`Battler had also heard about what was going on with them, so he knew what Jessica was teasing them about.`
`"George-aniki is a person I respect.`
` I think you've met up with a really great person, Shannon-chan."`
`"Yeah.`
` I also feel relieved that we can leave Shannon to George nii-san."`
`"St-Stop teasing.`
` It's a serious issue for us.`
` More importantly, what about you, Jessica-chan?`
` Have you been able to get a little closer to Kanon-kun?"`
`"Whaaaaaaaaat?!`
` So, you and Kanon-kun are like that?!"`
`"Ah, um, well!!`
` Th-That's dirty, George, twisting the conversation around like that's dirty!"`
`As they had an animated discussion with ups and downs,`
` the four kids headed for the guesthouse...`
`The annual family conference was extremely important to the Ushiromiya family,`
` and this year seemed like it was going to be especially important.`
`Apparently, the Family Head, Kinzo, was personally going to be making a very serious announcement,`
` and everyone other than the adults had been strictly ordered to leave.`
`Battler hadn't attended the family conference in six years, so he didn't really notice,`
` but according to Jessica, there seemed to be a very tense atmosphere tonight,`
` completely different from a normal year.`
`...Common sense made it clear that Kinzo, whose remaining life was short,`
` was going to make some big announcement about the succession of the Headship and the distribution of his fortune...`
`"But I'm suprised.`
` ......To think that Grandfather's actually gonna make an appearance..."`
`"...I see.`
` So, this is the witch's counterattack."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I wanted to leave the Joker called Kinzo face-down a little longer, but it's probably about time to turn it over.`
` Trump cards exist to be used.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Damn.`
` My theory that Grandfather was dead since the beginning, and a different 18th person had snuck in,`
` ...is now suddenly torn apart."`
`"I had foreseen that you'd begin to doubt Kinzo eventually...!`
` Yes, now your reasoning has all gone back to square one again, right?"`
`"With this, your theory that Kinzo was dead at the very beginning and I was hiding as the 18th person goes poof!`
`"......Fuck...`
` But no way I'll lose heart.`
` That's only one theory gone.`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` I'd have it no other way!`
` Even the first twilight has not yet begun.`
` It is far too early to give up.`
`"That's right.`
` And, it's not like it was denied with the red truth.`
` ......At this point in time, Battler's theory hasn't been defeated.`
` It's too early to say that you've won."`
`"Nn, yeah, that's right.`
` ...It's still too early for me to just swallow her story.`
` ...Grandfather is supposed to finally appear, `
`but there's a chance that they'll talk about how his health has gotten worse, and he won't appear after all."`
`"...Uncle Krauss might be trying desperately `
`to hide the fact that Grandfather really is dead until the last second."`
`"Ha...!`
` I see, I see, you could also think of it that way.`
` Do as you please.`
` It will be resolved soon.`
` Very soon...`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`All of the relatives and Nanjo could be seen in the dining hall.`
`Nanjo sat alone, quietly watching the wind and rain outside.`
`Krauss sat down in the seat of his own rank, with Natsuhi standing motionlessly at his side.`
`The other siblings were gathered at the opposite end of the long table, whispering to each other...`
`"...Is that true?"`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, ros_4e247:`
`was Father."`
`"What in the world...?`
` In other words, our strategy has collapsed from the roots...!"`
`"Not just our strategy.`
` Since Father is healthy and has said that he'll make an announcement himself, our trivial bargaining with Nii-san was completely pointless."`
`"Yep.`
` ...That old bastard.`
` Why couldn't he have just shown himself right away without making a show of it?`
` Thanks to that, we've just been quarreling with Aniki uselessly."`
`"......Or maybe he wanted to test us on that point.`
` I might not be one to talk, since we aren't related by blood, but your Father is very intelligent, correct?"`
`"Our arguments during the day were probably overheard by one of the servants and reported to Father.`
` ......Incredible.`
` The fact that we were making a fuss with Father's inheritance as our goal is now right in the open...`
` ......Ah, just incredible..."`
`Eva uncharacteristically held her head, dejected.`
`If, as Kyrie had said, everything had been going according to Kinzo's plans from the beginning,`
` and if this was a huge setup that had been kept up for over a year, trying to find the siblings' true intentions,`
` then they had fallen for it completely...`
`"...We still don't know for sure that it's reached Father's ears."`
`"No, it definitely has!`
` ...Everyone but Nii-san claimed that Father was dead, and none of us believed in Father's good health...!`
` Aaah, it's already over...`
` ...Father will make an announcement.`
` Nii-san will become the Successor, and he'll say we aren't even qualified to wear the One Wing...`
`'!s0`
`"Nee-san, ...get ahold of yourself..."`
`"...Rosa-san,`
` I wonder if Maria really received that umbrella from Father."`
`"Huh?`
` What do you mean...?"`
`"...Maria-chan might have seen Father.`
` However, we haven't seen him.`
` Maria-chan only claims to have seen him."`
`"What are you saying...?`
` ...Are you saying Maria's lying?!"`
`"Calm down, Rosa.`
` ...Maria-chan didn't necessarily lie.`
` Still, she's an innocent kid, right?"`
`"...For example, if Genji-san came up to her and said something like 'I was told by your Grandfather to hand this to you, Maria-sama',`
` then even if Maria-chan hadn't met Dad, she still might say that she got an umbrella from him, right?"`
`"...Th-That's right.`
` That trick could work...!"`
`"But what was it Maria-chan said?`
` 'Grandfather came and handed me the umbrella'."`
`"Yes, that's what she said.`
` She clearly said that she received an umbrella directly from Grandfather."`
`"...Directly, huh?`
` Then we're stuck."`
`"...............`
`They often say that bad thinking is no better than sleeping.`
` If you think about it a bit, all of this about the umbrella is a trivial problem."`
`"Why's that?`
` Couldn't Maria-chan have been bribed by Nii-san to lie and say something that made it seem like Father was in good health?!`
` There is no evidence that Father actually handed the umbrella to her...!"`
`"Regardless of whom Maria-chan received the umbrella from,`
` assuming she was even given an umbrella in the first place,`
` Father will appear very soon.`
` Once Father's in front of us, the problem with the umbrella will become completely trivial."`
`"......In other words, this is not the time to gossip about the umbrella issue."`
`"What do you mean, this isn't the time?"`
`"......I see, ...I got it.`
` ...This is probably what Kyrie-san's sayin'.`
` ......Father is supposed to come here very soon,`
` but the chance still remains that he'll get mad again and won't show up, right...?"`
`"...I-I see.`
` That's true...`
` Maybe Nii-san just said Father was going to appear at random in a desperate bid to buy time against our investigation.`
` Father really is dead already, `
`and Nii-san is still lying and saying he's healthy...!"`
`"In short, if Father appears, then no schemes will be effective.`
` There's no need to even think about that case.`
` We're fish on the chopping board.`
` We'd have no choice but to leave fate to the heavens and negotiate directly with Father.`
` That means we'd have no choice but to let him clobber us with his fist, then prostrate ourselves and beg for money."`
`"...But on the other hand, if Father doesn't appear, then our primary strategy isn't hampered in the least."`
`"......I see.`
` In short, no matter which way it goes, there's absolutely no need to get flustered now."`
`"That's it.`
` If Father shows up, we just have to carry out the normal family conference.`
` ......If he doesn't, we just have to keep on investigating Krauss-san."`
`"We can't let him talk his way out of it,`
` ...like if he says Father's mood has suddenly gotten worse."`
`"...It seems what we really should be trying to figure out...`
`is what scheme Nii-san is going to try and trick us with.`
` The way he just doesn't know how to give up is something I know better than anyone."`
`"If Father is well, ...we'll prostrate ourselves and beg for money.`
` ...If it's a farce of Krauss-san's, then we'll continue our ugly sibling fight.`
` ......It sounds like this year's family conference is going to be just wonderful."`
`"Yep.`
` So, bad thinking is no better than sleeping, huh?`
` It's almost 22:00.`
` ...Should we press Aniki?"`
`Rudolf and the rest looked at Krauss.`
`He was sitting down firmly...and looked like he was awaiting Kinzo's arrival with an air of composure.`
`...They couldn't tell if he really was composed, ...or if he was scheming about how to tie together his lie.`
`"......Dear..."`
`"...Calm yourself.`
` We won't get anywhere by making a fuss after all this.`
` ......Let's leave it to Genji-san."`
`"It's almost...10:00, isn't it?"`
`That was the time that had been set for tonight's family conference to open.`
`And, it was the time that the Ushiromiya Family Head needed to appear...`
`Right then, they heard the sound of footsteps approaching from the hall.`
`There were multiple sets.`
`Natsuhi raised her head, relieved...`
`But because of the sound of a knock, her expression was filled with disappointment.`
`Because Kinzo probably wouldn't have knocked.`
`"...Please excuse us.`
` I have finished closing up the mansion for the night."`
`It was Gohda and Kumasawa.`
`Unlike the powerful Gohda, `
`it was rare for Kumasawa, with her old body, to be forced to work this late.`
`Of course, Krauss also seemed to know that.`
`"Indeed.`
` Good work.`
` ......My apologies for making you work at such a time, Kumasawa-san."`
`"Oh, it's nothing.`
` I may not look it, but staying up late is still one of my specialties.`
` Hohohohoh...!"`
`"...Wouldn't it be okay to at least let Kumasawa leave without being an observer?`
` It really will be difficult on her body, I imagine."`
`"......The order was to gather all of the servants as well.`
` I cannot disobey."`
`Tonight's family conference was clearly different from normal.`
`On a normal year, no one was allowed to attend except family members.`
`To have the servants present for such a thing...was unthinkable.`
`But this year was different.`
`All of the servants were told to attend.`
`Of course, they were not allowed to talk.`
`......They were there as observers.`
`Just what in the world was happening that needed to be observed by five servants?`
`...Even Krauss didn't know.`
`"Hohohoh.`
` I don't look it, but I'm good at staying up late.`
` If you stuff yourself with mackerel too, Krauss-sama, you'll be more manly at night."`
`"Hahahaha.`
` I see you're still in high spirits.`
` I'm sure you'll be working in such high spirits until you're a hundred."`
`"Madam,`
` forgive my arrogance, but I have prepared a light snack.`
` I can serve it at any time, so feel free to order it."`
`"Thank you.`
` You really are considerate.`
` ...Please offer refills of coffee to the others."`
`"Certainly."`
`After nodding, Gohda took the pot towards the relatives gathered at the other end of the table.`
`As he did, more footsteps approached from the hallway.`
`...It was a single set.`
`And it was light.`
`Even before the knock, they could imagine who it was.`
`"Excuse me...`
` I've taken the children to the guesthouse."`
`"Good work.`
` Tonight is a special evening.`
` Make sure you stay alert."`
`"Y-Yes.`
` Certainly, Madam..."`
`Genji had gone with Kanon to meet Kinzo.`
`...There was still no sign of their return.`
`The hand of the clock passed 22:00 slightly.`
`Once sure of that, Eva spoke to Krauss.`
`"...Nii-saaan?`
` It's time.`
` Are you still not going to start the family conference?"`
`"......The arrival of the guest of honor has been delayed.`
` Wait a short while."`
`"How long?`
` Sorry, but time's up.`
` I won't have you saying 'Father hasn't quite shown up yet' over and over until dawn."`
`"How could I make a promise about the time Father shows up?`
` Why are you in such a rush?`
` Why not drink some tea and calm down for now...?"`
`"Aniki, we're gathered here for a family conference.`
` Not a farce.`
` We'll wait 30 more minutes.`
` But if that doesn't work, you'll let us break into the study, okay?"`
`"B-Break into...`
` Such an action would be quite lacking in respect for the Head!"`
`"Oh, right, our apologies.`
` We'll be good for 30 more minutes.`
` Hehheheheh..."`
`".........Hmph."`
`".........`
`I look forward to seeing if you can keep that same smile up 30 minutes from now."`
`"...So, you honestly believe that Father is dead?"`
`"I have no desire to discuss that now.`
` We can wait until Father comes here.`
` There's absolutely no need for me to argue you down, Nii-san."`
`"The Ushiromiya Headship will be passed on to the proper person in the proper manner.`
` ...No matter what you may scheme, you cannot resist.`
` Of course, the same goes for me."`
`"What are you trying to say?`
` ...And after bragging all these years about being the Successor yourself...!"`
`"I'll turn your own words back on you.`
` I have no desire to discuss that now.`
` All that matters is for Father to come here and proclaim it with his own mouth.`
` There's absolutely no need for me to argue you down.`
` ...Right?`
` Heheheh!"`
`Krauss casually turned Eva's words back on her.`
`Of course, that added oil to Eva's anger.`
`But it didn't ignite.`
`Because, in that instant, the sound of a very loud knock rang out.`
`Both Genji and Kanon were usually very reserved when they knocked.`
`They wouldn't hit the door with such a violent strength.`
`...It was like a judge's gavel slamming down in a call for silence.`
`So, everyone went quiet...`
`The door opened slightly, ...and Genji showed himself.`
`Then, he spoke with a serious tone different from his usual one.`
`It wasn't the tone he used when carrying out his duties.`
`...It was the tone he used when speaking for Kinzo himself.`
`So just by hearing Genji speak like that, the siblings were struck with a sudden tension.`
`"Take your seats, everyone."`
`At those words, the dining hall was wrapped in total silence, and everyone hurriedly returned to their designated seats.`
`It was as though students who had been bustling around just before homeroom had suddenly returned to their seats when the teacher came,`
` and it might even have looked humorous.`
`...But there was no way anyone would joke about it.`
`Everyone sat in order, and Shannon, Gohda, and Kumasawa stood up straight in a row by the wall.`
`"...The Head of the glorious Ushiromiya family and lord of Rokkenjima, the island that sparkles gold,`
` ...Lord Ushiromiya Kinzo has arrived."`
`Of the double doors that led to the dining hall, Genji opened the right door from the inside, and Kanon opened the left door from the outside.`
`...And, welcomed by a respectful bow from those two, majestically fluttering his cape, ......Kinzo appeared...`
`Kinzo's gait had a dignified weight to it, and it was hard to believe that he had reportedly been at the end of his life.`
`Genji pulled back Kinzo's seat and motioned for him to sit.`
`But Kinzo stayed standing, signaling with his chin for Genji to move back.`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* Fuhhahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` Welcome to Rokkenjima, ladies and gentlemen.`
` Why the frightened face, Evaa?"`
`"N-No, why would I be frightened...!`
` I'm just relieved to find you in excellent spirits, Father..."`
`"Wahhahhahhahhahhahha...!!`
` Evaa, you're as amusing as ever, aren't yoou?`
` Why don't you just honestly say how frustrated you are at losing your bet with Krauss?`
` ...*cackle*cackle* You can't say it, can you?`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`Eva realized that their conversation during the day had indeed been leaked to Kinzo, and she hung her head, turning red.`
`"Well then, my sons and daughters and their companions!`
` Tonight, I shall make an important announcement regarding my inheritance and the succession that you all seem so keen on."`
`"But first!`
` I must tell you how incredibly disappointed I am.`
` After all, until this very day, no one has been able to solve the riddle of the epitaph."`
`Even though Kinzo said he was disappointed,`
` a condescending smile rose to his face, as though there was no way the likes of these could've solved it, and his gaze passed through all of them.`
`"...I had planned to hand over everything to the one who could solve it.`
` But none have been able to solve it before today, and here we stand, with nothing of mine passed down to anyone."`
`"How shameful...!!`
` To think that not one among you has come forward with the qualifications to succeed me!`
` How truly disappointing, and shameful, and patheetic!!`
` Wahhahhahhahhahhahha!!"`
`The siblings hung their heads in silence.`
`Of course, they would have solved it if they could.`
`True, they couldn't deny that they'd wasted a golden opportunity, but it was just so hard...`
`"Therefore,`
` I am proclaiming here and now that I will suspend the use of the epitaph's riddle as a method of choosing my successor.`
` In short, time's up!`
` This is game over.`
` ...And what a shame for you all.`
` Even though it should have given you all an equal and fair chance, that's gone now!`
` ......Gehhahahahah!!"`
`It truly sounded like Kinzo was making a victory proclamation.`
`"In that case, will my oldest son Krauss succeed the Headship...?`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` The answer is <no>!!"`
`"Wha...?!"`
`"......"`
`"...You understand, right, Krauuss?`
` I certainly gave you the title of Successor.`
` But all you did was let it go to your head...`
` Do you know what a Successor is...?"`
`"......It means...the person who will inherit your position after you, Father..."`
`'!s0`
` The position of Successor isn't something that's guaranteed by the current Head at aaaaaaaaaaall!"`
`"......Listen up, Krauuss.`
` I won't tell you this again.`
` A Successor...`
`is what you call someone who finds everyone else who's after the Headship,`
` thoroughly breaks their noses, and makes it so they can never disobey him again."`
`"This is not only something that can be said of the Headship.`
` It's the same with money!`
` A 'rich person' doesn't mean someone who has money.`
` It means someone who crushes everyone who had more money than himself,`
` and who scrabbles together more money than anyone else."`
`"It's the same with talent.`
` A genius is not what you call a person blessed with talent!`
` It means a person who crushes everyone with more talent than themselves!`
` A person who can coerce geniuses and all other people to call them that using strength and charisma!!`
` You have a mistaken impression when it comes to all of these things.`
` ...So, you aren't of the right caliber to be my Successor.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"...I-I'll take your words to heart..."`
`Perhaps that truly was Kinzo's philosophy.`
`As a result of faithfully carrying out that rant-like philosophy of his,`
` Kinzo had glorified the Ushiromiya family to the state it was in today...`
`It may be hard to imagine after his immersion in the occult in recent years,`
` but that brutally overbearing outlook was no more or less than Ushiromiya Kinzo's charisma and aura...`
`"Such an unsatisfactory person is not qualified to inherit everything of the Ushiromiya family.`
` In that case, is Eva, Rudolf, or Rosa qualified?"`
`"Again, <no>!!`
` You were unable to solve the riddle, and you were also unable to use a scheme to drag Krauss down!`
` All the three of you managed to do was gather together in a united front to try and extort money from Krauss.`
` And even that scheme was thoughtless!`
` You can't even corner Krauss all by himself!`
` ......There could be nothing more shameful!"`
`"You lack the avarice to steal away the position of Successor by any means!!`
` In order to get what you want, you should sacrifice everything, becoming as covetous and greedy as possible...!!`
` The goddess of luck smiles upon the greedy!!`
` You three, who don't have that wild spirit, are as unfit for the succession as Krauss is!!"`
`Eva and the rest had no words to respond with.`
`And they couldn't calculate what it was Kinzo was about to say...`
`Was Kinzo actually planning to proclaim that no one would succeed the Headship?`
`If so, that would work to Eva, Rosa, and Rudolf's advantage.`
`After all, in the end, they'd just have to renegotiate everything among the siblings after Kinzo's death, splitting the inheritance evenly.`
`It would surely be more troublesome if a specific person's name was raised and proclaimed to be the Successor.`
`...But would Kinzo really say something to benefit any of the four siblings after demeaning them so much?`
`"...You don't think...he's going to say that because no one will succeed him,`
` he'll donate all of his fortune to charity or something, right...?"`
`"......I'm afraid I wouldn't put it past Father."`
`"The blood's just risen to his head...`
` We can't do anything but let him talk for now."`
`"...W-Well then, Father.`
` What thoughts do you have regarding the Succession of the Headship?"`
`"Hmph......`
` Since I am so utterly disappointed in all of you, I've lost the desire to hand it over to anyone.`
` Therefore, the Ushiromiya family will end here.`
` It ends with my generation."`
`"...Th-That cannot..."`
`"The Ushiromiya family was crushed long ago in that earthquake.`
` The current Ushiromiya family is nothing but an illusion of gold I'm glimpsing for an instant.`
` ...The likes of which will end when I awaken from my slumber.`
` Hehheheh!`
` Everything in this world is a dream, an illusion.`
` ...Life is but a daydream before the awakening called death.`
` Aaah, yes, that's how it was from the beginning!!`
` That I should lose everything when I die was part of Beatrice's contract, and her curse!`
` Fuhahaha!!`
` As if I'd let you, Beatrice!`
` I will be the one who captures you!!`
` Tonight, that goal will be realized.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` Wahhahahahahaha!!"`
`For a while, Kinzo was overcome with cackling, and his eyes bulged.`
`Whenever he talked about Beatrice, it was always both eloquent and insane...`
`"Foolish children such as yourselves truly are daydreams!!`
` It's as though you were never there from the beginning!!`
` Disappear! Wake up!!`
` Disappear from the doze of the truth that I am...!!`
` You failures that have not built up anything that makes you worthy to succeed me!!"`
`"K-Kinzo-san.`
` If I may..."`
`"What is it,`
` my friend?"`
`Nanjo nervously raised his hand, asking to speak.`
` Kinzo allowed him to.`
`"I understand how you feel, Kinzo-san.`
` Because you love your children, you expect a lot of them,`
` and as a parent and grandparent myself, `
`I understand how parental affection can make you feel as though your expectations were betrayed."`
`"...However, you are extraordinary, Kinzo-san.`
` A genius.`
` Isn't saying that it's only natural for them to catch up to you a little too harsh...?`
` Despite that, Krauss-san, Eva-san, Rudolf-san, Rosa-san,`
` and all of their partners have done their very best to catch up with you..."`
`"Hohoooooooooohhh???`
` And just how much money have they built up with this 'Doing their best'?`
` After these cowards fail completely in ventures and gain debt,`
` and still try to sponge off me, how can you say that they did their very best...?!!"`
`"Money is the crystallization of everything in this world.`
` If you cannot grasp that, then you cannot grasp the world!`
` If a life cannot strongly grasp this world, it doesn't deserve to live!!`
` Disappear!!`
` Disappear from my life and reality!!"`
`"...That's a reckless argument.`
` With that logic, even I must not live.`
` ...Even so, I believe the time I spend playing chess with you was worthwhile for both of us, Kinzo-san...`
` ...You should know better than anyone else that there are many things in this world that cannot be bought with money."`
`"......Hmm.`
` ...Hmph."`
`As the siblings motionlessly hung their heads, they cheered Nanjo on inside their hearts.`
`Not one of the siblings could offer their opinion in front of Kinzo in a rage, but Kinzo's close friend Nanjo alone was allowed to...`
`Even though Kinzo had raged so fiercely, after being admonished by Nanjo, he nodded several times as though in agreement.`
`...This surprisingly obedient side of him might have seemed cute, but there was no one here who could laugh.`
`"It may be true that your children haven't built up as great a fortune as you have, Kinzo-san.`
` ...Though, even so, they're rich enough to make me jealous."`
`"But besides money, they have also built up many things that cannot be bought with money.`
` When it comes to that, they are in no way inferior to you, Kinzo-san."`
`"Hoh.`
` And what do you claim they have built up that cannot be bought with money?"`
`"Happiness.`
` Family.`
` ...They have found wonderful partners, had children, and each has built up their own happy homes.`
` They have glorified your family name...and have brought back grandchildren."`
`"Grandchildren are wonderful.`
` We older people can look at these young grandchildren, who will live on into a new era that we will not even be given a chance to see, and in them, we can imagine an endless future.`
` ...Isn't that the sole entertainment we have in our old age?"`
`"Remember, Kinzo-san.`
` Remember your joy when they first brought back their grandchildren...!`
` Your children and your grandchildren...will carry your great works on to future generations, setting an example.`
` That is something that an individual cannot accomplish no matter how much money they have."`
`The siblings all nodded in agreement...`
`Certainly, Kinzo had looked happy when his grandchildren had just been born.`
`...Back when he still had some sanity in his heart.`
`...However, did Kinzo's heart still contain a Human's warmth...?`
`"In other words,`
` in exchange for the vast riches I created,`
` instead of gaining money, I have gained my grandchildren?!"`
`"N-No, no, that's not what I..."`
`"So, in exchange for the several tens of billions in wealth that I have built up, I have gained a single grandchild from each of my children!!"`
`"Hahhahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` This is wonderful!`
` So, I have created a single life using ten billion yen!`
` That's how it is!`
` Interesting, truly an interesting example in the alchemical sense, riight...?!"`
`"Hooh, what valuable grandchildren!`
` Wonderful, ...wonderful!!`
` Wahhahhahhahhahha!!`
` Is that right, Krauss?`
` ...Is your daughter worth ten billion yen...?"`
`"......"`
`Krauss couldn't answer instantly.`
`...It wasn't that he didn't have confidence in his daughter. It was because he didn't have a clue what Kinzo was trying to test him with in this question.`
`But when Natsuhi was then pressed for an answer, she responded, breaking Krauss's silence with an answer of her own interpretation.`
`"...Y-Yes.`
` Jessica is a daughter I wouldn't let go of even for ten billion yen.`
` In that sense, I believe she has a value that can't be measured with money."`
`"Hoh.`
` So, you can state for certain that she's worth ten billion.`
` Hoh hoh!`
` What about you, Eva?`
` What about your George...?"`
`Since Natsuhi had answered that way, Eva naturally came up with her own answer as well.`
`...Even though Eva should have known better than to respond to a provocative question like this, she answered as well.`
`"Yes, Father.`
` George is worth ten billion...no, even more than that.`
` And that's not in the abstract sense of things money can't buy.`
` George will certainly build up a fortune equal to his worth.`
` He'll become a grandson worthy of carrying on your great works, Father...!"`
`Eva sent a glance at Hideyoshi and Natsuhi as if she'd scored a point.`
`...When she heard what Eva had said, Natsuhi was about to add more praise for her daughter, but stopped at a glare from Krauss.`
`"Hmm, I see.`
` ......Then what about you, Rudolf?`
` What about your Battler?"`
`"Compared to George-kun, ...there's nothing about Battler I can brag about.`
` If he was kidnapped and we were threatened with a ransom of ten billion, I'd feel like sticking a bow on the guy and letting them have him."`
`"*giggle*giggle*..."`
`"On top of that, he's an idiot and reckless.`
` He talks about grand dreams and things that couldn't be done.`
` ...I guess in that way, he's a super idiot worth the equivalent of ten billion normal idiots."`
`"But I'm sure that guy could do things that even a group of ten billion average people couldn't do.`
` Well, I'm pretty sure he'll fall flat on his face.`
` The world isn't easy."`
`"...But at the very least, `
`there's no doubt that watching over his life will be more fun than looking at ten billion average people."`
`Eva clicked her tongue at that clever style of speech, which would probably match Kinzo's tastes.`
`Apparently, Rudolf had done that on purpose, so he grinned back at her.`
`"...What of Maria?"`
`"...M-Maria is my adorable and only daughter.`
` Her value cannot be measured with money.`
` ...That is all."`
`"Hmm.`
` ......I see.`
` Dreams and the future, miracles and possibilities are the source of my magical power.`
` No magic without hopes holds any strength."`
`"...Heh, I cannot expect any more from you who have proven to be average,`
` but I see, my grandchildren hold future possibilities, and expecting a magical miracle from them may be worthwhile."`
`"If you're saying that, in this way, they are worth more than ten billion...hmm, yes, I can see where you're coming from.`
` ...Hmmm, hmmmm..."`
`When Kinzo got in a rage, he wouldn't let anyone speak up,`
` but even so, he would sometimes accept something on his own while yelling by himself...and change his own opinion.`
`...That's what this felt like to the siblings.`
`Apparently, even though Kinzo had been disgusted by his unsuccessful children and had cast them away as being unfit for the inheritance of his title or his fortune,`
` he wasn't sure about his grandchildren.`
`...At this rate, he might soon say that the inheritance would go to his grandchildren instead of the siblings.`
`As the siblings sat in fear of what their fickle and short-tempered father might suddenly think of next,`
` they carefully watched his every move...`
`"...Hmm.`
` ...Let me change my thinking a little.`
` I have absolutely no desire to hand over all I have to any of you."`
`"However, it will be quite interesting to question the grandchildren to see if one of them is qualified...`
` I've always thought of them as mere kids,`
` but there's a chance I'll find a shining gem amongst them that will catch me off guard."`
`"And testing them for that would be...`
`...yes, it would be a shame to abandon that final side-trip in my remaining life.`
` ...Hmmmmm, `
`...well then, what shall I do...?"`
`"...I-I can, with confidence, recommend George as someone fitting to follow after you!"`
`Eva claimed that right away.`
`Natsuhi looked like she was about to follow along, but Krauss gave her a look telling her to restrain herself, so she swallowed her words.`
`"Hehheheheheheh!`
` How bold.`
` ...Then, let us do this.`
` I will individually question the grandchildren to see if they are qualified to succeed the Ushiromiya family inheritance and wealth."`
`"...Father..."`

`"......I shall obey Father's decision."`
`"Same here.`
` I'll go along with what he decides.`
` ...What about you, Aneki?"`
`"O-Of course.`
` ...I believe Father will make a wise judgement."`
`"I-I will also obey Father's decision..."`
`"I shall think of how to test my grandchildren.`
` Which means this is no longer any business of yours.`
` After all, none of you are involved with the succession in any way now.`
` ...So right here, right now, perhaps we should discuss a different matter that does involve you."`
`"A different matter...?"`
`"Indeed.`
` That is tonight's true purpose, and the true purpose for this final Ushiromiya family conference as well.`
` ...Heheheheheheh!!`
` I have no desire to hear your thoughts and opinions.`
` I demand only your assistance!`
` Assistance in my ceremony!"`
`"...Your ceremony...?"`
`"Quiet...!`
` Father's talking now...!"`
`Rudolf and the rest had automatically narrowed their brows at the occult-like word.`
`Could he be planning to start some strange ceremony involving Beatrice's resurrection again...?`
`And he wanted their assistance...?`
`What in the world was he planning to do?`
`In the past, he had carried out many eccentricities that he called by the same name, such as starting to burn a strange incense and filling the whole mansion with the stench.`
`To the siblings, a ceremony was nothing more than one of the aged Kinzo's obnoxious hobbies.`
`"Father,`
` just what do you mean by that......?"`
`"If we can assist you, we'll do anything.`
` Right, Rosa?"`
`"Y-Yes...`
` But...what in the world...is it...?"`
`"A ceremony as inscribed in my epitaph.`
` ...A ceremony to revive Beatrice and open the door to the Golden Land.`
` That witch, who escaped her cage of flesh and sneeringly slipped through my fingers, I shall now capture...`
`and force into submission with my greatest hidden art.`
` ......For that purpose, I must offer 13 people as sacrifices."`
`"...Hehheheheheh!`
` Gathering 13 people's worth of sacrifices is no easy feat.`
` But tonight is the family conference!`
` Many adults have gathered on Rokkenjima.`
` There could be no other day on which to carry out this ceremony."`
`Taken literally, it sounded like he was telling them to become human sacrifices for his dark ceremony and die.`
`Ridiculous.`
`Was it some kind of metaphor...?`
`But they didn't even have a clue what he was trying to illustrate.`
`The siblings whispered together about what Kinzo was saying...`
`"...What's Dad going on about?`
` Is this his usual sickness...?"`
`"Probably.`
` Listen silently for now."`
`"........."`
`"I'm sorry, Father...`
` I don't understand what you mean by that."`
`"What is it you don't understand?`
` I am making this extremely simple.`
` I told you that I'll choose 13 of the humans on this island and offer them as sacrifices in a ceremony to revive Beatrice.`
` Even worthless people like you can be very useful as sacrifices in my ceremony.`
` Wahhahhahhahha!!"`
`"...Listen!!`
` This is not a joke nor anything of the sort.`
` This is my final bet, my final ceremony, the last one I will desire in my life!`
` There are now more than 13 humans on this island.`
` In short, that's a head count that can easily satisfy the massive number of sacrifices I require!`
` Become the sacrifices for my ceremony!!"`
`"...Kinzo-san, ...you weren't...`
`serious about what you said back then, were you...?!`
` It wasn't a joke...?!!"`
`Unusually for him, Nanjo's face changed color as he stood up and shouted.`
`It seemed this wasn't the first time Nanjo had heard all this dark talk about 13 sacrifices.`
`"Sorry, my friend.`
` That was no joke nor anything of the sort.`
` It is what I bet my life on, the final ceremony, the final game that I will attempt."`
`"Yes, this is a game!`
` If gaining my fortune and leaving the island is your goal, then there are only two ways to achieve it!`
` Will you escape being chosen as one of the 13 sacrifices and spectacularly survive, by finally solving the riddle of the epitaph and stopping the ceremony, `
`...or will you kill me?!`
` ...And thereby stop this ceremony.`
` Those are your only two options!!"`
`By now, everyone wasn't just whispering, but chattering and muttering away.`
`Even the siblings had noticed that Kinzo was beginning to act abnormally...`
`"...Father, are you a little tired?`
` Genji-san, has Father been drinking?"`
`"......No.`
` The Master is sensible."`
`"Sorry, Dad.`
` I don't have a clue what you're talking about...`
` Dad's free to start up any weird ceremony he wants to revive the witch he loves.`
` That's his hobby.`
` But getting wrapped up in that...ahaha...and being made into a human sacrifice is a little more than I can handle."`
`"Rudolf, are you trying to interrupt Father?!"`
`"What are you talking about, Aneki?!`
` You expect me to listen to something that shady and say 'Oh, really?'?!"`
`Was the 'ceremony' Kinzo had mentioned literally something disturbing, `
`or was it some kind of test to choose the Successor?`
`It seemed that Rudolf had taken it literally,`
` but Eva apparently still believed that it was something like a test or examination to find a proper Successor.`
`But Kinzo responded with a clear smile.`
`"Well then, that is all I have to say.`
` Nooo objections or opinions are necessary from you...!!`
` I will simply awaken from my dream of having four unsuccessful children.`
` To all of you, what will occur now before your very eyes may seem like a dream, an illusion, something that couldn't conceivably be of this world, and a world that defies understanding."`
`"But that itself is my reality!!`
` Now, I will finally awaken from the shallow, useless dream that all of you are!!"`
`"Come, the game has already begun, see?`
` With this many of you here, I can take lives starting with anyone...!!`
` So long, my unsuccessful children.`
` And for the final and only time in your lives, be useful...for my ceremony...!!`
` Arise, Pendragon's Memorial Troops...!!"`
`When Kinzo raised his arms high like an opera singer and yelled as though towards a packed audience, `
`the air shattered like glass, ......and the outlines of three people who supposedly hadn't been invited to this island appeared...`
`"Chiester 45, right here...!"`
`"Chiester 410, riiiight here!"`
`"Chiester 00, right here, sir."`
`Three girls with strange forms suddenly appeared behind Kinzo.`
`Where from?`
` When?`
` Who?`
` Who were they??`
`...The Humans were thrown off balance, and their minds went blank.`
`Because they spent all that time thinking, they lost their last chance to survive.`
`"You have permission to shoot six to death.`
` I leave the choice of targets up to you.`
` Begin your attack."`
`"Unrestricted Firing, understood, sir.`
` Thank you for granting us such excellent targets.`
` Everyone, Commence Unrestricted Firing."`
`"Nihi!`
` First one in, nyeh!!`
` Hyahhah!!"`
`When 410 scratched the air with her finger, a golden bow appeared in empty space, and she pulled its string.`
`The golden arrow that had been readied there was fired off without any hesitation, flew around the room leaving haphazard gold curves everywhere, `
`......and chose Natsuhi from among those sitting at the table of the family conference, pulverizing the left half of her face.`
`Flesh and deep-red blood scattered around,`
` leaving massive red spatter marks on the relatives' faces and the pure white tablecloth.`
`...Silence fell.`
`Despite the massive number of deep-red spots left on the tablecloth, `
`......no one could understand why Natsuhi's head was half smashed, nor why she was hanging her head as though dozing while still sitting,`
` ......and they watched on in silence.`
`...Those sitting on Natsuhi's right-hand side were silent for a relatively long time,`
` but those sitting to her left were not.`
`...Because the people sitting on that side had been shown how her head had been smashed open like a watermelon or a pomegranate...`
`and could even see inside her...`
`"Na...tsuhi......"`
`"...One down.`
` Natsuhi, is it? A luckless woman to the end.`
` ...Next!"`
`"00, Firing."`
`After scratching the empty air in the same way and readying her bow, 00 fired as well.`
`After it flew around and around at high speeds like the golden arrow 410 had released, drawing a convoluted curve in the same manner,`
` ...it smashed half of Rudolf's head in the same way as he looked at Natsuhi in shock, killing him instantly.`
`This time, everyone managed to avoid freezing up mentally.`
` They realized that a fearsome murder had started playing out right in front of them, just as Kinzo had said.`
`And they realized that Kinzo would probably kill even more...!`
`'!s0`
`""Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!""`
`Shrill screams burst out.`
`Even so, they didn't know what to do.`
`So they could only keep screaming and flapping their wide-open mouths like goldfish...`
`"...F-Father, `
`...what do you think you're doing...?"`
`"...Y-You fool!!`
` Run now!!"`
`As Eva asked Kinzo that in total shock,`
` Hideyoshi, who had come to his senses faster than anyone else and risen to his feet, pulled at her arm from behind.`
`However, merciless fate's choice for the third sacrifice...`
`...was Hideyoshi.`
`Just like the two before him, half of Hideyoshi's head was neatly smashed,`
` ...and the right side of his head, which had happened to be facing that direction at the time, ...had been blown away with its contents exposed like a watermelon or a pomegranate.`
`So, still holding Eva, ...Hideyoshi slumped backwards and fell down.`
`Still held by her beloved husband, Eva fell over backwards with him.`
`"Dear...?`
` Dear...?!`
` Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkkk!!!"`
`Eva screamed.`
`...It was only natural.`
`The face she had been looking for...had been half lost,`
` and the crushed skull, the mashed brains, and the crushed jaw all lay bare...`
`"45, Impact, it's a hit...!"`
`"Spectacular.`
` Fire again.`
` Three more remain."`
`"F-Father...!!`
` Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What...what...is this supposed to be?!?!"`
`When Krauss stood up forcefully and was about to rush Kinzo, 00 blocked him.`
`...With her slender-looking body, she held back Krauss with just the palm of her right hand.`
`He still tried to resist and attack Kinzo,`
` so 00 lifted Krauss by the nape of the neck and twisted into his Adam's apple with her thumb.`
`It seemed to be very painful, and Krauss was overcome with agony.`
`"Gghh, oooooooohhhh...!!!`
` Everyone, ...run...!!`
` Get the police...!`
` An ambulance...!!`
` Quickly...!!"`
`"Everyone, let's escape!!`
` Escape!!"`
`Nanjo's sharp words finally dissolved the spell that had been holding them down in their chairs.`
`When Gohda and Kumasawa each tried to escape from the dining hall first, `
`410 moved in an instant and appeared there, blocking the way.`
`"Nihi! You sure are slow nyeeh.`
` Did you think I'd let you escape nyeeh♪"`
`"Hiieeeeeeeeeehhhh!!"`
`"H-Help meeeeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Gohda-san, duck!!"`
`Even though Gohda didn't understand, he crouched when he heard Kyrie's sharp voice.`
`...Then, a burst of air rushed above his head.`
`Kyrie had taken a big swing with a chair to mow 410 down.`
`But 410, still with a mocking expression, easily caught that widely swung chair with a single hand.`
`"...Tch!"`
`"What a scary woman nyeh.`
` You really wanna go the same way as your husband that muuch?"`
`From the cuff of her arm where she had caught the chair, something like a shining golden snake appeared,`
` ...wrapped itself around the chair, and burst open.`
`It was a fearsome power, like a vice.`
`When Kyrie realized that the being in front of her, which looked like a girl,`
` was actually something that surpassed Human knowledge and that a Human could not even begin to oppose,`
` her head was filled with a fierce alarm bell that welled up from deep inside her...`
`Genji, Shannon, and Kanon, all of the servants permitted to wear the One-Winged Eagle, continued to stand calmly at attention by the wall, even with a scene like this before their eyes,`
` making them look very bizarre and eerie.`
`For an instant, Kyrie thought that they'd managed to stay calm because they were with the enemy...`
`and had been given a guarantee that they wouldn't be killed.`
`...But as soon as she thought that, the side of Genji's face was blown away before her eyes.`
`"G-Genji-san..."`
`"45, Impact, it's a hit...!"`
`"...Hohoh, Genji, how unfortunate.`
` ...Rest in peace, my friend.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle* Your death will not be wasted.`
` You will become one of the 13 keys essential to the resurrection of my beloved witch.`
` Fuhhahahahahahahaha..."`
`The half of Genji's expression that remained...`
`was as indifferent as ever.`
`He tilted, ...fell over, and sent a blood-red splatter out across the floor...`
`"......Genji-sama........."`
`"......We're nothing more...than the witch's pieces.`
` ......Nothing more, ......nothing more..."`
`From the meek and frustrated...`
`no, ...resigned expressions on Shannon and Kanon's faces, one couldn't sense any naive hopes that they'd be rescued.`
`That's right.`
` Kinzo was, in the truest sense, ......carrying out these murders at random.`
`In the truest sense, ...he was killing like it was a game to see who would be saved and who would be killed.`
`"Weeell then, whoo'll we go for next nyeh?`
` Nihhihi!!"`
`410 looked at Kyrie for a second.`
`In that second, ...Kyrie was prepared for her own death.`
`But when she readied her golden bow in midair, 410 was looking at someone else over Kyrie's shoulder.`
`...So, as imprudent as it was, Kyrie felt as though she had been saved...`
`Again, an ugly, exploding, popping sound rang throughout the room.`
`...Who was it this time?`
`When Kyrie turned to face the direction of the sound, `
`......she saw blood gushing like a fountain, and Eva lying on her husband's chest.`
`...Of course, her face had been half smashed just like her husband's...`
`410 had mercilessly targeted Eva as she'd clung to her husband's corpse, sobbing.`
`"L-Let go of Nii-san...!!`
` Let go of Nii-san...!!`
` Just stop it, Father!!`
` Just stop this brutality!!"`
`"...Run away, Rosa...`
` Ggh, ack......!"`
`Rosa's objection didn't reach Kinzo as he continued to laugh loudly in the blood-spattered dining hall,`
` and she wasn't able to lessen Krauss's pain at being lifted up by the nape of the neck by 00.`
`So, Rosa had no choice but to use force.`
` She lifted up a chair beside her and gave a warning.`
`"Father...!!`
` Order her to let go of Nii-san!`
` Just stop them from doing this!!"`
`"I cannot.`
` If that is what you desire, then prevent it using your own power.`
` ...Cut a path through to your own fate with your own hands.`
` You who have always hid behind the backs of others in fear, let me see you overcome your weakness one last time in your life...!!`
` Fuhhahahahahahahahaha!!!"`
`"...F-Father...`
` ......Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"`
`'!s0`
`...swung down at the father who had reigned as a symbol of terror for her entire life.`
`It was the greatest...and final...act of bravery and self-control in Rosa's life.`
`What Kinzo had said might have been true.`
`...If she had grasped that courage much sooner,`
` her life might have become more free, unrestrained by anyone else.`
`Then, there was a bursting sound.`
`The sound of Rosa's chair fiercely hitting Kinzo...`
`could not have been this.`
`With the chair still lifted up, `
`......she neatly lost half of her head...and slumped over.`
`Still holding Krauss up with one hand, ...00 had stuck her other hand out towards Rosa.`
`'!s0`
`had constricted Rosa in a helix...`
`and had smashed into her head.`
`"...Defensive Firing.`
` I apologize for the discourtesy of shooting so close to you, sir."`
`"I care not.`
` Hmm, so this makes six people."`
`"Yes, Lord Goldsmith.`
` This makes six people."`
`When she indifferently communicated that, 00 let go of Krauss, whom she had been lifting up this whole time.`
`"Indeed.`
` So, the sacrifices of the first twilight were Eva, Rudolf, Rosa, Natsuhi, Hideyoshi, and Genji.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`It was a massacre that happened in an instant.`
`The interior of the dining hall had been dirtied by blood spatter,`
` ...and the six unlucky victims lay with their heads brutally exposed.`
`In a way that was fitting for that abnormal space, Kinzo's abnormal laugh alone echoed out...`
`"Hahhahahahahaha, wahhahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` The curtain has finally risen!`
` The ceremony to revive Beatrice has begun...!!"`
`"You lucky ones who have managed to escape the first twilight, allow me to introduce you to my friends.`
` Arise, my friend!`
` Ronove...!!"`
`When Kinzo called Ronove's name, the demon butler showed himself in midair, bowing respectfully...`
`"Pleased to meet you, everyone.`
` And good day to those of you I haven't seen for a long time.`
` Pu ku ku ku...!`
` It seems this place is once again spectacularly untidy."`
`"Pay it no mind.`
` It takes a stimulant of this level to wake me from my daydream-like days."`
`"Allow me to introduce my friend, a reliable butler and one of the 72 Great Demons, Ronove."`
`"I am pleased to make your acquaintance."`
`Just who was he making that introduction to?`
`...Krauss and Kyrie, who were still down on their backsides, and Nanjo, Gohda and Kumasawa...`
`could only look up at this middle-aged gentlemen they didn't know in shock...`
`Only Shannon and Kanon seemed to recognize him, and they bowed deeply...`
`"...So, I wasn't able to greet Genji.`
` I hope he was at least able to fulfill his purpose painlessly."`
`"It was an instant death from a direct hit to the head...!`
` He didn't have time to feel the pain."`
`"Is that so?`
` Very well."`
`"Allow me to introduce another friend.`
` Arise, my friend, Virgilia...!!"`
`Once again, a silhouette of someone the relatives didn't know appeared from empty space.`
`She appeared in a refined dress while making an elegant greeting.`
`"......Thank you for summoning me, Master.`
` Although I would rather not have been summoned into a bloody place such as this."`
`"Allow me to introduce her too.`
` This is both my friend and a reliable counselor, Virgilia.`
` ...I desire to borrow your great power as the Witch of the Finite.`
` Lend it to me!"`
`"...Even if I tried to refuse, such a thing wouldn't be permitted for one subordinated by the power of your summonings.`
` As you wish, Master."`
`"......Still, what a fearsome fellow.`
` To think he summoned three of the Chiester Sisters Corps, then me, and even Virgilia...`
` ...Even though it's only in the area of summoning, to think that he surpasses Milady so thoroughly... How frightening.`
` I can't help but shudder at the Ushiromiya blood."`
`"In order to carry out Beatrice's resurrection ceremony, I shall give it my all as a summoner.`
` This still isn't enough.`
` In order to perfectly succeed in the ceremony this time, I shall summon more."`
`"The Pendragon Memorial Troops and Ronove and Virgilia...`
` ...I can still call more... With my magical power, I can still call many more...!!`
`'!s1`
`...one of the 72 demons, Gaap!!"`
`"Gaap...?`
` You can even materialize her...?"`
`"It probably means that the corrosion has advanced even more on this island.`
` ...It had already proceeded far enough to materialize us.`
` By now, we shouldn't be surprised no matter how great a demon he summons."`
`"Has Rokkenjima already been completely sucked into a parallel world then?`
` ......I hope he does not surrender."`
`"......He learned a lot last time, correct?`
` After all this time, he won't surrender over this much.`
` Probably, I should say.`
` Pu ku ku!`
` ......Well then, shall we enjoy the stage we now stand upon?`
` It seems the main character is the Master this time.`
` Let us expect a script of a different flavor than Milady's."`
`When Kinzo strongly concentrated his magical power, ...a pale light gathered in the empty air, twisted,`
` ...and a magic circle was drawn there with a deep-red glow.`
`And with a sound like glass breaking, ......a new demon could be seen there.`
`"...You did well to answer to my call.`
` ...Gaap, one of the 72 Great Demons...!"`
`"......This is one hell of a place you've summoned me to.`
` Did you call me to clean up this blood-stained room,`
` Goldsmith...?"`
`The literally devilish woman, wrapped in a venomous, ominous costume,`
` looked at the scene which should have made her cover her eyes, and twisted her mouth in a grin...`
`"To summon you for such a reason...`
`would be like using a cashmere muffler to mop the floor."`
`"It's been a long time, Gaap.`
` ...To think that a Great Demon such as yourself has finally appeared on this island.`
` ...Perhaps this island is finally submerging completely into fantasy."`
`"This all-star cast is even more surprising than the gruesome state of the room.`
` ......A full three Chiester Sisters, the Great Demon Ronove, the Great Witch Virgilia, and even me."`
`"What's going on?`
` Is this Pandemonium?`
` Are you trying to start a concert from hell or something?`
` ......I see, as a conductor for that, I couldn't think of anyone better than you, Goldsmith."`
`"I will have your assistance as facilitator in the completion of my ceremony to resurrect Beatrice.`
` You have no objections to my summoning contract, correct...?"`
`"Of course not.`
` There's no way I could resist the subordinating power of the legendary Great Summoner, Lord Goldsmith, who forced the famous Great Witch Beatrice to do his bidding."`
`"...I'll assist you.`
` Although I will of course ask a fitting price.`
` ...So?`
` What's my first job?"`
`"Capture the cowards who made it through the first twilight.`
` Fortunately, there are still seven here, aren't there?`
` Nanjo, Shannon, Kanon, Gohda, Kumasawa, Kyrie, and Krauss...!"`
`"Hoh, if these seven are all offered as sacrifices, that's exactly 13 people!`
` Until it's time for the second and later twilights to be carried out, throw them into the cage of sacrifices, *cackle*!!"`
`"......A cashmere mop, huh?`
` Understood."`
`As Gaap shrugged her shoulders, she looked at Krauss, who was still down on his butt.`
`She glared.`
`Then, when she snapped her fingers, ...Krauss was swallowed up by the floor, as though a round pitfall had opened up beneath him.`
`"Uu, waaaaahhh......"`
`"One down."`
`There was no hole in the floor.`
`But it had certainly looked as though Krauss had been swallowed up by a hole and disappeared...`
`"......!!"`
`Searching for her next prey, Gaap's gaze crossed Kyrie's.`
`She snapped her fingers.`
`Kyrie jumped back as though repelled.`
`Her instincts had been right.`
`After all, in the place where she'd been until a second ago, a round, jet-black hole had appeared, the same kind that had swallowed up Krauss.`
`However, before she could catch her balance, another pitfall appeared and swallowed her up.`
`...Even Kyrie had no way of eluding Gaap's capture.`
`"Waahh...!!"`
`When she snapped her fingers again, a shocked Nanjo was swallowed up by the floor and disappeared.`
`When she did it again, 410 let out a short yell and jumped back.`
`This time, a slightly larger pitfall had opened, swallowing both Shannon and Kanon, who had been standing in a line by the door.`
`But because 410 had jumped away from the door, the way was no longer blocked.`
`Instinctively aware that he would be next, Gohda dashed out through that door.`
`Of course, Kumasawa also escaped with lightning speed, chasing after Gohda.`
`As Gaap snapped her fingers over and over,`
` round, jet-black pitfalls opened one after another behind them, chasing them.`
`However, they did nothing but drive the recklessly fleeing pair away...and couldn't swallow them up.`
`Gohda and Kumasawa had escaped in a matter of seconds...`
`"......I've gotten slow.`
` I let two get away."`
`"Don't worry, we are currently locking onto the escapee targets."`
`"Data Link ready.`
` Nihi!`
` Shall we snipe?"`
`"No, I cannot authorize that.`
` They are precious sacrifices.`
` Wait for the Master's authorization."`
`"Great Lord Goldsmith...!`
` We await your orders...!"`
`"It is still too soon for the coming of the second twilight...is what the source of my magical power is whispering to me.`
` It must not be now.`
` Let them do as they please.`
` It isn't as though they can escape from this island."`
`"The source of the Master's magical power is noise and risk and tests of luck.`
` ...Hohohoh, in other words, it means being fickle, it would seem."`
`"*cackle* Perhaps you could also put it that way.`
` Good work, Gaap.`
` Let us steadily advance the ceremony from here on."`
`"......Well then, that is that.`
` Next are my grandchildren.`
` ......I will test them to see whether they are qualified to become my successor.`
` Let's see, how shall I test their qualifications?`
` *cackle*cackle*...!!"`
`"If you decide that they're qualified, `
`...do you intend to abandon Beato's resurrection?"`
`"Of course.`
` And despite that, I will test them.`
` ...Hmph, perhaps a woman cannot understand that contradiction, nor my madness.`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`"......Well apparently, men are as weird as ever.`
` I don't get the very concept of playing around with risk."`
`"Oh my, and I thought you loved that sort of thing."`
`"Of course.`
` If a man whispers to me about dangerous risks and love, I go head over heels.`
` ...But only if he's hot!"`
`"Pu ku ku ku ku ku...!"`
`"Be quiet.`
` Try to refrain from whispering."`
`"Hmph, truly noisy women.`
` But at least they aren't boring.`
` ...This is what makes summoning so pleasant.`
` All of you will bear one side of the scales of noise and risk in my ceremony.`
` That is the work I expect of you...!"`
`Six brutally murdered corpses lay in the dining hall, and it was contaminated with red, gruesome decorations...`
`It was now unimaginable that, until just a second ago, 13 humans had been arranged here in a well-organized manner.`
`Kinzo lined up the famous demons and their subordinates, loudly declared the beginning of a night of overwhelming mass murders,`
` and swore to himself that he would certainly revive Beatrice and open the door to the Golden Land...`
`"Sorry to keep you waiting!!`
` Now the curtain finally rises on the first twilight!!`
` *cackle*!`
` That Kinzo, I see he loves being flashy as usual.`
` So, even that man who can be more persistent than anything when he follows you around...can shine so when on the stage."`
`"Damn...`
` Always killing in a grotesque way, as usual...`
` Smashing half of their heads?!`
` The bad taste you witches and demons have always pisses me off...!"`
`"Smashing half of their heads... I see.`
` So, she's realized that, in the games up until now, that's been the most ideal method of killing."`
`"Ideal?`
` How is such a grotesque way of killing ideal?!"`
`"...Isn't it though?`
` Try and remember the very first game."`
`"You...!`
` So, you're that new demon or whatever that just appeared...`
` Damn, so does this mean that the witch's corrosion continued, and there are now even more creeps wandering around...?!"`
`...The more the witch's corrosion advances, the more Rokkenjima tilts towards the spirit world.`
`That's why strange, insane people keep appearing one by one.`
`This island has been closed off by the typhoon, so no Human can leave it, much less appear as a new character to increase their numbers.`
`But the more the corrosion advances, the more witches and demons can appear, without limit.`
` Increasing one by one.`
`By now, there might be more demons than Humans among the characters appearing in this insane tale.`
` ...Their numbers might be the thing that represents this mad corrosion.`
`Yeah, I'm sure that's true.`
` And the corrosion hasn't just affected the number of people, but apparently their fashion sense as well.`
`If the corrosion advances any further and even more weird people appear, just what in the world will they be wearing?`
` ......It's so scary I can't imagine...`
`...Aaaah, seriously, give me a break...`
`Don't make these weird guys increase in number anymore...!!`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*! I can't do that, they'll keep increasing more and more!!`
` I'll defile the foolish 'closed circle' rule Humans speak of, over and over again...!`
` Welcome to my elegant game,`
` Gaap!"`
`"......It's been a long time, Riiche.`
` Have you been well?`
` ...Why do I ask, you look great!`
` Have you gotten younger?`
` You look two or three hundred years younger than when I last saw you.`
` ......Ah, I see."`
`The demon Grandfather had summoned and introduced as Gaap...`
`took a glance at me, and then grinned as though she'd figured something out on her own.`
`...That smile felt openly obscene.`
`"I guess she's Beato's friend.`
` ...Which means she's gotta be a creep among creeps.`
` By the way, they were saying something about a closed circle or whatever, but what does that mean?"`
`"Serial murder mystery novels that occur in places isolated from the outside world, like Rokkenjima is now, are sometimes called closed circles.`
` Since such a place is isolated from the outside, it's like a circle that's closed.`
` ...Therefore, in general, the characters and suspects are limited in number."`
`"Having new suspect candidates added on one after another from outside the circle goes against the etiquette of mystery novels.`
` ...In other words, the witch is probably trying to desecrate Humans and the mystery genre itself."`
`"......You're Gretel?`
` I see, you look like a wise kid. ...*giggle*`
` I love kids like you.`
` ...You taste so sweet and tantalizing."`
`"Gross.`
` ...Keep the jokes to your clothing."`
`"It's <Devilish Pretty>'s newest, <Jack the Ripper, Christmas Blood>.`
` Sorry for having a style that a country bumpkin from the Human world couldn't understand, okay?"`
`"...At least we know it's well-ventilated.`
` Why don't you add a gap to the head part as well?`
` Let a little air into your brain."`
`"Gaap is always sensitive to the fashions of the spirit world!`
` But this year's fad truly is bold.`
` I think I'll order one sometime...!"`
`"For you, Riiche, I'd recommend Ali-Gray, <Alice and the Graveyard>.`
` Let's go to 666 sometime soon to look at the clothes.`
` You really should drop by the spirit world every now and then."`
`"When this game is over, I'll be sure to do that.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......Still, your two opponents are pretty cute, Riiche."`
`"It looks like this kid has figured out the meaning of the corpses with their heads half smashed.`
` ......Know what that is, girl...?"`
`"...Just now, she told me to remember the first game.`
` ...What did that mean...?"`
`"Just what it sounds like.`
` ...Remember the first twilight of the very first game.`
` ...When the adults' corpses were found in the gardening shed with the magic circle drawn on it.`
` Remember?"`
`Episode 1.`
` The first twilight.`
`Krauss, Rudolf, Kyrie, Rosa, Shannon, and Gohda...`
` All six of them had their heads pulverized and died......`
`"At that time, there were two types of corpses.`
` Some had their faces pulverized, and some had half of their faces pulverized."`
`"That's right.`
` The ones with their faces smashed were Rudolf, Kyrie, Rosa, and Gohda.`
` The ones with the sides of their heads smashed were Krauss and Shannon.`
` ...At the time, I fickly created two types of corpses,`
` but I realized that the former, more atrocious type was actually disadvantageous for me."`
`"...Disadvantageous for you...?`
` ......I see.`
` So that's what this is."`
`That's right.`
`The smashed faces might look atrocious.`
`...But that made it hard to confirm the identity of each person.`
`For example, at that time, Uncle Krauss and Shannon-chan had their heads half smashed.`
`That alone was atrocious enough, but because half of their faces remained, it was easy to confirm their identities.`
`But Dad and the other three were different.`
`Because his face had been completely destroyed, even I, as his son, could only guess by inference that it had to be Dad because of his clothes and the like.`
`...In short, it remained vague until the end whether that really had been Dad's corpse.`
`"If this reasoning battle had taken place during the first game as well,`
` I would probably have claimed that, since the identities of Dad and the rests' bodies were impossible to confirm, there was a possibility that one was a fake corpse.`
` ...After all, Beato didn't state anything in red during that game."`
`"Well done. Correct.`
` ......A faked death is one of the basics of the mystery genre.`
` Even if you make a doctor examine the corpse, you can't trust the results if you suspect him of being the culprit's accomplice.`
` Therefore, corpses that can't guarantee a death for certain are always disadvantageous for the witch's side."`
`"You can suspect faked deaths for all corpses, hypothesizing that one or more of them is the culprit for the crimes that follow.`
` ...It's a move Battler doesn't like, but it's the most elementary move to use against a witch."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` That's why Beato started using the red.`
` ...With the red truth, she can carry out a perfect autopsy."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` That's how it is.`
` Normally, for the first twilight,`
` I would use the red truth right away, confirming the deaths of these six.`
` However, as you know, my battle strategy this time is the complete opposite of previous games, and I'll now use red truth starvation tactics...!"`
`"Since you use it as a grounding from which to counterattack, I will not use the red easily.`
` I'll make you come apart at the seams by using red in just a single place, as rarely as possible!`
` In the end, it means I will permit all rants regarding your guesswork for all the closed rooms,`
` and I only have to smash one of those once with the red truth."`
`"Ihihi!`
` Even though you've always teased me, once I start counterattacking, you now hole up back inside your shell.`
` Quit kidding around."`
`"At any rate, I do not want to use the red, I want to be stingy!`
` I want to bully Battleeer!!`
` But how could I guarantee a death for certain without using red?`
` I worried and worried over it.`
` ...Then, Gaap gave me an idea!`
` It truly is a simple method.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"...I just pointed out something obvious and you hit upon the idea, Riiche.`
` I simply said that you only had to create corpses whose identity could be distinguished and whose complete death would be understood."`
`"Kuhhihihihi!`
` In short, I put those two things together!`
` The face, which is necessary to distinguish their identity, and the pulverization of the head, the vessel for the soul, which is the perfect symbol of death!`
` When I put those two parts neatly together, aah, wonderful!`
` I came up with the perfect answer of corpses with their heads half-smashed!"`
`"I'll bet you love two-colored bread and two-colored ice cream.`
` You're just like a greedy kid..."`
`"......At any rate,`
` even if half of their heads are smashed, we shouldn't assume that they're dead at this point in time."`
`"I get it.`
` ...Since Beato is trying to act tough and is refusing to say anything in red, we've gotta suspect everything.`
` ...Of course, I'm definitely not gonna swallow the theory of magical mass murder by the Chiester ass nee-chans."`
`"*giggle*`
` You sure have gotten prudent.`
` ...If this were the first game, you would've swallowed everything."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` I wouldn't have anything less from a rival.`
` Since there is fortunately no red now, he can imagine whatever he wants and reason over and over again as he likes.`
` At the very end, at the very sweetest spot, I'll cut him down at once with the red truth...!"`
`"......Ah, ......uu......"`
`Silent.`
` Black.`
`Cold.`
` Painful.`
`Rosa regained consciousness bit by bit...`
`And the first thing she thought...was that it would have been better if she hadn't.`
`After all, with her body this cold and hurting, ...the pain grew the more her consciousness returned.`
`It felt like she'd been sleeping on ice-cold marble in the darkness, lying face-down for a long time.`
`...Aaah, this is why I always tell myself.`
`Even if its just for a nap, I've got to at least grab a sofa.`
`I know that, if I naively try to close my eyes for just a second...`
`and end up sleeping on the floor or in the study chair, it'll hurt my body later and make things difficult...`
`Since I slept on such a cold and hard floor, even my bones are ice-cold.`
`Since I slept on such a hard and cold floor, the half of my face pressed down against it hurts a lot.`
`...If I were to look in a mirror right now, I'm sure I'd see an embarrassing mark.`
`I didn't think that just rubbing it would make that mark disappear,`
` but I stroked the hurting side of my face anyway, trying to smooth it over...`
`...I wonder......where this is.`
`I thought it was pitch black, but it looks like it isn't.`
`After all, I can faintly see my own body.`
`...Without a doubt, there was some source of light, `
`but even if I looked up at the ceiling...or else the sky, there was only an expanse of blackness, and I couldn't see a proper light.`
`My body alone was slightly lit, `
`whereas everything else was sunk in darkness...`
` That's what this world was like.`
`It was almost as though Rosa alone had been abandoned in a forgotten world.`
`As her mind grew clearer,`
` she started getting nervous about why she was all alone in a lonely place like this.`
`'!s0`
`...*patter*...`
`*patter*...`
`of footsteps coming towards her.`
`They were light footsteps, so she thought it was probably a kid.`
` She didn't sense anything disturbing, so she wasn't afraid.`
`But they also weren't Maria's footsteps,`
` so, wondering who in the world would be in a darkness like this, she stared in the direction the footsteps were coming from.`
`......As she did, ...a faint, approaching silhouette came into view.`
`It looked...like a child much younger than Maria.`
`...Who is it?`
`I don't know this kid.`
`But, the expression on his face was like a lost child separated from his parents.`
`...As a parent with a daughter herself, Rosa felt as though her chest had been torn apart...`
`『............Uryu.〝`
`"...Ah! ......"`
`The instant the kid muttered that infantile word,`
` ...she felt pain in the half of her face that had started hurting from the cold floor, as though it had been pierced by long, thin, hard needles.`
`Without thinking, she pressed her hand against that side of her face.`
`『...Are you all right...?`
` Does it still hurt...?〝`
`"...Thanks, I'm fine, little guy.`
` ......Where are we...?`
` It's really...cold."`
`『...Come this way...`
` You mustn't stay here...〝`
`That child took my other hand and pulled with a grim expression on his face.`
`...Rosa didn't have a clue what was going on.`
`However, a single honest expression on a child...`
`can often tell the truth better than a hundred words from an adult.`
`She didn't know the situation, but even so, she dashed along with him, still being pulled...`
`But this was a world where nothing could be seen in the darkness except for their own forms.`
`It didn't even really feel like she was moving forwards.`
`...Even though she was running, she couldn't even feel any wind.`
`It was as though she was still inside a nightmare, ...that kind of unreal sensation...`
`So even though I ran, I couldn't maintain my sense of balance, and my legs got tangled and I fell.`
`...Even in a world that didn't feel real, the pain of smashing my face against the cold, hard floor was reality itself.`
`『Uryu, ...are you okay...?〝`
`"Ah, ......nn...`
` ...I'm sorry, my head hurts."`
`...When the kid said that...infantile word 'uryu', pain like being stuck with needles ran though my head again.`
`Even though it had only happened twice, `
`I was somehow able to understand that the child's word was the cause of my pain.`
`...So I said so frankly.`
`"I'm sorry.`
` Could you stop saying 'uryu'...?"`
`『Uryu...〝`
`"Nng, ...wait a second, didn't I tell you to stop...?"`
`『U, ...au, ...uu-!`
` Sorry...〝`
`I had the feeling that this child's apology caused a sharp pain in my forehead this time.`
`......What is...this child...?`
`'!s0`
`...but when I'm around this child, `
`...my head hurts...`
`『...Are you okay...?`
` Let's go, quickly...`
` You mustn't stay here...〝`
`"Why shouldn't I be here...?`
` Hey, where is this...?`
` Who are you?`
` Where is your Mama...?"`
`『......The one who made me...`
`...is you, Mama...〝`
`"...Huh...?"`
`That child stared at me with round eyes.`
`...This kid's Mama......is me...?`
`...Who?`
` Who is...this kid?`
`I don't remember at all.`
`『Did you...forget about me...?`
` You made me, right...?〝`
`"...Wait a second, stop kidding around.`
` ...Maria is my only child.`
` ......That's right, where is Maria?`
` Where is she?!`
` Maria...?!"`
`I suddenly grew nervous about Maria not being there.`
`Why am I all alone in a place like this?`
`Where is Maria?!`
`I'm only able to be me because Maria's there for me...!`
`『...Maria is here, ...but she's not Maria now.`
` It's better if you don't meet with her now.`
` That's better for your sake, and Maria's as well.`
` ......For Maria's sake as well, escape.〝`
`"Huh...?`
` What are you saying?`
` Where is Maria?`
` Maria?!`
` Answer me!!"`
`『Maria's gonna find you...!`
` Come this way, quickly, Mama...!〝`
`That child pulled on my hand again.`
`...He was probably pulling me in the opposite direction from Maria.`
`So I stopped walking.`
`"Let go...!`
` Just who are you...?!`
` What gives you the right to call me Mama...?!"`
`『...Mama is the one who made me...`
` Did you forget...?`
` For Maria's birthday present, `
`...you made me with your own hands, ...did you forget...?〝`
`".........You...couldn't be...`
` ......Maria's...Sakutarou......?!"`
`『Yes......`
` The lion stuffed animal Mama made...!〝`
`'!sd`
`A fierce, sharp pain struck me.`
`It came from the palm he had grasped with his hand.`
`When I knocked his hand away without thinking...and looked at my palm, `
`......a hole the size of a thumb had opened there, and deep-red blood gushed out.`
`...It was a hole so big that I could see through to the other side...`
`『U-Uryu...!`
` Are you okay?!`
` Are you okay?!`
` What's wrong...?!〝`
`Sakutarou noticed my wound and panicked.`
`...As far as I could tell by looking at him, he couldn't understand why my hand had sustained a serious injury.`
`But in my eyes, it felt like I'd been injured because he'd grabbed my hand.`
`Regardless of whether there was malice in him, `
`...I understood that this child was something that would do harm to me, and he instantly seemed eerie...`
`"Go away...!!`
` You have nothing to do with me...!`
` Sakutarou was just a disgusting, crappy stuffed animal, right...?!!`
` I don't know you, I'm not your Mama...!!`
` Go away...!`
` Disappear!!"`
`『......U......yu......〝`
`Slowly, ...the base of Sakutarou's neck...`
`was sliced in a horizontal line.`
`It gaped open, and pitch-black insides peeked out.`
`...No blood poured from it.`
`Only an empty blackness peeked out.`
`Then, ......from the insides of the gash,`
` ...cotton snow poured out, ...and as bits of cotton scattered, he slumped over.`
`Then, ...all that remained was a crumpled yellow cloth...`
`and bits of cotton that looked like sticky, crushed cotton candy.`
`......A lion...stuffed animal.`
`Without a doubt.`
`These were the remains of the Sakutarou stuffed animal I tore apart on that day, while overcome by my emotions.`
`The instant I realized that,`
` ......a long, sharp shriek that could rupture an eardrum tore the world apart...`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!`
` Sakutaroooooooo, Sakutaroooooooooo, waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuhhhh!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuhhhh!!"`
`Like a flood from a broken dam, or like a broken TV...`
`...Maria cried out in a high-pitched voice.`
`......Her voice, which made the ears throb, brought up two emotions in me...`
`One was regret, 'Yeah, I was overcome by my emotions and went overboard'.`
`It was a mother's desire to kneel down right away, hold Maria's head, cry with her and apologize.`
`...In actual fact, I did that right away.`
`I held Maria's head and apologized, crying.`
`But Maria didn't stop crying.`
`On the contrary, she rejected me, the one who had torn her closest friend apart, and pushed me away forcefully with both hands.`
`I had been on my knees in an unnatural position, so I fell backwards easily.`
`Maria scraped together the yellow scraps of cloth and cotton bits, ...buried her face in them, and cried even more...`
`Watching that, another emotion welled up.`
`It welled up rapidly.`
`...And then, it burst.`
`After all, she refused to make up with me even though I'd apologized, and there was nothing else I could do now anyway, and it was all Maria's fault in the first place...!!`
`Since she's too busy playing with stuffed animals all the time like this, she can't make any friends, and that's why people treat her like a freak...!!`
`This is a perfect opportunity to give her some instructive guidance!`
`After all, it's not like I was pampered all the time...!!`
`Everything eventually breaks, is stolen, is destroyed by someone!`
`Even I had lots of toys and treasures stolen, broken, mocked, `
`and thrown away by my brothers and sister and Father and Mother...!!`
`But when I cried about that, ...while I might have shed a few tears, `
`...not once did I sob like this and trouble my parents,`
` throw a tantrum, get mad,`
` hit the floor and kick and make a racket...!!`
`Even though I always wanted to, I thought I'd get in more trouble if I did, so I always, always held it back.`
`It's because I held it back THAT I WAS ABLE TO BECOME THE WONDERFUL ADULT I AM NOW!!!`
`At that moment, I felt something strange.`
`The same feeling as when you use a tool recklessly, and it finally breaks, so that only the base is left.`
`But I wasn't using a tool.`
`I'd just been repeatedly hitting Maria's head with both hands.`
`So, ...I looked at my hands.`
`...From my wrists onwards, my hands had broken off, splintered, ...and disappeared.`
`As though only that part of my arms had become ceramic.`
`...No, as though all of me from the wrists onwards had suddenly become ceramic, and had broken and fallen.`
`They must have gotten filled with cracks because I hit Maria too much...before falling off.`
`...After all, look, ...aren't both of my wrists lying smashed by my feet...?`
`"Ee......?`
` Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkk...!!!"`
`There was no pain.`
`But the shocking sight of my hands breaking off from the wrists onwards made me scream...`
`"Wh-What is this?!`
` What is this?!`
` My hands, ...my hands, my hands...!!`
` Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkkk!!!"`
`".........`
`......This way, ...you won't be able to hit me anymore."`
`Ignoring my confusion, ...Maria spoke with an icy voice,`
` ...slowly moving her hands away from her head, where they had been defending against my barrage...`
`"...What's happening?!`
` My hands, my hands...!!`
` What did you do, Maria, what is this, what on earth is this...?!"`
`Behind Maria's back, a black silhouette had appeared.`
`...It was the silhouette of an adult.`
`......Who?!`
`"...If she'd used those hands for patting her daughter's head, flipping through picture books, or making warm meals,`
` ...it may have been worth leaving them on."`
`"Mama hit my head more than she patted it.`
` ...She never opens picture books.`
` She doesn't even make me food.`
` ...I go to buy it myself."`
`"...But I mustn't go to the same store more than once,`
` mustn't have my face remembered, mustn't talk to the policeman...`
` ......Why?`
` Why is that?`
` Is it my fault?"`
`"Am I not allowed to have Mama pat my head, have picture books read to me,`
` or eat dinner with Mama...?`
` Why not?`
` Why not?!`
` I didn't do anything wrong!!`
` It isn't my fault, it's Mama's!!`
` Mama's fault!!"`
`"Mama wouldn't play with me, but Sakutaro did!`
` He even read books, watched TV and ate meals with me!!`
` He was a much, much better friend than Mama was!!!"`
`"...I-I'm not proud of it...!`
` B-But what am I supposed to do?!`
` I'm busy with work, work I tell you!!`
` You know that, right?!`
` It was unavoidable!!`
` There's nothing I can do!!"`
`"True enough.`
` It was unavoidable.`
` Unavoidable that you'd injure your daughter, tearing her heart apart and making her tears run with blood...!`
` In that case, there's no avoiding the same thing happening again, right here, right now...!!"`
`"Come, MARIA...!`
` Enough of the excuses from a woman who calls herself a mother.`
` Can you forgive her, or not...?!`
` Is she innocent...or guilty?!?!"`
`"I won't forgive her!!`
` Mama's guilty!!`
` I'll make Mama meet the same fate she gave to Sakutaro...!!`
` Take Mama...from the seam at the neck...`
`and tear her apart, so we can see the cotton inside her!!"`
`...Maria's eyes ominously flashed blue.`
`In that instant, invisible, massive arms stuck their fingernails out and tightly grasped Rosa's entire body.`
`As the bones all over her body made a sound like twigs being stepped on, they cracked readily and broke apart.`
`......Rosa had understood vaguely.`
`The massive arms were probably...her own arms, from the time she'd torn Sakutarou apart.`
`From a stuffed animal's perspective, her arms certainly would have been this massive.`
`So she could imagine what would happen next.`
`...The sharp nails stuck deep into the base of her neck, ...and she heard the skin tearing with her own ears.`
`Then, as the two witches watched over her, Rosa's flesh was split in two, top and bottom.`
`When Sakutarou had been torn apart, bits of cotton had flown about like snowflakes.`
`But in Rosa's case, something like black, thick tar came out, filthily flying all over the place.`
`There wasn't even a trace of the red of blood.`
`...It was something black, filthy and thick.`
`It was probably what a bloodless, tearless human kept inside their body.`
`"This is incredible. Hideous!`
` What filthy insides...!`
` Splendidly done, MARIA.`
` Well then, is this enough for your revenge?`
` Can you forgive your mother, or not?`
` Innocent...or guilty...?!!"`
`"I can't forgive her!!`
` Still can't forgive her, she's guilty...!!!"`
`When Beatrice brandished her pipe cane, `
`gold butterflies seeped up and restored Rosa's broken flesh in an instant...`
`"......Ack, ...gwah!`
` *cough*cough*...!"`
`"Feel the depths of your sin, which cannot be repaid by a single human life.`
` And remember your own great sin...!`
` Come, try and remember...!!`
` Remember the scale of your sin...!!"`
`......Hello.`
` ...Is it Mama?`
` ...When will you get home?`
`"I'm sorry.`
` I'm busy with work today, so I'm staying over."`
`...Staying over for work again......?`
` ...Looks like work is tough for you again today, Mama...`
`"Yeah, sorry.`
` I really am busy.`
` I'll be holed up in the company the whole time.`
` I can't even get a breath of outside air.`
` Mama just can't finish her job quickly this time.`
` Unless I give them a better design, I won't be given another job, ...that's how tough this work is.`
` So it'll just have to take some time."`
`...Yeah.`
` I understand.`
` ......I'll be a good girl and watch over the house,`
` so do your best at work, finish it quickly, and come back, okay...?`
`"Thank you for understanding about Mama's work...`
` I promise I'll buy a delicious cake tomorrow and take it home."`
`I don't need cake.`
` ...Instead of taking time to go to the cake store, I'd be happier if you came home that much sooner.`
`"Don't worry.`
` I'll come back quickly, I promise.`
` So let's have some delicious cake together.`
` Let's drink delicious tea together.`
` Let's read a new picture book together.`
` Let's play with that Wolves and Sheep Puzzle I bought the other day.`
` Both of us together.`
` ...I promise."`
`......Yeah, promise.`
` I'll be waiting.`
` ......Do your best at work, Mama...`
`"Hohoh.`
` It's a lonely story, but isn't this mother-daughter love wonderful, with both looking out for the other?`
` Do you see any problem with it, Maria? Rosa?"`
`"............`
`...I-I...kept that promise, didn't I?`
` The next evening, didn't I do as I promised, buying a cake and returning earlier than usual?"`
`"That's not it. I knew...`
` ......That evening,`
` a pay-on-delivery package came for Mama, but there wasn't enough money in the wallet,`
` so I called Mama's company to ask what to do.`
` ...I was told only to call at special times, `
`...but I thought it'd be bad if the package was something important for Mama's work...`
` So I called."`
`"............"`
`"......Then, I was told that Mama had the day off.`
` ...I was told that it had been decided long ago that Mama would have that day off, ......and that she'd gone far away to play.`
` ......I knew.`
` The whole, whole time, ......I knew Mama was lying...!"`
`But you know what? ...Sakutarou scolded me, saying that it wasn't true.`
`Every day, Mama was very busy with work.`
`There was no way she'd abandon Maria and play.`
`He said that the person who told us Mama had the day off must've made some kind of mistake...!`
`That's what Sakutaro said.`
`So I believed it.`
`...I believed it!`
`I love Mama, love her...!`
`Of course, Mama says that she loves me, loves me!!`
`"......Yes.`
` Me too.`
` I love you, Maria..."`
`Rosa let out a deep sigh.`
`...Maybe she felt the weight of her words.`
`Then, she set the receiver on the bedside phone down.`
`The dark room made the starry sky on the ground below the window stand out even more beautifully.`
`On the table in front of the terrace was a very cold wine cooler,`
` and the one she shared a glass with was gazing at the scene below...`
`"......You didn't tell your daughter you were on vacation?"`
`"I told her once, but she was so noisy that I decided not to tell her anymore.`
` It's less work that way."`
`"...If you were worried about your daughter, you didn't have to force yourself to put this in your schedule, right?"`
`"But that way, we'd never get our schedules to match...`
` Didn't I say not to worry about that?"`
`The slender, middle-aged man clad in a white robe gave a small sigh.`
`Rosa reacted instantly to that slight action...`
`"Come on!`
` Let's not talk about my daughter.`
` It'd be a waste of this precious wine."`
`"......I find you fascinating as both a woman and a human being.`
` But for that very reason, `
`I feel bad about taking so much of your time that it strains your relationship with your daughter."`
`"Don't I always tell you not to worry about my relationship with my daughter...?!`
` I try not to talk about her when I'm alone with you, okay?`
` I wouldn't even have phoned from here if it weren't for the noisy drunk laughing stupidly in the lobby downstairs...!"`
`"Rosa-san,`
` can't you reconsider taking sudden vacations like this in the future, for your daughter's sake...?`
` Isn't it enough if we only meet when our schedules match?"`
`"Our schedules will never match up that way, right...?!`
` And I...always want to be with you...!"`
`"That's a child's way of loving.`
` Loving between adults should be a little more stoic.`
` ...Not being able to be with you for long periods of time makes me lonely too.`
` However, I think we can enjoy more than enough adult loving during that limited time."`
`"So you're telling me to go be with my daughter more.`
` ...Be a mother, not a woman?"`
`"...That's what you want too, right?`
` You must also want to spend lots of time with your daughter.`
` I won't run away.`
` I'm trying to say that I think it's sad for you to sacrifice your daughter so you can prioritize your time with me."`
`"............`
`...Did you get back on good terms with your wife?`
` ......Looks like you've had about enough of being separated from her."`
`"I don't want to talk about my wife.`
` Just like you don't want to talk about your daughter."`
`"...I'm sure you think single women with children are a pain."`
`"I've never said anything of the sort before."`
`"......Whenever someone finds out I have a child, they desert me.`
` ...Even if I tell them not to worry about paying that child's living expenses, they all desert me...`
` ...I...thought you understood about my daughter,`
` ......but I guess you don't like single women with children after all..."`
`"That's not what I'm saying.`
` I haven't started to dislike you, Rosa-san.`
` I'm just trying to tell you to take better care of our daughter, something I know you wish for yourself, `
`and I don't want you to hurt yourself by lying to her.`
` That's all I'm saying."`
`"Liar!!!`
` I've just become a burden for you, right?!"`
`"That's not what I'm saying...!"`
`"No, I know, I understand.`
` After being abandoned so many times because of that child, I know,`
` I can tell by your mood, yes, you're already like those other men!!`
` You don't want a woman with a child, you don't want a divorcee, because that's a pain!!"`
`"You don't want to become the parent of a child made with another man, right?`
` Yes, that's right, I totally get it!!`
` I once went out with a man with children, so I really get how you feel...!!`
` That's why...I believed I'd be able to be together with you, a person who understood about my daughter!!"`
`"Gwah!!`
` *cough*, ...*cough*...`
` ...That's right...`
` You were...always in the way..."`
`"............!"`
`"...If only you didn't exist, ...I would've been able to grasp my happiness as a woman long ago...`
` Because you exist, ...you were always in the way of my happiness..."`
`"......Ma...ma......"`
`"......Even I didn't want you to be born...`
` No, that's not it.`
` ...I thought I might be able to build a happy family together with you...`
` ...But that man disappeared right before your birth.`
` He said he'd build a warm family with me, ...tricked me, ...and disappeared from my sight for all eternity...!!"`
`"Only you were left.`
` No love or memories or anything remained!!`
` Where did that man go?`
` He probably just turned my days with him into a warm memory...and met with a new love.`
` And this time, he might have been able to create a happy family...!!`
` And as for me?!`
` I have you!!`
` I can't even look for a new love!!"`
`"Men can go between women as they like and brag about it!`
` But for a woman, for me...!!`
` I have you!!`
` I had you as a stone weight,`
` and because of you, I can't search for romance, I can't find love, and I can only live alone!!"`
`"No, I wasn't even allowed that, I wasn't even allowed a night to drink myself drunk all alone!!`
` Who are you?!`
` Who?!`
` You wasted my life...and won't even let me have a new life... Just who are you to my life?!`
` Die, disappear, I've hated you since the time you were born!!`
` I've hated you since the time you were in my womb!!!`
` I've been doing my best to act like a good mother so that I'd be accepted by the outside world.`
` Yes, I've done my best!!"`
`"As I watched other women of my generation praise being single, sometimes playing with passion or even being joined with someone in love,`
` I was stuck being both a mother and a woman...!!`
` Who ever showed appreciation for my efforts?!`
` No one admired me, no one praised me!!"`
`"I got what I deserved?`
` Secondhand goods?`
` Divorcees should die?`
` You don't want anyone who's not a virgin?!`
` I'm the one who doesn't want anything to do with you, you damn inexperienced virgin brats!!!`
` I was so desperate, I probably looked like a easy woman to you...yes, I was desperate!!`
` You probably couldn't imagine how desperate a woman like me, who's still at the age where she wants to know love, was...`
`when I realized that my time was being filled with work and caring for my child `
`so that I'd probably grow old and end my life still like this!!"`
`"Of course I hate your real father too!`
` But we both share the blame for bringing about that catastrophe.`
` I myself might have been persistent enough to make him run away!`
` But the catastrophes after that were all your fault!`
` When did I ever scold you for that?!`
` Never, riiiiiiiight?!"`
`"The day after one man left me, when I wanted to drink myself dead drunk, was Parent's Day at your school!!`
` When I tried to hide my tear-stained eyes with heavy makeup,`
` the way I felt when you said something off the mark and the whole class laughed at you...`
`is something that not only you, but probably everyone in the world couldn't understand!!`
` I hate you, loathe you...!!!`
` And until now, I've never really loved you even once!!!`
` Whhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"`
`Maria's face was still stiff...`
`If the words really had been blades,`
` ...Maria's whole body would probably be stained red with fresh blood by now.`
`Even after gaining the power of a witch and resolving herself to take revenge for Sakutaro,`
` ...she couldn't stand these curses coming out of her mother's mouth...`
`'!s1`
` ...Uuuwau...`
` Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!"`
`"Ugly.`
` Aaaaaaaahh, how ugly is a woman drowning in lust...!!`
` Now you see this woman's true nature!!`
` Even I, as a witch who has explored the depths of evil, find this most difficult to watch!!"`
`"Aaah, MARIA, now is the time to part from her!!`
` Smash the ugly lump of meat that calls herself your mother...!!`
` It would be pointless for your pure soul to be bound by the chains between mother and daughter any longer!`
` With your own hand!`
` Release your own soul now!!`
` You have now gained the tooth and claw to protect yourself!!"`
`"Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!`
` Now you'll taste the pain I had to go through...!`
` Now I'll take revenge for those days of suffering...!!!"`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Aren't you the one who's been hurting me?!`
` I'm the one who wants revenge...!!`
` I should have done that before you were born!!`
` If only you hadn't been born!!`
` Disappeeeeeeeeeeeaaaar, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!`
`'!s0`
`As Rosa howled, in a way that can only be described by the word *splat*, her upper body was crushed,`
` and in an instant, became something similar to a wrung, bloodstained towel.`
`"Be crushed.`
` I can't forgive you, ...can't forgive you...!!"`
`"Kuhhahhahha...!!`
` What filth.`
` That form suits you...!"`
`...Even though Rosa's waist and below was standing normally,`
` just the upper half of her body had been pinched, and that extreme contrast was bizarre.`
`Then, she fell over, but the instant she fell, her body was restored.`
`"*cough*cough*!`
` *cough*!!`
` ......YOU die.`
` ...Kuhhihihhihhihhi...!"`
`"Come, Maria.`
` Is this the limit of your anger and sadness?`
` Now is the time for revenge!`
` Time for the settlement of anger and sadness...!!`
` Hit her, spit it out!!`
` Push out all of the wedges driven into your chest...and fling them back at her!!!"`
`"Uugaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhoooooooooooooohhhh!!!"`
`Maria's howl was adorned with the ugly sound of flesh and bone being crushed at the same time...`
`As Rosa, who had foully insulted Maria, lay spread-eagled,`
` a neat, perfect circle was cut out of her chest and crushed, as though her chest had been trampled by an invisible elephant.`
`Her heart and her lungs and her ribs were trampled so mercilessly that they were completely indistinguishable.`
`...It might have symbolized the pain in Maria's heart up until today.`
`"So, Maria,`
` are you satisfied now?`
` Can you forgive your mother for her sin?`
` Or not?`
` Innocent?`
` Or guilty?!"`
`"I can't forgive her!!`
` Not yet, not yet!!`
` Mama is guilty, guilty guilty guilty, can't forgive her!!!"`
`"Indeed, how could this level of punishment compare to the bitter days you suffered through?!!`
` Know it, Rosa!`
` Come, try to remember, what form did you have?!`
` Revive in order to be killed!!`
` Be killed over and over, so that your sins can be purified!!!"`
`When Beato waved her cane, the body was restored again,`
` and Rosa sat up, coughing violently in apparent pain...`
`And once again, she spat out curses rejecting Maria.`
`"......You aren't Mama.`
` You're a witch, a witch tormenting me and Mama!!`
` I won't forgive you just because you look like Mama!`
` I won't forgive you!!"`
`"...You're the witch, aren't you...?`
` Always reading creepy books and pretending to play with witches...!!`
` You're the one who should disappeeeeeeeeeeeear!!`
` Because of you, even I'm treated like a freak!`
` Because of you, because of yooooooooooooouuuuuuu!!!`
` If only you hadn't been born!!`
` Don't be born...!!`
` I've hated you since before you were boooooooooooorn!!!"`
`"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!!"`
`......Maria screamed.`
`Was she unable to bear her anger and sadness?`
`Or else, had she been taken over by an indescribable emotion...?`
`It was surely...a cry of hopelessness.`
`And yet, it was a reality that had to be accepted.`
`Maria knew.`
`She knew that she was thought of as a burden.`
`But even though she herself had known that, she didn't believe it.`
`She'd believed that her mother loved her...and had done her best to positively interpret several events that could have made her doubt this, `
`...trusting and clinging to her mother's love.`
`But, ......she had no one except Mama.`
`Even so, she really did like Mama...`
`and wanted to return to the days when she'd believed that Mama loved her...`
`So I howled...`
`I'll erase all of it.`
`I won't accept it.`
` I'll deny it.`
`I'll deny the mother who says these things, the black witch who makes her say them,`
` and......the part of myself that can't forgive my mother...!!!`
`But I can't deny it!`
`This is reality, fact, the truth, the answer.`
`Without any mistake, this is absolute...reality!!`
`Maria turned Rosa into a lump of meat over and over.`
`Over and over, in the dark world that reflected her heart,`
` rang the ugly sound of flesh and bone being torn apart, which would make anyone want to cover their ears...`
`Each time, Beatrice revived Rosa.`
`She dragged her back into the world of endless torture, which could not be escaped from even by death.`
`This was the true, deepest hell that the Endless Witch Beatrice could create.`
`However, this world was not made endless by Beatrice's will.`
`...Because every time Rosa turned into a lump of meat, she asked the same question to Maria.`
`*cackle*cackle*!`
` Are you satisfied, MARIA?!`
` Can your anger forgive your mother yet?!"`
`"How could I forgive her, how could I forgive her?!!`
` I won't forgive, won't forgive her!!`
` I'll teach you all of my pain...!!`
` Teach you much, much more...!!`
` It's still not enough, not close to enough...!!`
` Since I was born, since before I was born...!!`
` I can't get rid of the anger and sadness of being neglected so long...!!"`
`"......Fuhi, hahaha...`
` ...I hate you, haaate you...`
` Fuhihiha, haha..."`
`"Ugaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!"`
`Revive over and over again.`
`Return to a meat lump over and over again.`
`In various ways, she crushed, smashed, beat, and tore to bits.`
`Flying blood spatter and flesh turned the once pitch-black world into a world with mixed red and black.`
`Maria's anger still hadn't calmed down.`
`It was as though she was spitting out all of the suppressed rage from the time of her birth until today.`
`If that all became poison to her heart...`
`Then would the repeated murder of her mother purify her soul...?`
`Would even this wasteful murder save her soul, at least a little bit...?`
`This endless torture...might have become a slight diversion from her sad, unrewarded life.`
`After all, ...it seemed that she'd finally been able to regain her smile.`
`"Learn it!!`
` You, the source of my unhappiness!!`
` Learn it!!`
` Learn that what you're feeling is nothing compared to my pain!!`
` Kihhihihahhahahaha!!`
` What's wrong?`
` Why'd you stop laughing?!`
` Try and laaaaaaauuugh!!"`
`"...Fuhi, fuhihihi...`
` Gyack...!!!"`
`Half of her skull collapsed.`
`Eyeballs flew out and black cranial fluid gushed.`
`Fragments of teeth scattered.`
`"Come on, revive...!!`
` Try and laugh...!!`
` Come on, come oooooon!!!"`
`"......Ihi, ...ihi.`
` ...Gyaggh!!"`
`Her whole chest along with her ribs turned inside out, exposing her filthy innards.`
`All of them writhed, like some kind of impure creature.`
`"Come on, come on, come on!!`
` Revive!!`
` Can you still laugh?`
` Can you still laugh?!`
` Kihhihihihihi?!"`
`"............"`
`Rosa couldn't laugh anymore.`
`...But her face was laughing.`
`It was filled with a twisted laugh...and covered with a malice that rejected her unwanted daughter.`
`I erased that laughing voice.`
`Next, I'll erase that laughing face.`
`I'll erase it, I'll crush it, I'll tear it to bits...!!`
`"Laugh, try and laugh, Mama...!!`
` Kihhihihihihhahahahahahahahaha?!`
` What's wrong, Mama, let's wake up, read a picture book, and go take a walk...!!`
` Let's say we love each other, make a promise for next Sunday, let's go shopping, let's go to the movies...!!`
` And of course you'll break that promise!!"`
`"Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihi, isn't it fun, Mama? Isn't it fun, Mama? I'm playing with Mama now, right?!!`
` Kihhihhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"`
`"That's right, you are now playing with your mother, having fun with her...!!`
` Tell me how you feel right now!`
` I don't believe it's anger or sadness or pain...!"`
`"Yeah, that's right, I get it, Beatrice...!!`
` I'm having a lot of fun now... I'm playing with Mama, so it's tons of fun!!`
` And even though I'm killing Mama over and over again, she can be revived with just a single bit of magic!!`
` I took care of my toys because I couldn't fix them if they broke...!!`
` But if the toy could be fixed, I'd want to break it over and over again!!`
` Kihhihihihihihihihihihihi!!`
` Hihihihihihi, hihi......"`
`"...But......Sakutaro won't be fixed.`
` ...He can't be fixed...... `
`......Because Mama, who made him, `
`...Mama, who gave birth to him, `
`...won't acknowledge him."`
`"............"`
`"I wasn't acknowledged by Mama either, was I...?`
` ...So the broken Maria won't be fixed either.`
` ............`
`......Kihihihi.`
` Kihhihihihihihihihihihihi!!`
` Kyahhahahahahyahhyahhyahhyah!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaahhh, it's fun, it's fun, Mama...!!`
` Since it's gotten so fun, I'm somehow starting to feel that I could forgive you...!`
` Hey, Beato, this is a veeery strange feeling...!`
` Why?`
` Why am I starting to feel like I can forgive Mama?!"`
`"That enlightened state is only reached by witches who have gained the power to control life and death at will.`
` ...You can kill at any time.`
` You can revive her if needed.`
` If that's a pain, then it's all right to kill her again...!`
` Once you've learned that you can do this at any time by simply snapping your fingers, all nonsense spoken in the world of humans becomes a chirping of insects that isn't worth listening to...!"`
`"You didn't begin to think about forgiving your mother because your eyes were opened to your mother's love.`
` It was because now,`
` you stand at the entrance to the world of true witches...!!`
` Welcome, Maria, to the profound and sweet world of witches!!"`
`"I've done it...!!`
` Maria is no longer Maria...!!`
` I may still be an apprentice, but I've surpassed the Human world...!`
` I am now...the apprentice Witch of Origins, MARIA...!!!`
` There's nothing to frustrate me, nothing to make me sad!"`
`"Mama, I'll forgive you.`
` I'm sure I can forgive you!`
` I think I'll be able to forgive you after doing just a bit more!!`
` After all, I'm a witch!!`
` Ki, ...hihhihihhihhihhihhihhihhi!`
`'!s0`
`hi`
`hi`
`hi`
`h`
`!!!"`
`Maria would probably forgive her mother eventually.`
`...After brutally murdering her countless times.`
` Graciously.`
`"......Whoa, that last thunder was loud.`
` Must've been pretty close, right?"`
`"Looks like it.`
` No matter how old you get, thunder still makes you jump."`
`Battler was looking at the dark night through a crack in the curtains.`
`Every once in a while, a pale, white lightning bolt would shine, and he seemed to be enjoying it.`
`"............"`
`"...Oh?`
` Look, you were so noisy, you woke Maria up.`
` Sorry, Maria.`
` Sorry Battler's so freaking loud...!"`
`"What the hell, so it's my fault?`
` Sorry, Maria.`
` It's okay to go back to sleep.`
` Good night."`
`Maria was a bit hazy, with drowsy eyes.`
`...She was probably half-asleep and couldn't think straight.`
`".........Uu-.`
` ...That's okay.`
` I won't sleep."`
`"Nah, go ahead and sleep.`
` You're still half-asleep, aren't you?`
` Ihihi."`
`"...I'm not half-asleep!`
` ......Uu-!!"`
`"Come on, you're totally half-asleep, aren't you?`
` Sleep, sleeeep."`
`"I'm not half-asleep! Not half-asleep!!`
` Uu-uu-!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Quit it, stupid Battler...!`
` Aah, sheesh, what are you thinking, getting a kid who's just woken up into a bad mood...?!"`
`"I'm not half-asleep!`
` Not half-asleep!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"I understand, Maria-chan...`
` You aren't half-asleep.`
` So calm down..."`
`"Not half-asleep, not half-asleep!!`
` Uu-!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`Maybe it was because of her delicate mental state after waking up, but Maria suddenly threw a tantrum.`
`Battler had only been trying to tease her a bit,`
` so he was confused by this extreme overreaction.`
`George held her head, trying to calm her down, but Maria's tantrum wasn't going to be quelled easily.`
`Battler and Jessica were trying to push the blame on each other, saying 'It's your fault' 'It's your fault too'.`
`"Hey, be quiet, you two...!`
` Jessica-chan, there was still some hot water in the pot, right?`
` Could you make some tea for her?`
` ......Did you calm down,`
` Maria-chan?"`
`"......Uuuu---."`
`It looked like her tantrum was dying down bit by bit,`
` but she still glared at Battler, who had made fun of her, with sharp eyes.`
`"Battler-kun was just kidding around.`
` He doesn't really think you're half-asleep.`
` So calm down.`
` Okay?`
` ............?"`
`"............"`
`George noticed.`
`...Maria was staring at Battler with incredible eyes.`
`And, ...despite having just displayed all that emotion, ...she laughed in a small voice.`
`Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
`Instead of a laugh, it seemed more like she was muttering while thinking about, `
`or else counting, each 'hi'.`
`As though each time she said 'hi', something brutal would happen over and over.`
`George felt something creepy for just an instant,`
` ...but he couldn't spot the madness that peeked out of the depths of the girl's eyes for just a moment.`
`After a short period of stunned silence on George's part,`
` Maria stopped her bizarre, quiet laugh and pushed George's arm aside, as though telling him to let go.`
`"......Uu-.`
` I'll forgive him."`
`"R-Really?`
` You're such a good girl, Maria.`
` ...Battler-kun, Maria-chan forgave you.`
` Make up."`
`"Yeah, sorry for teasing you.`
` Forgive me..."`
`"Hey, Maria...`
` Let's make some cafe au lait as a sign that you've made up.`
` I'll put in lots of sugar, so it'll be sweet."`
`"I don't need it.`
` But I'll forgive you.`
` ......Because I'm a witch.`
` ...Kihihihi."`
`One more time, Maria laughed in a creepy, quiet voice.`
`But it was only for a very short time, so Battler and Jessica didn't think much of it.`
`...They decided to think that...`
`it had probably only looked that way when the lightning lit her cheek with a pale, white light for an instant.`
`At that time, they could hear the sound of loud footsteps coming from the hall.`
`It was already about 10:30, late at night.`
`Late at night is usually a time when you aren't supposed to be disturbed.`
`Hearing footsteps like that at this time was far from calming...`
`Then, along with a clearly ominous knock that repeated fiercely, they could hear Gohda and Kumasawa's voices.`
`...That clearly told them that this was an abnormal situation.`
`"Children...!!`
` Are you there? Are you there?!`
` It's Gohda!"`
`"It's Kumasawa, is everyone okay?!`
` Aaaaaaah, what has happened, what has happened...?!"`
`When George opened the door, the two of them tumbled in, sopping wet.`
`It looked like they had dashed here from the mansion without an umbrella.`
`"Wh-What's wrong, you two...?`
` Did something happen...?!"`
`"I-It was, it was...!!`
` Th-Th-The Master and Krauss-sama, and everyone,`
` awawawawawawa`
`...It was...a pitch-black room.`
`There were no windows, and with the weak light bulb, one could just barely make out the state of things around them.`
`It appeared to be an old forgotten underground storage room, with some kind of dusty furniture haphazardly thrown into it...`
`However, even with just a little light, one could at least make out that it probably wasn't a storage room.`
`...After all, that room was sealed off with iron bars.`
`"...Where...is this......?"`
`"I don't know...`
` ...Could this be underneath the mansion...?`
` Has there always been a room like this...directly underneath the dining hall...?"`
`They had dropped into what had appeared to be a pit, `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~falling~ib~`
` into this room.`
`Therefore, it was natural to assume that this room was directly under the dining hall.`
`...However, not even Krauss could bring himself to believe that there were pitfalls rigged in his beloved dining hall, where he had enjoyed his meals for years, `
`...and that this dungeon-like room lay directly beneath it.`
`But the ceiling above was of crude stone craftsmanship, ...and they couldn't understand how they could've fallen from somewhere up there.`
`No, all five people who had been dropped here thought the same thing.`
`Although they'd had the sensation of falling into a pit,`
` ...there was no way there could be pitfalls in the dining hall, nor could this dungeon-like place be directly under it.`
`...But, the truth was that they actually had fallen into this place and were locked in.`
`...So, ...they were confused.`
`"...It is lucky that no one was hurt after falling from such a height..."`
`"......Shannon, Kanon.`
` Did either of you two know about this room...?"`
`"...No.`
` We did not know of this room either."`
`".........Really...?"`
`"R-Really...`
` We really...don't know about a room like this..."`
`Despite their age, Kyrie apparently wouldn't have found it odd if they,`
` as servants allowed to wear the One-Winged Eagle, might know of the mansion's secret tricks.`
`There was a long silence, as if Krauss was evaluating their answer...`
`"...No, it's probably true that you don't know.`
` After all, this is the clean-freak Shannon we're talking about.`
` If she knew about this room, she'd probably scrub this place until it was sparkling.`
` The filth of this room is proof that you two don't know of it.`
` ...More importantly, I think we should worry about what to do next."`
`"E-Exactly...`
` We need to call the police, ...o-or rather administer first aid as soon as possible..."`
`Nanjo's words were hollow.`
`...Obviously.`
`Six people had been killed in the dining hall.`
`Everybody had seen the exact moment when they'd been killed.`
`And since half of their heads had been destroyed,`
` anyone could tell that the deaths had been instant with just a single glance.`
`Everyone understood that first aid no longer held any meaning...`
`"Thank you, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...We already understand that our partners are no longer alive.`
` ......Thanks for trying to console us by mentioning first aid."`
`"......Natsuhi...`
`.................."`
`Once again, a gloomy silence dominated the atmosphere.`
`But Krauss shook his head harshly over and over and, for the time being, `
`decided to forget the pain of losing his wife, and to dedicate himself to figuring out where they were.`
`"Everyone, listen to me.`
` .........Father is...`
`...hopeless now.`
` We've passed the point...`
`of searching for a reason or an explanation that can be expressed in words."`
`Nobody answered.`
`...Without any kind of discussion or mercy, six people had been killed in an instant.`
`And, Kinzo had even been so bold as to proclaim that we'd become sacrifices for a ceremony involving 13 murders.`
`...Since we've been locked up in this place,`
` we too will probably become the ceremony's next sacrifices soon.`
`Around this time, our eyes became used to the darkness...`
`and, bit by bit, we were able to understand more about the dungeon's interior.`
`...What we thought was furniture haphazardly left in the dungeon turned out not to be furniture at all.`
`They were...things like small cages to lock people in, restraints, or else...torture racks.`
`...At any rate, it was obvious that it was eerier than a mere jail cell.`
`Since the objects were rusted together and coated in thick dust, there was no doubt that they had been forgotten.`
`...Maybe you could even call these things Kinzo's sealed and forgotten madness.`
`However, we had been locked away in this room.`
`...Those objects weren't exactly comforting to people who were locked up,`
` hoping to be released without harm...`
`"...At any rate, let's get out of here.`
` We've lost loved ones and friends and would like to spend some time shedding tears, `
`but more than that, ...I'm worried about the children."`
`"......I-I wonder if the children are safe..."`
`"All we can do is pray...`
` ...Come to think of it, Kumasawa and Gohda aren't here."`
`"Perhaps...they were able to get away safely..."`
`"You never know.`
` It would be a relief if they were able to meet up with the children..."`
`"When the going gets tough, Gohda-san is reliable, and Kumasawa-san is knowledgeable and calm...`
` I'm sure they'll be able to help the children..."`
`"...Hahahaha.`
` Yes, that certainly would be comforting."`
`Shannon and Krauss smiled bitterly a little.`
`But they quickly realized how improper that was and stopped, clearing their throats.`
`"......We can't be optimistic, Nee-san.`
` There's a chance they've already been attacked after we were."`
`"I agree.`
` What Father carried out in the dining hall was...`
`the six murders of the first twilight from the witch's epitaph, right?"`
`"Then, the second twilight is to 'Tear apart the two who are close'.`
` ...We can't deny the possibility that Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san may have been killed after escaping together.`
` ...We can't cling to the optimistic idea that they must've gotten to the guesthouse and are protecting the children."`
`Kyrie coldly analyzed the worst-case scenario.`
`For her, it was heartbreaking to have lost her beloved husband.`
`...But right now, the most important thing was protecting that husband's son, `
`along with the other children, from becoming the insane Family Head's sacrifices.`
`She overcame her sadness with the parental urge to protect children from sorrow.`
`...It seemed that both Kyrie and Krauss were strong enough to forget about their grief, if only for the time being...`
`They would let their tears flow later.`
`...In order to protect the children, they had to act.`
`"Anyway, let's get out of here...`
` It seems to be a rather old cell.`
` Couldn't we break the bars with something?`
` Let's try searching the entire room for some way to escape."`
`"I wonder if there are any torture tools lying around all these torture cages.`
` They might be useful as weapons, or to break the bars."`
`Kyrie pulled a lighter from her pocket.`
`She herself didn't smoke, but she kept one tucked away in her pocket to light Rudolf's cigarettes.`
`...It was an extremely valuable source of light for searching in this dim dungeon.`
`"Shannon, help Kyrie-san search the room.`
` Kanon, you help me check out the bars.`
` This is a very old cell.`
` The bars could be loose."`
`"...W-What should I help with...?"`
`"Please just keep up your strength.`
` ...Father will probably come soon.`
` You're the only one whose words will reach him.`
`"...My words...will no longer reach him, I think.`
` I'm sorry, but I don't believe I will be of any use..."`
`"Then lend us your expertise as a doctor.`
` ......I wonder if there exists a drug that can make people instantly faint."`
`"...A drug that makes people instantly faint...?`
` What are you talking about...?"`
`"We believe we fell through a pit and landed in this dungeon.`
` ...In that panic-stricken moment, that's what we believed happened."`
`"...But I measured the breadth of this room and came to a realization.`
` This dungeon can't be underneath the dining hall."`
`"Why do you say that...?"`
`"......You're an idiot, Nee-san.`
` Compared to the dining hall, this dungeon is too cramped."`
`"Exactly.`
` The first person to fall was Krauss nii-san.`
` The second was myself.`
` When you fell into this room, did you move from that spot, Krauss nii-san?"`
`"...It's embarrassing to say, but the landing hurt, and I lay there groaning in pain.`
` Immediately after that, Kyrie-san came crashing down next to me."`
`"The distance between where we were standing and the places where we landed is clearly off."`
`"C-Certainly, when you put it that way.`
` ...I was the next to fall, so I remember fairly well where you two were standing.`
` ...The distance between you two in the dining hall might have been greater than this entire room."`
`"We fell into a pit and directly dropped down here.`
` ...It's not like we fell into multiple interlocking pipes and were all collected here.`
` The fall was instant, wasn't it?`
` I don't remember rolling around in some sort of elaborate water pipe system."`
`"......True, we can't explain it with a pitfall.`
` ...What a strange tale."`
`"What does that have to do...with a drug that makes people instantly faint, like Kyrie-sama was talking about...?"`
`"...............`
`...Kyrie-sama is probably thinking that there were no pitfalls in the dining hall, correct?"`
`"But in reality, we did fall."`
`"More accurately, we felt as though we fell into pits.`
` ...That was only natural.`
` After all, we experienced something that couldn't be described any other way."`
`"I-I see...`
` In other words, this is what you want to say...`
` ...We did not fall into pits...`
` ...We were attacked with something like a blowdart, for example, and lost consciousness instantly.`
` It could be that we just remember the instant we fell to the floor as though it were falling through a pit..."`
`"......I see.`
`"...Nee-san,`
` do you have a watch?"`
`"Huh?`
` ......Y-Yes.`
` I have a pocket watch.`
` ......Umm, it's about 22:40."`
`"......Yes.`
` My watch says the same.`
` ...In short, it's only been a bit more than ten minutes since that uproar in the dining hall, at most."`
`"My watch has the same time.`
` ......That's much too short a time to knock us out and carry us somewhere.`
` ......Judging only from the time, it's reasonable to assume that we did fall through a hole leading directly underneath the dining hall."`
`"They could've tampered with the watch hands as much as they wanted.`
` ...While we were passed out, they may have wound everyone's watches back.`
` We're incapable of proving that this possibility doesn't exist."`
`"...............`
`Whether it was a pitfall or a drug that induces fainting, `
`...it does not change the fact that we need to be on guard..."`
`"...Well then, Doctor Nanjo,`
` is there a drug that can do that?"`
`"Well......`
`  ...It's the same as your reasoning, Kyrie-san.`
` ...I cannot prove that there isn't a drug with that effect that I don't know about."`
`"...As they say, you can never be too careful.`
` ...Sorry, it was a useless question.`
` I just thought that with my hypothesis, I could suggest that this dungeon might not necessarily be directly underneath the dining hall."`
`"I see...`
` ...There's always the possibility that we were carried off to `
`the hidden mansion they say Father built in the middle of the forest.`
` ...If we can escape from here and get outside, then we'll know.`
` We'll save worrying about that until after we get out."`
`"Exactly.`
` I'm truly sorry.`
` I've only been asking about and prying into useless things."`
`"No, it's quite promising.`
` If you notice anything else, please tell us.`
` It might become a hint to escaping from here."`
`"......Rudolf was always talking about you.`
` He said he was always surprised by your ideas, and they would sometimes give him valuable hints.`
` ...The fact that you're here is a blessing within a tragedy."`
`"...Thank you.`
` I heard something from Rudolf-san as well.`
` He said that you usually just swagger about, but when things get serious, you overflow with a sense of responsibility and can be a very dependable older brother."`
`"Hahaha, ...that's too kind.`
` ......Dammit, at any rate, these iron bars won't even budge.`
` How are things on your end, Kanon?"`
`"......No, this side is no better."`
`Krauss and Kanon tried wiggling the bars in various ways.`
`...There were a few bars that could be twisted...`
`and a few had enough space to rattle a little bit around in, `
`but they couldn't be broken with human strength alone.`
`...However, there was still hope if they could use some kind of lever-like tool.`
`It was still far too early to give up yet.`
`The children's lives were hanging in the balance.`
`...Even if there was no hope, they couldn't stop their struggle.`
`And, it was better for them to act this way.`
`...If they were to stop, ...there's no doubt they'd once again be overcome by the grief of losing their loved ones and curl up, clutching their knees...`
`"How are you doing, Kyrie-san?`
` Find anything?"`
`"...I've found some small stones that we could hold onto and hide.`
` Something like this could probably be used as a weapon.`
` Though, it'd probably be impossible to whittle down those iron bars with them.`
` How about you, Shannon-chan...?"`
`"No, nothing.`
` ......Ah, this is...`
`...a phone."`
`"I doubt it's connected.`
` ...But, we might be able to use the cord as some form of string-based weapon.`
` If we break it, we could take out the metal parts.`
` Krauss Nii-san, there's a keyhole for opening the bars, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` It's a pretty large hole, quite old fashioned.`
` ...If we twist some wire into it, we just might be able to pick it."`
`"We might be able to use the metal parts of the phone as a substitute for something.`
` ...This phone will become our weapon."`
`"It's just like investing.`
` Our weapon is information."`
`Krauss and Kyrie laughed together at how they hadn't even thought of using the phone as a means of communication.`
`"......What are you doing, Nee-san?"`
`"Ah, ...um, ...I just wondered if maybe the phone was w-working..."`
`"......You dummy, Nee-san.`
` (*whisper*)"`
`"Huh...?`
` ......What?"`
`At that point, Shannon let out a small, surprised cry.`
`"K-Kyrie-sama...!`
` ...This phone, it's connected."`
`"What did you say...?"`
`It was like when people move out of an office, taking everything with them, leaving only the telephone behind...`
` That's the feeling the phone gave off, having been left in the corner of the cell.`
`The cord was wound into a coil, the tip of it being swallowed by the wall,`
` and just looking at it, there was no reason to assume that it wasn't hooked up.`
`...But, to think that it was actually was...`
`Kyrie took the receiver from Shannon and pressed it to her ear.`
`Certainly, the electric hum of a phone was a familiar sound.`
`...And this phone was certainly live.`
`"Wh-What good luck...!`
` Let's contact the police...!"`
`"Hold on...!`
` This is too good to be true.`
` Could it be bugged...?!"`
`"If they were planning a trick like that, normally they would cut the telephone line.`
` ...There's actually a good possibility that they overlooked this.`
` If they notice, they might actually cut the line this time.`
` There's nothing we could tell the police that would be problematic for us if they overheard."`
`...Surely, that was true.`
`The point of a wiretap is to overhear some important piece of information,`
` but the way things were right then, she couldn't think of a single thing that would come up in a conversation to the outside world that might be troublesome to have overheard.`
`Kyrie instantly concluded that it was more likely to be a mistake on Kinzo's part than a trap...`
`"Y-You do have a point...`
` I believe you start with 0 to make calls through the external line..."`
`"Kanon-kun, I'm going to make a phone call, so will you watch how things are out there for me?`
` If you sense somebody coming, let me know."`
`"Y-Yes...!"`
`Kanon raced off towards the iron bars, silenced his breathing, and strained his ears...`
`As everyone present watched her, Kyrie dialed 110...`
`However, she pushed the hook down and re-dialed many times.`
`...It didn't seem to be working very well.`
`"...The outside line begins with 0?`
` 110 would be 0110 then, right?`
` It doesn't seem to want to go through..."`
`"Hand it over here, I'll try to call...`
`..............."`
`Krauss took the receiver in Kyrie's place and tested various things...`
`But in the end, they were unable to notify the police...`
`The phone itself was definitely live, but the circuit was apparently cut somewhere.`
`...Did this mean that 'they' were not so naive?`
`"...So it's useless after all..."`
`"It means our enemies aren't naive either...`
`........."`
`Kyrie let out a deep sigh, leaned against the wall, and hung her head for a while.`
`As cool-thinking as she was, for a brief moment, she may actually have had the naive hope that the phone might actually work.`
`...She sneered at herself mockingly for holding onto that naive hope for even a single moment.`
`Then, ...she remembered just what was happening here.`
`...Truth be told, ...even after being shown a scene like that right before her eyes...or rather, exactly because of that...`
`...She still couldn't think of that gruesome mass murder as something real...`
`It was less that she couldn't believe it...and more that she didn't want to.`
`Ushiromiya Kinzo killed six family members.`
`He summoned strange, witch-like, demon-like people...`
`...right out of thin air, `
`......and with something like magic, `
`...began to kill people one after another......`
`............`
`It's just all so screwed up.`
`...Even though she definitely saw it, there was no way she could accept that spectacle...`
`"......There's no way that's what happened.`
` ......Those were obviously Father's friends or something.`
` ...They just hid somewhere in the dining hall beforehand and used some tricks to appear suddenly and fool us.`
` ...There's no other way to explain something as screwed up as that."`
`But when those six had had their heads blown apart, a golden arrow had flown around and around the room.`
`...That had truly looked like...`
`...magic.`
`Was that another thing we just saw wrong?`
`There's no way it was magic.`
` It was definitely some kind of setup.`
`...Since those heads were smashed, there's no doubt it was some kind of explosive.`
`For example, a styrene toy plane like they sell at candy stores, painted gold, `
`...and with a powerful explosive loaded onto the end of it.`
`...However, though it had seemed to be flying about at random, `
`Kyrie couldn't imagine that after being fired six times, each time had perfectly hit the victims square in the head, one after the other.`
`It couldn't be that there was a computer control system for finding and hitting targets,`
` making it a high-tech styrene plane on the same level as a guided missile, right...?`
`"......Would he invest such a large amount of money into developing some stupid trick like that?`
` ...For that insane sideshow...?`
` Does this take us back to the old 'I wouldn't put it past Father'...?"`
`A number of mysterious people appeared out of thin air, `
`...six people had their heads demolished by a mysterious golden flying object, `
`...and the five of us were locked away in a mysterious dungeon by a mysterious set of pitfalls, or else put to sleep by some fainting poison dart...`
`The family conference started a bit after 22:00.`
`...It's only been a bit more than 30 minutes since then.`
`Most likely, `
`even though I witnessed it myself, `
`...that event took place in such a short period of time, so I still can't understand it, and I still can't come to grips with it.`
`For argument's sake, even if we did get ahold of the police, `
`it would probably be impossible for anybody to accurately explain what we saw...`
`Even though I saw it just now,`
` ...my brain's fried, and I have no confidence in what I saw myself...`
`Kyrie tried her hardest to cheer herself out of her overwhelming confusion, to just hold onto her sanity...`
`"Dammit, ...what's going on here, `
`...dammit, ...dammit...!"`
`Krauss started to become desperate, hitting the hook multiple times and resetting the dial.`
`...Krauss had also been feigning composure, but he was unable to hide his panic.`
`The more he retried the dial, the more the pretense of serenity peeled away...`
`I don't know what's going on anymore...`
`Kyrie couldn't help but pray that the events that had just occurred were a dream...`
`......At that time, the look on Krauss's face changed.`
`"Nn, ...o-oh...!`
` I got through, I got through...!`
` It's ringing...!"`
`"R-Really, Krauss-san...?!"`
`"I see, how shallow, old man...!`
` Since we can't contact the police, the external line has probably been cut, but he failed to sever the internal line...!"`
`"The internal line?`
` Krauss-san, where did you call...?!"`
`"The guesthouse.`
` I'm calling the room where Jessica and the rest are staying...!`
` ...Ah?!`
` Hello!`
` Hello?!`
` It's me...!`
` You're...!`
` Gohda?!`
` Is Jessica there, is she safe...?!!"`
`"K-Krauss-sama...!!`
` I'm so glad you're safe!!`
` Yes!`
` Lady Jessica and the other children are here as well, safe and unharmed...!"`
`"Dad!!`
` Is it Dad?!`
` I'm so glad you're okay...!!`
` Is Mom okay?!`
` Is she there?!"`
`"......Your......"`
`Krauss choked on his words.`
`...Krauss had clearly seen Natushi's head crushed, had seen her killed right before his eyes...`
`Eventually, he was going to have to tell that to Jessica.`
`...However, Krauss began to fret over whether he should tell her now or not...and lost his words.`
`...But even that was an answer under these circumstances...`
`"...I don't know about your mother...`
` ...Let's pray for her safety.`
` ...For now, I'm just glad you're safe.`
`"............Yeah.`
` ...I understand.`
` ......I'm sorry...for asking."`
`Jessica's voice was filled with tears...`
`...Krauss was certain now.`
`Jessica and the rest had heard everything, start to finish, after meeting up with Gohda and Kumasawa at the guesthouse...`
`When they learned that six people had been killed,`
` they must have been anxious to rush over to the dining hall.`
`......Luckily, he'd been able to call before they'd stormed off towards the mansion.`
`Krauss was relieved at this good timing during such a tragedy...`
`"We have Kyrie-san and Doctor Nanjo, as well as Shannon and Kanon here.`
` We've been locked in a place that's like a dungeon, but don't worry.`
` We'll figure something out."`
`"A dungeon?`
` Where?!`
` We'll come and save you...!!"`
`"Unfortunately, we can't figure out where this is either.`
` We think it may be under the dining hall, but that might not be true.`
` ......Anyway, Jessica,`
` you must stay where you are.`
` You've heard about what happened from Gohda and Kumasawa, yes?"`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, jes_4e44:`
`...everyone..."`
`"Grandfather isn't in a sane state of mind right now.`
` If you encounter him, you'll be in danger.`
` You might be killed...!`
` You mustn't even think about trying to come and save us...!`
` We'll take care of ourselves."`
`"Th-Then what should we do?!`
` Damn you, Grandfather, how dare you do that to Mom and the rest...?!`
` I'm gonna kill that undying bastard...!!"`
`"Jessica, if you talk like that, you'll sadden your mother.`
` Those aren't the words of a lady."`
`"Uuuuuuu, ...uuuuuu...!!"`
`"Anyway, put your own safety first.`
` Lock all the guesthouse doors.`
` ...But you mustn't overestimate how safe that will make you.`
` The large window in the first floor lounge might get broken.`
` Stay in your room, and use a bed to make a barricade.`
` There's a toilet and fridge in there too, right?`
` You should be able to stay holed up until tomorrow morning.`
` ...Listen up, I'll say it again. ...Don't think of doing anything violent.`
` Don't even think about trying to take revenge for Mom!`
` Only think of hiding, of getting through this without provoking our enemies."`
`"Yeah, ......yeah...!!`
` I understand, ...Dad...!`
` Uuuuuuuuuu!!"`
`After that, Gohda took the phone...`
`and was firmly told to supervise the kids well, as an adult.`
`...Gohda, with his face covered in a cold sweat, repeatedly replied "Yes sir, yes sir!" in an excessively tense voice.`
`From there, Kyrie took the receiver and spoke with Battler, and when Shannon and Kanon got their turns, George and Jessica answered.`
` Following that pattern, Nanjo and Kumasawa picked up as well, so that all members of both sides took the receiver in turn,`
` confirming that everyone was safe for now, even if their location was unknown, and encouraging each other, coming to an understanding on the current situation for both sides.`
`They wanted to talk forever, but now was not the time to chat.`
`Krauss explained that they would be hanging up for now, and those in the guesthouse consented.`
`"If anything happens, we'll call.`
` Wait by the phone so you can pick it up quickly.`
` Again, be careful.`
` You mustn't do anything rash...!"`
`"...Y-Yeah, I understand...`
` As long as you and...Kanon-kun and the others are okay, ...then that's good enough for me...`
` ...We'll do our best.`
` Stay safe...!"`
`"Yes, of course.`
` Well then, I'm hanging up for now.`
` Be on your guard."`
`With that, the phone call ended.`
`Gohda and the rest of the men quickly descended to the first floor, closed the shutters, and secured the sturdy locks on the doors.`
`However, just as Krauss had worried, there was nothing that could be done about the beautiful wide window in the first floor lounge.`
`If someone broke that, it would be easy to get inside.`
`It wouldn't be hard for someone like Kinzo, who hadn't hesitated at committing murder, to invade the first floor.`
`"...It's likely that Grandfather and his followers will be armed.`
` Locking ourselves in our room is our best bet, and moreover our only method of forming a barricade.`
` ...It's painful that we have no choice but to hole up in a sealed room, but if our enemies are carrying guns, then that's the only method we have left to us."`
`"I-I have heard that the Master has a collection of working guns.`
` ...That's right, guns, that was a gun...`
` If so, ...it must have been a horribly powerful gun...!`
` W-We can't contend with that at all...!"`
`"......It takes a lot of force to smash someone's head open, right?`
` So it might be a magnum bullet or something like that.`
` That'd probably go through a flimsy door like it was nothing."`
`"If so, then that's even more of a reason to hold out in our room...`
` Let's slide a bed in place, and block the window too.`
` ...If we do that much, then no matter how many guns they've got, they shouldn't be able to raid us."`
`"Crap, ...all we can do is this passive, one-sided defense.`
` ...Dammit, dealing a finishing blow to Dad, and even capturing Kyrie, `
`...that's gonna cost you, you damn geezer...!"`
`"I-I-I-Impossible, there's no way we can compete with them...!!`
` Besides, it's not just the Master, he has his underlings too!`
` Th-There might even be more of them...!`
` ......Just what...are they...?"`
`Battler was filled to the brim with the urge to get revenge for Rudolf...`
`and to rush out of here to save Kyrie.`
`...But just by looking at how terrified Gohda was, there was no doubt in him that this would be reckless...`
`"...It's gotta be hard on you too, ...right, Aniki?`
` And yet, you've got to stay holed up here, ...dammit..."`
`"Of course, I'm torn up about it too.`
` It's not like I can remain calm with both of my parents murdered.`
` But specifically because of that, I have to remain calm!`
` Do you think our dead parents would want us to die in vain?`
` There's no way they would!`
` They'd want for at least their children to escape."`
`"So I will survive.`
` And I'll report this to the police and uncover everything.`
` I'll leave my enemies to the courts.`
` That is my revenge.`
` ...There's no way our parents would want us to die taking revenge for them.`
` Right...?"`
`"...............`
` ...You're right...`
` It's just as you say...`
` ...Dammit, you old bastard, what's this about a ceremony...?!`
` If we're supposed to be sacrifices for something like that, then we'll escape no matter what it takes, ruining this precious ritual of yours..."`
`"That's right.`
` ...Besides, you still have Kyrie-san, Battler-kun.`
` And I still have Shannon.`
` Anyway, let's be cautious and wait for our chance.`
` Any careless actions on our part might just end up causing harm to those who have been captured."`
`"......Hostages, huh?`
` ......But Grandfather captured them so he could use them as sacrifices, right?!`
` If we don't go and save them, then are we just waiting for them to get killed?!"`
`"We don't even know where the dungeon they're being held in is...!`
` Shannon and Kanon-kun didn't know about it, and of course Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san didn't know either.`
` The possibility that they're in a secret location that only Grandfather knows of is incredibly high.`
` ...Under these circumstances, aimlessly wandering about would be practically suicidal!"`
`"...I-I understand...`
`...But still, ...dammit, ...are you saying the only thing we can do is stay confined here until something happens...?"`
`"......B-Battler-sama, I understand how you feel, but...`
`...let's put safety first...`
` ...From what Krauss-sama said, they seem to be in a fairly old cell,`
` and they may be able to break the bars somehow.`
` ...The wise choice of action now is to believe in them and wait."`
`"Grandfather has a number of subordinates, and they're all armed, correct...?"`
`"...Y-Yes, he does.`
` ......And they're probably...`
`all armed..."`
`Gohda had been able to say that Kinzo had comrades with him, `
`...but he hadn't been able to mention that they were mostly young women, like witches, ...who had used strange magic to murder.`
`If he had said that, it would only have cast doubt on his sanity.`
`...No, not only that, he himself still couldn't understand what he had seen, and was doubting his own sanity.`
`...But, regardless of sex or appearance, ...regardless of whether it was done with magic or a gun.`
`The fact that those girls had followed Kinzo's orders......`
`and killed six people in an instant...was an unshakable truth...`
`If that group came to attack the guesthouse as well, ...what would happen?`
`Just closing the doors and windows like this was surely meaningless...`
`Gohda...and Kumasawa...`
`The only thing left for those two, who had witnessed that massacre in the dining hall,`
` was to cradle their heads without knowing how to interpret what they had seen...`
`"......Kumasawa-san, are you okay...?`
` Want some tea...?"`
`"H-Hohohohohoh...`
` Thank you very much, thank you...`
` ...I'm sorry, but may I be left with my thoughts for a little while......?"`
`Maria tried to be nice, but it seemed that Kumasawa still hadn't been able to clear away her confusion.`
`"...Maria, thanks for being so considerate.`
` Let's let Kumasawa-san rest for now."`
`"...Uu-."`
`Jessica was also worried about the shock those two must have received after witnessing such a tragedy, `
`...but her wildest dreams couldn't even come close to the unbelievable scene Kumasawa had witnessed...`
`Nevertheless, with her mother murdered and her father captured,`
` it wasn't as though Jessica could stay calm either.`
`She sealed her anxiety and sadness using her anger towards Kinzo...and walked irritatedly around the room.`
`"......Kumasawa-san,`
` is Mom really......dead?"`
`"...Y-Yes...`
` ...I've never seen such a...horrible way to die before..."`
`'!s1`
`...and that if we fix her up, `
`...we could save her...?"`
`"...............`
`...I-It's not possible for a person to have something like that done to their head......and live..."`
`"..................`
`...Yeah, you're right...`
` ...There's no need for first aid...`
`once your head's smashed, usually..."`
`When Gohda had come flying into the guesthouse,`
` he had, overcome with agitation, told about the massacre in the dining hall without concealing anything.`
`...Except for the part about witches and magic, which they themselves still couldn't believe.`
`In other words, he hadn't even sugarcoated the cold-blooded way in which Natushi and the others had died.`
`...It was too late now, but Kumasawa regretted the fact that they'd obviously said too much...`
`However, while lightly shaking her head and with a slightly painful laugh, Jessica spoke.`
`"...Actually, thanks to what you told us, I was able to stay level-headed.`
` ......If you'd avoided mentioning the part about her head being smashed, `
`...I would've thought she might still be alive.`
` Then I would've run off towards the mansion, met Grandfather, ...and I might've gotten killed.`
` ...That sliver of hope could've been fatal in the end.`
` ......So I'm grateful."`
`"...I'm truly sorry...`
` I'm so sorry we didn't choose our words more carefully..."`
`"Don't worry about that now.`
` There's nothing we can do for Mom, ...but Dad's still alive.`
` Kanon-kun and Shannon, and Aunt Kyrie and Doctor Nanjo too.`
` ...I want to save them somehow, so we shouldn't do anything unnecessary that might make things worse for them.`
` The most helpful thing we can do right now might be to wait by the phone."`
`They might receive a phone call asking them to create a diversion while the others escaped.`
`Or, the others might discover their location and call for rescue.`
`...Jessica understood that in order to act promptly when that time came, the only thing they could do for the time being was to wait in this room...`
`Once they had finished inspecting the downstairs area and locking up, George, Battler, and Gohda returned.`
`Each was holding various objects.`
`George had things like drinks, canned food, crackers, and other types of snacks he had found in the lounge and a storage room, as well as a first aid kit.`
`They were all consumables that would be essential during a seige.`
`Gohda had a large folding ladder and carpentry tools.`
`Those were to seal the door from the inside, just in case.`
`If it came to it, the ladder was for escaping out the window.`
`Battler had brought up objects that could be used as edged weapons or poles.`
`In addition to the obvious kitchen knife, there was a dissembled table leg that could be used as a club...`
`and a pole roughly the size of a person, which he'd apparently made by taking apart a hat stand.`
` Even though the pole had no point, it could surely be used like a spear.`
`...There was a good chance that their enemies had guns, so it was dubious whether these would be of any use.`
`But it was still better than not having them, and if having these could give them at least a little peace of mind, then they'd be useful for their calming effect.`
`Then, the bed and sofa were placed up against the door, barricading it.`
`They didn't go so far as to seal it up with nails.`
`...There was still a chance that Krauss and the others would escape and come to meet up with them.`
`They had apparently set up a barricade at top of the stairs as well.`
`It had been set up in a way that would create a racket, so it would serve as a warning alarm as well.`
`That had apparently been Battler's idea.`
`For that reason, they turned the TV off.`
`......This way, if the first floor window were to be broken, they would hear.`
`Once the switch had been turned, all that was left was an eerie silence.`
`...The sound of violent wind and rain.`
`Were they going to have to spend the whole night being crushed by such suspense?`
`The boat would come tomorrow morning.`
`However, judging by the weather report, most of tomorrow was going to be covered in the typhoon, and the boat probably wouldn't come.`
`...The typhoon was set to pass by in the morning of the day after tomorrow.`
`In other words, the boat would be arriving in the morning after next, ...the morning of October 6th.`
`And right now, it was late at night on October 4th.`
`......They would have to spend more than 30 hours on this island,`
` with Kinzo turned cold-blooded murderer and his weird companions prowling about...`
`Even with the shutters closed, there would definitely be a little bit of light seeping out.`
`It might let the enemy know that they were hiding here.`
`...Battler suggested that it might be best to turn off the lights.`
`But they had already been overwhelmed by a ghastly feeling just from turning the TV off.`
`...There wasn't anyone who directly challenged his proposal, but then again, there wasn't a single other person who agreed with it......`
`"...Uu-.`
` We can't watch TV?"`
`"Yeah, sorry, but you'll have to bear with it.`
` ...We can't just let the sound of the enemy breaking in slip by."`
`"............`
`...Boring."`
`Even though she had been told of her mother's death, Maria alone didn't feel an approaching sense of danger.`
`She just seemed to be upset that the TV had been turned off.`
`......Even though she's in such a bizarre situation, can she not share in our sense of danger?`
`...Is it because she's so young?`
`To Battler, even this faintly unsettling feeling from such a young girl made him sense that there was something very eerie about Maria...`
`"That said,`
` ......we've already done all we can.`
` Do you think you'll be able to do anything about the bars?"`
`"...Unfortunately, they're tougher than expected.`
` I don't know when these were made, but there's no problem with their lifetime guarantee.`
` These truly were built rather well."`
`Kyrie chuckled softly.`
`...They had no moves they could make, but she had calmed just a little.`
`"...This place is just like the capture pile of a chess game.`
` ...So, are there no remaining moves left to us...?"`
`"Not yet.`
` It's still too early to give up.`
` If we stop thinking, we might as well stop breathing, right?"`
`"Exactly.`
` ...Chess pieces in the capture pile may serve no purpose, but in shogi, they can be quite significant.`
` Just one captured pawn should be able to put pressure on the opponent."`
`"I see...`
` But still, there's nothing that can be done about these bars..."`
`"For us, maybe.`
` ......But, if we can figure out where this is and contact Gohda-san, he might be able to come and save us."`
`"I see...`
` But that would mean putting Gohda-san in danger...`
` And if that happens, I would also be worried about the children in the guesthouse, alone without a full-grown adult male..."`
`"When you're afraid of risk, it's all right to bide your time until the price starts to go up.`
` ...However, if you're too afraid to cut your losses, you might end up with just a scrap of paper.`
` ...Though in this case, that represents our lives."`
`"And our dignity as parents, right?`
` After talking big like that during the telephone call, telling them that they should behave because we'll manage something on our own, we can't just start asking for help right away.`
` That would be very uncool.`
` *giggle*."`
`"By this point, I've long since thrown out such useless pride.`
` ......Why don't we put our heads together?`
` Where is this?`
` Is it really underneath the dining hall?`
` Or else, is it a different place, separate from the mansion...?"`
`Krauss, Kyrie, and Nanjo began to discuss this further.`
`Kanon was squatting by the bars, silently trying to sense anyone's presence.`
`...Just as he had been ordered.`
`Shannon came close to him, and they both squatted down together.`
`"......Do you sense anyone?"`
`"......Yes.`
` ...They haven't focused their attention in this direction, but there's somebody relatively close by."`
`"Is it Human...?"`
`"......I think it's the goats.`
` Their breathing is rather noisy."`
`Kanon's ability to sense the presence of others was several levels above that of a Human.`
`He said that their breathing was noisy, but Krauss and the rest couldn't even pick up the slightest hint of it.`
`...Therefore, if he had obediently reported it, they would have merely doubted Kanon's ears.`
`".........They got us, didn't they?"`
`"............`
`...It's rare.`
` To think that they captured us without killing us."`
`"This time, Beatrice-sama didn't make an appearance.`
` And the Master left his study.`
` ...I don't have a clue what's going on..."`
`"I know.`
` ......Whatever happens or changes, it's all for that witch's fickle entertainment.`
` In the end, nothing will change."`
`"I wonder if we'll be able to......go to the Golden Land this time."`
`"Who knows.`
` We have a high rate of losing."`
`"......Come to think of it, it's very rare for us to survive the first twilight together.`
` ...I get the feeling that it's incredibly unusual for us to be able to talk together like this even though the ceremony has already begun."`
`"That may be.`
` ...But even that's just for the witch's entertainment, I'll bet.`
` I can't think of it as anything other than her letting us live just a little longer to ridicule us, since we usually drop out right in the beginning."`
`"I wonder......if we'll be unable to reach the Golden Land again."`
`"I'm sure we won't make it there.`
` ...If we hold onto any foolish hope, we'll get taken advantage of again."`
`"*giggle*`
` That's right.`
` Last time, you got taken advantage of, didn't you?"`
`"...I'm an idiot."`
`Kanon made a sour look and turned his head.`
`Shannon laughed softly and apologetically leaned towards his shoulder.`
`"But...I'm glad Milady is safe."`
`"...She's only escaped from the first twilight.`
` ...She might just be waiting for an even crueler death later on.`
` What about you, Nee-san?`
` ...Aren't you glad George-sama's safe?`
` It'd be nice if you two could reach the Golden Land together."`
`"......Thank you.`
`"I-I wasn't hoping for anything like that.`
` ...It's just as you say.`
` That witch is only having fun, dangling prizes in front of people and watching them vainly try to get them.`
` ......I'm sure no one will be able to go to the Golden Land.`
` ...If I wish to reach the Golden Land with Milady, `
`...then that person will find it funny...and will certainly never let us reach that place."`
`"...You're right.`
` ......Beatrice-sama is thinking about which order of sacrifices will be the most interesting."`
`"The whole thing about them being chosen at random is just a blatant lie.`
` That swindling witch...`
` ...All that about having any wish you want granted in the Golden Land is probably just a lie too."`
`".........That's not true.`
` The Golden Land is...a wonderful place."`
`"Have you been there?"`
`"......Only for a little bit.`
` Though, even that was probably just a joke of Beatrice-sama's."`
`".........What's it like there?"`
`"Well,`
` ......it's a wonderful place.`
` ...I can't really explain it well.`
` It's like a world from a pleasant dream."`
`"A paradise-like place, with roses blooming all over and beautiful butterflies dancing about, or something like that?"`
`"...It's not a place with a tangible image like that.`
` It's really like the inside of a dream.`
` When you're there, it's very gentle, very peaceful, `
`...and you're allowed to sleep as long as you want, like when you wake up early on a day off, lying on a futon."`
`"...Sunlight comes in through the cracks in the curtains, and you think you'll have to wake up soon,`
` but then you realize it's your day off, and you can go back to sleep... It's a place where you can feel like that."`
`"I think it'd be wasted on me.`
` Waking up on accident even though it's your day off is something only you would do, Nee-san.`
` ......So?"`
`"Well,`
` when I was there, it was very satisfying and very calm.`
` When I returned to this world, even though I had just been there a second ago, I couldn't remember it well.`
` It's like when you can't remember a dream you were just having.`
` ...But I still remember that it was a very calm and quiet world."`
`"......That's it?`
` What the heck, that Golden Land she's always bragging about isn't anything great at all.`
` ...I thought it was a place where all your wishes come true."`
`"That's right.`
` It's a place where all your wishes will be granted.`
` ......Well, maybe that's not quite it.`
` It might be better to say it's a place where you won't wish for anything."`
`"...For example, Kanon-kun, if you were cold and wished you had a jacket, you'd be happy to be given one,`
` but if you were in a warm room to begin with, there wouldn't even be a reason to want a jacket, right?"`
`"...That's what the Golden Land is like.`
` There's no need to even wish for most wishes.`
` It's a world where everything is calm."`
`"You could even say it's a place that transcends the concept that having your wishes granted will bring happiness, ...a world released from everything."`
`"............`
`...It sounds somewhat like a religious world."`
`"And there, everything is equal.`
` Anything that can think is equal.`
` ...There are no Humans, furniture, nor witches.`
` ...There, I was equal to everyone.`
` There was no longer any need to feel ashamed that I was furniture."`
`"......It was honestly a happy world where all Humans, and even witches, were equal.`
` I can't really remember it well,`
` but I have the feeling that when I was there, I was equal even to Beatrice-sama, and we were good friends."`
`"......If that witch is there, it can't be much of a paradise.`
` ......So, you want to go to that Golden Land with George-sama.`
` How strange.`
` The Golden Land is a utopia where you can be pleased with everything, right?`
` Wouldn't you be content even if George-sama wasn't there?"`
`"............`
`...The Golden Land is very calm, peaceful, and everything is equal.`
` ...But actually, happiness alone is left out."`
`"It isn't a happy world?"`
`"Of course, just by being peaceful, calm, and equal, it's an incredibly happy world.`
` ...But I guess you could say that it's a world of zero, where you're released from all negative worries.`
` The human world is filled with negatives, so of course a zero world is incredibly happy, ...but it's still zero.`
` *giggle* What a luxurious problem to have."`
`"...It's something like this.`
` When you're nodding off on your quiet holiday morning,`
` ...if the person you love the most is next to you and holding your hand, then it can become an even greater, more wonderful happiness, ...something like that.`
` ...Sorry, your Nee-san is too dumb to be any good at analogies."`
`"...In other words,`
` to you, the greatest happiness would be reaching that world together with George-sama."`
`"Yes.`
` And surely, for you, it would be reaching that world together with Milady."`
`"We'll be released from our worries in a fair world...?`
` ......It's like some kind of strange religion.`
` I'm more worldly-minded.`
` I imagined a world where we would be given some magic medicine, and we could be reborn as Humans, or something more like that."`
`"......If you go, you'll understand.`
` If Beatrice-sama really is a fickle person, then surely some day, she'll let you get a glimpse of it too.`
` ...If so, then you'll be able to understand my analogy."`
`"..................`
`Well, I'm not holding my breath.`
` ...At any rate, it seems like game over for us this time already.`
` I'll hope for another chance."`
`"...You're right.`
` If we cling to any overambitious hopes, Beatrice-sama will take advantage of us.`
` ...It might be best to just stop thinking...and let fate take care of us."`
`"......We can just be simple chess pieces.`
` ...No matter what we think or don't think, we can't escape from the witch's chessboard.`
` Our role is now just to wait and see how we'll be tortured to death.`
` ...For us, the dream of the Golden Land is too empty."`
`".........You're...right.`
` ...Sorry..."`
`Kanon shrugged his shoulders, then told Shannon to leave him alone because she was in the way of his duty, distancing himself from her.`
`Realizing her thoughtlessness in bringing up such an inappropriate topic and instead hurting Kanon,`
` Shannon bit her lower lip and stared at the ground...`
`Shannon wouldn't bother him any more.`
`She went off and crouched down in a corner by herself.`
`"............Nn-"`
`At that moment, Kanon perked up.`
`It was like the ears of a cat when it reacts to a strange sound.`
`"What's wrong?"`
`"...Shh.`
` ......Krauss-sama, someone's coming."`
`"What?!"`
`They ended their conversation and strained their ears.`
`...For a while, they couldn't hear anything,`
` but eventually, they were able to hear the shuffling sounds of a large group of people walking...`
`"...So they've come."`
`"Time to pay the piper, or perhaps this is our first and last chance."`
`"......I shall talk to Kinzo-san.`
` ...I will try to somehow find out where this place is."`
`"We're counting on you.`
` ..............."`
`During the last phone call, Kyrie had asked what the time over at the guesthouse was.`
`...By doing that, Kyrie had learned that it was the same as her watch, and she had learned that their watches hadn't been set back.`
`It wasn't just the clocks on the walls in the guesthouse.`
`Several people's watches, including George's and Gohda's, had matched.`
`...If that was the case,`
` then it had only been a few minutes between the time of the massacre in the dining hall and the time they had been transported to the dungeon.`
`Not enough time had passed for them to be knocked out and carried away.`
`Then were those really pitfalls, meaning that this was the area directly under the dining hall...?`
`All that they could do was pray that Nanjo could find out where this was...`
`"...They're coming.`
` There's probably...four people.`
` ...The Master...and three of those who appeared in the dining hall."`
`"That's enough.`
` You come back here as well.`
` We'll deal with the rest."`
`"Shannon-chan, sorry, but can I have you sit by the phone?`
` Hide it with your skirt."`
`"Ah, ...yes...!"`
`The shuffling came close, ...and there was the sound of a large door being opened in the hallway.`
`The light they were apparently carrying illuminated the hall, stroking the walls with sharp, razor-like shadows.`
`And then, the light from the lantern they held illuminated the prisoners through the bars.`
`...The bars' sharp shadows divided them up lengthwise.`
`There were four silhouettes.`
`......It was Kinzo, ......Ronove, Virgilia, and Gaap.`
`"Silence, everyone.`
` Please welcome the Head of the Ushiromiya family, Lord Goldsmith."`
`"......Goldsmith?"`
`"It's Father's pen name.`
` It seems he always signs with it when writing those bizarre grimoires."`
`"'Kinzo' made English-style?`
` Shouldn't that be Gold Warehouse?"`
`"......Hahhahahahahahahahahaha.`
` What more is a warehouse than a place to keep things in?`
` However, I give birth to gold and use my craftsmanship to further increase its worth.`
` Don't you think 'smith' is much more fitting?"`
`"......True enough.`
` I apologize for butting in."`
`"Kinzo-san, `
`...just what is going on?`
` Where in the world is this...?"`
`"Oh, my friend,`
` can't you remember?`
` True, you may have never entered the prison, but you should remember walking through this corridor."`
`"......Huh, `
`......huh?`
` ......Y-You don't mean......"`
`"...Do you have an idea?"`
`"But, well, ......it is unthinkable.`
` ...Firstly, we fell through a pitfall and were locked up in here after only a few minutes...`
` ...Not only is the distance too great, that's physically impossible..."`
`"For a Human, right?`
` *giggle*."`
`"Father, ...is this the mansion?`
` To think that the mansion had a basement like this..."`
`"Krauuss,`
` wasn't there a place whose existence you all whispered of, and which you followed after me several times trying to find?`
` ......This is that place.`
` No, to be correct, this is its basement.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`'!s1`
`...of Kuwadorian...?!"`
`"...A splendid observation.`
` This is indeed the basement of Kuwadorian."`
`"Kuwadorian...`
` ...You don't mean...Father's rumored hidden mansion...?`
` It really exists...?"`
`"This mansion was constructed for the sole use of my beloved witch, Beatrice.`
` It's truly a shame that I cannot guide you to the above-ground sections, as it is such a beautiful and elegant mansion."`
`"......How lovely, just the two of them alone in a mansion with a prison like this.`
` I guess Father's tastes are a bit more than I can stomach."`
`"...Kyrie-san,`
` ...perhaps it would be wiser to refrain from such rude comments."`
`"*giggle*`
` But I agree.`
` ...If a mansion I was given had this kind of dungeon in it,`
` that'd shake me out of even a century-long love, and I'd take anything of value and run."`
`"Pu ku ku.`
` Oh my, so you don't have an interest in this kind of thing?`
` And here I was thinking you went head over heels for it."`
`"Heheh.`
` ......Of course I go head over heels.`
` Like if I get a collar or something for a birthday present.`
` ...But only if he's hot."`
`"Pu ku ku ku ku!"`
`"Silence!`
` ...Perhaps you could use a gag more than a collar right now."`
`"Oh, you have an interest in that too?`
` You sure aren't picky, Lia.`
` *giggle*..."`
`"D-Don't just go around shortening people's names on your own...!"`
`"Enough, you noisy women!`
` Are you telling me you'd like to be locked up in the same cell?"`
`"I-I apologize, Master...`
` This old body of mine would not be able to stand such a cold prison..."`
`Virgilia quickly apologized, but Gaap and Ronove merely laughed together.`
`It was like they thought they alone couldn't be imprisoned,`
` or else, that even if someone tried to imprison them, it would be pointless...`
`"A prison is a place from which the captured cannot escape.`
` That implies a strong will and love to not let them go for a lifetime.`
` It's not even worth speaking of love to a woman you could give up on if she ran away."`
`"A woman who makes you so insane that you don't want to let her escape, to the point of binding her in chains...`
` Because she was worthy of that, she was a love worth sacrificing my life for.`
` ......I will not ask you to understand."`
`"......No one can bind me, I will not be bound.`
` I don't want to be loved, I want to love.`
` I feel the same as Goldsmith.`
` That's why I understand the madness of your love."`
`"Love and madness are two sides of the same coin, or so they say.`
` How bothersome."`
`"......But learning where we are so easily was a big step.`
` We'll ask the details later, but it seems you know about this place, ...right, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"Y-Yes...`
` ...If that hallway is the underground passage beneath Kuwadorian, `
`...then if we go straight down it, it will become a long tunnel, `
`...and if we stay on that, we should be able to return to the mansion."`
`"...Then if we could just do something about these bars, we could go home."`
`"Father...`
` What are you planning to do with us?"`
`"As I have already declared, you will become sacrifices for the later twilights.`
` There are conveniently five people here.`
` Exactly enough hostages for the five gougings."`
`"...I see.`
` ...Then it's time for us to pay the piper?"`
`"Eventually.`
` That's not why I've come to visit you this time, so relax.`
` Besides, I believe I have said it already.`
` ...If one of my grandchildren is deemed suitable to inherent everything from me, then the ceremony will be called off.`
` In other words, your lives will be spared."`
`"...Wh-What are you planning to do to the children?"`
`"I shall give them a test.`
` A test to see if they are suitable to be the Successor or not.`
` If even one of them can surprise me, I'll call the ceremony off."`
`"......And if there isn't anyone suitable, `
`...what are you planning on doing with the children?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` There's no need to worry about that.`
` After all, you all will be sacrificed first.`
` How could anything that happens after that concern you?`
` Entrust your fates to your own children.`
` ...Your children, the embodiment of what you've born, taught and raised.`
` They should be the most suitable ones for you to entrust with your fate...!`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` Don't look so worried, Kraaauss...`
` Believe in the daughter that you brag is worth ten billion yen.`
` Hehheheh, hehhahahahahaha...!!"`
`"......Exactly.`
` Children are the embodiment of their parents.`
` It's fitting that we put our fates in their hands.`
` That applies even to you, Father, right?"`
`"...Hmph, hahhahahaha!`
` This girl has guts, what a waste on Rudolf!`
` Wahhahahahaha...!!"`
`"...Kyrie-san, ...it would be best not to aggravate him too much."`
`"I agree.`
` Let's bear with it for now..."`
`"That's right...`
` ...After all, we're just fish on the chopping board.`
` There's nothing we can do now."`
`"Hah, though you can insult me with such vigor.`
` I don't dislike that kind of woman, see?`
` Beatrice was like that too, in the beginning.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"......Master,`
` perhaps we should get back to the main topic.`
` We've been off track for a while now."`
`"Ah yes, there was that. Sorry, sorry, my friend.`
` Well then, back to the main event.`
` For that, I've prepared a phone.`
` ...Shannon, how clever of you.`
` You don't have to hide it any longer.`
` That's something I arranged for.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"M-My apologies..."`
`"............"`
`Shannon quickly withdrew herself, and the telephone was revealed...`
`"Krauss,`
` call the grandchildren in the guesthouse.`
` Tell them of the test...and of the start of my trial."`
`Ronove motioned for Krauss to pick up the receiver.`
`".........And if I say no?"`
`"Hohoh, and why do you think you're in a position to negotiate?`
` If you don't make the call, then the grandchildren won't even be given a chance.`
` The Ushiromiya family will end here.`
` And I'll sacrifice you all right away!!"`
`"You'd be lucky to become sacrifices right away.`
` ...Don't you think it'd be more painful to watch the children get sacrificed first, before your very eyes...?"`
`"...Ga...ap.`
` The Master is the one who decides the sacrifice order.`
` Don't say things on your own."`
`"Lia, you just tried to shorten my name, didn't you?"`
`"I-I did not!`
` And I told you not to shorten other people's names on your own...!"`
`"...Women truly are..."`
`"Noisy. Pu ku ku!"`
`The clinic that Nanjo had opened and later passed on to his son still existed on Niijima.`
`This aged doctor was Nanjo's son, but the atmosphere about him was very different.`
`"I am truly sorry to say this after you have come all this way, but I have nothing in particular to tell you."`
`Nanjo's son said that very indifferently.`
`"...After the accident on that island was taken up by the broadcasts in a most indiscreet manner,`
` even my father, who was Mr. Ushiromiya's doctor and friend, was focused upon by many with a wholly regrettable interest.`
` All of it was without proof, and they even managed to defile all of my father's previous achievements.`
` I still feel a great deal of resentment because of that."`
`"......I think that's understandable.`
` The same thing happened to me.`
` I had to put up with it constantly since I was six."`
`"True.`
` My apologies."`
`The doctor finally remembered that Ange was also a victim who had been exposed to the same curious eyes as he had been.`
`"In that case, you can probably understand why I don't want to have anything to do with that incident.`
` ...That was an unfortunate accident.`
` The only ones who want to make a fuss about it being a crime are those irresponsible TV shows and magazines.`
` I am more than fed up with their attitude."`
`......Nanjo had been bathed with attention for being one of Ushiromiya Kinzo's few friends.`
`Because of that, there was probably an aggressive and persistent rush among the Witch Hunters and the press to use Nanjo's son as well, a surviving relative, as a source of information.`
`...The doctor went on and on, criticizing the press indignantly.`
`"I really understand how you feel.`
` For a person like me, who was observed even in her personal life,`
` and whose privacy, likeness, and even human rights might have been violated,`
` it's really easy to pick up on the anger of someone in your position."`
`"......And for that very reason, I want to know, more than anything else, what in the world happened in the incident that so thoroughly ruined my life.`
` So I came here.`
` ......I'm a related party just like you.`
` Not a magazine columnist or an interviewer.`
` Please, don't get the wrong idea."`
`"I didn't come to do this for fun.`
` ...Quit looking down on me.`
` If we're gonna argue over whose life was most screwed up by that incident, you're no match for me."`
`"......Nng, ..."`
`Ange spoke sharply.`
`The doctor, who hadn't imagined that he would be talked back to in such a forceful manner, couldn't help but fall silent.`
`...From Ange's perspective, the doctor really was whining over nothing.`
`She really didn't want to be looked down upon.`
`It was about time to let him understand how many days had passed for her before arriving on this island.`
`The doctor realized that he'd said something wrong and remained silent for a while, looking uncomfortable.`
`"I know it's probably painful to remember what happened at the time, but if there's anything you do know, please tell me no matter what it is.`
` Of course, I'll keep quiet about it."`
`"I visited here today to bring some resolution to my life.`
` ...I'm 18.`
` That incident took away 12 years of my life.`
` And it'll probably keep on taking.`
` ...Since that day when I was six years old, I've remained shut away in darkness.`
` Are you saying that despite that, I still don't have a right to know...?"`
`"......No, ...how rude of me.`
` It seems that since all the others who came were ill-natured folk, I instinctively put up my guard.`
` I apologize for my rudeness.`
` ...I understand.`
` If you'll swear not to breathe a word of this to anyone, I'll tell you everything."`
`"Thanks, Doctor.`
` ...Then if you would.`
` Please tell me anything you can."`
`"...As you know, my father was not only Mr. Ushiromiya's head physician, but his friend through the game of chess.`
` That relationship was very long, stretching back to the time Mr. Ushiromiya moved to Rokkenjima."`
`"Just how close were they?"`
`"Very close, it seems.`
` It seems that their connection through chess led my father to stay at Mr. Ushiromiya's mansion quite often.`
` ...Although I may not be one to talk, Mr. Ushiromiya was extremely moody.`
` And my father was an exceedingly magnanimous man, who excelled at interacting with humans like him.`
` It's not hard to imagine that he was a rare friend for the isolated Mr. Ushiromiya."`
`"That day was the day of the family conference.`
` ...At the Ushiromiya family conference, the inheritance and how it would be distributed were rigorously discussed,`
` making it almost like a financial conference.`
` Which means Doctor Nanjo must have gained a trust so great that he was asked to attend even that, right...?"`
`"My father was a simple doctor,`
` so I cannot imagine that he was in a position to advise on the distribution of wealth for a massively rich family like the Ushiromiya family.`
` He was most likely called there to assist with Mr. Ushiromiya's health, because it was not at its best at the time.`
` ...As Kinzo's close friend, I'm sure my father would have kept his mouth shut, and that he was trusted not to leak the secrets of the family conference."`
`"...Wasn't Ushiromiya Kinzo in very bad health at the time?`
` Were there any medical charts left behind?"`
`"Perhaps he brought the medical charts with him on the day of the accident.`
` I'm afraid to say that the entire folder of Mr. Ushiromiya's medical charts has been lost.`
` He was my father's patient, so I do not know the details."`
`"Around the time of the incident,`
` did anything strange happen?"`
`"......`
`...Yes, there was one thing.`
` ...However, it seems exceedingly likely to invite misunderstandings, so I very much do not wish to discuss it."`
`"...What is it?`
` Please tell me."`
`For a while, the doctor beat around the bush,`
` but after saying that much, he wouldn't be able to fool Ange by dodging the subject.`
`He eventually gave in, and after making Ange swear herself to secrecy again, told her...`
`"The truth is, several days after that accident, I received something by mail at my home."`
`"......By mail?"`
`"It was very curious.`
` The sender was made out to be me, but I had no memory of it.`
` Someone had faked my name and sent it."`
`"The destination was Rebun Island in Hokkaido.`
` ...Excluding the Northern Territories, it is at the northernmost tip of Japan.`
` The recipient was apparently a residence on Rebun Island, but......`
`the name was my father's."`
`"...However, it seemed that there was a problem with the destination address, so it was stamped as Address Unknown...`
`and returned to the sender, 'me'."`
`It was...truly a strange tale.`
`Nanjo's son's name was written as the sender.`
`...However, he said that he hadn't mailed the letter.`
`In short, that meant someone had faked his name and sent it.`
`The destination was 'Nanjo Terumasa', on Hokkaido's Rebun Island.`
`But the lot number written on it didn't exist,`
` so the local post office had been unable to deliver it and instead sent it back to 'the sender, Nanjo's son'...`
`"...What was inside?"`
`"............`
`...I do ask that you keep silent about this.`
` It is extremely troublesome to me as well.`
` And even so, I cannot throw it away..."`
`The doctor stood up and faced a bookshelf.`
`There was packed a group of dictionaries that could only have been ornamental,`
` meant to make it very clear that the owner was an intellectual.`
`When he pulled several volumes out from there, a large, brown envelope peeked out from behind them.`
`He took that out and tossed it onto the desk.`
`It had been been carefully sealed with cellophane tape,`
` and its faded color and dryness made it clear that it had been sealed 12 years ago...`
`"I ask most solemnly for your silence on this matter."`
`Being so persistent that it was annoying, the doctor removed the seal with a paper knife.`
`...Then, when he tilted the envelope, an already opened mail envelope spilled out.`
`The envelope had a weight to it, hinting that there was something other than a letter inside.`
`......The recipient...was certainly Nanjo Terumasa.`
`Just seeing that...was a huge shock.`
`Following that incident, Nanjo's corpse had not been found, and he had eventually been treated as dead after going missing under extraordinary circumstances.`
`...And despite that, this letter addressed to a Nanjo in Hokkaido existed.`
`One could almost take this as a sign that he had faked his own death and escaped to Hokkaido.`
`"...Was Doctor Nanjo really in Hokkaido?`
` Or else, was there another person with the same first and last names in Hokkaido?"`
`"If my father had somehow escaped from the accident and lived on in Hokkaido,`
` that would have made us of his family very happy, regardless of the circumstances.`
` I also thought of that possibility at first.`
` ...However, the envelope's destination address does not exist.`
` In short, this envelope was mail that had no way of reaching him."`
`"......Is there a possibility that the sender miswrote the correct address?"`
`"Of course, I cannot deny it.`
` However, judging from the residence's house number, I find that hard to believe."`
`'!s1`
`Hokkaido, `
`Rebun Island, `
`Rebun County, `
`Rebun City, `
`1-2-34-567.`
` ........."`
`Up until Rebun City, it's fine.`
`...But I just couldn't wipe away the feeling that the sequential number after it, 1234567, was a little insincere.`
`It felt like a fake number that some kid had made up.`
`"They probably wrote a nonsense number that clearly didn't exist.`
` I think it's natural to assume that, from the very beginning, this envelope was sent to a nonexistent residence to which`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~it had no chance of being delivered~ib~`
`."`
`If the destination address doesn't exist, mail is generally returned to the sender.`
`But even in the case of an incomplete address, the local post office will often courteously, and to the best of its ability, `
`research to find whether the sender's intended destination exists.`
`When they still can't find it, the mail is sometimes returned after an investigation of several days.`
`It seemed that the same thing had happened with this envelope, and the stamp was postmarked on October 3.`
`It was postmarked on Niijima.`
`Niijima was a long way away from Rebun Island.`
`On top of that, the destination was also nonsensical.`
`...It had taken more than a week for the mail to be returned.`
`...In other words, there was probably a high chance that having the envelope returned to the sender after an unfixed amount of time...`
`had been the goal from the very beginning.`
`Why do something like that......?`
`Even before asking what it was that had been sent, this envelope was already wrapped in mystery...`
`".........And inside it?"`
`"Go ahead."`
`After getting the doctor's permission, I tilted the already opened envelope.`
`From the inside came a small, folded letter, and a small key with a number plate attached.`
` Then, a magnetic card slid out.`
`A112 was engraved on the key's number plate.`
`...I didn't know what it meant.`
`The magnetic card was pitch black and had gold characters engraved in it.`
`'Members' was written in English.`
`The jet-black, gold-lettered card design made it feel like something very high-class.`
`...But of course, I didn't have a clue what kind of card it was just from that.`
`...I unfolded the letter.`
`Its contents were extremely brief, and only the following was written:`
`07151129.`
`Also written was the name of a certain massive bank known throughout Japan, as well as the words 'Central Branch'.`
`...That was all.`
`"And this is......?"`
`"......`
`......It's a card, a key, and a PIN for a safe-deposit box.`
` And it wasn't a normal safe-deposit box either.`
` It was an unsettling one, which was apparently reserved only for special clients."`
`After he finished putting his affairs in order following his father's funeral, he had visited the bank.`
`...PIN and key and card.`
`There was no doubt that something of great importance was kept there,`
` and he had been naturally curious about what it might be.`
`At first, he hadn't known what to do.`
`...The card wasn't something he'd owned in the first place.`
`When he mustered up his courage and showed the card to a bank clerk, he was then switched to a clerk of clearly high status...and was guided to a large vault on the fourth basement.`
`The security on the way there was strict.`
`The doctor had himself stored valuable items such as real estate transcripts in safe-deposit boxes before,`
` but this was something on a whole different level...`
`"...Unlike the procedure at the deposit box I had been using,`
` with this system, as long as you had a card, a PIN, and a key, you didn't need to have your identity confirmed.`
` ...But, anyway, I was frightened at how imposing that secure vault was.`
` ...And I wondered what kind of shady objects might await me that had to be stored in a place like this."`
`"......And then?"`
`"When I passed the card through the reader, I was asked to input the PIN.`
` And, after that eight-digit number was input and authenticated, I was permitted access to the vault.`
` ...It was an incredible scene.`
` A world like something from a sci-fi movie.`
` The massive, dimly-lit silver room was covered with doors to safes."`
`He had entered that room along with the clerk.`
`It seems that as soon as the card was read, the vaults he had a right to were determined,`
` so that safes he could open were lit with a green light, while those he couldn't open were lit with a red one.`
`"A112 was one of those safes that were marked.`
` ...By the way, there were several other safes marked with a green lamp besides that one.`
` I think there were at least 20.`
` There might even have been more in the other corner.`
` ...In any event, I only had the key to A112.`
` I had no way of checking the contents of the other safes."`
`As the clerk watched, the doctor had unlocked and opened the safe.`
`When he did, a safe drawer like a large cabinet had opened,`
` ...and an expensive-looking duralumin case peeked out...`
`That was carried into a separate room, where for the first time, the clerk left, and he was introduced to the contents...`
`"And the contents were......?"`
`".........`
`......Cash."`
`"Cash?`
` How much?"`
`"I have heard that a pack of one million yen in fresh banknotes is precisely one centimeter thick.`
` Since those were packed tightly into a duralumin case of such a size, `
`...there was probably 100 million in total.`
` I don't know, because I didn't count.`
` I didn't even touch it with my hands.`
` I realized at once.`
` This was dangerous money."`
`It isn't normal to store a whole hundred million yen in cash in a case in a safe like that.`
`...It's much easier to deal with if you put it into an account and turn it into numbers.`
`When someone is unable to do that, then it's clear that there's something wrong with that cash...`
`"...My mind went blank, and I instantly realized that I mustn't get involved."`
`"So, you didn't use it at all?"`
`"Correct.`
` I locked it back up just as I'd found it, returned it to the original safe, and left.`
` ...I have thought about throwing away that key and card, but I don't know what will happen.`
` For that reason, I have been hiding it in the back of this bookcase for a full 12 years.`
` ......I still do not know what kind of money that was."`
`"...Could I borrow this envelope?"`
`"No.`
` Please just view it here."`
`"......`
`...Understood.`
` Then, if you'll excuse me.`
` There's something I want to investigate."`
`I took Onee-chan's grimoire from the knapsack I had set down.`
`...Then I opened to the page with the paragraph Beatrice had written to Onee-chan...and compared the handwriting on both...`
`"............"`
`......There was no mistake about the characteristic handwriting.`
` The one who had sent this hundred million yen in cash......was Beatrice herself...`
`But, ......what is it...?`
`Something's bugging me...`
` What is it......?`
` What could it be......?`
`"......Y-Yeah.`
` I'm pretty sure I got something like that in the mail.`
` Hey Ma, where'd you put that?!"`
`The same envelope and contents had been sent to Kumasawa's son, who had once lived with her.`
`But he had been very busy in the days since, and seemed to have forgotten about it while running around all over the place.`
`However, its strange contents had apparently stayed in his memory, and he remembered as soon as Ange mentioned it to him...`
`After a bit of a wait,`
` his thin-lipped wife found the envelope, complaining that he always forgot where he put things right away...`
`The modus operandi for the sender and recipient was the same as Nanjo's son's.`
`The sender was made out to be Kumasawa's son, and the recipient was Kumasawa Chiyo.`
`And the destination address was in the Okinawa Prefecture.`
`Okinawa Prefecture, Yaeyama County, Yonaguni City, 1-2-34-567.`
`Yonaguni Island was at the western-most tip of Japan.`
`And the lot name was the exact same sequential number that had apparently been chosen without much care.`
`...Now it was certain.`
`This envelope was definitely sent with the goal of having it be returned to the sender.`
`Its contents were exactly the same.`
`A letter with the PIN and the bank's main branch written on it.`
`A magnetic card.`
` A key with an attached number plate.`
`The inscription on the number plate was A113.`
`...The number right after the one on the key that had been sent to Nanjo.`
`Most likely, inside the vault was the same kind of duralumin case, packed with a hundred million yen in cash...`
`"...I get the feeling my dead mother sent it to me from beyond the grave.`
` Don't really get what's inside, and it's creepy, so I just left it alone all this time, and totally forgot about it until today."`
`"...So, you know what this is, girl?`
` Could it be that the same kind of thing came to your place...?"`
`"............Ah."`
`"...What is it, Ange-sama?"`
`『Uryu, ...is it a headache? A headache...?!〝`
`"......Sorry, my head hurts...`
` ...I've got it... ......I know..."`
`『What do you mean, you know...?〝`
`"You don't mean...`
`...this envelope...came to your place too, Ange-sama...?"`
`......I've remembered...`
` ...I've remembered...!!`
`A strange envelope was also sent to me...12 years ago...!!`
`After losing my entire family, I was depressed.`
`...But it was a really strange thing to come in the mail, so I still had a faint memory of it.`
`It was a strange letter, which I had no memory of sending, but which had me as the sender.`
`I forget the destination address, but the named recipient had been Ushiromiya Rudolf.`
`My father.`
`I remember how disturbed I was when I got a letter I thought was from Father, opened it up,`
` and found a key and a card that I didn't really understand.`
`I felt let down and threw it away somewhere, I think...`
`Where did I put that envelope?`
`I probably lost it somewhere in the chaos that followed.`
`By now, I have no way of checking its contents.`
`However, I have a general idea.`
`...I'm sure the contents were the same.`
`Without a doubt, there had been a key, a card, and a note with a PIN inside the envelope...`
`"...Beatrice...`
` ...What was she trying to do here...?`
` So, did she hand out this stupid money to all the surviving relatives?`
` ......I won't forgive her...for mocking them even after their deaths......"`
`『Uryu, ...uryu, ...Ange......〝`
`Sakutarou acted nervously.`
`...As I looked at his worrying face, my agitation began to cool off bit by bit...`
`"I'm sorry...`
` My hatred of Beatrice isn't anything new.`
` ...I was just surprised and angry to find out that I had a connection with the witch already...at the age of six on that day..."`
`"......For the past 12 years,`
` you've been constantly enslaved by Beatrice-sama's curse.`
` ...This might be proof of that a curse.`
` But please, hang in there.`
` Breaking through that was supposed to be part of the goal of this journey."`
`"That's right...`
` Just letting the blood rise to my head won't get me anywhere.`
` Got to think calmly.`
` ......What's going on?`
` What's the meaning of handing out a hundred million yen to the relatives?`
` Is she trying to provoke us...?`
` Damn that Beatrice......"`
`『Ange, ...calm down...`
` ...Uryu...〝`
`As Sakutaro buried his head in my stomach, he urged me to stay calm.`
`...I took another deep breath...and started thinking.`
`"......I wonder if this envelope was sent to support the theory that Beatrice was behind that crime."`
`"It was postmarked right before the family conference.`
` And it was intentionally set up so that it would be sent back after some time."`
`『...They wanted it to arrive after the incident, is that it...?〝`
`"Yeah.`
` That's what it implies.`
` ......But it raises a few questions.`
` Why use such an uncertain method?"`
`"Uncertain?"`
`"Yes.`
` After all, no one could even guess at how many days it would take for the mail to return before you used this trick.`
` ...Normally, you couldn't even guess at the amount of time it would take for the receiving post office to do their research, determine that the recipient was unknown, and return it."`
`『Yeah, now that you mention it...`
` It'd be more dependable if they just set an arrival date and mailed it that way...`
` Uryu...〝`
`"...Maybe, but still,`
` if they mailed it the day before, then no matter how quickly it returned, it would probably arrive Monday or later.`
` I wonder if they wanted to make it seem like a letter from the dead."`
`"...A letter from the dead, you say?`
` ...You're right.`
` It surprised me, and it made me feel bad.`
` ...Some mail with my dead family's name written on the outside in large letters...`
`was thrown into the mailbox with an ominous label attached.`
` ...However, it doesn't really make sense to me.`
` I would've mailed it to arrive on a specified day.`
` I just can't understand why someone would allow the uncertainty of it arriving on a day other than the one they imagined."`
`『.........Uryu.`
` ...But it really does sound like Beato to me.〝`
`"Huh?`
` You...know about Beato?"`
`『...Well, I only talked with her a little.`
` ...Still, I can pretty much accept that Beato would do something like this.`
` ......Can't you imagine that happening too, Mammon?`
` Beato likes pranks like this, right?〝`
`"......`
`......Yeah, that might be true.`
` ...I wouldn't put it past Beatrice-sama to try a vicious prank like a letter from the dead."`
`『No, that's not all.`
` ......Beatrice would find it more interesting to do it through an uncertain method, instead of one that was absolutely certain.〝`
`"......She would find an uncertain method...interesting...?"`
`I remembered Maria onee-chan's diary...`
` ...It had described playing with Beatrice very often.`
`During those times, Beato sometimes played pranks on the adult relatives with Maria.`
`But those pranks always had a touch of witch aesthetics.`
`Which was......that they were more interesting when they were uncertain.`
`One day, Maria onee-chan and Beato decided use a wind-up minicar she had brought for a prank.`
`It was a popular toy at the time, and if you made the minicar back up, it would wind up the spring in the tires, and when you let go, it would race forwards.`
`They had wound up that minicar and set it behind a milk jug.`
`...In other words, the prank was that, if you lifted the milk jug, the minicar would jump forwards and surprise whoever did it.`
`Hoping that someone would get caught in this prank, Onee-chan and Beato had watched the adults from the shadows for their whole teatime.`
`They were looking forward to seeing someone get caught by it, but no one moved the trap milk jug, and the trap ended in a misfire...`
`When Onee-chan had then muttered 'We should've put it somewhere where it would've definitely caught someone',`
` Beato apparently said this:`
`"The most interesting and thrilling traps...are those where you don't know who'll get caught, or even if anyone will get caught at all."`
`...It's probably true that you wouldn't get this kind of excitement from a trap that would certainly go off.`
`...Similar accounts occurred in multiple places,`
` making it possible to guess that the witch called Beatrice had a fickle character and loved a random thrill...`
`A fickle person is very hard to deal with.`
`I can't spin the chessboard around...to find out what that witch from 12 years ago was planning.`
`As Ange examined these, her gaze darted from place to place.`
`Then, she suddenly showed interest in the wall.`
`There, several framed pictures were hung.`
`Many of them were commemorative photos from when the relatives of the Kumasawa family gathered or went somewhere to play, and Kumasawa was in several.`
`...And she still wore a smile that made it so you could almost hear her lighthearted 'hohohoh' laugh.`
`...It's part of my distant memory, but I definitely remember that she was this sort of cheerful old lady...`
`"Did you notice anything different about Kumasawa-san in the days leading up to the incident...?"`
`"Nope.`
` She looked the same as ever.`
` ...The family conference put her on edge, so she was always grumbling about how tough it was."`
`"......?`
` ...What's this?"`
`Among the several frames, there was one that had something other than a picture of people in it.`
`It was a picture of an enlarged relief of a door from a Western-style house or something.`
`...You couldn't see any interesting subject in particular, which actually bugged me a bit as I wondered why anyone had gone to all the trouble of taking it.`
`As I got closer, I realized that some characters had been written with a pen.`
`"...Oh yeah, that's a photo I got when Mother's belongings were distributed.`
` I think it probably has something to do with that 'Legend of the Gold' thing."`
`"The witch's epitaph, you mean?`
` It was whispered that it pointed out the location of the hidden 10 tons of gold...`
` ...So, Kumasawa-san tried to solve it too.`
` But this isn't the epitaph.`
` It's the first time I've seen it."`
`There was an arch above the Western-style door, and that's where the relief was.`
` English words were engraved there, and that seemed to be what the picture was focused on.`
`The pen writing appeared to be a translation into Japanese.`
`".........`
`'This door is opened only at a probability of a quadrillion to one.`
` You will be blessed only at a probability of a quadrillion to one'.`
` ...I don't recognize it.`
` Nothing like this ever showed up in the epitaph or Onee-chan's diary."`
`"In Mother's belongings, there were quite a few photos and notes that looked like her trying to solve the riddle of the epitaph.`
` Mother was actually surprisingly fond of that kind of thing.`
` And there was that rumor that 10 tons of gold bars were hidden somewhere.`
` It's no surprise she got so absorbed by it."`
`In both Maria onee-chan's diary and in her grimoire, there was a description of the witch's epitaph.`
`It had talked about how it was a ceremony to open the door to the Golden Land, Beatrice's resurrection ceremony, Beatrice's succession ceremony.`
` On and on.`
`Maybe the most interesting one was the last part, about it being a succession ceremony.`
`According to Beatrice,`
` if you were able to solve the witch's epitaph,`
` you would receive not only the 10 tons of gold and the Ushiromiya family inheritance,`
` but her own magical power and name, as well as the title of Golden Witch.`
`Among the Ushiromiya family household at the time, the witch's epitaph was thought of as a difficult quiz, which the Family Head, Kinzo, had arranged for to choose his successor.`
`But with the Mariage Sorcière interpretation, the questioner was Beatrice herself,`
` and she had posed the question in part to choose her successor.`
`...There were slight discrepancies in the details of the two interpretations.`
`Either way, its ominous contents brought to mind a bloody serial murder,`
` and both of the message bottles drew a tale of a crime following that pattern.`
`If I could solve the witch's epitaph now, 12 years later, I wonder if I could expose some plot made back then...`
`I tried to solve it many times myself, but I never did have a clue what it meant.`
`It seems that many Witch Hunters tried as well.`
`I also found theories like the La Plata theory and the Enoura theory in certain books.`
`However, neither of these theories were conclusive...`
`"Are there any other materials?"`
`"I think so, but they were all split up between my siblings.`
` I don't have a clue who has what.`
` Sorry."`
`"......Just reading this English text that Kumasawa-san took a picture of, it gives the impression that this was a forbidden door that was rarely opened.`
` ...But where in the mansion is it, I wonder?`
` Judging by the lighting, it looks like it's outside.`
` ...I wonder if Kumasawa-san thought that the gold might be hidden in there."`
`"Who knows.`
` Either way, I do wonder where in the Rokkenjima mansion it was.`
` ...I hate to say it, but there wasn't enough money in Mother's bank account to make me think she found the gold.`
` Uhahahaha, she probably didn't find it after all."`
`...The Golden Witch, Beatrice, gave 10 tons of gold to Kinzo.`
`Which meant that the witch was the true owner of the gold.`
`Beatrice was the owner of all the vast fortune of the Ushiromiya family.`
`The witch holding this vast wealth had massacred the humans on Rokkenjima on that day,`
` ...sending large amounts of money to the surviving relatives like it was a game.`
`...Like hell it's a letter from the dead.`
`This is a desecration of the dead.`
`I was once again convinced.`
`...When my family died on that island that day, they didn't go to heaven.`
`They're being trapped by the witch even now...and are being desecrated and tormented for all eternity...`
`The last place Ange visited...`
`was a store in the region between the housing district and the retail stores, with a signboard saying 'Marufuku Sleep Shop'...`
`There lived the man who had been the boat captain of the ferryboat to Rokkenjima at the time.`
`...Even he, who had once lived as a man of the sea, had retired after contracting a serious illness,`
` and was now taken care of at the house of his son and his son's wife...`
`"I remember it veeery well...!`
` You were still about this small.`
` Look how you've grown...!`
` And...it must have been very tough on you.`
` I know very well how you must feel...!"`
`The former boat captain was in such high spirits that you couldn't really tell why he had retired in the first place.`
`His memory seemed clear too, and he could remember the events of more than a decade ago well, apparently even about how Ange had been at the time.`
`The way he chatted on was very helpful for Ange,`
` ...but at the same time, he also remembered the final family conference very well,`
` and the fact that he remembered even details like Battler's 'fall fall madness' on the boat was actually painful for her.`
`It had been so back then as well, but even now, there was no public way to cross to Rokkenjima.`
`It was necessary to make an individual request to an owner of a boat to make the voyage.`
`I'd been unable to arrange for a boat to Rokkenjima,`
` so if he refused me, such a voyage would probably become hopeless...`
`"I getcha.`
` It won't be easy to find a boat eager to go to that island.`
` ...By now, there are even some who call it by its old name, Akujikishima, instead of Rokkenjima.`
` It's understandable why the sailors around here would turn down your request."`
`From the start, fishermen had feared Rokkenjima as an island of misfortune.`
`And because of that incident 12 years ago, this fear had reached a peak...`
`They respected the sea, feared it, and revered it.`
`There were almost no sailors who would try to take a boat to the cursed island.`
`Because of that, most of the Witch Hunters were unable to cross over to Rokkenjima...`
`and were limited to taking a trip around the island.`
`...Ironically, this had caused the sense of mystery surrounding Rokkenjima to increase even more, `
`which had resulted in the propagation of the bizarre witch stories they loved so much...`
`"......Would you take me in your boat?"`
`"Yep.`
` They're supposed to give it back to me just for tomorrow.`
` Though it seems its engine has been in a pretty bad mood lately.`
` I'll knock it into shape!"`
`The former boat captain promised that tomorrow, he would go back to his previous job and take his boat out to Rokkenjima.`
`Now, my method of transport to Rokkenjima is ensured.`
`This is probably all I can do on Niijima.`
`All that's left...is tomorrow.`
`On Rokkenjima, ...I'll reach the final destination of a journey that stretches back 12 years.`
`『Isn't that great...?`
` This way, it looks like you'll be able to go to the island...〝`
`"It sure does.`
` ...I'd heard that it would be hard to find a boat, so the boat captain's helpfulness really saved me."`
`"......Although it may not be the same as it was for you, Ange-sama,`
` I'm sure the incident 12 years ago has been a thorn for the boat captain as well, one that he still hasn't been able to pull out."`
`『...Uryu.`
` ...Even the boat captain wasn't able to sort out his feelings.`
` This whole time...〝`
`"That's probably true.`
` ...If that guy had taken his boat out on October 5 as promised, there's a chance that he could've saved a lot of people.`
` If he hadn't been hesitant to go out just because of a little wind..."`
`『Uryu, ...you shouldn't say things like that...`
` I'm sure that's pained the boat captain constantly until today...〝`
`Apparently, they truly had been right in the middle of a typhoon on October 5.`
`According to the boat captain, he had known for certain that they'd be trapped by the typhoon if they headed to Rokkenjima on October 4.`
`But the family had been very persistent about the date of their conference, which had been determined beforehand.`
`...It was only natural.`
` All of the relatives had been very busy at the time, and they came to the family conference only after arranging their schedules beforehand.`
`It was probably a situation where they couldn't easily push it back to the next week just because a typhoon was approaching.`
`...It wasn't the boat captain's fault.`
`But perhaps you could say that he wasn't so irresponsible that he could place the blame wholly on the typhoon.`
`Certainly, just as these two said, there's no doubt that the boat captain has been dragging the events of 12 years ago along with him this whole time.`
`...And, by taking me, the last member of the Ushiromiya line, to the island,`
` and bringing me back safely, he might be trying to find some resolution for his past...`
`"The boat is supposed to return just after noon.`
` I'll guide you to Rokkenjima after that, so we should arrive before evening.`
` It's an island without electricity or lights.`
` You won't be able to stay long.`
` ...Will you be satisfied with a landing that short?"`
`"......`
`There's nothing that would make me more satisfied by staying longer.`
` I'm grateful just to have you take me there."`
`"Yep, don't mention it.`
` If I hadn't parted with my boat, I'd be able to guide you to the island as much as you liked, without being stingy..."`
`It's not like I have a goal of doing something in particular on Rokkenjima.`
`So, I'll be there during the evening...`
`...The evening, which straddles the two different worlds of day and night, seemed almost like a borderline between this world and the next...`
`or possibly, 1998 and 1986,`
` and it felt like the most fitting time to visit Rokkenjima.`
`...It's not like I have anything in particular to do there.`
`Just staying there for a few hours should be enough for me to find some closure.`
`At that time, there was a small knock on the paper sliding door, and Amakusa stuck his head in, tapping his watch.`
`I nodded back and told him about how I had succeeded in reserving a boat for tomorrow.`
`"That's great.`
` ...It's about time for us to go.`
` We'll be counting on you tomorrow, Captain."`
`"Sure, leave it to me!`
` I've heard all about what you guys've gone through.`
` I also watched the talk shows at the time...and was disgusted by the people who stirred up that incident just for fun.`
` I'll help out any way I can."`
`"Thank you very much.`
` ...Then we'll see you noon tomorrow.`
` Umm, here.`
` The fare for the boat."`
`Ange took a wrapped wad of ten-thousand yen bills from her pocket.`
`The boat captain should have noticed its thickness as well,`
` but he paid it absolutely no interest and shook his head.`
`"...I'm grateful to you.`
` This is a sign from the heavens.`
` I've been given a final chance to take you to Rokkenjima and bring you back safely.`
` Now, I'll finally be able to finish the final job Kinzo-san entrusted me with.`
` So I'm grateful to you.`
` I got more than enough money from Kinzo-san back then.`
` I can't accept yours."`
`".........Thank you very much."`
`"Watch your step on the stairs.`
` It's steep."`
`...I went down the steep staircase that was the exact opposite of 'accessible'.`
`It was getting hard to believe that there was actually a chest of drawers and a TV in the room upstairs.`
`Most of the first floor was a bedding store, with many futons piled up on each other.`
`We weaved our way through the cramped futon shop.`
`After cautiously checking around outside, Amakusa dashed out first and started up the car.`
`"My grandchild's room is empty.`
` I really wouldn't mind if you stayed there.`
` As you see, we've got plenty of extra futons."`
`"Thanks a lot for the offer.`
` ...But this way, even if the unexpected happens, you won't be bothered."`
`"......I don't know the details, but it seems you've been caught up in a lot of trouble.`
` There's a rumor that some suspicious people are searching for someone.`
` That wouldn't happen to be you, would it?"`
`".........`
`...Who knows."`
`Ange played dumb, but it looked as though the boat captain had guessed.`
`"My job is to take guests to Rokkenjima...and bring them back again.`
` ...That job was put on hold 12 years ago, and it still hasn't ended.`
` So, thanks to you, I'll finally be able to finish it."`
`"........."`
`"So listen.`
` ......Let me finish this job, okay?`
` Do you understand me?"`
`".........`
`...Yeah.`
` It's not like I'm going there to die."`
`But part of me does feel that, if I could die on that island, I'd surely be able to go to where my family is...`
`I've finally become aware of it.`
`...I might have been planning...to die on that island.`
`I might have come all this way, heading towards Rokkenjima, in search of a place to die.`
`The boat captain had guessed that as well.`
`That's why he repeatedly told me not to die.`
`"......Yeah, I won't die.`
` I promise.`
` ......After all,`
` I'm still not sure if there's any reason why I need to go to Rokkenjima."`
`"No, I'm sure there's a reason.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` Even if there isn't one for you, ...there is one for ~ib~them~ib~.`
` The island called you.`
` That's why you came here."`
`"......That might...be true.`
` ...I might...have been called."`
`I was called.`
` For what reason?`
` For them.`
`Father.`
` Mother.`
` Battler onii-chan.`
`...And, Maria onee-chan.`
`......Or maybe, the Golden Witch.`
`Beatrice.`
`What is on Rokkenjima?`
`And what will I achieve?`
`Even though tomorrow is finally almost here, I still haven't been able to understand my own mission...`
`There was the sound of a car stopping in front of the store, and a short honk could be heard.`
`"Then I'll see you tomorrow.`
` If you'll excuse me..."`
`"Yep."`
`Winding between the stacks of futons in the cramped store, I was about to go outside.`
`......Then, my feet stopped.`
`"...What is it?"`
`'!s1`
`Umm, `
`...what is that...?"`
`"Hmm?`
` That?`
` What?`
` What are you talking about?"`
`Trembling all over, ......I pointed at it.`
`But no matter how much the boat captain squinted, he noticed absolutely nothing in that direction that should have surprised me.`
`...That must mean,`
` ......th-that must mean......`
`"......I-Impossible...`
` ...Wh-Why......?"`
`『...U-Uryu......`
` ...Ange, `
`...what does it mean?`
` What's going on here...?!〝`
`"...I-I don't have a clue either...`
` There's no way something that ridiculous...`
` Is this magic?`
` A miracle...?"`
`"......Yes, this is probably fate.`
` ...Now, ...I understand.`
` ......This was...my mission."`
`『......Uryu.........〝`
`"I......don't have a clue what......"`
`Shaking, I pointed into the thin darkness inside the store...and froze up...`
`"Wh-What is it?`
` You see something there, don't you?!`
` I don't...I don't see anything...`
` Wh-What is it you see...?!"`
`"Thank you, Captain.`
`'!s1`
`...was fate.`
` Even me visiting this place...`
`...was fate.`
` ......This is...`
`...the mission...and the purpose...that I'm going to Rokkenjima for......"`
`"......Ange-san?`
` What is it, is something wrong?"`
`"I-I don't have a clue either...!`
` This girl just froze up while pointing into the darkness...!"`
`"Ange-san...?`
` Are you okay?`
` What can you see...?"`
`"Can't you two see it?`
` It's that, right there.`
` ...Can't you see it?!"`
`"All I can see is a normal display case.`
` There's no one there, right...?"`
`『Uryu , ...Ange, `
`...I don't know what's going on...`
` ...Is this...a dream?`
` Magic...?`
` What is it...?`
` ......?`
` ......Ange......?〝`
`Sakutarou lifted his face towards Ange...`
`'!s0`
`...slid a single tear.`
`"......Ange-sama........."`
`"...I understand,`
` Onee-chan.`
` ...And, `
`......Beatrice."`
`『......Uryu......〝`
`This is......magic, isn't it......?`
`"......A test...?"`
`"...Y-Yes.`
` Listen well..."`
`Once again, there was a call from Krauss to the guesthouse.`
`...And the message was...that Kinzo wanted to hold a test to see if the grandchildren had the qualifications to become his successor.`
`"......The Head has said that his successor will not be one of us siblings...`
` That he wants...to pick from among his grandchildren..."`
`From Krauss's restrained style of speech, Jessica realized as his daughter that he was being forced to speak.`
`And she was forced to realize that the hostages were being exposed to danger even now,`
` and that if they refused this test, there was a possibility that the hostages would be harmed.`
`"Th-Then, `
`......what should we do?"`
`"...I-Indeed.`
` Hold on..."`
`Krauss put down the receiver, then looked at the grinning Kinzo on the other side of the bars.`
`Kinzo gave his next order.`
`"Before the test, those not involved must be removed.`
` ......Gohda and Kumasawa are there, I believe?`
` It will be a problem if they interfere with the test.`
` Banish them from the guesthouse."`
`"......Banish, ...you say...?"`
`"There should be a gardening storehouse in the rose garden.`
` Lock Gohda and Kumasawa in there.`
` Hmm, we'll begin from there.`
` Tell them to do it immediately.`
` ......My weapons will be watching.`
` If they happen to do anything questionable, I'll instantly stop the test and execute all of you as sacrifices!"`
`"...I-I understand...`
` ...Hello, Jessica...?`
` Listen closely to what I say..."`
`Krauss relayed the orders to lock up Gohda and Kumasawa...`
`"...What kind of test are you planning?"`
`"Hmm?`
` Aah, it truly is a simple test.`
` I only want my grandchildren to show me their resolve.`
` Well then, I wonder what kind of results they'll show me.`
` ...*cackle*."`
`Looking disgusted, Kyrie watched Krauss, who was talking with the children.`
`...I hate it, but for now, we cannot refuse orders.`
`In this dungeon, a feeble resistance won't amount to anything.`
`If we provoke him too much and drive him into a position where he might kill us,`
` there will no longer be any way to stop this murderer.`
`...For now, the only choice left is to obey his rules without agitating him, `
`...all the while waiting for an opportunity...`
`However, if we continue to obediently follow his commands,`
` the children might be attacked in this so-called test, and they might even lose their lives.`
`......Whether we feign obedience or try to resist, ...nothing will cause the situation to improve.`
`Anyway, straining our eyes so that we don't let a single chance escape until the very end...is the only resistance possible now.`
`...While telling herself this, Kyrie watched over Krauss as he delivered Kinzo's orders...`
`"......Kyrie-san,`
` let us be patient..."`
`"I understand.`
` ...It's unfortunate, but all we can do right now is wait.`
` If only we could do something about these bars, we'd be able to return to the mansion..."`
`"...If only we could somehow get out of here...`
` ...I-I'll try something.`
` .........Kinzo-san, I have a request."`
`"Hmm, what is it, my friend?"`
`"We understand well that you want to test the children...`
` ...It is fine for you to do as you desire."`
`"Without your power, the Ushiromiya family might have been destroyed long ago.`
` We truly understand why you want to carefully select the person who will take charge.`
` Besides, that is what the family conference is all about.`
` We won't get in your way..."`
`"Hmm.`
` Your insight is useful.`
` That's right, this is the family conference.`
` The final family conference, where I will select my successor.`
` Fuhahahaha...!"`
`"And yet, Kinzo-san, `
`...it is far too cold here.`
` Since we won't interfere with your test, couldn't you take us to a slightly warmer place...?"`
`"........."`
`At Nanjo's words, the slight signs that Kinzo's mood had been improving were blown away.`
`Nanjo was struck with a moment of silence as Kinzo gazed at him with dangerous eyes, as though appraising him...`
`"...Certainly, this place is cold.`
` It's tough on an old body.`
` ...Master,`
` wouldn't it be all right if we moved them upstairs...?"`
`"I cannot do that!!`
` Are you naive, Nanjoooooo...?`
` So, by acting as though you'll skip this turn, you truly and splendidly advance your strategy?`
` I'm not falling for that, you seeeee...?`
` If you're freezing, then why don't I line the floor with red hot coals!!"`
`"M-My apologies..."`
`Virgilia had tried to help out, but in the end, Kinzo would not comply...`
`".........You two sure are obedient.`
` ...If you felt like it, you could easily break these bars."`
`"...Even if we break them, nothing will come of it."`
`"Of course.`
` ...If you were to break these, it would mean the end of Goldsmith's game.`
` ...All of you, as well as those humans in the guesthouse, would immediately become sacrifices for Kinzo's ceremony."`
`"...But, surprisingly, you two might be the only ones, yes?`
` Perhaps only you two hold the power to break out of this situation, ...right?"`
`"......You want to reach the Golden Land, don't you?`
` You must have many dreams you want granted, right...?`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`"..............."`
`"Gaap,`
` you musn't provoke them.`
` ...This is not your game.`
` It is the Master's, as well as Milady's game."`
`"......What is it, Ronove?"`
`"Oh, no, nothing.`
` ...We were talking to the prisoners.`
` Forgive us."`
`Gaap sent one final sneering smile at Kanon, then turned away.`
`Kanon could only bite his lower lip and shake his fists...`
`"............`
` ...Dammit......"`
`"...You did well...`
` Good job hanging in there..."`
`"We're powerless...`
` Because we're furniture..."`
`"That's right, ...we're powerless.`
` ...However, furniture is sometimes relied upon...and even loved.`
` ...Right now, we've only been stored away in the basement.`
` ...Surely, one day, somebody will love us.`
` Because they'll rely on us.`
` ...That's why, for now, let's ignore their provocation and bear with it...`
` ...Okay?"`
`"...Father,`
` I've ordered them to lock up Gohda and Kumasawa in the storehouse."`
`"Very well.`
` Hang up now.`
` ...Chiester Sisters,`
` observe the grandchildren as they lock Gohda and Kumasawa away.`
` If they do anything suspicious, ...then in that moment, the selection test for my successor will be over."`
`When Kinzo made his order, the Chiester Sisters appeared behind him in a line.`
`"Understood, sir.`
` ...I will scout.`
` 556 and 410 will cover both flanks.`
` 45, you're on wide-area surveillance."`
`"00,`
` 556 is..."`
`"Ah, ......that's right.`
` Sorry."`
`"She was a good kid..."`
`"...That's why I don't like them nyeh.`
` ...Good people."`
`"What are you doing, Chiester Sisters?!`
` Follow my orders!"`
`"......My apologies, sir.`
` Then, let us go observe.`
` ...Move out!"`
`The Chiester Sisters erased their forms simultaneously.`
`Nanjo and Kyrie had witnessed the instants they appeared and disappeared as if by teleportation, `
`but they interpreted this as moving in and out of the darkness in a way that only looked like teleportation,`
` and the two could do nothing but rub their eyes...`
`"...Well then,`
` I shall begin the preparations for the test.`
` Ronove, Gaap,`
` I'm asking you to be the examiners.`
` Virgilia, you'll watch these rats.`
` ......After all, two of my furniture are here.`
` Just in case, be on your guard."`
`He glanced at Shannon and Kanon.`
`Tightly closing her eyes, Shannon gave a silent bow and answered wordlessly, avoiding any unnecessary actions...`
`"...Certainly.`
` I'll be careful."`
`"Isn't this cold hard on your old body, Lia?`
` Should I bring you a hot water bottle...?"`
`"Shut up.`
` Go quickly.`
` Gap!"`
`"Pukukuku...!`
` Well now, what a strange experience this game is, to have a test and examiners.`
` ......I do hope this development entertains Milady."`
`"...Come, arise, goat attendants."`
`Virgilia began to call out into the darkness, and from that spot, three massive goat-headed attendants suddenly appeared.`
`"Ah, Beato's minions.`
` How convenient.`
` Plus, they seem so warm.`
` I see, so you'll use them instead of a hot water bottle.`
` In that case, wouldn't sheep have been better than goats?"`
`"You're the one wearing cashmere.`
` ...They aren't very bright, but they faithfully follow orders and are quite dependable."`
`"Indeed, I leave it to you,`
` my friend, Virgilia.`
` ...The rest of you, follow me."`
`With a dignified gesture, Kinzo fluttered his cloak.`
`Following him were Ronove and Gaap,`
` ...as well as the three recently summoned goat attendants.`
`"...Hey, you three are supposed to wait here with me.`
` Don't follow them."`
`The goats jumped in surprise and then came tottering back.`
`Kyrie, who had been watching stunned as all of this played out, couldn't help but snort.`
`"Heheh...`
` What entertaining underlings."`
`"L-Lord Goldsmith did not give you permission to speak."`
`...She was probably embarrassed.`
`Virgilia had spoken cooly, but Kyrie saw through that, and for a little while, she couldn't restrain her muffled laughter.`
`However, on the inside, Kyrie was surprised at the number of people Kinzo had with him.`
`After all, including Kinzo himself, at least 10 enemies had already been spotted...`
`...The dungeon they were currently locked in was supposedly underneath the hidden mansion called Kuwadorian.`
`Although this mansion had been whispered of, not even Krauss had known of its existence until today.`
`Are there actually several facilities like this on Rokkenjima,`
` where many unknown henchmen that only Kinzo knows of hide...?`
`Just how many humans are on Rokkenjima, locked away by the typhoon...?`
`No, on the contrary...`
`Were we the only ones under the impression that there were only 18 people on this island...?`
`Were we, who bickered over whether Beatrice existed or not and worried about whether a 19 person existed or not, `
`nothing more than the frogs in a well on this island...?`
`No wait, not only that...`
` By now, are there actually more people on the enemy's side than on ours...?`
`"......Just what the hell is going on...?`
` Witches? Demons? Magic?`
` ...Are you telling us to believe in those?`
` Are my eyes screwed up? Or is it my head?`
` ...I think I'm losing it......"`
`A mass murder by magic.`
`Demons forming and disappearing into thin air.`
`Setting aside the enemy's numbers, `
`how should we interpret the various things thrust before our eyes that cannot be explained with the common sense of our world?`
`...Kyrie started to feel like she didn't know what was going on anymore,`
` and while desperately battling the urge to abandon everything and give up, she grit her teeth and tried to hold onto her sanity...`
`Obviously, Gohda and Kumasawa were quite unwilling to be locked in the rose garden shed.`
`...But they were threatened that, if they resisted, the hostages' safety could not be guaranteed...`
`It was fairly hard to get them to agree, `
`but once they started thinking that their safety might actually be guaranteed if the key to the gardening storehouse was to be handed to them after being shut inside,`
` ...and when it was decided that blankets and food would be carried in for them, they were finally convinced.`
`"......This place is pretty chilly...`
` I wonder how long we'll have to stay locked in here..."`
`"...It could be as late as Monday morning at the worst, so a full day and night.`
` ...I really feel bad about doing this to you two..."`
`George and Battler cleared a space on the floor, then spread the blankets there.`
`They also left the canned food, crackers, and other light snacks they had brought.`
`"It'll be hard for you guys to go until Monday with just this...`
` If only we could make a trip to the kitchen..."`
`"They said not to go anywhere we weren't told to.`
` ...Sounds like we're being watched.`
` ...Damn."`
`"...I am honestly sorry that we cannot be of any use...`
` And these are the times that we are truly supposed to be at your sides..."`
`"It can't be helped.`
` ...More importantly, take care of Kumasawa-san.`
` We don't know what might happen.`
` If the going gets tough, I'd like you to play it by ear and come to the rescue.`
` And more than anything, I want you to be safe..."`
`"...Yes, I understand.`
` ...Please be careful, everyone.`
` Right now, the Master...is taking human lives like they're pieces on a chessboard.`
` ...Please look out for yourselves."`
`Gohda stared at the floor, even now unable to believe what had happened as he remembered that atrocity in the dining hall,`
` and he hung his head in shame at his failure to fully describe that terror.`
`"Thank you.`
` ...Make sure you stay on your guard.`
` You too, Kumasawa-san."`
`"...And you all please take care as well...`
` I don't have any idea what's going on anymore..."`
`"Well then, ...we'll be off.`
` Let's go, Battler-kun, Jessica-chan.`
` ...Come on, you too, Maria-chan."`
`"......Uu-."`
`Looking at the pitiful expressions on the imprisoned pair's faces, it got really hard to close the shutter.`
`But we can't disobey.`
`...We're being watched.`
`The shutter was brought down and locked.`
`Then, George walked toward the small window on the side of the storehouse.`
`At that side, there was a small latticed window that could only admit light and ventilation.`
`It looked like something from a jail, making the two of them seem even more pitiable,`
` ...but on the other hand, it would hopefully protect them from Kinzo and his subordinates...`
`He opened the window and called out.`
`"...Are you okay? You aren't cold, are you?"`
`"We're okay.`
` You've given us so many blankets, after all.`
`"I wish we could've brought them a kerosene stove or something..."`
`"...But it wouldn't have ventilation here.`
` It'll probably be tough for them, but there's nothing we can do now.`
` ...Hostages are being held against us.`
` We can't disobey..."`
`"...Dammit...`
` ...If we manage to save Kyrie and the rest somehow..."`
`"Shh.`
` ...They might be listening.`
` ...Gohda-san, here.`
` It's the key to the shutter."`
`"...Indeed.`
` I'll hold on to it."`
`Gohda took the key, showed it to Kumasawa, and placed it in his own pocket.`
`There's only one key to the gardening shed's shutter.`
`That key was being held by the ones locked up inside it.`
`If the children had kept it...and had it stolen from them by some chance, that would do nothing but expose the lives of those in the shed to danger.`
`And even with the key, the shutter could not be opened from the inside.`
` Kinzo's demands were fulfilled this way.`
`However, there was now no longer any way to open the shed from the outside either.`
` This protected them.`
`Kinzo had ordered that they be confined, ...and we could do nothing but trust that this cold closed room would protect them.`
`Jessica watched this while holding Maria's hand, then looked over the thickets in the pitch-black rose garden.`
`...Somewhere in this darkness, somebody was hiding, watching to see whether we obeyed orders or not.`
`Of course, when we pointed our flashlights out there, no suspicious silhouettes appeared.`
`But somebody was surely out there, ...hiding and watching.`
`I was hit many times with an urge to scream at them.`
`...But I was able to hold that urge back through reason.`
`The four children left the area, repeatedly looking back over their shoulders.`
`The light from the faint lightbulb in the gardening storehouse was seeping out slightly.`
`...I wonder if this insane incident will come to an end somehow...so that we can meet those two again.`
`...To George, who had closed the shutter himself, `
`...the resistance of the lock had made it feel as though he'd killed them with his own hands.`
`"...But even so, ...we can't defy them..."`
`"What's with this test...?`
` ...Damn geezer, don't screw with us...!`
` Killing Mom, capturing Dad for that...`
`"...It's okay, Jessica onee-chan.`
` There's nothing to be sad about..."`
`"...Maria..."`
`"Soon, the witch will be revived.`
` ...Soon, we'll be able to meet in the Golden Land.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihi...`
`"Don't laugh indiscreetly like that.`
` ...Seriously, a resurrection ceremony for a witch?`
` ...Getting so many people involved...`
`in delusions he should've just kept inside his head.`
` ...That's gonna cost you, ...bastard..."`
`"...Let's return to the guesthouse.`
` ...It'll be bad if we aren't there when Grandfather calls."`
`Urged on by George, everyone began walking towards the guesthouse...`
`At that moment, Jessica turned in a circle, facing towards the darkness of the rose garden, and roared.`
`".........HEY!!`
` Someone's watching, right?!`
` Tell the old man...!!`
` Tell him I'm gonna fuckin' kill him!!`
`Of course, there was no reply, only the howl of the wind and rain...`
`The children returned to the guesthouse...`
`...While fearing what was waiting for them up ahead...`
`After they left,`
` ...from the exact point in the darkness that Jessica had yelled at,`
` two rabbit ears sprung up...`
`"...S-Sorsorsorry...!`
` They found me ouuuut...!!"`
`"It's because you're too slow nyeh.`
`"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please don't tell Pendragon-samaaaaaaaaaa!"`
`"Be quiet.`
` It was obviously just a bluff.`
` ...Gohda and Kumasawa's imprisonment confirmed.`
` Mission complete.`
` We'll report back."`
`"Ya-i, ya-i.`
` Nihihihihihihihihi!`
` Ouch."`
`"Do you want us all stuck on nothing but carrots and water because of collective responsibility?`
` ...Let's go."`
`The fact that they were being watched certainly seemed to be true.`
`Because, when they returned to the cousins' room, turned the lights on, and laid down on their beds, the phone rang again.`
`Earlier, Jessica had been answering the phone, seeing as this was her house,`
` but now it was the eldest, George, who picked it up.`
`This time, Kyrie-san was on the other end of the line.`
`George handed it to Battler out of consideration...`
`"......Hello.`
` Kyrie-san?`
` Is everything all right over there...?!"`
`"Thanks for worrying.`
` ...At the moment, we're all doing great here.`
` ...............Sorry, I've been ordered to refrain from idle chatter.`
` Listen to what I'm about to tell you."`
`The fact that they were hostages still hadn't changed.`
`Kinzo or one of his subordinates was listening to the conversation.`
`Battler restrained the urge to talk about other things...and focused on what Kyrie had to say.`
`"The test will be carried out by Jessica-chan, George-kun, Battler-kun,`
` and Maria-chan, in that order.`
` ...You'll each be summoned in turn, so until then, do not leave the room.`
` When someone's called out, they'll head to their designated location, alone."`
`Battler repeated it out loud, so that the cousins listening in around him could hear.`
`"...So it'll be Jessica, Aniki, me, and Maria, in that order, and we've gotta stay in the room until we're called, right?`
` ...Got it.`
` ...Maria too?`
` Even a nine-year-old girl... What's the damn geezer trying to force us to do, that bastard...?"`
`"......The fate of the Ushiromiya family rests in all of your hands.`
` ...Do your best."`
`"...Nng.`
` ......Sure."`
`Battler noticed the strange nuance in Kyrie's words.`
`Even without any blood connection, he could still understand thanks to the long-lasting bond they shared.`
`At this point, it doesn't make sense to worry about the Ushiromiya family itself.`
`...That probably wasn't the message Kyrie wanted to send.`
`She probably meant 'There's no way for us to escape from this dungeon, and we can only wait to be rescued.`
` Our lives are in your hands.'`
`...Something like that.`
`"Yeah, leave it to me.`
` We don't know what kind of test it is, but no problem.`
` I'll take it gladly.`
` ......It's gonna be a serious test, right?`
` ...Should we really...`
`go all out?"`
`"...Yes.`
` It's a serious test.`
` Grandfather truly does intend to test you all."`
`"It's useless, it's all useless.`
` ...Some old fart on death's door is gonna give me a serious challenge?`
` Let him spout nonsense after he gets in the coffin.`
` I know he's there, so tell him this for me:`
` I'll be your successor.`
` And my first action will be to shove my fist into your face...!"`
`Even without Kyrie having to repeat it, Battler's powerful declaration of war reached Kinzo's ears...`
`"Fuhahahahahahahaha!!`
` Battleeeeer, I am truly looking forward to thaaat!`
` I can't wait to see just what a man who once threw away the Ushiromiya name has attained,`
` just what lot in life he's reached when he appears before me!!`
` Tell him...!"`
`Unfortunately, Kinzo's voice was not picked up by the reciever.`
` Therefore, Kyrie spoke for him.`
`"It sounds like he's more than up for the challenge.`
` ...Got that, Battler-kun?`
` There's no need to hold back.`
` ......You are Rudolf's son.`
` ...No, you are my son.`
` Show me something I can brag about to anyone.`
` ......I leave everything in your hands."`
`"Understood, Mom.`
` ......Leave the rest to me...!"`
`"......All of us here have lost the right to inherit the position of Successor.`
` ...Now, we're just the same as pieces taken off the game board looking on from the outside.`
` So you'll have to fight by yourselves."`
`".........Kyrie-san......"`
`'!s0`
`'We've already given up,`
` ...so forget about us.'`
`...But...for that very reason, I won't give up...`
`I'll definitely crush this test or whatever...and save everyone...!`
`"In that case, here are his instructions for the first test, Jessica-chan's:`
` ...Go to your room."`
`"Really, go to your room? What's your game, you damn geezer..."`
`"It seems he means Jessica-chan's personal room, the one in the mansion."`
`"...I'll hand it over to Jessica.`
` Tell her directly for me.`
` ...Jessica, here."`
`"H-Hello...`
` ......Yes, I understand..."`
`"......Starting with me, huh...?`
` ...Well, I've been ready.`
` See ya later!"`
`Even Jessica was probably tempted to succumb to the fear of a girl her age.`
`...But she crushed those feelings and strengthened her resolve.`
`"Be careful, ...okay?"`
`"...We're probably being watched, right?`
` We can't do anything we aren't told.`
`"...They say that old geezer killed those six in the dining hall instantly, with no hesitation.`
` ...So, if we try to fight back, we might end up the same way."`
`"I know.`
` ......I'll beat them at their own game."`
`"Don't do anything reckless.`
` ...If you think you're in any danger, your own safety comes first.`
` ...If Uncle Krauss finds out that his daughter sacrificed herself for him,`
` there's no doubt it'll tear his heart apart."`
`"It goes the other way too.`
` ......If Mom and Dad are both killed, and I'm the only one left,`
` my heart will rip itself to pieces."`
`"...............`
`...Battler-kun,`
` what you said earlier is true, right...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Kyrie-san and the others are already...prepared for what will happen."`
`"Then, ...the way things are now is just perfect.`
` ...Everyone's lives rest on our shoulders.`
` The hostages can't do anything while they're locked up.`
` That means we'll have to manage something ourselves."`
`"......If something happens, run back to the guesthouse.`
` At that time, we'll be done playing along with Grandfather's game."`
`"Aniki......"`
`"At that time, we'll declare war.`
` ......Wherever they're locked up, we'll save them, and we'll deal with Grandfather accordingly."`
`"... Are you sure, Aniki?`
` ...Shannon-chan's there too."`
`"............`
`...That's why I'm saying it. I'm not sitting around and waiting for my fiancée to be killed.`
` ......What scares me is not that Shannon might be killed by Grandfather."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"~ib~I'm just worried you guys'll get there first and clobber the damn geezer who made my fiancée experience terror before I do~ib~."`
`"I see...`
` ...This really does sound like a test to see who'll be the Successor."`
`"Yep.`
` ...The first one to bury a fist into that old face will be the next Head."`
`George, Battler, and Jessica each forcefully nodded their heads and put their fists together.`
`Then, Jessica headed off to her own room, as designated...`
`Her form disappeared into the darkness of the rose garden waving in the strong winds.`
`...Watching her go, George and Battler gripped their fists even tighter, making them quiver...`
`Left on the second floor, Maria watched Jessica's back through the window.`
`She wore a blank expression...`
`"...I wonder what everyone's getting so upset about.`
` ......Even though when Beatrice is revived, everyone will be brought back to life."`
`Jessica's form was already being completely swallowed up by the darkness.`
`...At that time, the phone began to ring again.`
`Battler and George heard it and came clamoring back, but Maria picked up the receiver right away.`
`".........Hello."`
`"...I-Is that Maria-sama...?`
` It's me, Shannon.`
` ...Would you please hand the phone to George-sama?"`
`This time, it was Shannon on the phone.`
`And this time, the message was to tell the next person, George, where he was to go...`
`Of course, since the time of her birth, ...Jessica had been raised in this mansion.`
`The atrophied, Western-style house that the cousins called a mansion was her home.`
`And yet, she had never understood her cousins' feelings as much as she did today.`
`...At the same time, she had never felt her own home, which she knew well, to be as alien as it seemed now...`
`Her own......room.`
`This had once been her hideaway, the only place in this vast mansion where she could feel at peace.`
`However, ...she had never felt as much pressure coming from that door as she did now.`
`"......A test, you say...?`
` Tch, what the hell could be waiting in there...`
` I'm not gonna find my desk and stuff dragged around all over the place, right...?"`
`She acted tough, trying to deceive herself.`
`...Trying make herself believe that she wasn't scared of anything.`
`Readying herself, she opened the door to her room.`
`"............"`
`...When she saw that, fortunately, the room didn't appear to be messed up, she relaxed.`
`No one...was there.`
` ...Of course.`
`There was nowhere for anyone to hide here.`
`Right away, Jessica locked the door behind her.`
`...This way, the room was safe.`
`She peeked under the bed and in the closet, but of course, no one was hiding.`
`"...Wh-What the hell.`
` ...Haha, ...haha...!"`
`She looked at the clock.`
` ...It was just past 23:10.`
`As her tension lessened and fatigue came back to her entire body, she realized how messed up this whole day had been.`
`It was still about 23:00.`
`...The plan had been for all the cousins to gather, have fun playing around, and talk animatedly about various things together into the night.`
`Normally, we would've been doing that kind of thing right now.`
`Why...has that turned into this...?`
`"......It's all that damn geezer's fault...`
` ...How could he do that...to Mom...`
`to everyone......"`
`She shook her head back and forth with anger and sadness...`
`But there was no one here to direct those emotions at.`
`...Because of the lock, this room's security was guaranteed.`
`Remembering that one more time, Jessica somehow regained her calm...`
`If it keeps up like this and nothing happens...`
`...I want to go to the dining hall and see Mom's dead face.`
`...Even though Gohda emphasized so strongly that it was gruesome and that I definitely shouldn't go to look at it,`
` even so, I wanted to see her face at the end...`
`But we were warned repeatedly that stepping out of line even a little would put the hostages in danger.`
`...Could it be that locking the door was also against the rules...?`
`If I close myself up in here, I alone might be saved.`
`...But if I don't open it, it'll surely be against the rules, and Dad, Kanon-kun, Shannon, Aunt Kyrie and Doctor Nanjo...`
`will be killed.`
`......There's no way the scales will balance out between five lives and my own one life.`
`Jessica tightly shut her eyes, resisting the other part of herself that said 'Isn't it okay as long as I stay alive?',`
` ...faced the door, and made to unlock it.`
`...At that time.`
`*clap* *clap* *clap*...`
`A crisp applause rang out, making Jessica's heart leap...`
`"If the door had remained locked, it might have been in violation of the rules, and harm could have come to the hostages.`
` ...But despite that, your own life might be saved."`
`"However, you resisted that temptation and were about to unlock the door yourself.`
` That bravery of yours is worthy of admiration."`
`"Wh-Who......"`
`'!s0`
`...searched everywhere a human could've been hiding, `
`......where did this man...come from...?`
`......There was nowhere for a Human to hide,`
` ...but could something non-Human have managed it......?`
`This was supposedly my first meeting with this largely-built, middle-aged man.`
`...I didn't recognize this guy, who looked like a butler and bore the crest of the One-Winged Eagle.`
`"A pleasure to meet you, Jessica-sama.`
` ......I serve as head furniture for the Master, the 27th of the 72.`
` I am called Ronove."`
`"...Rono...ue...?`
` ......Genji...san......?"`
`"...Ah yes, ...Genji is like my little brother.`
` Or perhaps he was my true form while in this world.`
` ...You might even say he was my vessel."`
`"......What's...this guy...saying......?"`
`"Oh, my apologies.`
` This is not something a Human would be able to understand.`
` ......Well then, let us move on to the main event."`
`"So this is...`
`...that test or whatever the damn geezer talked about......?"`
`"Correct.`
` This is the test that the Master has granted you, Jessica-sama."`
`At Ronove's elegant gesture, like that of a butler ordering for a meal to be set out,`
` many gold butterflies flew up out of nowhere...`
`"Gwah?!`
` What the...hell...?!"`
`As the cloud of gold butterflies spun around in a small swirl, they gathered in one place.`
`...Then, that golden mound disappeared like a pile of leaves blown away by a cold wintry wind,`
` ...and there lay a Western envelope with the One-Winged Eagle crest done on it in gold leaf...`
`With a gesture, Ronove urged her to pick it up.`
`Jessica timidly did so...and opened the letter inside...`
`".........What's...this...?"`
`"It is an exceedingly simple test to determine whether one is qualified to become the Successor.`
` ...Please attend to the question written there with a fitting attitude for the Successor who is to support the Ushiromiya family...`
`and tell me your answer, as well as the thoughts that led you to it."`
`".........D-Dumbass......"`
`Shaking, Jessica looked between the paper and Ronove's face several times...`
`...At that time, George, who had been called out after Jessica, could be seen in the arbor of the rose garden.`
`If things had gone normally, ...he had planned to give Shannon the ring that would be proof of their engagement...here, at this time, on this day.`
`...But the woman in front of George now was not Shannon.`
`"...Read it.`
` That is Goldsmith's test for you."`
`"............"`
`George picked up the Western envelope, which was on the table where he'd once had tea with Shannon,`
` and read its contents...`
`Perhaps its message was short.`
` After glancing at it, George's eyes grew sharp.`
`"......What's this supposed to be?"`
`"Ehheheheheh.`
` ...It is as you see.`
` This is the test given to you, to see if you're qualified to be the Successor.`
` ...As you ask yourself whether you truly are so qualified, answer that question."`
`"......What a...stupid question."`
`"That's right.`
` It really is a stupid question.`
` ......Doesn't that mean the Ushiromiya family inheritance is also something on that level in Goldsmith's eyes?`
` ...Heheheh."`
`George lowered his eyes to the surface of the letter once again, examining its contents...`
`George and Jessica.`
` ...While the tests given to them were slightly different, they were almost exactly the same.`
`"...'Among the three mentioned below,`
` in order to gain two, sacrifice one'."`
`"It's a simple three choices.`
` ......Decide for yourself which one you will choose to abandon."`
`"If you refuse to choose, the test will be suspended.`
` I've been given permission to kill you right here by my own hands.`
` ......If you want to include even that as a choice, then there are four options.`
` It's been an awful long time since I've gotten to play with a kid like you, so I can't say I'd be disappointed."`
`"......Are these three choices only a test?`
` Or will the consequence of my choice be carried out?"`
`"Don't be so naive.`
` ...The one you choose will definitely lose their life."`
`"............"`
`Among the three mentioned below...`
`In order to gain two, sacrifice one.`
`1. Your life`
`2. Shannon's life`
`3. Everyone else's lives`
`If you do not choose one, all of the above will be lost.`
`"......Why is Shannon's name here?"`
`"The second choice has the name of the one most needed and most loved by the test-taker.`
` ...I believe Kanon's name is written second on Jessica's test."`
`"......You gave this stupid question to Jessica too...?"`
`"*giggle*giggle*`
` ...You shouldn't be worrying about Jessica, right?`
` Right now, you are the one being tested.`
` It really is a simple three-choice test.`
` Which can you throw away for the sake of the other two?`
` ...Isn't that simple?`
` If you still can't decide, would you like me to lend you a coin...?"`
`"...A coin?`
` How would you choose between three options with something that only has two sides?"`
`"No one would throw away their own life.`
` ...So, there remain two choices that will leave you standing.`
` Will you give up on everyone for the sake of the one you love?`
` Or will you give up on the one person you love so that you can save as many people as possible?"`
`"Either way, you should be able to find a fitting just cause.`
` After all, this Rokkenjima is now a demon island."`
`"...The sentimental relationships of the Human world aren't necessary here.`
` No one will blame you.`
` Do as your heart desires.`
` ...And ask yourself whether you're qualified to succeed the Ushiromiya family Headship..."`
`"Or rather, make your decision as if you truly were the Ushiromiya Family Head, okay?`
` Hehheheheheh..."`
`"............"`
`"......Fuck you guys, ...mocking me like this......!"`
`Jessica crumpled the letter up and threw it on the floor.`
`"I believe your anger is quite appropriate.`
` ...I also find it an exceedingly pitiful...and yet truly humorous question.`
` ...Pu ku ku ku."`
`"How could anyone wish to die themselves?`
` And how could anyone want to remain alive after abandoning the life of the one they...l-love.`
` ...And...how could anyone massacre everyone else, ...as long as it's good for the two of them...?!"`
`"No, Jessica-sama.`
` Such a person could exist.`
` This is Rokkenjima, the demon island!`
` It is now completely cut off from the Human world and fully immersed in the spirit world like cheese fondue.`
` Values of the human world get taken out with the trash."`
`"Pu ku ku!`
` So please.`
` Rank the things you desire from the bottom of your heart.`
` Whatever remains will become a fitting answer for you in this insane evening."`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, jes_4e139:`
`"'If you do not choose one, all of the above will be lost'...`
`also makes for a fine fourth option.`
` Even choosing that should give us an amusing show."`
`"But since that choice will result in the loss of your own life in the end, I believe it would be more wise to be pure and choose the first one, 'your life',`
` so that the other two will be saved.`
` ...Everything has been entrusted to your decision, Jessica-sama."`
`"Please, let me hear an answer and conviction fitting for the Successor to the Ushiromiya Family Headship...!!`
` I, Ronove, am sincerely hoping for a wonderful answer, fitting for the Master's descendant who shares his blood!!"`
`"...D-Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt..."`
`That scene was observed through the magic crystal ball Kinzo held.`
`Kinzo finally couldn't hold it back and, spreading his arms and facing the heavens, began laughing in an explosive voice...`
`"Fuhahahahahahaha, waahhahhahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` What are you wavering for, foolish grandchildren, my descendants?!!"`
`"Isn't this problem so easy that you could answer right away?`
` Isn't this a question that should cause you to waver less than whether to put butter or jam on your morning toast?!!`
` ...Do you people know the correct answer?"`
`He turned to face the Chiester Sisters, who had been waiting on him.`
`"N-N-No, my apologies, I don't know, Lord Goldsmith!"`
`"Fool, not choosing at all means game oveeeeeeeeeeeer!!!`
` You foolish rabbit, who cannot even choose a reason or a goal for your own life...!!"`
`"You aren't worth a single ant that anyone might step upon without even noticing!!`
` Die! Be crushed!! Disappear faster than I can blink!!`
` ...And what of you?"`
`"...I would sacrifice the first one, 'your own life', sir.`
` Weapons fight and die in battle.`
` And weapons exist to destroy enemies and protect allies.`
` Being able to protect those we love and then die is our satisfaction, sir."`
`"Hoh.`
` A truly splendid model answer for a weapon.`
` The immediate reply is very nice.`
` ...So, have you been raised to think you'll be given an extra carrot for answering that way?`
` Heheheheh, that's wrong, seeeeeeeee?`
` Even that is wrong, seeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...?"`
`"Answering that way when you are asked is nothing more than giving the answer you have been indoctrinated with!!`
` You are the same as that other rabbit a second ago.`
` You still live without having chosen a purpose or goal to strive for...!!`
` You filth that doesn't deserve to live...!`
` It would suit you well to be crushed and used as fodder for the other livestock!!"`
`".........!`
` ...Yes sir!`
` Animal fodder...would be an honor...!"`
`"That's wrong, riiiiiiight?`
` You don't want to see anyone else die anymore, riiiiiiight?`
` Why can't you accept that?`
` Accept that the depths of the depths of your old wound are still festering and rotting...!`
` Yes, the rotting stench would make the nose wrinkle, you foolish rotten rabbit!!`
` These are words of praise for you!!"`
`"......Th-Thank you very much, ...sir..."`
`"Well then, what about you, the last one?`
` Which of the three choices would you choose...?"`
`"Nihi.`
` Without wavering, I'd chose the second one."`
`"Hoh...`
` The second.`
` There are not many who could stick their chest out and choose to offer 'the one they love' as a sacrifice.`
` Tell me your reason."`
`"Because the one you love will be lost eventually.`
` If you don't love anyone, you won't get hurt, and if you lose someone, you still might be able to love again.`
` So,`
` the person you love right now isn't worth that much at all nyeh.`
` ...Nihi!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` I see, so that is why you reach such an answer, you rabbit who has become cowardly from pain caused by love...`
` I have heard that rabbits can die from loneliness, but just when was it that your heart was killed...?"`
`"Then, rabbit, I shall alter the question.`
` Why don't I change the second option to, not 'the one you love', but 'the memories of the one you loved'?"`
`"...How is that?`
` Can you still select that one?`
` What's this about the one you love not being worth much at all, foolish rabbit...?!`
` Filth who cannot even face up to the depths of her own love!!`
` Try and choose it, try and choose to have the one you loved forgotten!!"`
`"You can do it, right?`
` I'll bet you can, riiiiiiiight?`
` Cooooome on, try saying that you can, okaaaaaaaaaaaayy?!?!"`
`"Y-Yes, I can choose it...`
` I can choose it...!!`
` Nihi, ......nihihihihihihihihihiiihii..."`
`"L-Lord Goldsmith...!`
` Please, stop this...!!"`
`"Hihiiihiii...`
` ...Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnggg...!!"`
`"Enough, rabbit filth!!`
` Go to Virgilia and help keep watch on the dungeon.`
` Disappear!!"`
`The Chiester Sisters, with their respective old wounds of the heart gouged out,`
` escaped by disappearing.`
`After that, even though there was no one to hear, Kinzo continued talking by himself as though in a play...`
`"...Indeed, that is the nature of this charming test.`
` In truth, no choice can be said to be correct.`
`'!s1`
`without hesitation, `
`quickly, `
`and with a resolute conviction and their own strong, unshakable will!!"`
`"It's their reason and their willpower that are most essential.`
` That is what I want to learn.`
` Yes, my descendants, I am truly looking forward to what kind of answer you will show me!!"`
`"......Hmmmm?`
` Me?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Yes, of course I once had the same question thrust upon me.`
` Because I splendidly answered that devil's question, I was able to obtain gold and honor, and that witch as my possession.`
` Which answer did I chooooooooooose?`
` ......Do you really need me to say it out loud?`
` Wahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!!"`
`"Well then,`
` have you nearly decided on your answer...?"`
`"............"`
`As Jessica stared at the letter that had been crushed and lay on the floor,`
` ...she hung her head in constant silence.`
`All that filled the room was the stir from wind and rain shaking the treetops.`
`Regardless of how noisy that was, it actually made the stillness more apparent.`
`Ronove waited for Jessica's answer.`
`...However, Jessica didn't answer.`
`Whether she was lost in deep thought or had stopped thinking, Ronove couldn't tell.`
`...No, ...he might actually have known.`
`But cruelly, like a demon, ...Ronove urged Jessica to voice it.`
`"......If you cannot choose any,`
` ...I can at least bring you peace without pain, ...but..."`
`"............`
`......me."`
`"...Yes?`
` I had trouble hearing.`
` Could you say it again please...?"`
`Jessica lifted her face...and looked straight into Ronove's eyes.`
`...It seemed that she had decided on her answer.`
`"......Kill me."`
`Jessica said it one more time, ...clearly.`
`Perhaps Ronove had imagined that this would be her answer from the very beginning.`
`...Without any surprise, he smiled lightly and nodded.`
`"...I thought you would choose that answer, Jessica-sama.`
` ...Well then, there is no right or wrong answer to this test.`
` The essential part is what thoughts led you to that answer."`
`"Come now.`
` Please answer with a fitting attitude for the Successor."`
`"......It's not like I chose the first one 'cause I wanna die.`
` ...The second one was letting Kanon-kun die.`
` Of course, that was out of the question.`
` So I excluded it.`
` ...The third one was everyone else's lives.`
` Of course, that was also out of the question.`
` So I excluded it.`
` ...After that, only the first choice remained."`
`"Process of elimination, ...is it?`
` So, it was not something you chose proactively..."`
`After chuckling slightly, Ronove dropped his gaze.`
`...A Human couldn't even imagine what answer a demon would have been expecting.`
`...All she could understand was that this was apparently slightly below Ronove's expectations.`
`"...That answer is neither bad nor good.`
` ...60 percent, I believe you could call it.`
` ...I'm a little disappointed."`
`"You're a pretty selfish bastard, telling me to answer with self-confidence and then being disappointed when I do."`
`"......Apparently there was more to it than process of elimination.`
` ...It's a failing grade either way, ...but there seems to be a little more to your thoughts.`
` Allow me to ask."`
`"People don't want to die.`
` ...So no one would want to choose the first option.`
` ...People want to live in happiness...and struggle as much as life will let them.`
` So normally, the first choice should be impossible from the beginning."`
`"......However, you took that first choice.`
` You chose to throw away your own life.`
` Only that choice remained for you."`
`"I tried...thinking of the future that would come after choosing each one."`
`"...Hoh.`
` And what did you see...?"`
`"First, ......I tried letting Kanon-kun die.`
` ......I tried to imagine the rest of my life after having abandoned the one I love."`
`"What kind of life was it...?"`
`"It was a horrible woman, who didn't deserve to live.`
` A shabby woman who always lamented her own decision and lived only to regret.`
` ...I could never forgive a horrible woman who'd choose to live and abandon the person she loved.`
` ...I put an end to her myself."`
`"Heheh, how brave.`
` ......So, did you also consider the third option?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` I tried letting everyone but me and Kanon-kun die.`
` ...There's no way Kanon-kun would like me if I did that."`
`"So again, even with Kanon-kun, I was forced to bear the cross of abandoning so many people.`
` ...And even Kanon-kun was forced to bear it."`
`"......I'm not gonna make a foolish choice that leaves Kanon-kun bearing that cross.`
` I wouldn't be able to forgive a future me who did something like that.`
` ...I put an end to that woman myself too."`
`Jessica had pictured it in her mind.`
`The future her beyond each of the three choices.`
`There were three Jessicas.`
`...Of the three, two had regrets.`
`Only one could hold her head high and smile at Kanon.`
`"...You know, `
`I once had the nerve to preach something to Kanon-kun.`
` ...Something about trying to live life to the fullest."`
`"Live your life to the fullest.`
` ...Meaningful words.`
` And a surprisingly difficult thing to do."`
`"So yeah.`
` I've gotta stand proud and show Kanon-kun.`
` ......Show him how to live by holding your head high and looking straight at the sun, with a full smile."`
`"...Will Kanon be able to accept your self-sacrifice?`
` Haven't you thought that your selfish decision might hurt him more than is necessary...?"`
`"That's why...I want to leave a message..."`
`"Hoh.`
` ...I will listen, but I am after all a demon.`
` ...I may not keep my promises, you see?"`
`"......Keep it!`
` Your promise!"`
`Jessica spoke that looking quite unconcerned.`
`She had asked the demon who was about to take her life to pass on a message, and she didn't think at all that she would be betrayed.`
`...At that extremely innocent smile, Ronove closed his eyes lightly and shrugged his shoulders.`
`"Hmph...`
` ...I see nothing wrong with that.`
` So?`
` What shall I tell him...?"`
`『...Tell Kanon-kun...to live his life to the fullest.`
` ...No, that's not quite it.`
` Not...Kanon-kun.`
` ...He still hasn't told me his real name yet.`
` Tell the real Kanon-kun to live his life to the fullest.`
` ...Tell him that.〝`
`"......Mi...lady..."`
`"...Jessica, `
`...you really are......"`
`"Ronove is fickle, so he might not have passed the message on.`
` ...You certainly are fortunate `
`to have me here showing you this scene."`
`A musty three-sided mirror was set beyond the bars, ...and the scene with Jessica was reflected on it.`
`On the next mirror, ...the scene with George was reflected in the same way.`
`None of them questioned how a three-sided mirror had appeared from a group of butterflies,`
` nor did they wonder why these scenes with Jessica and George were reflected on it.`
`...Because the reflected scenes themselves were more important.`
`"......Are you so prepared...`
`...to throw your life away......`
`...for his sake......?"`
`".........`
`...My...apologies..."`
`Krauss looked at Kanon with a complicated expression mixed in with a bitter smile.`
` ...Kanon wouldn't meet his eyes.`
`"...Virgilia-sama,`
` ...there is no reason for Milady to throw away her life.`
` ...Please kill me.`
` Please change it to the second choice.`
` ...That way, everything should resolve itself."`
`"Hohhohohohohoho...`
` I am not capable of granting that wish.`
` ...After all, this is Jessica's own decision, which she herself chose."`
`At that time, suddenly, the air split and the Chiester Sisters appeared, flying into Virgilia's chest.`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, s41_4e34:`
`"So mean, so mean, Lord Goldsmith is so meeeeeeeeaan, waaaaaaaaahhhh!"`
`"I'm...doing the best I can...`
` Crushing me for animal fodder, ...that's just too much.`
` ...Uuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!"`
`Virgilia, who still didn't have a clue what was going on, was mobbed by the sobbing Chiester Sisters.`
`"Th-There, there. Everything's all right, don't cry...`
` I'll make you some delicious tea...`
` ...I'm leaving it up to you all to guard this place.`
` If they do anything suspicious, inform me immediately...!"`
`The goat attendants all faced each other, nodding their heads.`
`Virgilia took the Chiester Sisters and left.`
`The sound of them going up stairs could be heard, so they had probably gone to an upper floor.`
`"......This is our chance.`
` ...It looks like these goat heads are morons.`
` ...I wonder if we can trick them..."`
`Kyrie realized that an opportunity had arrived, but even so, she hadn't thought of a way to break the metal bars...`
`The Jessica reflected on the three-sided mirror had her eyes closed, as though in contemplation.`
`...The way she had both hands stuck into her pockets, wanting to be defiant until the very end, might have been her own aesthetic stance.`
`"......That's all I have to say.`
` ......Kill me."`
`"...Understood.`
` ......Well then,`
` ...fear not, for I shall make your death more gentle and merciful than any sleep."`
`As Ronove raised his palm, ...he slowly approached Jessica...`
`'!s0`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kla_4e316:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kla_4e317:`
`Realizing that his daughter was about to be killed, Krauss went half-mad and repeatedly body-slammed the metal bars.`
`The goats looked like they were sneering at how a mere Human didn't stand a chance at breaking those bars.`
`Krauss's pointless efforts certainly may have been comical.`
`...But Krauss was giving it everything he had.`
`He was now living with all he had as Jessica's father, so that he could save her.`
`......Kanon made tight fists with both hands.`
`If he used his cursed power, he might be able to cut through even metal bars.`
`...But there were a full three goats.`
`...There was no way he could defeat three of them in an instant.`
`It would instantly be reported, and then even Virgilia and the Chiester Sisters would probably dash in.`
`Even if he could break the bars, ...that would be the end of it.`
` ...It was useless.`
`...Kanon already knew that the witch sneered at useless efforts like that,`
` ...so he could do nothing but stare at Krauss's repeated body-slams...`
`"...Ah, ......George-sama..."`
`Shannon, who had been looking at the three-sided mirror, raised her voice.`
`...When they looked, they could see George, who had been silent the whole time, lift his face.`
`...It seemed that George had also decided on an answer...`
`"......Have you decided?`
` On your answer?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......I've decided."`
`"Is it an unwavering answer...?"`
`"Yeah. It's unwavering."`
`"Then let me hear it.`
` ......Oh, by the way,`
` it seems Jessica decided to take the 'your life' option.`
` Surely, such an indecisive person as you isn't going to choose the same answer, right...?"`
`"...Jessica gave her own answer.`
` ...No matter which choice that was, it was Jessica's answer.`
` It doesn't influence my answer in any way."`
`"I see.`
` Then let me ask again.`
` ......Among the three mentioned below,`
` in order to gain two, sacrifice one.`
`1. Your life.`
` 2. Shannon's life.`
`3. Everyone else's lives.`
` ......Which one will you choose?`
` Could it be the first one, like Jessica?"`
`"......Wrong."`
`"Oh...?"`
`Gaap looked a little surprised.`
`...Because she had thought this timid-looking man would obviously choose that option.`
`".........`
`...Very well then.`
` I'm glad the most boring option for me has been removed.`
` ...Then, as crazy as it sounds, ...could it be the second option?`
` Can you abandon Shannon's life...?"`
`"......You must be joking.`
` Why would I do that to the person I was going to give an engagement ring to tonight?"`
`".........`
`......How bold.`
` Is that your answer...?"`
`"......That's it.`
` ...My answer is...`
`the third option."`
`George took......the third option.`
`...'Everyone else's...lives'.`
`Unsurprisingly, Gaap hadn't imagined that he'd give an answer like that.`
`...She had been sure that he'd choose the same one as Jessica...`
`So, she was interested in how he had reached that answer.`
`...How he had reached an answer that had surpassed the imagination of the 33rd ranked of the 72 demons?`
`"I want you to tell me.`
` ......I want you to tell me the circumstances that made it possible for you to sacrifice the lives of everyone else so that you and the fiancée you love would be safe.`
` ...Did you use the process of elimination, like Jessica?"`
`"Wrong.`
` I clearly have no choice except this one."`
`"......So, you don't care what happens, as long as it's good for you?`
` So, you can sacrifice the world for the woman you love...?"`
`"What are you even talking about?"`
`"......What......?"`
`George faced the demon as he spoke, almost as though he was disgusted.`
`"...Tonight,`
` I planned on calling Shannon right here and giving her this ring as proof of our engagement.`
` ......There probably are quite a few people who wouldn't celebrate an engagement between me and Shannon.`
` I was prepared to make enemies of the entire family by announcing my engagement to her."`
`"I have been prepared.`
` Since the time I came to this island......no, that's not it.`
` ......Since the time I confessed that I wanted to engage her."`
`"......So, you can sacrifice everything else as long as you can get married...?"`
`"Marriage means...`
`...continuing to be your wife's ally for your whole life.`
` ......At that point,`
` ...I was prepared to have the entire world as my enemy for her sake."`
`Those words, through the three-sided mirror, ...also reached Shannon's ears.`
`And that determination reached her eyes.`
`...Shannon certainly had promised to be given an engagement ring tonight.`
`Then, this incident had occurred, and she hadn't been able to receive the ring.`
`But now...`
`...Even though it wasn't in the form of a ring, `
`Shannon had received something even greater.`
`...And as proof of that, `
`...a single tear with the same sparkle as a diamond...`
`dripped down.`
`"Heh, ...heheheheheheh...!`
` What a courageous answer.`
` I see, if I really think about it, this was an easy decision for you."`
`"After all, your parents were already killed on the first twilight, right?`
` By now, there's no one whose death would trouble you."`
`"Hahhahahahahahaha, I see, truly an easy choice.`
` Ahahahahahahahaha..."`
`"Say whatever you want.`
` This determination and choice are mine, ...and mine as the Successor."`
`The sparkle in George's eyes was brilliantly sharp.`
`...For just an instant, Gaap felt the same sense of threat as Kinzo's...and was slightly overwhelmed.`
`"......I see.`
` ...Yes, the same decision as Goldsmith...`
` ...So even with your innocent face, ...you will also become a terrible demon in the future.`
` ...What do you know, we might get along pretty well."`
`"You will succeed Goldsmith.`
` Eventually, I may even be summoned and serve you.`
` ...That could be surprisingly interesting.`
` ......Heheh."`
`Gaap had needed to change her opinion of George.`
`...This man bore a determination and resolve unimaginable from his outward appearance...`
`and not just now, but since the very beginning.`
`"I am prepared to inherit the Headship right away.`
` ......No, that's not it.`
` You told me to think as the Head in this test.`
` So I answered based on the premise that I am the Head."`
`"......No, even that's not it.`
` I thought as the Head himself.`
` ...I am now...the Head of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"............`
`Hehheheheheh...`
` Splendid, to think that you'd be able to go so far.`
` It seems you truly are one to be reckoned with.`
` ...Battler's and Maria's tests remain, but I've got a good feeling that you'll pass."`
`"......But only if that is your true, unexaggerated answer, you see?"`
`"......Do you doubt my resolve?"`
`"Can you carry out the option you chose?`
` Can you, right now, with your own hands, offer all the lives that exist on this island as sacrifices...?`
` By your own hand...?"`
`"I can.`
` I've said I was prepared to do so several times."`
`"Ha, ......hahahahahaha!`
` Then return to the guesthouse right away...and kill Battler and Maria!`
` When that's done, I'll bring you the other hostages.`
` Execute each of them except Shannon before her eyes!`
` You can do it, right?!"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"~ib~I can~ib~.`
` My resolve is on a whole different level from yours."`
`"............Nn.`
` Then carry it out!`
` Death for them all!`
` Complete this bloodstained ceremony as the new Ushiromiya Family Head...!!"`
`"...Understood.`
` I'll carry it out.`
` I'm already the Ushiromiya Family Head."`
`"Yes, that's right!`
` Stain that throne red by your own hands...!`
` You will become the king of the spirit world who controls the demons...!!"`
`Gaap was convinced.`
`This man truly was fitting to succeed Kinzo's madness...!`
`"Blow wind, cry thunder!!`
` Celebrate the birth of the new demon king!!`
` The demon island has now welcomed its new lord...!!"`
`In response to the demon's call, a tempest raged more and more.`
`Then, a massive lightning bolt fell, its tearing thunder and brilliant light giving the sensation of a moment of silence...`
`"So,`
` ......about the order of the murders.`
` I get to choose that, right?"`
`"Please, as you wish, your Majesty, the new demon king of Rokkenjima.`
` As your heart desires...!"`
`"......Well then, to start, `
`that means the first one's gonna be you. Got a problem with that?"`
`"............Huh?"`
`A gust of wind blew, ...stirring up George's jacket as if it was a cloak.`
`It was very much like the cloak worn by the Head.`
` It definitely carried that impression of dignity...`
`...At that time, ...Gaap truly did see the storm wiped away, and the sky covered with a pure-white and vast full moon.`
`'!s0`
`bore the full moon on his back...`
`and sneered at the demon.`
`"Even the lives of the entire Ushiromiya family...are now part of my fortune.`
` Reparations will be made for the damage that's been done.`
` And it won't come cheap."`
`"...You didn't seriously think you could take my parents, Aunt Natsuhi, Uncle Rudolf, Aunt Rosa,`
` and Genji-san's lives and expect me to overlook it, right?"`
`'!s1`
`......hohoh, `
`......impertinence..."`
`Ronove was trying to press his palm against Jessica's chest and stop her heart.`
`But right before he could, his hand stopped...`
`'!s0`
`...one...two small red flowers bloomed with a *plop* *plop*.`
`The seed of those flowers...`
`was way up high, `
`piercing into the heavens...`
`...on Jessica's fist.`
`Ronove's nose was stained red with spewing blood......`
`and those drops had been dripping onto the carpet.`
`"......By the way, that just now was my answer as a maiden.`
` ...My answer as the Successor is different."`
`"Allow me to ask..."`
`"...The person I love, my family and my relatives, everyone, everyone!!`
` I'll protect them.`
` If I'm the Head, then that's my duty!`
` Dad wasn't just swaggering around.`
` He protected me and Mom!!`
` ...He fought the pressure of succeeding the Ushiromiya family...for decades!!"`
`"That's why I know.`
` ...Being the Successor is nothing trivial.`
` ...So you know what?`
` I can give it up.`
` ...Betting my own life is something I can do easily!!"`
`Jessica knew.`
`She knew that in order to protect her family, her father had bluffed and fought alone continuously.`
`Jessica understood something that his back had been telling her!`
`Another left straight was buried into Ronove's face.`
`...That terrifying strike wasn't due just to the brass knuckles she was using.`
`It was a strike...`
`of a person, a Family Head, who could throw away everything in order to protect.`
`"If Dad's lost his qualifications to be the Successor,`
` then I, the next in line, will succeed the Headship.`
` ...Head of the Ushiromiya family, Ushiromiya Jessica!!`
` I'm not the kind of coward who'd let you do whatever you like any more!!"`
`"......A wonderful answer.`
` I shall change your score from earlier.`
` Plus 10 for that answer.`
` ...Plus 10 for that splendid left straight."`
`"Which means that...plus 20 more would make for a perfect 100, yeah?"`
`As Ronove jumped backwards, somersaulting in midair, he violently wiped away the blood pouring from his nose.`
`...It had become, not blood, but petals of a red rose.`
`The blood on his face was wiped off, ...and in its place...`
`was a grin filled with a delight he hadn't felt in so many centuries that he couldn't remember.`
`"I, Ronove, `
`will test to see whether your resolve is worth full marks, understand...?"`
`"Shut up, shut up!!`
` Come at meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`"Come, into the Abyss...!"`
`"Whaaa?!"`
`Suddenly, beneath George's feet, a pitch-black pitfall opened its mouth wide.`
` Of course, George had no way of resisting.`
`After being swallowed up by that, George fell out of a pitch-black hole that had opened up in the ceiling of the arbor.`
`As George fell down, `
`he was hit by a reverse roundhouse kick from a sharp stiletto heel, like a strike from a carefully aimed bee...!`
`The instant George, after being blown out of the arbor, thought that he'd be swallowed up by a rose bush...`
`Another pitch-black hole opened there and swallowed George up.`
`And this time, a pitch-black hole opened at Gaap's feet before her eyes, spitting a defenseless George out of it.`
`...At that time, Gaap had already finished the preparatory motions for the next reverse roundhouse kick.`
`"Ghh, ...what is...this...?"`
`"Welcome back. *giggle*!"`
`Right side of the head.`
` Below the right armpit.`
` Side of the right knee.`
`As Gaap danced and spun like a small cyclone,`
` she kept hitting him, left foot right foot left foot right foot, with successive roundhouse kicks.`
`The fourth one became a sweep, cutting George's feet out from under him and making him fall down, `
`but of course, there was no floor there, but a pitch-black hole, and George was swallowed up once again.`
`Gaap once again spun around like a small cyclone.`
`George was once again spat out from the ceiling of the arbor.`
`"......Take this and reflect. The Abyss ends with a single strike.`
` ...Die...!"`
`The sharp strike of the queen bee pierced the heavens like a rising cyclone.`
`It kicked through George's lower chest as he fell from the ceiling...`
`And then, ...time froze.`
`George was pinned in midair by Gaap's raised leg...`
`"Gah, ......mmph......"`
`Still pinned in midair, George moaned...`
`Then Gaap, with George still hung up on her foot, `
`...grinned.`
`"......I'll admit it.`
` At least your attitude is that of an adult.`
` But that's no good unless you have power to go with it.`
` ...Did you know?`
` They say you need three kinds of power to rule this world.`
` The first one is influence.`
` The second is wealth.`
` Do you know what the last one is?"`
`"I read it in a book.`
` ...Force, right...?"`
`"Correct.`
` And that's where you're lacking."`
`Gaap finally released George.`
`She kicked upwards one more time, changing into another roundhouse kick and knocking him into a pillar.`
`"No one will fear a monarch without influence, without wealth, or without force.`
` Kinzo possessed all three of those.`
` That's why he reigned as a tyrant!`
` ...If you're going to call yourself Kinzo's successor, try showing me a bit of that majesty, okay?"`
`"...Come ooon, how long are you gonna sleep there?`
` Stand up, okay?`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` If you don't, you'll `
`~ib~fall~ib~`
` again, see?"`
`"Pu ku ku ku.`
` Not bad movements.`
` But I feel they are slightly unfitting for a lady."`
`"Bastaaaaaaaaaaaaaard!!`
` Swaying around all over the place!!`
` Aren't you gonna strike back...? Don't take me lightly, you fuckin' bastard!!"`
`Ronove dodged skillfully, jumped back, and avoided Jessica's fist,`
` but he still didn't strike back himself.`
`Because of his dodge that was as rapid as a fluttering flag blown by strong winds, Jessica's fist wasn't even able to touch him.`
`Amidst the sensation that her own blood was boiling, Jessica regained her offensive composure.`
`Even though this room was large for a bedroom, it was a very cramped place to keep up such exaggerated dodges in for long.`
`...She calmly realized that and started using not just her fists, but her legs as well.`
`"...Hoh.`
` Boxing with just your arms makes you but half a fighter.`
` Your arms must be like the hot roar of a lion.`
` And your legs must be like the cold snake closing in on its prey."`
`"Snakes don't have legs!"`
`"Pu ku ku, true."`
`Jessica began cornering Ronove towards the wall with perfect footwork.`
` She didn't let him get around her.`
`...Ronove's magnificent dodges looked flashy, but they needed a large footing.`
`Once cornered, he wouldn't be able to dodge anymore...!`
`Jessica knew the characteristics of her weapon, the brass knuckle, very well.`
`This powerful weapon's most notable characteristic was how it didn't give the opponent a chance to defend.`
`Even if they blocked with their arm, that arm would receive direct damage.`
`...If it hit the wrong way, it might even break the bone.`
`So she cornered him.`
`With this fist, ...she'd whittle away at this demon who'd lost any way to escape!!`
`"Whoops...!`
` Oh, when did...?"`
`"Looks like I've finally cornered you, right...?`
` Where is everyone being held?`
` Where's that damn geezer?`
` You tell me everything, and I'll let you off with nothing more than plucking that mustache off, got it?"`
`"That would be a problem.`
` It does take me an hour every morning to set this."`
`"Once you're in a cast, you won't even be able to do that, right?!"`
`"......Whoops.`
` .........Gggh."`
`Ronove had blocked Jessica's fist with his arm.`
`He tried to act as though it was no big deal, but it must have hurt a lot.`
`...Jessica grinned.`
`Ronove smiled the same way, but twitched slightly.`
`"...I see.`
` This certainly does hurt."`
`"Here's my last bit of advice.`
` Cry and apologize."`
`"That, I cannot do.`
` It would ruin my image."`
`"Then just crumple.`
` Rapid fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiire!!!"`
`Jessica's fists were buried into Ronove.`
`But there was a resistance that seemed too hard...and the sound of breaking glass, which startled Jessica.`
`At a glance, it looked like Ronove had caught Jessica's fist with his palm.`
` ...That wasn't quite true.`
`When Ronove opened his hand, a faint, purple, glowing barrier like a glass shield appeared,`
` stopping the attack by a hair's breadth.`
`Pulling herself together, Jessica let her fists fly again, but with a truly magnificent gesture, Ronove caught all of them...`
`"I am, after all, a demon.`
` This level of magic is nothing.`
` ......Even so, you aren't bad at all.`
` If I were a Human, I would probably resign right here.`
` Because I am a demon, I can still continue to fight."`
`"...Wh-What are you trying to pull......?!"`
`"Is this the end?`
` ...Are you simply going to attack all the time, while neglecting your defense?"`
`'!s0`
` ...Waaah!!"`
`Ronove's palm shot to within a hair's breadth of Jessica's stomach.`
`Jessica was knocked away by the purple shield, rolled backwards, and smashed her head on the bed.`
`"My shield cannot be broken by a mere Human.`
` Don't think that you'll ever be able to touch my body again."`
`"...In that case, ...I'll just burst through that shield...!!"`
`"Persistent, I see.`
` Yes, a truly fitting spirit for the Successor.`
` ...Perhaps I'll be your opponent for just a while longer.`
` This is also part of an examiner's role.`
` ......Pukkukukukukuku!"`
`"Breeeeeeeeeeeaaaak, aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!"`
`Gaap looked down on George, sneering.`
`George was on a path in the rose garden, lying face-down in a puddle.`
`The merciless rain beat down on him, so that it looked as though even the heavens were mocking him...`
`"......Ahhahahahahahaha.`
` Stand up, okay?`
` You'll fall again, right?"`
`"............"`
`George stood up shakily.`
`...It seemed his spirit hadn't given in, but the damage done to his body was fairly significant.`
`"Beg for your life.`
` What you're doing now is the same as the fourth option of choosing nothing.`
` ...You chose the third option, right?`
` If you get down on your hands and knees and apologize, I'll forgive your rudeness towards me."`
`"Then, I'll guide you down to the dungeon.`
` There, for your beloved Shannon and your own powerless life, you will kill the other hostages one by one.`
` ...You can do it, right?`
` You did boast about having that resolve.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"............"`
`George didn't answer.`
`...But his gaze was still obstinately resisting surrender.`
`"...If you are too obstinate, then this time you really will fall to the deepest depths of the Abyss, okay...?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`Gaap's strength was evident.`
`...That was probably clear, even more than it was to George himself,`
` to Shannon's group watching through the three-sided mirror...`
`"......George-sama...`
` ...That's...`
`......enough......`
` ...For someone like me..."`
`"Nee-san..."`
`'!s1`
`...you wouldn't have to fight with anyone, right, George-sama...?`
` Then please, abandon me...`
` Please forget me..."`
`There was no way that voice could have reached George.`
`...But, even so, `
`...George answered.`
`"No way.`
` ......I won't...surrender."`
`"...Oh?`
` Why not...?"`
`"......Because that's...my resolve.`
` ...I'll fight everything for Shannon's sake.`
` And I'll make everything accept us...`
`...and bless us."`
`"Hey, could you tell me something?`
` Why are you willing to go so far for that furniture called Shannon?`
` ......She's just a washout, isn't she?`
` Rubbish furniture that couldn't even make a satisfactory waitress."`
`"......I won't permit any more insults against the woman I love."`
`"So what are you going to do about it?`
` How could a weak kid like you resist me...?"`
`"Loving someone is strength.`
` ...Because I learned that, I was able to become strong.`
` ......'Shannon,`
` I love you'.`
` With just those words, I can stand back up, over and over again."`
`"Shannon's in the dungeon, right?`
` Professing your love to me won't-"`
`"No.`
` She heard.`
` ...That's because it's love.`
` Shannon can hear my words right now.`
` The reason I can believe that...is because of love."`
`".........You......"`
`『Shannon,`
` you aren't furniture.`
` ...Even if you are furniture, you're mine alone, the only one for me in the world.`
` I want you to be close to me as long as we live.`
` ...I need you for all eternity.〝`
`"......G-George-sama........."`
`"...I'm jealous.`
` He's surpassed my husband in smooth talking."`
`"...Th-That's youth for you."`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` The strength of love?`
` Then why are you so weak, boy?`
` Does that weakness mean your love is also that weak?`
` *giggle*giggle*!`
` Even your love for your fiancée is weak.`
` The way your parents died so quickly was weak.`
` Everything about your life is weak."`
`"......Shannon taught me about love and strength.`
` If you're trying to measure my love towards Shannon by my strength alone, `
`...let me teach you about my love."`
`"*giggle* So you say.`
` ...I get it now.`
` You're saying that the way you can still stand up after being kicked down so many times is the strength you received from Shannon."`
`"In that case, what did you receive from your parents, who got killed way too easily?`
` ......?"`
`At that time, there was a blackout.`
` ...Even though they were outside?`
`"......N-No.`
` ......Th-This is......"`
`'!s0`
`......was the bottom...`
`of George's...`
`...`
`shoe...`
`"......Side kick.`
` Nasal bone fractured."`
`It had stopped right in front of the tip of Gaap's nose.`
`"The thing I got from Mom was this kick."`
`Several moments after, Gaap jumped back.`
`Of course, that was too late.`
`If George hadn't stopped, he would probably have caused the damage he'd announced.`
`"And what I got from Dad...`
`...is fortitude."`
`Anger with a low boiling point isn't something to be truly feared.`
`...True anger is disciplined by fortitude.`
`"......I recognize your violent method of declaring your intentions.`
` ...I also see that you've slandered my fiancée and my parents' honor.`
` And you have no intention of taking back what you said, yes...?"`
`"...Y-You..."`
`"I now understand your attacks more than enough, `
`......so maybe it's about time. Time to start fighting back."`
`"Q-Quit prattling, foolish boy...!!"`
`A pitch-black hole opened its mouth at George's feet.`
`But George rapidly opened his legs, straddling the hole.`
` The same move won't work again...!`
`It was an extremely smooth dodge, and the upper part of his body didn't even quiver.`
`"Fortitude means calmly analyzing how your opponent will act, instead of losing your cool.`
` ......Why?`
` Isn't it obvious?`
` Can't you guess?"`
`"N-N-No, I can't..."`
`"It's to counter, to give back exactly what you got, to make them not want to take another pass at you,`
` to make them cover their face in tears and snot and forget to wash it off,`
` to make them want to rub their forehead on the ground and apologize over and over, to completely, perfectly, and thoroughly...!!!`
` ...Beat them until they can't get up."`
`George dashed.`
`Pitfalls opened one after another, but George didn't step in them again.`
`And, because he was persistent, he was able to reach Gaap a second time...`
`"......Reverse roundhouse.`
` Jaw fractured."`
`".........!"`
`It was stretched out more forcefully and beautifully than Gaap's had been.`
`Of course, while it centered directly on Gaap's face, it stopped a hair's breadth away.`
`Perhaps she couldn't rely on pitfalls at this close range.`
`Gaap kicked at George's shins as a diversion,`
` and in the instant of weakness when he tried to deal with that, she aimed a kick at his stomach.`
`It was a bee-like stab by her stiletto heel.`
`...But it sliced through the air where George no longer was.`
`"......High axe kick.`
` Collarbone fractured."`
`"......Gah-"`
`By Gaap's side,`
` George calmly announced that, his foot still raised.`
`If that monarch's heel had swung down, a collarbone fracture would probably have been the least of her worries.`
`"This guy's...`
`...stronger than me...at close range...?!`
` I need distance...!"`
`She jumped backwards to open a large gap between them.`
`She jumped and jumped and leapt and even flipped in midair, increasing that distance.`
`It should have been magnificent, but for some reason, it was very similar to the movements of a small, scared animal.`
`If she opened the distance between them, she'd be able to fight at the range that was her specialty, using a mixture of pitfalls and kicking techniques...!`
`"You fool, ...you'll regret the pride that made you let three chances of defeating me slide...as you fall into the depths of the Abyss!!`
` .........Huh?"`
`When she magnificently landed and tried to aim a pitfall,`
` a razor-sharp wind cut Gaap's bangs.`
` ...Yes, it cut them.`
`It happened twice.`
` ...This time, it didn't just stop a hair's breadth away, but scattered her bangs with its air pressure...`
`"......Armada com martelo.`
` ...The fundus of the eye fractured with the first strike.`
` Cerebral contusion with the second strike."`
`"............!!!"`
`Gaap was too shocked to speak.`
`George had closed in over all that distance in an instant, letting off a fearsomely nimble midair double-kick.`
`...Furthermore, with the accuracy and edge of a razor, it had cut nothing more than several of her bangs.`
`"I learned the power of kicks from karate, `
`speed from tae kwon do, `
`and freedom of range from capoeira.`
` ...Mom was pretty fickle.`
` But I've learned from studying various merits."`
`"...Wh-Why don't you hit me...?`
` ...You aren't going to say it's because I'm a woman, right?!!"`
`"...You spoke of force as a monarch's third power.`
` It looks like you still misunderstand the meaning of that force.`
` ...In this situation, force doesn't mean hastily wielded violence.`
` ......It refers to a deterrent, knowledge that if someone opposes the monarch, that person won't get away unharmed."`
`"A deterrent, ...you say...?"`
`In short, this is what it meant.`
`This was why all of George's attacks up until then had stopped a hair's breadth away.`
`These bare misses, which were more difficult than hitting directly, had all been performed so splendidly.`
`...Also, if George had wished it, any one of those would probably have crushed Gaap.`
`He had, daringly, not done that.`
`"You said it yourself, right?`
` Force is the power to control.`
` ......If you crush your opponent with force, you won't be able control them, right?`
`A monarch's force is something that is only shown.`
` He does not crush.`
` He makes others surrender and adds them to his own fortune."`
`"If you start blowing bubbles, I won't be able to make you guide me to where the hostages are."`
`Gaap had to admit it.`
`She had to admit that George understood force in its truest sense...!`
`"You'll take me to where everyone is.`
` I would advise against resisting.`
` ...I won't stop short next time."`
`"...Ack!!`
` ......Sorry, Lia. Lemme borrow your troops.`
` This guy's too much for me alone to handle!!"`
`As a large, pitch-black hole opened in the sky,`
` *thunk* *thunk* *thunk*, three muscular goat attendants fell out.`
` They surrounded George.`
`"......Reinforcements?`
` Should I take this to mean that you take back all that about me being weak?"`
`"...I-I admit it.`
` ...I made light of your...Human power..."`
`"That's wrong.`
` This is the strength of a man who's experienced love."`
`"H-How can you say stuff like that with a straight face?!!`
` Come, goats!`
` Crush this man and turn him into meatballs!"`
`"*giggle* These goats are stupid, but it looks like they at least have power.`
` I'll turn you into a corpse that even your fiancée won't be able to recognize!"`
`"You refuse to surrender and intend to continue fighting. Understood.`
` ...Know that from now on, you will receive real harm proportional to your own attacks."`
`"If you still plan on attacking me, prepare to sustain a great deal of damage."`
`When George proclaimed that, `
`...a faint, red magic circle rose up around him.`
`It seemed that George couldn't see it.`
`However, Gaap, being a demon, could.`
`"...M-Magic?!`
` Why does this guy have a defensive barrier...?!`
` And that's also...a counterattacking type...?!`
` Is this...wh-what you meant by a deterrent...?!"`
`From a demon's perspective, that may have been magic.`
`But in George's eyes, it was...determination.`
`It was a determination filled with certainty, ...which would be merciless to anyone who wished to fight anymore...`
`and which would force them to prepare for a significant counterattack.`
`Determination with certainty...becomes magic.`
`Ronove had been accurately blocking Jessica's fists with his shield.`
` ...But something felt odd.`
`Even though he was certainly catching them on the shield, `
`he felt his arm get jarred, and it hurt.`
`It should have prevented all physical damage.`
`...However, the damage from her fists was gradually being transmitted to his arm, piling up.`
`Ronove tried to act like he was composed, so that this wouldn't be noticed...`
`"H-Heheh...!!`
` I'm not gonna get worn out.`
` What's wrong, old guy?`
` Starting to get a little tough...?!"`
`"...No matter how much you attack, it is useless.`
` Why can't you understand that you cannot break my shield?"`
`"I'm not gonna stop hitting you just because it won't break.`
` ......No matter how hard someone's heart is, if you keep on talking to them little by little, it'll eventually start to crack...!`
` I believe it!!`
` I believe that useless effort doesn't exist in this world!!"`
`"That's why I can live...to the fullest!!`
` If words will eventually make it through, then the same goes for fists...!!`
` 'Give up' isn't written anywhere in my dictionary!!"`
`Those words were probably aimed at Kanon...`
`Kanon, who had seemed to reject Jessica's words.`
`...But Jessica knew that, no matter how stubborn his heart was, those words would eventually soak through.`
`She believed that they would surely reach his heart, that the day would come when he would stop calling himself furniture and disparaging himself,`
` ...and that he'd step out into a new life.`
`So Jessica didn't give up.`
` She didn't lose heart...!`
`"It's stupid, right?`
` I'll bet a guy couldn't understand, right?`
` A girl in love doesn't even think about giving up just because it's useless!!"`
`At that time, Ronove certainly saw.`
`He saw the reddish glow of light that encircled Jessica's fists.`
`"......This is...not good.`
` ...An enchantment, is it?`
` ...This permeating upgrade...will be troublesome."`
`Inside her unrelenting fists and determination...dwelled the power to succeed no matter what.`
`From a demon's perspective, that was magic.`
`Determination with certainty...becomes magic.`
`"See?`
` Nothing useless about it.`
` ...Looks like my fists are making it through.`
` Guard your arm, old guy."`
`"......It seems I will have to get a little more serious.`
` ...It appears it is as you said.`
` ...In this world, nothing is useless."`
`"That's right...!`
` If you give up because something's useless, that's when your life ends...!`
` You'll get through.`
` ...You can be sure of that...!!"`
`I'm an idiot, so this is the only way I can live,`
` but even so, ...I'm sure I'll be able to teach Kanon-kun...`
`about a new world someday!!`
`So I'm not gonna lose heart in a place like this...!!`
`I'll definitely defeat you...`
`and save everyone!!`
`"Damn!!`
` Got to somehow...open a hole... Aaaaaaaaaaaaargghhh!!!"`
`Krauss was repeating his useless effort to somehow open a hole between the metal bars.`
`...Useless.`
` ......Nothing is useless.`
` There's nothing...`
`The lookout goats had been swallowed up by those black pitfalls and disappeared.`
`...Now was their once-in-a-lifetime chance.`
`This was their only chance to break the bars...`
`"S-Stop it, it's impossible, Krauss-san!`
` There's nothing we can do with our bare hands!`
` Let's look for a tool, don't waste time on the impossible...!"`
`"If you give up because it's useless, then it's all over. That's what my daughter said.`
` ...Even if my body won't fit, as long as a small person like Shannon or Kanon can make it through...!!"`
`"...Now that we've reached this point, action is more important than racking our brains.`
` Let's work together, I'll do it too...!`
` ...Kanon-kun, you're a boy, aren't you? Lend a hand...!`
` ...Kanon-kun?!"`
`"......Krauss-sama,`
` please stand back."`
`"What?`
` What are you planning...?"`
`"...Okay, Nee-san?`
` ......Just one more time, let's try struggling."`
`"......Yes.`
` ...I too...will struggle one more time.`
` ...No, not just one more time.`
` ...Over and over again."`
`Jessica's voice had reached Kanon.`
`It certainly had permeated into his cold, rock-like heart.`
`And George's voice had reached Shannon.`
`If the love he had shown was embodied by strength, she would have to respond in the same way.`
`An incredible metal sound rang out.`
`......In the first flash, several metal bars were severed horizontally, and in the next flash, they were severed horizontally again,`
` causing many metal bars to clatter to the ground like bamboo shoots cut by a sword.`
`Krauss, Kyrie, and Nanjo didn't even have a clue what had just happened...`
`"...Doctor Nanjo,`
` which way down the corridor goes to the mansion...?"`
`"......O-Oh, of course!`
` In and to the left, ...in and to the left...!"`
`"Let's go, Krauss-sama.`
` ...Virgilia-sama will notice us at any moment now."`
`"What in the world...`
`...are you guys...?"`
`"......We are..."`
`When Kanon hung his head a little and faltered, Shannon slapped his shoulder, smiled, and spoke.`
`"We're Human."`
`"V-Virgilia-sama!!`

` ...Gap!`

` ...Virgilia-sama, an escape prevention barrier, if you would."`
`"Owowowow...`
` Y-Yes, you're right.`
` Hohhoho, I won't let you escape from here.`
` ...Owow, bit my tongue saying Gapgap..."`
`The underground passage in front of them was once again blocked by metal bars.`
` The door was, of course, locked.`
`...However, that was no problem for them now.`
`"Kanon, it's those metal bars again!`
` We're counting on you...!"`
`"Yes, Krauss-sama...!"`
`"...Still, that's incredible.`
` ...I wonder what kind of principle it works on."`
`"I'm not interested in principles.`
` All that matters is that he can sever the metal bars...and that we can escape from here...!"`
`"Don't worry, Kanon, do it!"`
`"Leave it to me...!"`
`Kanon sliced the metal bars again with his red curved blade.`
`But there was a harsh, strange noise, and the metal bars only had a slight scratch.`
`"Wh-What's this?`
` ...These are sturdy..."`
`"Wrong.`
` ...They're enchanted!`
` It's one of Virgilia-sama's magic locks."`
`"Can you cut through it?"`
`"Of course.`
` But it will take time."`
`"We'll wait three minutes...!"`
`After taking a deep breath and concentrating his mind, Kanon extended a red curved sword again.`
`When he pressed it hard against the metal bars, sparks sprayed, almost as though he was melting through it with a burner.`
`"It looks like we'll be able to cut it, ...but it'll be tough."`
`"......Krauss-sama,`
` you've been targeted by the enemy.`
` Please move back."`
`"Huh?`
` Pursuers?`
` There's no one coming!"`
`"Please get behind me.`
` They're aiming for you...!!"`

`A golden arrow that sparkled gold was fired, leaving a gold tail streaming behind.`
`It drew a curve, went through the door, through the keyhole, down the stairs, towards the underground path at full speed...!`
`"S-Something shone!!"`
`"...You can't block the golden arrow with a shield.`
` Kanon-kun, Interception Stance.`
` Let's link."`
`"Gatekeeper, understood.`
` ......It's been a long time since I've fought with you, Nee-san.`
` Don't screw up."`
`"Yeah.`
` I'll be serious."`
`"Then there's no problem!"`
`Kanon stopped cutting the bars and stood in front of Shannon.`
`Behind him, Shannon closed her eyes, concentrating her mind deep, deep into the darkness of the underground path...`
`A Guided Cluster Round is a special kind of arrow made up of 48 sub-rounds bound together.`
`It explodes mid-flight and divides into 48 mini-arrows.`
`The strength of each individual one is low, but they pierce through all shields and possess a perfect wounding and killing power against personnel.`
`And on top of that, each one of the 48 possesses autonomous guidance towards their individual targets.`
`"......It shone.`
` ...It's divided..."`

`"Nihyah?!`
` All 48 of them?!"`
`"Hohohoh...`
` After all, Shannon and Kanon were originally a furniture pair.`

`"Calm down, Reload.`

`"Wh-What in the world was that just now...?"`
`"Don't worry, I don't have a clue either...`
` All I know is that we would've died if not for these two..."`
`"Kanon-kun, thanks.`
` Go back to the metal bars.`
` The next shot will probably be one we can't intercept."`
`"How can we defend against such an attack...?!"`
`"We don't let them shoot.`
` ...Kanon-kun, Initiate Spirit Particle Combat Countermeasures."`
`At those words, Kanon closed his eyes tightly and ground his teeth.`
`...With Shannon at the center, a pressure and impact that only nonhumans could perceive struck.`
`"...Huh?!`
` Firing System Error!!`
` No good, Rebooting...`
` Huh huh?!"`
`"It's Spirit Wave Jamming! Activate Spirit Particle Safeguards, hurry!`
` What are you doing?! Cover your ears quickly, 45!!!"`
`An unseen, unheard impact had struck the Chiester Sisters.`
`00 and 410 crouched down, covering their ears, ...but 45 didn't make it in time.`
`...As she stood bolt upright, her eyes rolled.`
`'!s0`
` ...Kyuu? Kyu-!`
` Kyu-`
`kyu-`
`kyu-!!!"`
`"45 got damaged...!`
` Her IME's busted...!!`
` ...Nn, gya, ...the noise...is also horrible for me nyeh..."`
`'!s1`
`410, `
`...and 00, `
`Damaged...`
` Abandoning Sniping Posture.`
` ...Ack, it came straight through the link...`
` I-If we don't reboot..."`
`Raising their spirit particle sensitivity for precision sniping had backfired.`
`They had taken the full brunt of the spirit particle shock wave Shannon had released,`
` and not only 45, who had been hit directly, but also 00 and 410, who had been linked with her, were taken down.`
`"Are you okay?!`
` ...I'll make you some more delicious black tea later, so get ahold of yourselves!"`
`"...M-My apologies, sir...`
` Rebooting.`
` Please wait several hundred seconds..."`
`All of the Chiester Sisters had fallen over.`
`They would probably get back up eventually, but it looked like it would be hard for them to return to the battle lines for a while.`
`"So, furniture was able to repel weapons, if only for a moment.`
` ......I see, a plot to entertain that child truly will be filled with unexpected turns!"`
`Virgilia tore the air with a large gesture, motioning as though opening a door.`
`"Come, arise, goat attendants...!`
` It's time to work.`
` Catch and kill the escapees.`
` Corpses are fine, we can just revive them anyway!"`
`A gold-colored door opened in the air...and countless giant goats with muscular bodies peeked their faces out...`
`"Come now, hurry.`
` There are five escapees, so the fastest five of you win!`
` There will be a wonderful prize, so give it your all, give it your all!"`
`Virgilia clapped her hands, urging them on.`
`A prize?!`
` After facing each other at those words, the goats all rushed to the door at once, trying to get out,`
` making the exit as packed as the Touzai or the Yamanote rail lines in the morning.`
`Each wanted to get out first, so none of them could get out.`
`...Virgilia held her head in frustration.`
`By that time, Kanon had managed to cut enough bars to make a crack that could be slipped through.`
`It had been a bit of work for Krauss, large as he was, and Nanjo, with his lethal waist,`
` but even so, they all managed to make it through.`
`But after they did, they only had a couple seconds to be relieved.`
`Immediately, another set of metal bars blocked the way in front of them.`
`"This certainly is secure.`
` ...I'll bet they really didn't want the people in here to escape."`
`"Kanon, sorry, but I'll have to ask you again.`
` ...It may be tough, but please...!"`
`There was sweat on Kanon's forehead.`
`You could tell at a glance that cutting the metal bars, which had been made even more solid by magic, had physically exhausted him.`
`"...Yes, leave it to me, Krauss-sama."`
`"Only you can do it!`
` Please, we're counting on you...!"`
`Only he...could do it.`
`...Holding tightly onto those words,`
` Kanon concentrated his mind once again and set himself to the task of cutting metal bars again.`
`"......Enemies are coming from behind. Multiple targets."`
`"Yeah, this time even we can tell.`
` ...The ground's really shaking.`
` I can tell that some ridiculous monsters are rushing at us."`
`"Don't worry.`
` I'll use a magic lock to make a blockade of the metal bars we just came through.`
` Mere goats won't be able to break it."`
`Shannon held her hand out towards the metal bars they had gone through.`
`...But she stopped right away.`
`"Wh-What is it...?"`
`"Virgilia-sama has started neutralizing the Spirit Wave Jamming...`
` It'll be bad if it's broken, and we'll lose the initiative once the Chiester Sisters are rebooted...!"`
`"I'll make you pay in full for bullying these cute bunnies."`
`"If you're trying to gain the advantage with those clever spirit particles of yours, I'll tear all that away and rob you of them."`
`"Nee-san, concentrate on the Spirit Wave Jamming! The gap in those metal bars is too narrow for those goats.`
` It should hold them back for a while...!"`
`"I don't have a clue what you're saying, but-"`
`"We know it's something pretty bad."`
`Kyrie picked up a metal bar that Kanon had just cut.`
`Krauss had no weapon, but he rubbed his fists, and the two of them glared into the depths of the underground passage where the shaking was coming from.`
`"...I believe these are the final metal bars blocking the way."`
`"How far is it to the mansion from here?"`
`"Quite a walk...`
` The path is even, but I seem to remember walking for 30 minutes..."`
`"So if we run all out, it'll be half that time."`
`They couldn't tell for sure, since they didn't have the three-sided mirror,`
` but there was no guarantee that George and Jessica would still be all right against demon opponents after all this time.`
`"...If we run at twice the speed of walking, it'll be 15 minutes.`
` And twice that speed would make it eight minutes."`
`"And if we sprint all out at double that speed, it won't even take 5.`
` No problem."`
`"Wh-What an unreasonable calculation...`
` But that's how you calculate in a fire...!"`
`"...My sincere apologies, everyone.`
` Please watch my back...!"`
`"Leave it to us.`
` Kanon, you cut the bars as fast as you can.`
` Shannon, you concentrate on jamming this witch called Virgilia or whatever.`
` Kyrie-san and I will defend against our pursuers...!"`
`Then, the roars of beasts rang out from the darkness, and several fiery, glowing, bright-red eyes appeared.`
`Goats that were several levels more massive than the guards were rushing with an incredible force.`
`The tremors they created were almost like an earthquake.`
`They brought a frightening intensity and terror, but Kyrie actually laughed with relief.`
`...Those massive bodies wouldn't be able to go through the crack in the bars!`
`The group of goats crashed into the metal bars with a fierce sound like that of a train colliding with a dead end.`
`Clumps of dirt fell here and there from the ceiling, and you could tell that the metal bars had bent as if collapsing.`
`...Their charging power probably was on par with a train.`
`If the metal bars hadn't been there, they would likely have overwhelmed the five of them and crushed them in an instant.`
`When the group of goats pressing up against the metal bars noticed the five people right in front of them,`
` they let out a terrible howl, trying to intimidate the five.`
`...Or maybe that was out of pain from their game of push and shove.`
`One calm goat among them figured out what should be done about the metal bars, `
`then grabbed two of them with its massive arms and began bending them as though opening double doors.`
`'!s0`
` The goat let out a roar of anguish.`
`It probably hurt a lot, but that was all.`
`It wasn't enough to bring it down...`
`"Krauss-san...!!"`
`"Whoooaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`Still holding the metal pole she had stuck out, Kyrie relinquished the opposite tip to Krauss.`
`Krauss ran there with all his might, jumped up and kicked down with all his weight and kicking power combined...!`
`All of that destructive power was focused on a single pole, drilling it in!!`
`"...A-Are you okay?`
` Please don't rub the affected area.`
` I'll prescribe some medicine later. Take care..."`
`As the goat who'd taken a pile bunker to its vitals writhed with teary eyes,`
` it nodded its head.`
`"Looks like our link isn't that bad either.`
` We won't lose to Shannon-chan and Kanon-kun."`
`"Naturally, for a loving family like us."`
`"We can do it if we take them together!`
` Next, that one on the right!"`
`"Understood...!`
` You really are a good wife. That Rudolf must have grumbled a little too much."`
`"Ooh, tell me about it later.`
` Rudolf-san, suddenly turning pale in heaven won't do you any good, okay?"`
`The goats' massive bodies were buried in rose bushes.`
`Even taking into account that a leg's power is three times that of an arm's, this strength surpassed common sense.`
`To think that those massive bodies had been kicked in the chin and flown through the air... It was too fierce!`
`Even George seemed a little surprised.`
`"...To think that my kick works on monsters too.`
` Now there's a shock."`
`"......It's because of your counterattack-style barrier.`
` ...The attacking power that grazes you is added on to your own.`
` ...Your kick has been supplemented by those monsters' superhuman strength..."`
`"Oh...?`
` ...I don't really get it, but isn't that just perfect for me?`
` ...No matter who attacks me, they should be prepared for a counterattack of equal measure.`
` Nonaggressive defense.`
` That's my policy."`
`That's why Gaap couldn't easily touch him.`
`The counterattack-style barrier had no defensive power.`
`However, because of its countering ability, it could be useful in defense by making the opponent hesitate to attack.`
`The goats had been foolish and so had attacked without worrying,`
` but this second effect had worked in full against Gaap.`
`"These guys really are dull.`
` When your power's even, it's always an advantage to have a smaller build."`
`He lightly dodged the log-like arms.`
`When those arms touched the barrier that protected George, they let off a strong, red light.`
`...The tip of the counterattacking foot would then gain the same sparkle...and the superhuman power of the goat added to its own.`
`The second goat fell forward and floated in the air for a second.`
`Then, George's next roundhouse kick missed right over the falling goat's head.`
`...For an instant, the goat hoped it might get away with its life.`
`But no!!`
` A heel was dropped onto the back of its head, and it was forced to kiss the ground.`
`"...Going from a high roundhouse kick into a neri chagi is pretty basic, right?`
` Works pretty well every now and then."`
`"This guy's...a problem, `
`...seriously, a problem...!!"`
`"What do you mean, demons? What do you mean, witches?`
` ......The rulers of Rokkenjima are the Ushiromiya family.`
` I'll make you physically aware of that."`
`"......Yoooooooooooouuuuuu......!!"`
`The only way to finish off George, now that his body was wrapped up in a counterattack-style barrier, ...was to deny him a chance to counterattack.`
`...Nothing to do but suck him into the Abyss next, then kick and drop him, kick and drop him, kick and drop him...`
`until she kicked him to death!!!`
`But George had already completely seen through the faint warning signs that told of the appearance of Gaap's pitfalls.`
`...If he could jump over that next pitfall,`
` ...then this time, he would probably pulverize Gaap's head with his whirlwind-like kick, without holding back in the slightest,`
` ...just as had been done to his parents.`
`She was able to envision that scene vividly.`
`Gaap hated Kinzo more than ever for calling her out to this ridiculous island...!`
`Even though Ronove held out a shield, he had finally started using his hands.`
`Without a more powerful shield, he wouldn't be able to block Jessica's fists anymore.`
`The enchantment on Jessica's fists grew the more she fought.`
`The permeating upgrade had already grown several times,`
` and those fists had also been given an impact upgrade, a piercing upgrade, and a speed upgrade, making them fists worthy to fight on par with a demon...`
`"......What's wrong?!`
` Starting to get tired?!`
` You're getting all slow!!"`
`"No.`
` Your movements and thoughts and kinetic vision have been rapidly enchanted.`
` ......My movements have not changed from the beginning.`
` ...Your movements are beginning to catch up to me."`
`"And you still won't fight back...?!!"`
`"This is my style.`
` ...However, I cannot allow it to continue at this rate.`
` It's about time for me to get serious and end this...!!"`
`Ronove's face turned into an expression he hadn't shown before.`
`It was full of respect for Jessica in a truly demonic way.`
`Because it was an expression he only showed for enemies who made him get serious.`
`"Whooaa?!?!`
` What the?!"`
`With a gesture of his whole body that you couldn't call elegant, Ronove held out a shield with all his strength, a shield the size and thickness of a wall.`
`It was more tenacious than a simple shield.`
`It literally was a wall.`
`And on top of that, with all of Ronove's magical power, it pushed Jessica back bit by bit.`
`...Did he plan on pushing her back against the wall and crushing her to death?`
`Jessica tried to break through the wall with both fists, but it was solid.`
` ...Without any exaggeration, it was solid!`
`"Is this what you call serious...?!!`
` No problem, I'll break right through iiiiiiiiiiitt!!"`
`"I will not let you this time.`
` This wall is somewhat different.`
` ...Here, allow me to enchant it as well."`
`When Ronove made a magic sign almost like a ninja, `
`the wall glowed red for just an instant...and some kind of ominous power dwelt within it.`
`Jessica was able to recognize that almost immediately with her body.`
`Every time her fists hit the wall, pain as though glass fragments had scattered and hit all over her body rebounded against her.`
`"I upgraded it with attack-reactive armor.`
` An exceptional item that will decrease the force of your attacks by counterbalancing them...`
`and which can even counterattack with reactive fragments."`
`"...It's perfectly fine to keep punching it, but doing so will damage you as well."`
`"Heh, ...heheh!!`
` In short, it's an endurance test between me and your wall?!!`
` No problem!!"`
`"Will you fall to your knees first, or be pushed into the wall first?`
` ...Allow me to observe."`
`"Except I might break through it and smash that whole wall along with your face, right?!`
` Watch iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`Without hesitation, Jessica punched using both fists.`
` Each time she did, a large amount of shards scattered, torturing her entire body.`
`Instantly, several red gashes appeared all over her...`
`She grimaced at the intense agony, but her eyes were burning with fighting spirit, and her lips curved in a grin that stood in sharp contrast to the pain...!`
`"Kanon, are you done yet?!`
` We're fine, `
`...but the metal bars blocking them don't seem to be...!"`
`"Just...a little more...!"`
`"There's no stopping these guys...`
` These metal bars might break just from them shoving each other!"`
`The group of goats made the metal bars creak.`
`Several arms grabbed the bars, twisting them with superhuman strength.`
`...However, some bars were being pulled in opposite directions by different hands.`
`Apparently, they really were stupid.`
`The way those countless hands grabbed the metal bars...sometimes happened to match up by chance.`
`Several hands grasping two metal bars neatly put their power together and pulled the bars to the left and right.`
`The incredible sound of metal bending could be heard, and that crack was getting larger bit by bit...!`
`They attacked the arms of those goats one by one, but they weren't getting anywhere.`
`They couldn't stop the gap from spreading left and right...!`
`At that time, there was a loud metal sound behind them.`
`Kanon had finally finished cutting.`
`"Quickly!!"`
`"Kyrie-san, ladies first.`
` You go next, Doctor Nanjo!"`
`"Krauss-sama, please leave this place to me...!`
` Nng, ...this is?!"`
`Kanon's red sword that had cut the metal bars disappeared.`
`"...Sorry!`
` We've entered Virgilia-sama's Spirit Particle Area of Influence!!`
` Our magic power has been neutralized!"`
`"Hohhohhoh.`
` How dare you resist me this far... I, who was called a Great Witch.`
` You can no longer use your magic in that underground passage."`
`A magic circle column drew a complex magical formula with Virgilia at the center.`
`...With such genuine magic being used, Shannon's power couldn't even compete.`
`On the contrary, it was surprising that she had withstood as long as she had.`
`"Spirit Particle Supremacy Ensured.`
` Come, Chiester Sisters. It's your turn now, right?`
` Wait, are you still rebooting?!`
` Why are kids these days so bad at waking up...?!"`
`"M-My apologies...!!`
` We're all different versions..."`

`".........`
`Y-You take your time fixing yourselves...`
` I'm going..."`
`""Sorryyyyyyyyy-!!""`
`The narrow underground passage was packed with goats, truly like a commuter train in the morning.`
`Virgilia was again shocked by this congestion.`
`"What are you doing...?!!`
` Huh?`
` You want to go first because you want the prize?`
` You're getting in each other's way because you don't want the other goats to steal the prize from you?`
` You stupid goooooooooooooaaaats!!!`
` I'm going, so make way!!"`
`"What?!`
` You don't want to?!`
` Virgilia-sama is trying to steal your prize?!"`
`"Why are you all standing arm in arm?!!`
` Aaah, tight, cramped!!`
` When did this become a goats-only car?!`
` Ugyu-!!`
` You, that kid who just touched my butt, get off at the next statioooon!!!"`
`"......Hmm? What's with you?`
` Come this way, you say??"`
`The five in Krauss's group dashed through the passageway with all their strength!`
`They couldn't dawdle around in an underground place like this.`
`They had to quickly join up with the children on the surface!`
`If they could meet up, there would no longer be any more sorrow!`
`At that time, a terrible rumble started chasing them.`
`Had their pursuers finally made it through the metal bars?!`
`But they couldn't see anyone when they turned around.`
`However, that rumble and the dirt that fell here and there from the ceiling grew closer and closer,`
` finally catching up with them and even going past them.`
`It felt almost like being chased by ghosts.`
`For a second, they thought they'd gotten away, until the ceiling in front of them fell in...and a single goat stood in their path.`
`...Virgilia was sitting on its shoulder.`
`"This wise child knew a shortcut.`
` What a good kid, you get first prize.`
` Later, you can have some handmade mackerel curry."`
`Maybe it really was happy about that dubious prize.`
` The massive goat showed its joy by putting its hands together and writhing.`
`Virgilia leapt down, laughing that this time, it was finally checkmate.`
`"...Damn, ...it's no use...`
` ...Our magic has been completely killed..."`
`"...Not yet...`
` ...Even without magic, we still have these bodies..."`
`"D-Don't be ridiculous...!`
` There's no way you could fight a monster like that without that strange power...!"`
`"...St-Stay back, children...`
` I'll do something about this, so escape past the sides of that monster while I distract them...!"`
`"I won't let you.`
` Hohhohohohohoho!"`
`When Virgilia clapped her hands, a purple magic circle wall appeared behind her,`
` stealing even the faint hope that Krauss had been betting on.`
`"Is there...nothing more to be done...?`
` ...N-No, not yet.`
` ...Even Jessica fought.`
` I must do so as well..."`
`"A-Are you serious?!`
` It's not possible, not against that massive monster...!"`
`"Don't be absurd...!`
` Krauss-san, let us think of another way..."`
`"If you think of something, say it.`
` Until then, it looks like I'll have to manage something...`
` ...Come on, get back."`
`"...Take care."`
`"Hohohoho, ...hohhohohohohohohoho!`
` My, my, Krauss.`
` You intend to fight this child alone?"`
`".........Nngg...`
` Y-You never know.`
` In a fight, it's always possible to get in a lucky shot..."`
`"Hohhohohoho.`
` You think you can win even with a fluke...?`
` Allow me to explain so that even one who so blissfully unaware of his place can understand."`
`"What...?"`
`"Hohohoho...`
` If you were to wield 100% of your strength, your power level is at most 6.`
` In comparison, this child has a power level of 1000.`
` In short, even if there were 100 of you, you definitely couldn't win.`
`Well, it's true that there are uncertain elements in a fight.`
` Let us admit that your power level has a slight scaling factor to it.`
` But even so, your chances of defeating this child are at perhaps 0.00001%.`
` Do you understand?`
` You don't even have a one in ten thousand chance of victory.`
` Hohohohoh...!"`
`Virgilia and the goat guffawed together.`
`"D-Damn it...`
` If I've got a one-in-ten-thousand chance, that means the payoff will be ten thousand times greater, right?`
` ...A splendid dark horse.`
` Seeing a ticket like that makes me want to buy it right away..."`
`"Hohohohoh!`
` But the coin to buy it is your life, and you've only one of those, yes?`
` However, I can understand why you'd still want to entrust that miracle to fate."`
`"...Therefore, I shall praise your courage for standing against us without fear...and give you a bit of a handicap.`
` This child will fight with only his left arm.`
` Well, even so, I have absolutely no intention of losing to you."`
`"......Come to think of it, what's that *bing*bong*bing*bong* noise I keep hearing?"`
`"...V-Very well.`
` I'll take that challenge...`
` Whether it uses its left arm or not, I'm sure I'd be killed with a single strike.`
` ...I also only have a single chance at a strike.`
` I can only bet everything on that."`
`"That's absurd, Krauss-san...!`
` I know you used to do boxing, but wasn't that as far back as your college days...?`
` No, no, even if you were a pro boxer, there's no way you could defeat a monster like that with one strike...!"`
`"...That would be true if it were a match in the ring.`
` But while Krauss nii-san's chance to bet on this hope is faint, it does exist.`
` ...He's betting everything on that hope..."`
`"Y-You aren't saying...`
` But there's no way that would work out..."`
`"...Krauss-sama......"`
`"W-Watch me...`
` I'll settle this with a single strike..."`
`Hohohohoh...`
` How shallow.`
`I know what you're after.`
`The distance between the two of them is more than 10 meters.`
`If the goat and Krauss both step in with all their strength to settle the fight with a single blow, their power will be double what is normal.`
`Both will crash together, so it's a relative four times normal.`
`Even if, on top of that, the strike lands on a weak point for a critical hit, that will only double the power again.`
`......In short, Krauss's maximum power level of 6 times 8 would be 48 at the most.`
`He might or might not be able to win if he repeated that lucky shot a full 20 times.`
`Hohhohohohoho, if you're killed every time you take a hit and your damage still accumulates,`
` ...let's see, perhaps you might finally win when we get to Episode 24, yes?`
`Hohohohoh, if only this series could stretch on so long...!!`
` Either way, you don't even have a slight chance at victory!`
`...Hey, seriously, what is that *bing*bong* sound?`
`"Let me bet everything on a single strike...`
` You have no reason to hold back either, goat-kun.`
` Come at me seriously..."`
`"Hohohoho, he's requesting that you go all out.`
` Smash him with a single serious strike...and turn him into chunks of meat."`
`As the goat got excited and beat its chest over and over, it took a position as though preparing for a sprint.`
`Hohohohoh, is this what you wanted?`
`Bet your hopes on the greatest limits of your power level...and despair when even that gets you nowhere!`
`It rang again!`
` What the heck?! It's really starting to get on my nerves!`
`"Here I go...`
` Ready?"`
`The goat howled in response.`
`Then, with a matched timing that only the men confronting each other could comprehend,`
` ...the two leapt forward like bullets shot out of a gun.`
`The men howled, collecting the strength from all over their bodies into one arm each.`
`The goat's fiery glowing eyes clearly locked onto Krauss's face.`
`...He could perfectly see a vision of when he would step forwards, `
`when he would punch through Krauss and blow him away, `
`and when he would win perfectly.`
`The long, painful days up to that point drifted through the goat's mind...`
`Those painful days of training when his senpais had picked on him...`
` Those faint glimpses of the warm concern his senpais felt for him.`
`And the joy of that day his power had been acknowledged, when he had been accepted as one of the comrades...!`
`I never showed proper respect to my parents.`
`...That's right, didn't I plan to wash my hands of this business when this job was over...and return to my hometown?`
`I'm sorry, little goat sister... Your Onii-chan always caused you so much trouble.`
`And I...a-actually have a childhood friend, ...and I'm gonna marry her when I got hooooome!!!`
`"Gyaaaaaaaaahh!!!`
` Nooooooooooo!!`
` Stop tripping all those loser flaaaaaaaaaaags!!`
` You can't handle that punch, dodge iiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`It happened the instant before the two crashed and their punches crossed.`
`"You fool, Virgilia.`
` Looks like you failed to make a calm and rational decision."`
`"You mustn't take that punch!!`
` Knock it aside!!"`
`"?!?!"`
`The very instant the goat's left straight and Krauss's right straight crossed...!`
` The goat obeyed Virgilia's order with super-fast reflexes and pulled his straight back, repelling Krauss's punch!`
`"......Nng-"`
`That's right, Virgilia's decision probably had been wise.`
`After all, the number of loser flags amplifies the power level of one's opponent!`
`"That was close,`
` if you had taken that punch after tripping so many loser flags, imagine just how great a force it would have been amplified to...!!"`
`"Come on, from there, smash the completely open right side of his face with a right straight!!`
` What?`
` That promise about fighting with only your left arm?`
` Hohohoh!!`
` Aren't promises made to be broken?!!`
` Gyaah, tripped another ooooooone!!"`
`"I'm disappointed, Virgilia.`
` You really have lost your composure."`
`"What's that...?!`
` How was I not composed by noticing it beforehand and making him avoid it...?!"`
`"Wh-Why is that, Kyrie-sama...?`
` If they had crashed like that, wouldn't it have been Krauss's..."`
`'!s1`
`...even with 20 loser flags, `
`...that's not enough!"`
`Krauss's and the goat's double rush made for times 4.`
`With a miracle as an ally, the firm promise of a critical hit doubled it again for times 8.`
`On top of that, there was an amplification of times 20, equal to the number of loser flags, making for x160.`
`At a glance, that was an incredible amplification, but even so, Krauss's power level was 6.`
`Even multiplied by 160, it only made for a power level of 960.`
`Just barely below the goat's 1000...!`
`"That's why I said you weren't composed.`
` It's your blunder.`
` If they had crashed like that, you would have won."`
`"H-Hohohohoh!!`
` Even if that were so, it all comes to the same thing if this right straight smashes Krauss's head!!`
` Die, Ushiromiya Krauss!!!"`
`"...Take this, the strongest strike of the boxing world."`
`After repelling Krauss's right straight,`
` the goat's right straight attacked the right side of Krauss's face, which had been left open...`
`But there, it crossed Krauss's left straight...`
`The two punches crossed, and time stopped as each aimed for the face of the other...`
`"Ho, ......hohohoho.`
` To think that it would be timed for a simultaneous strike!`
` But his power level stops at x160, making it 960!!`
` It doesn't reach up to my child's 1000...!"`
`"......No.`
` Virgilia-san, `
` ...it's your loss."`
`"Why?!"`
`"You made him repel the first cross-counter.`
` ...Certainly, if another right straight after that were to hit, Krauss-san would probably be in pieces."`
`"...However, that was crossed...`
` ...That's no good.`
` Sorry, but this is a complete loss for you and this goat."`
`A cross-counter has four times the destructive power of a normal punch.`
`This is common knowledge in the boxing world.`
`And if it's blocked and the right straight hits, then it's a double cross-counter, with 8 times the destructive power.`
`This is also common knowledge in the boxing world.`
`And if that is crossed...`
`Then, by the principle of leverage, the triple cross would multiply the destructive power by 12!`
`This is also painfully common knowledge in the boxing world!!`
`It's even written in a Minmeishobou book!`
`"......Krauss-san's power level is 6."`
`"The rushing from both sides is times 4."`
`"Th-The critical hit is times 8."`
`"And times 160 for tripping too many loser flags."`
`"...And times 12 again for the triple cross-counter."`
`"...T-Times 1920..."`
`His power level is 11520...!!`
`Krauss's punch now had the power to easily win the first Tenkaichi Budokai...!!!`
`"...This result was brought about by Krauss-san's persistence in not giving up on victory until the end...and your pride.`
` Without either, this strength would not exist..."`
`"...You fought well.`
` ...You may now fall..."`
`Nanjo clapped the goat on the shoulder...`
`...Y-Your Onii-chan...gave it his all...`
`As the sparkling drops from the goat's eyes scattered, he bent backwards,`
` and fell on Virgilia.`
`"Ugyu-!!`
` Heavyyyyyyy, get off meeeeee!"`
`The goat's massive body was too heavy for the slender Virgilia.`
`She wriggled around with it on top of her, but it didn't look like she'd be able to escape.`
`In that instant, the barrier Virgilia had sealed broke.`
`"Don't take it personally.`
` It was the principle of leverage that led to your defeat."`
`"...I wonder how the principle of leverage applied to that counter.`
` It's an eternal mystery."`
`"Let's escape while we can...!!`
` You take care too, goat-san...!"`
`"W-Well then, excuse us, Virgilia-sama!"`
`"......*bow*."`
`"Waaaaaaaaiiit!!`
` Wait uup!!`
` Get this off meeeeee!!`
` Kiiii---!! Gapgapgapgap!!!"`
`After that, there was nothing to block their way.`
`...They ran intently through the underground passage...!`
`Jessica had finally been cornered, with the wall at her back.`
`...Ronove advanced with his magic circle wall bit by bit...and would probably crush her against the other wall eventually.`
`Considering the distance, she threw out her fists... This would be her final strike.`
`Jessica had dealt out many punches so far.`
`...The wall wasn't invincible.`
`It had already started to crack, and it wouldn't be strange for it to smash at any moment.`
`However, due to the rebounding damage,`
` Jessica also had cuts all over her body...and was all worn out.`
`"...Please put a stop to this.`
` I don't intend to crush you.`
` It is up to the Master to decide how to deal with you.`
` ...However, I also intend to congratulate you specially for your good fight."`
`'!s1`
`Quit fucking a-`
`around...`
` ...Not yet...`
` It isn't...over yet......"`
`"...You have wounds all over your body.`
` It's all you can manage just to stand, is it not?`
` ...It seems you plan on putting all your strength into this final strike.`
` However, that final strike will be fatal for you."`
`The damage reflected by Ronove's magic circle wall was proportional to the strength of the attack.`
`Jessica's all-out punch would be bounced back onto her.`
`...The more all-out she went, the more suicidal it would be for Jessica.`
`"I-I get it, `
`...I know that......"`
`"I am warning you.`
` Stop this now.`
` This is for your own good."`
`"Stop bluffing.`
` Your wall is already about to break, right...?`
` I can tell by the feel of it after punching it so much, okay......?"`
`"............"`
`That was...a fact.`
`Ronove's wall was already on the verge of breaking.`
`And on top of that, `
`Jessica's fists had been imbued with an unimaginable magical attack power by now, and their destructive strength defied the imagination.`
`...In the worst case, that destructive power might even pierce the defensive wall, smash Ronove as well,`
` and create an expansion connecting this room to the next.`
`...However, that damage would rebound on Jessica as well.`
` She wouldn't escape unharmed!`
`"I will say it just one more time.`
` Stop.`
` I say this out of consideration for you!"`
`"Shut the fuck up...`
` ......Prepare yourself."`
`Jessica howled.`
`...Putting all the strength of her greatest and final destructive power into her fist, she roared...`
`The three goats had been beaten down long ago.`
`Without straining to breathe in the slightest, George cautiously closed the distance between him and Gaap.`
`...He was after her.`
`He was planning on bringing her down with a single strike...`
`Gaap was also aiming for a single strike.`
`......If she let that chance slide, she would be killed this time...`
`"...Aren't you going to use your pitfalls?"`
`"......Ack..."`
`Even the tiny opening during the time it took to open the hole would prove fatal with George as an opponent right now.`
`...Gaap cautiously calculated the distance and timing, but even as she did, George closed the gap between them...`
`"......If you won't come, I will."`
`"...G-Go ahead...`
` There's no point in cheap tricks anymore.`
` ...I'll settle it...`
`with this kick of mine!"`
`For an instant, she thought George's body blurred, ...and then only his jacket was floating in the air.`
`The moment she thought 'Ah-', darkness covered Gaap.`
`George, with his heel swung up high, was attacking from the sky like a massive dragon.`
`"I-It worked...`
` ...This is my victory, Ushiromiya George!!"`
`"What?"`
`Gaap opened a vast pitfall with her in the center, swallowing up George along with herself...!!`
`The two were swallowed up by the pitfall...and spat out from the ceiling of the arbor.`
`But that was what Gaap had been after, so she alone landed lightly.`
`...However, there was another pitfall in George's landing spot.`
`"Ehheheheheheheh, aaaahhahahahahahahahahaha!!!`
` Gotcha, Ushiromiya Geoooooooooorge!!"`
`"It was fun, so die.`
` The Ushiromiya Family Headship would be wasted on the likes of you,`
` so I'll finish you right here, right now!!!`
` Aaaaaahhhhh, nngaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`George once again fell from the ceiling of the arbor.`
`He had probably been dropped the same distance as falling off the roof of a two story building.`
`In the sky, he couldn't control his posture in any way.`
`It was impossible to resist or defend or avoid!!`
`As Gaap spun like a whirlwind, she concentrated all of her energy on the sharp tip of her stiletto heel.`
`...This was the final strike...to perform his requiem.`
`The final strike of the queen bee that would bore into heaven, knocking him down into the true Abyss!!`
`"Welcome to the Abyss!!`
` This is the end of the line for you!!!"`
`She closed in on her prey...and stuck her foot up into the sky.`
`...At that time, she saw George's face.`
`......Even though he was in midair, he was calmly adjusting his glasses with the middle finger of his right hand.`
`And his posture was still preserved as that of an axe kick.`
`Without the faintest deviation, he aimed for Gaap's forehead...`
`"......I had already hypothesized that this move would come up."`
`"......Wh...at......?"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"If I'd jumped to make the person ~ib~on the ground~ib~ taste my heel, my posture would have collapsed long ago.`
` ......However, my posture hasn't collapsed in the slightest.`
` Do you know why?"`
`'!s1`
`don't...`
`mean..."`
`'!s1`
`...I aimed to make a person two stories below taste my heel!!!"`
`"Uu, ...oooooooooooooohhh, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"`
`"It's your loss, Miss!!!"`
`'!s0`
`"Whooooooaaaaaaahhh, take thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiss!!!"`
`'!s0`
`reached the wall...`
`and was sucked in.`
`It was sucked into a black, large hole that had suddenly opened on the wall.`
`"Well, ......I did tell you to stop."`
`"This......is......"`
`"...Gu, ......ah..."`
`"Actually,`
` ......I wasn't even close to being in a pinch.`
` Sooorry..."`
`...Jessica's fist had gone for George's stomach, `
`...and George's axe kick had lined up on Jessica's head.`
`The shocking destructive power imbued in Jessica's fist crushed George's organs and scattered his abdomen.`
`The same destructive power in George's axe kick smashed half of Jessica's head...and scattered its contents in the same manner...`
`"Pfft, ...ahhahahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` Didn't I tell yooou?`
` About a witch's acting proweeeeeeess?`
` Hey, hey, Beato, what do you think, were you watching...?"`
`"Wahahaha, waaaahhyahhyahhya, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` Not bad, just as planned!`
` You really do get it, Gaap!!`
` Woohoo!!"`
`Beato and Gaap casually high-fived each other.`
`'!s1`
`...aaah, `
`......whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"`
`"Thanks, Ronove.`
` Thanks for the gift.`
` I'll return Jessica's corpse.`
` ...Separate the corpses of the two who are close.`
` ...Does this mean the second twilight is over?"`
`Gaap dropped Jessica's corpse through a pitfall...`
`and all the chunks were thrown into Jessica's room,`
` as carelessly as throwing something into the trash...`
`Jessica's corpse and lumps of flesh fell from the ceiling and poured out all over her room.`
`Ronove shook his head slightly at this gruesome change of scenery.`
`"......My apologies, Jessica-sama.`
` I did warn you."`
`"However,`
` ...the true art of us demons...that is, foreseeing this conclusion and giving you advice I knew you wouldn't listen to, really isn't something a Human could understand.`
` ...Pukkukukukukukukukukuku!"`
`"It really was fun, kid.`
` ...But you play with words a bit too much.`
` ...Is 'Maybe it's about time I started fighting back?' really the best you've got?`
` Heheheh, are you trying to be someone from a light novel or something?`
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`In the arbor brutally decorated by George's and Jessica's scattered blood and guts, `
`Gaap enjoyed a loud laugh for a while...`
`...But she quickly realized that, in all seriousness, this was a little too filthy and undignified, and she snapped her fingers.`
`As she did, a cloud of gold butterflies rose up around her, `
`stuck to each of the bits and blood stains, and dropped them.`
`...Then, George's corpse returned bit by bit,`
` and the brutal corpse with its guts torn out was repaired into a clean corpse that looked like it was sleeping.`
`Was this some act of sportsmanship towards a dead rival......?`
`The heavens were split.`
`...Because Gaap had lifted her leg high, pointing at the sky.`
`"See you, lover boy.`
` This is Game Over for real."`
`*splat*.`
`......Without a trace of mercy, that foot stepped down...`
`and was buried into George's forehead.`
`The stiletto heel that was sharp as a weapon pierced George's forehead.`
`With a *bloop*, ...it was pulled out...`
`It was like a mark proving that Gaap certainly had finished him by her own hand...`
`Ronove also returned Jessica's corpse to its original form.`
`...And unlike how it had been with George, he restored Jessica's life...`
`"...Uu, ......*cough*, *cough*...`
` ...What in the world...is this...?`
` ...A dream...?"`
`"No, that is wrong.`
` ...You certainly did pass away, Jessica-sama.`
` You should be well aware of the memory of your final moments."`
`Jessica's mind was burning.`
`...For some reason, she remembered being thrown somewhere...and having George's heel smash her head...`
`"Am I...alive...?"`
`"No, you are dead.`
` With my magic, that will only be postponed for a scant three minutes.`
` After three minutes, the magic will end, and you will return to being a tragic corpse with half of its head crushed."`
`"...Wh-What'd you say......?`
` ...Heh, ......heheheheh..."`
`"Death is brutal.`
` In most cases, you aren't even given the time to ready your heart.`
` ...But to praise you for fighting so bravely, I've decided to give you this time.`
` Perhaps you should sort out your regrets from this world in those three minutes."`
`"I can also...decide to take you along with me during those three minutes..."`
`But the power that had burned through Jessica's body until a second ago had been completely lost.`
`...Jessica was aware of that herself.`
`She was already dead.`
`"And that is all for me.`
` If you would excuse me.`
` ...It was fun, Jessica-sama."`
`Ronove turned his form into a cloud of gold butterflies and disappeared.`
`All that remained was the sound of the wind and rain, and the figure of Jessica as she crouched down, leaning against the wall...`
`Jessica could tell.`
`She probably really would revert to the corpse she had been after three minutes.`
`...Was there anything she could do in those three minutes......?`
`She stood up, and with a shaky gait, `
`...took the phone that was on the desk...`
`"...H-Hello?`
` ...Is that Jessica?`
` Jessica?!`
` What is it, are you okay?!?!"`
`"......Heh, ...heheheheh... `
`...They...got me..."`
`"Are you okay?!`
` Did you get injured?!`
` I'll come to save you right now!!"`
`"No, ...it's already too late.`
` I'm...already dead, or so I hear...`
` Ahahaha, by the time you got here, Battler, I'd be a corpse with half its head split open."`
`"Craaaaaaap, that damn geezer!!`
` Wait there, I'm coming right now!!"`
`"Listen to me, Battler!!`
` Listen closely, okay...?`
` ......Now I totally see why Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san were evasive about the time the six in the dining hall got killed.`
`'!s1`
`......aren't...`
`...Human."`
`"Wh-Whaat?!`
` What are you talking about......?"`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, jes_4e296:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, jes_4e297:`
`"...Ahhahhahhah...`
` ...From the very beginning, fighting was useless...`
` They really aren't opponents that you'll be able to fight with that hat-stand spear you're so proud of..."`
`A line of blood dripped down from Jessica's forehead...`
`"George nii-san's done for too.`
` That was...an instant death...`
` ......Heheh, the next test is yours, Battler.`
` ......I wonder if your test will go the same way as ours...`
` ......Be careful...and don't misunderstand."`
`"Y-You mean about the test...?"`
`"No.`
` ......Don't misunderstand...`
`and assume that your enemy's Human.`
` ......The enemy...isn't Human.`
` ...They're demons...that can freely wield a terrifying magic.`
` No matter what, ...don't get the wrong idea about that...`
` *cough*, *cough*cough*!! Be...careful..."`
`A line of blood dripped down from Jessica's mouth as well.`
`...The left half of her head started hurting.`
`Jessica realized that she was about to return to the corpse she had been.`
`".........When 13 people die, the Golden Witch...will revive.`
` Six were killed including Mom.`
` That's the first twilight.`
` ...Then George nii-san and I were killed...for the second twilight.`
` ...So once five more people are killed, the ceremony will be complete, ...and the witch will revive."`
`"......I hope Dad and the rest are safe...`
` ...If they aren't, `
`......the one to test you...`
`might be the resurrected Beatrice herself..."`
`Battler already didn't understand what Jessica was saying.`
`But from her tone, he realized that she knew she was about to die.`
`So even though he didn't understand the situation, he urged her to give it her all.`
`"...Haha, I said I'm already dead.`
` ......See ya.`
` It looks like it's time.`
` ...Good luck on your test.`
` I hope you...can become the Head.`
` ............"`
`"Jessica?`
` Jessica?!`
` Hey, answer me!!`
` Jessicaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`Battler's sorrowful voice could be heard from the dangling receiver.`
`...As she leaned against the wall in that corner, crouched down...`
`...Jessica's head had been half smashed......`
`"This place is...?"`
`"...Is this...a well...?`
` Where is this...?"`
`Kyrie stuck her face out of the well, and then Krauss showed himself too.`
`When he realized that they could see the back of the mansion from beyond a grove of trees, Krauss knew more or less where they were.`
`...To think that here, in a certain well, there had been a hidden underground passage,`
` which led to a hidden mansion...`
`"Th-This really is tough on this old body...`
` ...I usually came up from a different spot, with real stairs.`
` If you just unlock it..."`
`"...I will ask you to tell me about the layout of this place in detail later, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...Shannon, are you okay? Grab hold."`
`"...I-I'm fine.`
` Kanon-kun, quickly."`
`Kanon climbed up a ladder out of the shaft that was disguised as a well.`
` ...It was probably quite deep.`
`When he looked down, for the first time, he realized how far he'd come up.`
`'!s0`
`*bang*.`
`......As Kanon was about to finally crawl out of the well, a hole the size of a basketball opened up in his chest.`
`...Everyone there looked through the hole in Kanon's chest to the scenery beyond...`
`"......K-Kanon-kun!!!"`
`'!s1`
`...e-sa...`
`......"`
`Kanon slumped backwards...`
`and was swallowed up into the depths of the well...`
`"E-Everyone, run!!`
` The Chiester Sisters!!`
` They've locked on, we can't avoid them!!`
` Run!!`
` Let at least one of us remain alive...!!!"`
`At that time, Krauss and Kyrie and Nanjo...`
`certainly saw a golden curved line appear from the well...`
`and sew itself through the side of Shannon's head......`
`"Shannon!!!"`
`Her head had been pierced.`
`The three had witnessed it perfectly until it had shot out the opposite side, blowing it away.`
`'!s0`
`......blood gushing from both sides of her head, `
`and flopped to the ground.`
`"W-Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhyaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"They're after us!!`
` Run!!`
` We'll be killed!!"`
`"...R-Run, ...runrunrun!!!"`
`As Nanjo doubled over in shock, stunned by how Shannon had died, the Chiester Sisters did not allow him to escape.`
`A curved line again appeared from the well...and pierced from Nanjo's forehead to the back of his head in an instant, sewing through him.`
`...*thump*.`
` And so, Nanjo passed away.`
`"What the, why...?!!`
` Where's the enemy coming from?!"`
`"We're being sniped!!`
` I don't know where from, but they've honed in on us perfectly!!`
` Let's escape into the mansion, block their field of vision!!"`
`The two dashed towards the back door of the mansion.`
`Then, right as Krauss was about to shut the door behind him, `
`...a golden curved line appeared for the fourth time, piercing Krauss from the back of his head to his forehead and smashing that forehead...`
`'!s1`
`......oooh......"`
`"Eeek!!`
` Eeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!!"`
`Krauss's body leaned over, fell down, and drew a neat radial pattern with the insides of his head...`
`Kyrie ran wildly through the hallway, flew into some room, and locked the door.`
`......But even so, she wasn't even remotely convinced that this had saved her life.`
`She would probably die soon!`
`This was apparently one of the guest rooms.`
`...At that moment, Kyrie's eyes fell on a phone on a side table...`
`After hanging up the call from Jessica, Batter had been about to dash out.`
`In that instant, the phone rang again.`
`"H-Hello!!!`
` ......Huh?`
` Kyrie-san?!"`
`"...Yes, Battler-kun.`
` ...I got lucky.`
` I managed to escape the dungeon somehow.`
` I really did have luck on my side."`
`"Where are you?!`
` Is everyone okay?!`
` Over here, it looks like Jessica and George-aniki are-"`
`"Listen!!!`
` I probably won't be alive for long."`
`At that time, right after she thought the keyhole of the locked door might have glowed gold, `
`a gold, curved line drawing a helix...`
`no, a golden sewing thread penetrated in from there at an incredible speed and bored a hole into the floor by Kyrie's feet.`
`...Oh, that's unusual.`
`The enemy, who sniped the other four one after another with extraordinary skill,`
` apparently really does have trouble shooting me between the eyes with a single shot while I'm holed up in this room.`
`But the next strike will probably hit...`
`At this point, Kyrie finally remembered the first massive killing in the dining hall...`
`...That's right...`
` ...This is what killed Rudolf and the rest, all six of them...`
`"...Listen, Battler-kun.`
` I'm going to tell you everything exactly as I saw it.`
` ...I'm sure you'll think there's something wrong with my head.`
` ...Yes, it's okay for you think that.`
` Even I still haven't sorted out what it was I saw."`
`"......Today,`
` after you all returned to the guesthouse, the family conference began in the dining hall, `
`...and I'll tell you everything that happened next.`
` Listen until the end without butting in.`
` ......The call might be suddenly cut off partway through.`
` If it does, at that time, I'll be dead."`
`"......Kyrie...san..."`
`'!s0`
`...about Kinzo appearing and the family conference starting, `
`...about the six being killed and the five of them being confined...`
`...About how she had escaped somehow...and ran away to where she was now,`
` and how everyone had finally been killed...`
` It was all spoken dispassionately, with no dramatization, just as she'd seen it.`
`...She even spoke about how everyone except her had been killed, and how she had observed the moments of all their deaths,`
` ...and how even now, someone was trying to kill her.`
`"......Actually, `
`even while we've been talking, ...I've been attacked three times.`
` Something like a strange gold thread keeps flying in through the keyhole, spinning around and aiming for me.`
` First it was by my feet.`
` ...Next, it was close to my shoulders.`
` ...Just now, it grazed my ear.`
` ...Its aim is getting more and more accurate.`
` Looks like it'll go right between my eyes pretty soon..."`
`"R-Run, Kyrie-san...!!`
` Run awaaaaaaaaaaay!!!"`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kir_4e385:`
`run this far, `
`...shut myself into a room, and even locked the door, right...?`
` ......Now that I'm still being pursued, `
`......just where should I hide, `
`...hey..."`
`'!s1`
`ri...`
`e...`
`...san......"`
`"Hey, Battler-kun...`
` Are Jessica-chan and George-kun...still alive?"`
`"......`
`...Not long ago, ...I got a phone call from Jessica...`
` ......It kinda...sounded like they were...done for..."`
`"......Thought so.`
` ...Yeah, when we were being killed one after another, I had a kind of premonition.`
` I thought that perhaps the second twilight had been finished in the ceremony of killing 13 people...before our twilights had been reached.`
` ......In short, when I die, that's 13 people.`
` This way, the ceremony is complete.`
` ...The Golden Witch, Beatrice, will resurrect."`
`"......I wonder what in the world will happen.`
` ...On this island filled with demons and witches...and swarming with goat monsters, `
`...I wonder just what will happen...`
`...when even the leader of them all, the Golden Witch, appears...`
` ...By now, `
`I don't...`
`...have a clue what's going on anymore."`
`Kyrie-san's voice...had completely given up on her own life.`
`Because Battler understood that, `
`...he couldn't stop the tears...`
`"...There's just one thing...I can advise you on."`
`"What...?"`
`"......If...`
`a demon or a witch does appear in front of you..."`
`"Yeah..."`
`"There's no need whatsoever to doubt whether it's real or not.`
` ...Understand that it is what it seems to be."`
`"............"`
`"You might think there must be some trick, or that there's some true nature hidden behind it.`
` ...If you have the time to think of something like that, `
`...it'd be much more constructive to plan out how not to damage the mood of whatever you're facing.`
` ...Even mistakenly, ...you must not say 'In that case, try showing me magic'...`
` ...Because to prove that, they'll probably use an even crueler way than before...`
`...to show you."`
`'!s1`
`...believe it...`
` ...Even if I hear...`
`...something like that coming from your mouth, `
`...I can't believe it......"`
`"I understand.`
` I understand why you can't believe.`
` ...So, that's why I can give this advice.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`...`
`~ib~Believe~ib~`
`."`
`"......You're telling me to believe in Beatrice...and demons and witches and monsters...?"`
`'!s1`
`...I think we still weren't able to believe any of it.`
` I'm still like that now.`
` ...The true form of this thing that keeps attacking me, trying to shoot through my forehead, `
`...is something I don't understand, `
`......and I can't believe it."`
`"So, `
`...I want you alone to believe, to understand, `
`......to accept the existence...`
`...of what we couldn't accept.`
` If you do that for me, our deaths won't be wasted.`
` ......It'll also have been worth it for me to make this phone call...`
` ...Ah...!"`
`"K-Kyrie-san?!?!"`
`"...I'm still okay.`
` It scratched me, but it missed again.`
` ...It looks like...`
`...I probably won't get another chance.`
` ......Thank you.`
` And goodbye, Battler-kun.`
` I treated you coldly sometimes because you were Asumu-san's son.`
` ...Forgive me...for those days."`
`"What do you mean, forgive you? Right now, you are a mother to me, Kyrie-san!!"`
`I felt as though I'd heard an incredible sound at the other end of the receiver.`
`Then, a noisy clacking sound.`
`...As though the receiver had fallen to the floor.`
`"Kyrie-san?!?!`
` Kyrie-san!!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!"`
`'!s0`
`......answer through the phone......`
`...again......`
`"...I don't know why you're mad, Battler."`
`"You don't?!`
` Everyone was killed!!`
` By that damn geezer!`
` Who was saying something crazy about Beatrice's resurrection ceremony or whatever!!"`
`"So, by now, 13 people have been offered as sacrifices,`
` ...and it's already time for Beatrice to revive, right?"`
`"Sure, that sounds great!!`
` I'll find Beatrice too and kill them both!!"`
`"......We've survived the ceremony.`
` So, we'll receive an invitation to the Golden Land from Beatrice.`
` Over there, all wishes will be granted.`
` If having your family killed is painful, then you just have to resurrect them.`
` ...That's what I plan to do.`
` I'll revive the really nice real Mama, the one that isn't possessed by the black witch."`
`"...So Mama will always be with me.`
` ...There won't be any more overtime or working on days off.`
` ...She'll always be with me, and think only of me, kihhihihi, and she'll always fight against fearsome enemies for my sake.`
` Kihhihihihihihi...!"`
`"...There's something wrong with you.`
` ...Why are you saying something so incomprehensible in a situation like this...?!"`
`"......Didn't Kyrie just tell you, Battler...?`
`'!s1`
`to believe...`
`in the witch?"`
`".........F-Fuck.`
` This is no time to get in an argument with you over something like this...!!`
` Now, there are no hostages or anything...anyone left alive!`
` This weird, shitty ceremony game is already over...!!"`
`"Let me do what I want now.`
` Someone might still be alive.`
` Or someone might be hiding!`
` I'll search everywhere, find them, and beat the shit out of them!!"`
`In a rage, Battler grabbed his hat stand spear and flew out of the room.`
`Maria watched him go, looking bored...`
`"......Even though Beatrice will grant our wishes soon anyway.`
` ...Stupid Battler.`
` ...Kihhihihihi."`
`At that time, the phone rang out again...`
`Maria stood up and grabbed the receiver.`
`"Uu-.`
` Hello.`
` ...Uu-?`
` Uu-!!!"`
`Of course, the sound of the phone also reached Battler's ears as he was about to dash out of the house.`
`With a violent forcefulness, he turned around and dashed into the cousins' room...`
`"M-Maria...!`
` Who...was the phone call from...?!"`
`With a terrifying look on his face, Battler yelled at Maria, who was on the phone.`
`You couldn't blame him...`
`Right now, the only humans left alive on the island were himself, Maria, Gohda, and Kumasawa.`
`But there was no way those two could call after being locked up in the gardening storehouse.`
`...Which meant......there was only one person left.`
`It had to be Kinzo.`
`After continuing her pleasant chat with the person on the other end of the phone for a while, Maria slowly turned to face Battler.`
`......Then, with an unsettling expression on her face, she laughed 'Kihihihihihihihihihi'.`
`...It felt almost as though the person on the other end of the line was chatting about Battler.`
`"Maria, ...who's on the phone?`
` ...Grandfather...?!"`
`Battler couldn't imagine that this was the case.`
`...After all, it was inconceivable that Maria would talk intimately with Kinzo,`
` ...and that she would be chatting about Battler with that eerie smile on her face.`
`So just what kind of person could be on the phone......who could make Maria chat with a smile like that?`
`......At that time, in the back of his mind, the words Kyrie had spoken to him drifted up.`
`If a witch does appear, there's no need to doubt it.`
` ...Just......believe that it exists...`
`"Yeah.`
` Battler just came back.`
` He sure is jumpy.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`"Maria!!`
` Who's on the phone?!`
` Who?!?!"`
`"...Hand it over?`
` Sure.`
` ......Here, Battler."`
`After getting the consent of the person on the other end, she held the receiver out to Battler...`
`".........Nng."`
`"Here."`
`Maria held the receiver out for him to take, ...as though it was perfectly normal.`
`Battler hesitated just a little bit before taking the receiver.`
`...After all, ......by accepting the existence of the person at the other end, `
`......he'd have no choice but to acknowledge them.`
`......As Kyrie said...`
`'!s0`
`...any need...`
`...to doubt that they exist.`
`Battler took the receiver.`
`As he did, Maria briskly left the room.`
`Battler, who was a bit scared to find out for sure who was at the other end of the receiver,`
` questioned Maria before taking the call.`
`"H-Hey!`
` Where are you going...?!"`
`"To where my test is.`
` ...I wonder who the next Ushiromiya Family Head will be, Battler or me.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihihi."`
`"......D-Don't go!!`
` You'll be killed!!"`
`"I won't be killed.`
` The ceremony is already over.`
` ...And even if I'm killed, I'll be revived.`
` ...Whether one of us becomes the Head or not, we've already been invited to the Golden Land.`
` See you."`
`"Wait!!`
` Maria...!!!"`
`Battler stretched his hand out to Maria's back as she left,`
` ...but the cord of the receiver that he was gripping stopped him, just like a chain.`
`...He readied himself.`
`...Battler put the receiver to his ear...`
`"......H-Hello...?"`
`'!s0`
` <And I'm fiiine>!!`
` <And yooooooooooouuuuu>?!`
` Aaaaahhhhyahhyahhyahhyaaaaa!!!"`
`Screwed up, mocking English filled his ears.`
`...It was the voice of a woman he didn't know.`
`...Who was it...?`
` The inside of his head was starting to freeze up...`
` ......Who was it......?`
`"What do you mean 'Who is it?', Ushiromiya Battleeeeer...?`
` Normally, you'd answer <yeees, I'm fine>!`
` Right??`
` That takes me back, ...you do that one in middle school, right?`
` That thing you do in pairs!`
` Uhhyahyahyahyahyahyaaaaahh!!!"`
`"Y-You're insane...`
` Who are you?!!`
` Answer me!!!"`
`"Say it in Engliiish.`
` Isn't that your specialtyyyyy?"`
`"...D-Don't fuck with me...`
`Who are you?!!`
` An underling of that damn geezer?!"`
`"Underling is a mean way to say it, is it not?`
` At least say prisoner.`
` ...And Kinzo is my prisoner!`
` Riiight?`
` Wahhahahahahahahahaha..."`
`That last laugh didn't sound like it was aimed at Battler.`
`...It was almost as though Kinzo was right next to the phone, cackling as well...`
`"...S-Say your name!!`
` Who are you?!`
` Who?!!!"`
`"Guess right, and you could win a free trip to Hawaii!`
` Ahhyahhyahhhyaaaah!!`
` Fffinally.`
` Finally!!`
` Mmmmmmm, it was so looooooong, the days leading up to today were reeeeeeally long...!!`
` I seriously waited a thousand years for today, get it??`
` I owe it to you!`
` My big resurrection!!`
` <Thank you>, Kinzo!`
` Just for you, I'll lend an ear to that last `
`'I'll take that move back' of yoours!!!"`
`"...My, my, aren't you getting a tad too excited?`
` Couldn't you act a bit more ladylike?"`
`Kinzo and Beatrice sat facing each other over the chessboard on the reception table.`
`There was expensive cheese and snacks to go with drinks.`
`And there were several empty wine bottles lined up.`
`As Beatrice rolled around on the sofa in an unseemly way,`
` she happily held a wine glass in one hand...`
`and was probably completely drunk.`
`"I'm in the beeest mood today, so here's a huge bonus for you!!`
` Hey, hey, Kinzo, don't use Chateau Petrus as a decoration!`
` It's from 1947, right?!`
` If you don't open it today, just when do you plan on opening it?!`
` Let's drown ourselves in it and plaaaaaaaaay!`
` Then let's whack each other with the empty bottles!`
` Uhhyahhyahhyahhya!!"`
`"Hahhaha, how amusing.`
` You're too excited.`
` And you're letting loose too much."`
`"And what about you, Kinzoooooo?!`
` Aren't you happy to be reunited with meee?`
` Ah, it's the living world! The earthly world!!`
` Long live my flesh!!"`
`"...What...are you going on about......?`
` ...Are you saying that you're...B-Beatrice or something...?"`
`"<Ye-eeeeeeeeeeeeeeess, I aaaaaaaaaamm>!!`
` Thanks to Kinzo's 13-person murder ceremony, I've finally been resurrected...!!`
` It's nice having a mouth, it's nice having a tongue!`
` How fun it is to be able to talk to you like this!`
` Come to think of it, even though we slapped each other with abuse so many times, over and over again, `
`this is the first time we've had a conversation like this on the board during the game, isn't it?`
` How very fresh!!"`
`"Oh, did you hear that *pop* sound just now?!`
` He opened it, he seriously opened that Chateau Petrus!!`
` Do you know how much a single bottle costs?!`
` Almost as much as a whole 10 kilogram ingot, you seeeeeeeeeeee?!?!`
` Hii-hhahhahhahhahha!!"`
`"C-Cut the crap...!!`
` Beatrice...?!!`
` The Golden Witch, you say?!`
` Give it a rest!!`
` Where are you?!`
` Is that damn geezer with you too?!`
` I'll beat the shit out of both of you!!`
` Where are you now?!`
` Answer me!!"`
`"Oh, so you want to meet me?`
` Uhhihihihi, it's tough being such a popular woman!`
` But please, don't try to chat me up when Kinzo's around, okaay?`
` This guy gets seriously jealous, so he has a bad temper, you see?`
` ......But when Kinzo isn't around and we're all alone, I'll love you all ya want in secret, okay...?`
` Uhyaaahhahhahhahha *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!!"`
`"Y-You're insane......"`
`"Kinzoo, I've changed my mind.`
` I won't do Maria's test.`
` You go."`
`"How fickle.`
` So, are you saying you'll do Battler's test?"`
`"Nothing wrong with that, riiight?!`
` That guy's so much like a younger you that it makes my heart race.`
` Don't worry, I won't cheat on yooooou.`
` This'll be the only time I'll be alone with him.`
` ...I'm always alone with you in bed, riiight...?`
` But no more tying me to the bed with a collar, 'kay?`
` Kuhhyahhahhahahahahaha...!!!"`
`"Well then, Battleer!`
` I, the Golden Witch Beatrice, will be conducting your test myself!`
` As for the place, ...yes.`
` Let's make it the front entrance to this mansion!`
` Battleer, make sure you try seriously hard in this test to become the Successor, okaay?`
` ...I mean, Kinzo's practically dead on his feet.`
` If you become his successor, you'll be the new owner of everything on this island.`
` ...If it's you, ...I wouldn't mind becoming all yours, see...?`
` Rule over me just like Kinzo did, 'kay...?`
` Kuhhihihihihihihihi, uhhyahhahhahahahahahaha!"`
`"Th-The front entrance of the mansion...`
` Perfect...!!`
` You drunk bastard!!`
` I'll sober you up.`
` I'll fix that hangover with a burning punch!!`
`'!s0`
`Battler impulsively slammed the receiver down.`
`There was no need to talk through it anymore.`
`...I'll meet her face to face and settle this!!`
`I took the spear I'd made from the hat stand...`
`and went outside without even an umbrella.`
`...It's hard to imagine that the young woman calling herself Beatrice is waiting for me alone.`
`...I should probably assume that, as Gohda-san and the rest said, she'll be waiting with supporting troops.`
`Going alone would be too reckless...`
`"Gohda-san, Kumasawa-san...!`
` It's me, Battler...!"`
`I headed for the gardening storehouse first.`
`I need all the help I can get.`
`Gohda-san is big, so I can probably count on him for some firepower.`
` Kumasawa's knowledge and familiarity with the terrain as a senior servant might become a huge weapon.`
`Both of them have master keys, and they know more about the mansion than I do.`
` They'll be pretty reliable allies.`
`As I banged on the shutter and called out for them to open it, I remembered that there was nothing they could do from the inside.`
`I would have to get the key back from them before opening the door.`
`I rounded the corner, knocked on the small latticed window there, and opened it.`
`"Gohda-san, Kumasawa baa-chan...!`
` It's Battler...!!`
` Hey, come on, get up, ...h...ey......"`
`The scene in the shed, lit by a dim lightbulb, ...was very...strange...`
`'!s1`
`sa...n...`
` ...Kumasawa...sa...`
`n..."`
`'!s0`
`...hung two thick ropes, `
`...and at the ends, `
`...Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san...`
`...were hanging...by their necks...`
`It was dim and cramped because of the various pieces of equipment strewn about, so I couldn't make out the situation clearly.`
`...But when they showed not even a tremor after I called out to them,`
` and because of the way the loops around their necks seemed to carry the full weight of their bodies, I could sense no trace of life from them...`
`"You've gotta be......kidding me, ...right......?`
` ...Why......?"`
`The shutter was still closed.`
`...And there was only a single key, which had supposedly been given to Gohda-san.`
`So how had the culprit...opened the shutter and killed both of them inside...?`
`No, wait, they weren't necessarily killed...`
`If this is a suicide...`
`...That way, this closed room makes sense, but I don't know why they would hang themselves and commit suicide...!!`
`Feebly, ...I slumped down on the spot.`
`'!s0`
`...are me, Maria, `
`...and that damn geezer.`
`......No, there's also that insane woman calling herself Beatrice...`
`There's Maria, who had acted like the witch's ally from the beginning.`
`And that geezer, the ringleader who revived the witch.`
`And...the witch herself.`
`...What the hell.`
` ......By now, I might as well be...`
`...the only one on this island......`
`Using my pole as a cane, I feebly rose.`
`...Damn, I can't do it like this...`
`I've got to avenge...everyone...`
`"Damn iiiiiiiit, ...it's useless this way...`
` Aaah, it's useless, it's all useless...`
` Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiitt......"`
`Might as well cry while I can...`
`...So that my frail emotions will be squeezed out with my tears...`
`Then, ...I straightened up and gazed into the darkness in the direction of the mansion.`
`......At the entrance to the mansion, the witch is waiting.`
`I'll go...and settle this.`
`I'll find the source of this weird, insane night...and crush her with my own hands...!`
`Amidst the pouring rain, ...I walked through the rose garden without an umbrella, letting myself get soaked.`
`...I could see the arbor on the other side.`
`According to Jessica, it seemed that George-aniki had also been killed...`
`Well, by this point, there's no need to worry about the lives of any hostages.`
`...I left the path, aiming for the arbor.`
`Then,`
` ......I saw George-aniki's weather-beaten corpse...`
`"......Aniki...`
` ......Damn......"`
`The corpse was in front of the arbor.`
`If he had died under the arbor, he might have at least been spared being beaten down upon by the rain...`
`In Aniki's forehead was a gaping hole, as though he'd been shot with a gun.`
`Perhaps because the rain had washed everything away, his face wasn't covered with blood, ...so he looked almost like he was sleeping.`
`...However, his clothes were stained a deep red, and there were still signs that a large amount of blood had flowed out...`
`How happy I'd be if he were sleeping, or else pretending to be dead...`
`...But even though the rain sprayed against Aniki's eyes, they remained open.`
`...And...the hole in his forehead was no joke, `
`...but absolutely real...`
`There had been a faint chance that even Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san hanging by their necks in the gardening shed had been them playing a bad joke.`
`But that naive possibility had now been completely denied.`
`And, as I looked at this corpse, I became completely sure.`
`Just as Gohda-san had once said.`
`...The enemy had come to take lives like pieces on a chessboard.`
`"......Aaaah, ...there's no mistake.`
` ...It seems that old geezer and the witch...`
`...really don't view our lives as anything more than that..."`
`...That damn witch said something over the phone...`
`Something about us being 'on the game board'...`
`"...Perfect...`
` ...I see, she thinks this is a game...`
` Then, ...if you killed everyone like it was a game, `
`......it's okay if I kill you all like it's a game, right...?`
` ......Prepare yourself,`
` ...Beatrice......"`
`The lightning caused the mansion's vast shadow to rise up.`
`...Finally, ...the mansion.`
`As the massive shape came into view, there was no silhouette of any person.`
`It seemed that there weren't any underlings waiting for me in a pack, or anything like that.`
`......According to Kyrie-san, there were massive amounts of attendants with goat heads.`
`At least for now, I couldn't sense a large group of them hiding and staring at me...`
`What's this...?`
`Beneath the roof of the entrance, `
`......there's something set down.`
`"...What is this?`
` ......A...box?"`
`It looked like the kind of small box that girls often keep trinkets in.`
`...Or maybe it was the same kind of extravagant cigar case you'd find in a reception room.`
`Either way, it didn't look like something that should be here...`
`It clearly looked...as though I was being told to open it.`
`But for some reason, opening something being offered to me was irritating.`
`...However, it didn't look like we'd get anywhere if I didn't open it.`
`Could it be that it's set up with some trap to make it explode when opened...?`
`Thinking things like that, forgetting even to come under the overhang,`
` I continued to glare at the box, still beaten down upon by the rain.`
`Then, ......mixed in with the thunder...was some kind of...music?`
` ...It sounded like that.`
`...It was the tone of the big clock in the hall announcing 24:00.`
`It was also a sound announcing that this insane day, October 4, had finally ended,`
` ...and that the much more incredibly insane day of October 5 had begun.`
`That sound quieted, ......and I could hear an eerie laugh coming out of nowhere...`
`I got the feeling that the voice was coming from the heavens, ...and I looked up at the sky.`
`...What I saw there......was a woman I'd never seen before.`
`No, it's not true that I never saw her before.`
`...I saw her once today.`
`Yes, in the portrait inside the mansion...`
`The clothes were different, ...but that face was just like the witch of the portrait...`
`Aaah, who am I kidding, ...I already know who this person is...!!`
`"...A-Are you Beatrice?!!!"`
`"Yahhoooooooooi, Battleeeeeeeeeeeeer...!!"`
`From the second floor balcony, ...leaning out under an umbrella and waving high-spiritedly,`
` ...was, without a doubt, the witch of the portrait, ...Beatrice......!!`
`Was the plan for the boss to take a birds-eye view and let the goat underlings torture me to death...?!`
`I adjusted my grip on the spear, `
`and, imagining goats creeping out of the nearby shadows and the entrance and surrounding me, I raised my guard in all directions...`
`"Ahhaha, be at ease, there's no one here but you and me, see?`
` No goat furniture, no demon butlers or Teacher, not even the demon who's my close friend."`
`"And, there's none of the gold butterflies that compose my flesh, no magic circles, and no summoners as witnesses!!`
` ...Do you know what that means?"`
`"No clue.`
` Quit babbling..."`
`"It is true that I have met you several times even in this world.`
` Almost as though we just missed each other.`
` ...As you know, this world of Humans is filled with a toxin just by your existence and your doubting of me."`
`"Almost like solid ramparts strengthening the guard around you, the king!`
` And through multiple games,`
` I have advanced pieces one by one, split them apart, and cornered them, leveling your ramparts bit by bit."`
`"Then, a faint crack finally opened, and I sent a bishop in, so that it could approach right up next to you.`
` ......But as you know, bishops are pieces with blind spots.`
` As long as you stay on the black squares, a bishop on black can wield a massive influence,`
` but if you escape just one step to a white square, even if I close in right next to you, I will not be able to touch you."`
`"That is why I have progressed through this game by sending in various pieces to prevent you from staying on a white square,`
` forcing you out in front of me, the one who controls the black squares next to you."`
`"Howeeever!!`
` There are now holes opened all over your ramparts,`
` and I was able to send in not a bishop, but a full queen!!`
` Do you know what kind of piece a queen is?"`
`"A rook+bishop.`
` ...Is this what you're trying to say?`
` ...That now, you not only control the black squares that are part of the illusion of the witch, but have been able to eat into the white squares of the human world at will...?!"`
`"That is correct!!`
` You have been calling the squares with the gold butterflies that are my minions 'the Illusion of the Witch',`
` and you have denied them as unobserved unrealities, right...?`
` *cackle*cackle* I know...!!"`
`"For that very reason, I have openly descended to the white squares like this!!`
` Do not worry, I'll call plenty of gold butterflies and goats, demons and witches later!`
` If you wish, I'll invite you to the Golden Land!!`
` There, any wish can be granted...!!`
` Wahhahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`"...It's starting to look like someone knocked an ink bottle over the chessboard of this island."`
`"I see, a pleasant phrasing...!`
` *cackle*cackle* Soon, you will be covered in ink as well.`
` You will finally become covered with pitch black...and will surely become a black king...!`
` You really are pitiful, drowning in a sea of ink right now, aren't you?"`
`"No, that's wrong.`
` I'll admit that the island has been stained completely black from your ink bottle,`
` ...but there's still a white square left."`
`"Hoh, where...?!!"`
`"Right under my feet.`
` ......Your ink of magic tried to cover the entire island, but it can't cover the ground my feet are standing on.`
` ...Even if this island seems to be stained pitch-black at a glance, I am me.`
` I'm here, stepping on a white square!!"`
`It's strange...`
`Until a second ago, I was shivering all over.`
`...But now that she's appeared openly right before my eyes like this, my terror has actually lessened.`
`Interesting.`
` Ghosts are most terrifying when you can only sense them.`
`When you can see them, and they have a face you can plant your fist into, there's nothing scary about it...!!`
`...However, she definitely isn't an interesting or a friendly person.`
`...She can kill me instantly by snapping her fingers while rolling around giggling.`
`Whether we interpret the result of her snapping her fingers as magic flying at me or underlings showing up to shoot me, it doesn't matter.`
`...Anyway, whether this is fantasy or mystery,`
` that queen is in a position where she can kill me by just snapping her fingers...!`
`'!s0`
`@`
`...she's the queen of this island, `
`...who reigns over both the white and black squares...?!`
`"Well then,`
` it might be amusing to wait until you catch a cold in all that rain, but it's about time to move to the matter at hand.`
` ......Can you see the box down there?`
` Your test is inside it."`
`"Wait.`
` ...After all that's happened, I'm not interested in some stupid game about who'll become the Successor."`
`"My game is to take you and that damn geezer...and all of you guys who killed everyone...and smack 'em with a Gian punch.`
` One of those face-crushers."`
`"Hoh.`
` So, you will fly through the air up to my balcony?`
` Very well, very well, *cackle*!`
` Then, look, come on right now, here here, up up!"`
`"...Damn you, acting so carefree just because you're in a completely safe place...`
` I'm coming over there right now, so prepare yourself and wait for me!!"`
`"Aah, no, no.`
` The door is locked.`
` Of course, the shutters are down for all the windows.`
` My castle isn't so fragile that a single knight like you could break in!"`
`I tried opening the door to the entrance anyway, ...but it really was locked.`
`When I looked around, I noticed that the shutters were closed on the windows after all.`
`...Normally, those wouldn't be closed.`
`"...Tch.`
` Looks like you've prepared for everything.`
` ...Where's the key?!"`
`Gohda-san and Kumsawa-san probably had master keys, but they were in the closed room of the gardening shed.`
`...I can only give up for now...!`
`"Damn...`
` ...Guess she's no fool herself."`
`"Do you really want to be right beside me so muuch?`
` All right, if you impressively pass your test, why don't I grant you an audience?`
` If you pass, then you'll become the Successor and my new master.`
` ...My flesh and soul will be yours to do with as you please.`
` For I am no more than the Ushiromiya family's furniture!`
` Ahhahhahhahhahha!!"`
`"......Well,`
` it looks like you want to make me take this test no matter what.`
` ...Okay.`
` I'll give it a shot.`
` ...If I pass, my first prize will be a punch to your face."`
`"Scary, scaary...`
` But it's not like I mind being controlled by violence, you see?`
` Grab onto my head!`
` Make my face twist in pain, tear me apart like a hawk does with its talons to its prey, scratch at me and trample upon me...!!"`
`"Aaah, remind me of Kinzo in his younger days once more...!!`
` That single time in my thousand-year life!`
` Remind me of that day I was taught the joy of being controlled, surrendering and being reduced to furniture!!`
` Uhyaaahhyahhyahhyahhya!!"`
`"...You damn drunk, we aren't getting anywhere."`
`Ignoring the stupidly smiling witch, I picked up the box.`
`"Yes.`
` Open it.`
` Inside is a letter.`
` Read it."`
`"........."`
`I opened it.`
` ...There was a faint smell of cigarettes.`
`Apparently, it really had originally been a cigar case.`
`But there were no cigarettes or cigars inside.`
`Instead, there was a Western envelope with the One-Winged Eagle crest.`
`And when I opened that too, ...there was a letter inside.`
`I looked up at the witch.`
`She was grinning down at me.`
`...It seemed she was looking forward to seeing what kind of reaction I'd have to the contents.`
`...Damn, just perfect.`
`Its contents were something like this...`
`Among the three mentioned below...`
`In order to gain two, sacrifice one.`
`1. Your life`
`2. ＿＿'s life`
`3. Everyone else's lives`
`If you do not choose one, all of the above will be lost.`
`"......What's this?`
` Some pretty creepy stuff's written here.`
` More importantly, the second one's blank, so I don't even know whose life it's supposed to be."`
`"Indeed.`
` That second one is where you put the name of the one the test-taker loves the most.`
` For Jessica's test, it was Kanon's name, and for George's test, it was Shannon's.`
` ...Since they had obvious feelings for certain people, those names were written in beforehand,`
` but I don't know whom you have feelings for.`
` So I didn't know whose name to write and left it blank."`
`"That's perfect.`
` I love you, Beatrice.`
` I'll stick your name in here.`
` In that case, I'll choose the second choice.`
` Happy now?"`
`"Hey hey, quit joking, quit joking.`
` Heey, please, Battler.`
` Tell me the name of the person you have feelings for.`
` If you don't, then this won't be a test, right?"`
`"Sorry.`
` I don't have any girl in particular.`
` Even if I did, why the hell would I tell you?"`
`"In that case, this test will not work for you.`
` Hmmm, what a shame, what a shame.`
` And I was really wondering what kind of woman was your cup of tea!`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......What would you do if I said I liked flat-chested lolis with long, black hair?`
` That wouldn't match you at all, right?"`
`"Lies, you breast sommelier!`
` Blonde and bouncy is best, right?`
` Am I not truly the embodiment of your ideal, *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"If guessing your three sizes is the test to become the Successor, I'll take it gladly."`
`"Ah, yes.`
` This was the test to choose the Successor, wasn't it?`
` It was so fun chatting with you that I've been getting a bit off topic."`
`"...Then let us begin the test.`
` I will question you to see whether you are qualified to be the Successor to the Ushiromiya Family Headship.`
` Answer with care."`
`The witch, who had been joking around like she was drunk until a second ago, suddenly regained her dignity.`
`...She looked as though she truly had stepped out of that majestic portrait...`
`"......I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, the Golden Witch and the Endless Witch, Beatrice.`
` ...Do you have the qualifications to inherit the Ushiromiya family and all of my gold?`
` That is what I will test.`
` ......State your name."`
`"......Ushiromiya...Battler."`
`When faced with a dignity you wouldn't have imagined from her appearance a short while ago,`
` I answered without any hesitation.`
`...And from that...yes, I see,`
` ...I can tell why she's worthy of calling herself the true queen of this island.`
`"Very well, Ushiromiya Battler.`
` ......However, for these six years, you have thrown away that Ushiromiya name, have you not...?`
` Why was that...?"`
`"......Nn......`
` ...Because I ran out of love for that old bastard."`
`"I know.`
` It was because you felt that your father's remarriage disgraced the death of your mother, whom you respected, yes...?"`
`"I see, you have no blood relation to your new mother whatsoever.`
` It's not as though I can't understand why you'd be unable to accept that mother.`
` ...However, no matter whom your father remarried, that wouldn't change the fact that his blood runs in your veins, correct?"`
`"......What are you trying to say?"`
`"I can somewhat understand the childishness that led you to resist your father's remarriage, since you wanted him all to yourself."`
`"However, was throwing away the Ushiromiya name as a means of resistance not a disgrace to your family and blood?`
` ......You were born and raised Ushiromiya, were you not?`
` Do you think you had the right to forget that debt and throw away the Ushiromiya name?"`
`"...It's got nothing to do with you.`
` This is between me and Dad...!"`
`"The Ushiromiya name does not belong to you and your father alone.`
` That was your childishness, nothing more than your inability to forgive the fact that your father was stolen away by an unknown woman.`
` ...Those six years during which you threw away the Ushiromiya family register were a significant period during which you covered the Ushiromiya family in mud.`
` Know the depths of that sin."`
`"......Well, sorry I'm so childish..."`
`"However,`
` even though it occurred around the time of the deaths of your grandparents, you did well to return to the Ushiromiya register.`
` For that, let us give you a chance to purify that sin yourself.`
` Now is the time to compensate for your sin of six years ago."`
`"Come, try to remember, remember your own sin.`
` Remember that, confess, and repent.`
` ......That is the test I shall give you."`
`...At that time, a massive thunderclap rang out, making my mind go blank.`
`".........`
`...What do you mean, ...repent?`
` ......Are you trying to tell me to apologize?"`
`"......The test has already begun.`
` You may think as you wish."`
`The witch's expression did not look like a person forcing a tough question on someone and sneering at them.`
`...She was asking seriously, and he could even sense a quiet determination.`
`Even though the rain fell on Battler, he did not shift his eyes from that gaze.`
`...The witch threw her umbrella away.`
`She abandoned herself to the falling rain.`
`So that the rain would fall on her until Battler answered that question.`
`...She had chosen to let the rain fall on her as well until he reached an answer.`
`For some reason, Battler understood that.`
`...And yet, ...he didn't understand.`
`"...W-Well,`
` ...if you put it that way, I do think I was being childish...`
` All things considered, even Dad getting remarried didn't cancel out the debt I owed for him raising me."`
`"...I hear that Dad always kept on paying for my living expenses...`
`and that he even said he wanted to participate in school events.`
` ......The only reason he couldn't come...was because I told Grandpa and Grandma not to let him come, no matter what..."`
`"..............."`
`"...I-It's true that...I can't argue back if you wanna call that my childish resistance.`
` ......But you know, ...in that case,`
` ...who would clear away Mom's...Ushiromiya Asumu's regrets...?!`
` Even though Mom was so devoted to our family and did the very best she could...?!"`
`"Despite that, Dad was cheating with Kyrie-san.`
` He even got her pregnant with Ange...!`
` And then, along with her birth, he rushed to move them into his register.`
` ...If that wasn't a betrayal of Mom, then what was it?!`
` Who...`
`will clear up...`
`Mom's regrets?!!"`
`"...But what you're saying is also right.`
` Even though the cheating was a fact, the debt I owed for being raised was real too."`
`"In that case, they cancel each other out, so there's absolutely nothing wrong with me leaving the family, is there?!!`
` That's right, I had the right...no, the duty to smack Dad in Mom's place, didn't I?!"`
`"But I didn't do that!`
` I left without saying anything, as though I hadn't been there in the first place!!`
` And Dad forgot all about me and started a new family with Kyrie-san and Ange!`
` Doesn't that settle everything?!!"`
`But since then, six years have passed.`
`...Time healed the anger.`
`Kyrie-san understood my anger,`
` and even so, she tried to interact with me, even if it meant tearing her heart apart.`
`Ange didn't know anything about the situation,`
` and even though I lived in a separate house, she was raised believing that I was her real big brother and loved me as if it were true.`
`...Dad casually said to come home any time I wanted.`
`"It started to feel more and more ridiculous!!`
` I thought it was about time for me to cool my head as well.`
` So I said I'd put it all behind me as long as Dad apologized.`
` Then came the day of Grandpa's funeral!`
` Then, he really did put his hands on the floor and apologize...!!`
` Looking unbelievably pathetic...!`
` Dad did that and seriously bowed his head to me, you see...?!`
` ...When I saw that, it felt like it'd be stupid to keep it up any longer."`
`"I'm sure Mom thought the same thing!`
` Every time Dad and I fought, Mom would always laugh and mediate for us.`
` 'Oh, were you fighting over something that silly?'`
` is what she'd say.`
` ...I could feel Mom saying that and laughing...!!"`
`"So, `
`...though I couldn't actually say I'd forgive him, `
`......I thought it might be okay to start over again from square one.`
` So I decided to wind everything back to how it was six years ago.`
` ......Then, I returned to the Ushiromiya family register...!!`
` I'd also cried, raged, and worried for a whole six years!"`
`"It might've been the same for Dad...and for my dead Mom.`
` Maybe even for Kyrie-san and Ange.`
` ...So we went back to square one, and I returned to being Ushiromiya Battler!!!`
` That's my immediate family's problem...`
`and has nothing to do with the Ushiromiya family!!"`
`"You have no right to judge that as a sin, and I have no obligation to show repentance to you!`
` If there was anyone I should've done that for, you've already killed them!!`
` So I won't apologize for anything!`
` I won't repent!!`
` That's my answer for this test!!!"`
`"...............`
`...Is that all...?"`
`"What......?`
` ........."`
`Part of me had fully responded to her provocation,`
` and I'd supposedly vented out all the stuff I'd kept inside my chest, stuff I hadn't wanted to show anyone.`
`That was what the witch had supposedly been expecting.`
`...And yet, the witch's blank expression didn't change in the slightest.`
`I'd been sure she'd start cackling and guffawing,`
` sneering at my childish, foolish, and shameful past.`
`But to the contrary, I could feel a sense of disgust about her,`
` ...something you could almost call disappointment.`
`"......What do you mean 'Is that all?', ...I've exposed everything about me, right?`
` What more could you want?"`
`"That still isn't enough to clear away your sins."`
`"Clear away?`
` ...What the hell, are you asking me to prostrate myself right here and apologize like Dad did...?!"`
`"......That's not it.`
` I have no interest in matters concerning your immediate family or your home.`
` Where are we?`
` Rokkenjima.`
` The main residence of the Ushiromiya Head Family.`
` ...Isn't there a sin you ought to remember, fitting for this place...?"`
`"......Are you...saying that I have...another sin...?"`
`"...Remember, Ushiromiya Battler.`
` ......Not being able to remember that is your sin.`
` For that reason, I shall forgive you.`
` If you can remember it, I shall forgive you.`
` ......Remembering that is my test of atonement for you."`
`"......Even if you...tell me to remember..."`
`"......Remember.`
` ...That's what makes it a sin."`
`"Sorry, Beato.`
` ...I have absolutely no memory of it."`
`"...You make it sound like I caused you trouble six years ago or something,`
` but I supposedly met you for the first time at this family conference.`
` It's true that your legend also existed six years ago,`
` but I shouldn't have been acquainted with you."`
`"...Naturally.`
` On the Rokkenjima of six years ago, I had not yet materialized."`
`"Then what kind of sin are you saying I have?`
` ...Are you saying...I've sinned against you somehow...?"`
`"Don't make me say the same thing twice.`
` I had not materialized six years ago.`
` There was no way for me to become acquainted with you.`
` In the world that you are, it was as though I didn't exist."`
`...Beato's cold eyes...felt as though they were pursuing some kind of sin.`
`At a glance, it felt as though she still hated me for something I'd done to her...and that she blamed me for it.`
`However, ...I naturally didn't have a clue, and Beato had said it herself.`
`Six years ago, there was no link between us.`
`Six years ago, no person called Beatrice existed for me.`
`"......At least give me a hint.`
` ...Does this sin...`
`have anything to do with you and me...?"`
`"I had no connection to you six years ago.`
` Remove me from your thoughts already.`
` ...Why...do you think it is a sin against me?"`
`"......Your...eyes."`
`"My eyes...?`
` ......Hoh."`
`"Because...your eyes are whispering at me to apologize.`
` ...But I had no connection with you six years ago, and it looks like you acknowledge that too."`
`"......Is that true?`
` ...Is it really not a problem between me and you...?"`
`"......I already said it wasn't.`
` No problem between me and you has anything to do with this."`
`"But still, ...your eyes are telling me differently.`
` ......So I don't even have a clue."`
`"......Can you say it in red?`
` Can you proclaim that the sin you're telling me to remember isn't something between you and me?"`
`"............`
`...Very well."`
`#ff0000The sin I am now demanding that you remember is not between Ushiromiya Battler and Beatrice.#ffffff`
`"......Then...why are you looking at me with those eyes...?"`
`"I don't know.`
` ......I am simply gazing at you blankly.`
` If it feels that way to you, `
`...perhaps there's something making you feel that way."`
`".........`
`......What kind of sin are you saying I have?"`
`"#ff0000Ushiromiya Battler has a sin#ffffff."`
`"...And I'm asking you what kind.`
` I'll bet it's just some trivial sin, like hitting someone or tricking someone."`
`"#ff0000Because of your sin, people die.#ffffff"`
`"L-Liar...!`
` I've never killed anyone...!!`
` Then say it!`
` Who did I kill?!`
` When? Who? How?!"`
`"#ff0000Due to your sin, a great many humans of this island die.`
` No one escapes, all die.#ffffff"`
`"...Wh-Whaaaaat?!?!`
` Wh-What kind of incomprehensible thing are you saying?!`
` Are you saying I killed everyone?!`
` I'm a killer?!"`
`"It doesn't mean you carried it out directly.`
` ......However, because you committed a sin, from an imperfection in the cogs that stretch back a full six years, a distortion was created,`
` ...and tonight, this many lives are lost.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~You are one of the causes of this tragedy~ib~."`
`"...Qu-Quit messing around!!`
` I'm the cause?!`
` Then what?!`
` Are you saying 13 people died because I abandoned the Ushiromiya register six years ago?!`
` Are you saying that 13 people died because I came back to the Ushiromiya family after six years?!"`
`"Don't fuck with me, give it a rest!!!`
` For these six years, I've been the man farthest from the Ushiromiya family, right?!`
` How could I have influenced anything in any way?!"`
`"It's not like I came to the family conference because I wanted to, right?!`
` I'd returned to my family after six years, so to make up for that lost time,`
` I came to Rokkenjima reluctantly...!!`
` It's not like I had some duty to come here today!"`
`"I came back, and because of that, a massacre occurred?`
` Then what?!`
` Are you saying that if I hadn't come back, no one would've had to die?!`
` Say it in red!!`
` Can you say in red that, if I hadn't come back, this massacre crime wouldn't have occurred?!`
` ...There's no way you can say it, because you're the culprit for everything!!"`
`"Repeat it!!`
` 'If Ushiromiya Battler hadn't returned to Rokkenjima, this crime wouldn't have occurred'.`
` If you can say it, try saying it...!!`
` ...Can't do it, can you?`
` You can't say it! The culprit is you, not me!!`
` Don't try to rub that responsibility off onto meeeeeeee!!!"`
`"............"`
`"...Answer in red!!`
` Try to repeat it...!!`
` You can't!`
` My existence has nothing to do with the crime."`
`"Quit saying incomprehensible stuff and trying to confuse meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`I began to remember the coldness of the raindrops that kept pounding down.`
`...The rain earlier had just hurt,`
` ...but now I felt a tormenting cold from those raindrops...`
`"............`
`...Is there nothing that you remember?"`
`"......Sorry.`
` I don't even have a clue."`
`"............"`
`"...Hey.`
` ...I'm starting to get a little pissed off.`
` ...If there's something you wanna say, then say it.`
` If you have a grudge against me. you just have to say it out loud.`
` ...Don't do it in such a dirty way, forcing me to remember."`
`"......I'll ask one more time.`
` ...Can you remember any sin?"`
`"No!!`
` I can't remember anything...!!"`
`"......So, `
`...he says that he can remember...nothing."`
`With this, are your regrets at an end...?`
`"............`
`......I-Indeed..."`
`Even a hopeless bet can leave behind regrets if you do not take it.`
`...That's enough.`
`The betting itself has meaning.`
`"......That may be true.`
` ...In that case, this is...`
`the end of my regrets...and my game."`
`What will you do...?`
`"...Who knows.`
` ......I'm not interested at all anymore.`
` ...Sorry, but I wish to leave the game board now."`
`............`
`...I see.`
` ...I understand.`
`"I will take over for the rest of the game.`
` ......You may rest."`
`"...Indeed.`
` ........."`
`"All that remains, I will finish.`
` ......You may forget everything and bury your head in your pillow.`
` A feather futon should gently protect you from everything."`
`"......I'll be counting on you...to finish up the rest."`
`"Leave it to me.`
` ...Leave everything else to me...and sleep."`
`The witch who had questioned Battler hid herself,`
` and the other witch, who had appeared from behind, remained.`
`She certainly was identical, the same witch,`
` ......but her expression was somehow indifferent and ice-cold,`
` ...completely removed from the one who, despite seeming drunk up until then, had been in high spirits.`
`"......Hey!!`
` Are you listening?!`
` Isn't this enough for that test thing?!`
` I don't care whether I passed or failed!`
` I won't be satisfied until I can bash your face!!`
` Come down here!!`
` Or else open this door...!!"`
`The witch did not answer.`
`Her eyes were as ice-cold as Battler's shoulders.`
`...She was now clearly a different person since the time she'd first appeared on that balcony.`
`The witch gazed into my eyes...and gave two small shakes of the head.`
`Even without words, I was able to gather that she was expressing some kind of disappointment...`
`Without saying anything, the witch turned on her heels.`
`After that, only Battler remained, the cold rain still beating down on him......`
`The study was in the middle of a lively party.`
`It seemed that Gaap was making fun of Virgilia, having tripped her up in some stupid way.`
`...They were spitting 'Lialialia' and 'Gapgapgap' at each other.`
`With this as a sideshow, Kinzo and Ronove had opened a new bottle.`
`"Oh, you're back.`
` How were the results of Battler's test?!`
` Maria's test got passing marks with no complaints, you see?`
` I've despised her as a little girl, little girl,`
` but see, but see, why, why, oh my, oh my, not bad, not bad!`
` Wahhahhahhahhahha!!"`
`It seemed like Kinzo was dead drunk.`
`Facing Beato, who had returned, he laughed with the same level of tension as the time they'd left for the tests.`
`...However, Ronove and Virgilia instantly noticed the change in enthusiasm.`
`Gaap also froze her expression and went silent.`
`"Wahhahahahahahhahha, what is it, Beatrice, my beloved witch?`
` Not enough to drink? Not enough on the side?`
` Let's pour it all over a cow or something and roast it whole, ooh, not bad!"`
`"Ronove, prepare one right away!`
` Beatrice, let's leave the results of Battler's test for later.`
` Why don't we have a toast with spare rib first, uwahhahhahhahhahha!!"`
`".........Roast yourself whole."`
`"-hahhahhahha, `
`...what?"`
`The witch, who had spoken bluntly, coldly passed by Kinzo's side as he doubled over laughing in a great mood.`
`...Then, behind the witch's back, `
`......the old summoner's body suddenly went up in flames...`
`"Gyaaaaaahhh!!!!`
` Gwohh, gah, ...gyah, ......w...h...y......?!"`
`As crimson flames spat from his eyes, mouth, nose, ...every hole on his body, Kinzo rolled around.`
`...Even though it was a terrible hellfire, it didn't burn anything except Kinzo.`
`Kinzo didn't have a clue what was going on.`
`...Unable to understand why Beatrice, who had been in such a good mood,`
` had suddenly turned so cold, he rolled around...`
`The dancing silhouettes of the witch and demons created by that massive rolling torch...`
`looked like a group of excited spectators around a burning at the stake.`
`However, the eyes of the demons who watched over it were indifferent...`
`When Kinzo finally stopped moving, the fire disappeared, leaving a pitch-black corpse.`
`The inside of the room was commanded by the stillness of the sound of the rain...`
`"...What has happened, Milady?"`
`"I've gotten over...my excitement.`
` ......Clean up those bothersome cinders."`
`Beatrice's expression...was unbelievably indifferent.`
`...There was an iciness that might easily bring the others to the same fate as Kinzo if they annoyed her.`
`"......Y-Yes.`
` I will clean it up..."`
`Gaap made a jet-black pitfall swallow up Kinzo's cinders.`
`...If she hadn't carried that out quickly, Gaap might also have been burned.`
` You could even feel that thirst for blood.`
`No, a thirst for blood probably isn't the best way to describe it.`
`...Just like humans don't have any particular emotion when they step on an ant while they're walking...`
`...That was how much, unconsciously and mercilessly, Beato was now filled with a brutal emptiness that wouldn't hesitate at burying a passerby...`
`"...Wh-What is it, Beato?"`
`"I don't want to answer.`
` .........No, even answering is too much of a pain to do now."`
`"...What is it? This isn't like you.`
` ...Did something happen?`
` Did Battler say someth-`
`......ack, gah, gyah-"`
`Beatrice didn't even answer.`
` It seemed that she even ignored it.`
`But there was a change in Gaap.`
`From her feet, a creaking, cracking sound rose, like thin ice breaking,`
` ...and in an instant, turned Gaap into a glass sculpture.`
`"...G-Gaap..."`
`"......Disappear for a while.`
` I'm in a very bad mood."`
`Beatrice spoke that...`
`in a truly cold voice, which could freeze the heart just by hearing it.`
`"...Certainly.`
` Then, please allow us to retire.`
` ......If you need anything, call at any time."`
`After bowing, Ronove turned into a cloud of gold butterflies and hid himself.`
`After turning Gaap, who had become a sculpture, into a cloud of gold butterflies, `
`Virgilia also turned into a cloud, which mixed in with the others and disappeared.`
`......In the study made untidy by drinking,`
` ...Beatrice stood still, alone.`
`Since the time she had returned, her expression hadn't changed in the slightest...`
`...However, when she saw the fallen empty wine bottles and scattered cheese plates,`
` her brow furrowed, and she looked a bit displeased.`
`And when she whispered 'disappear', in that instant, the room was cleaned up in a flash, as though nothing had happened.`
`The reception chairs were neatly arranged, and there was no wine or cheese.`
`There were no stains or scattered trash either.`
`...To the contrary, even the air had frozen over,`
` and, enough to make one doubt whether a large number of noisy people really had been in this room until a short while ago, `
`......the study had returned to silence.`
`......In that silent, ...frigid study where even the air had frozen,`
` Beatrice stood still...`
`Then, she called, muttering.`
`".........Battler,`
` are you there?"`
`"...I've been here for a while.`
` ......What the hell's going on with you?`
` You've been strange since a short while ago."`
`"Do I seem strange?`
` My apologies."`
`"......Even though you were drinking so happily with that damn geezer, you suddenly burned him up,`
` and your demoness friend is a glass sculpture.`
` ...When you told the demon butler and your teacher to leave, they disappeared right away at your words.`
` ...Just how fickle and selfish are you?"`
`"Battler, I'm done."`
`"Done with what?"`
`"......I've grown bored of this."`
`"Huh?`
` ......That's...well...you were the one who started this game.`
` Heh, if you've had enough, that's great for me.`
` So basically, you're giving up?"`
`"I am not giving up.`
` I am simply ending it.`
` No, I won't even end it.`
` I am just abandoning this game for all eternity."`
`"Doesn't that mean you're giving up?`
` ...Nah, the words 'got bored of it and threw it away' fit you perfectly."`
`"That is correct.`
` I grew bored of it...and am throwing it away.`
` I don't care what happens next.`
` It can remain abandoned and gather dust as much as you like."`
`".........`
`...What's going on with you?`
` You've been kinda hard to deal with since a short while ago."`
`"...Are these still the aftereffects of that incomprehensible test from earlier?`
` If you've got a grudge, all you have to do is say so clearly.`
` You said in red that it has nothing to do with you, but that's gotta be a play on words, right?`
` It's written all over your face.`
` You have a grudge against me."`
`"How many times will I have to say I have no grudge against you before you'll understand?`
` At the time you committed your sin, I did not exist."`
`As Beato spoke with an offended expression, her face twisted to look even more displeased.`
`Fickle.`
` Inconsistent.`
` Moody.`
` Temperamental.`
` ...Selfish and simple-minded and cruel.`
`But even so, she hadn't shown an expression as strange as this even once until now...`
`"......Well, you were the one who provoked me into this game.`
` I'm a bit let down that it wasn't resolved, but feel free to invite me again if you feel like it."`
`"But when that happens, allow me to politely refuse, okay?`
` Heheheh."`
`He intentionally spoke in a mocking tone, but Beato showed no reaction.`
`...Battler hung his head and clicked his tongue...`
`"We've circled around October 4 and 5 over and over again, but I've finally had just about enough of this role.`
` ...This way, the boat will come tomorrow."`
`"...That's right, and then the seagulls will return to the harbor.`
` ...I'll finally be able to hear Rokkenjima's signature nya-nya- cries.`
` After all, maybe because of the weather, they weren't there at all when I came to the island."`
`"......When the seagulls cry, everything will end, I guess.`
` All done, the end.`
` What a relief."`
`"......Exactly what is it that you're misunderstanding?"`
`"Hmm?`
` What'd you say?"`
`"......I said that nothing would end.`
` With this, everything will be abandoned.`
` The game will be forgotten, and the pieces on the board will be abandoned as they lay.`
` There will be no advancing or returning, no taking and being taken.`
` No victory, no defeat, not even a tie.`
` Just abandoned."`
`"......Doesn't that mean it's over?"`
`"Wrong.`
` On my turn, the game will stop for all eternity.`
` Your turn will not come.`
` So there will be no victory nor defeat nor a tie."`
`"......In the past, I couldn't let you do that.`
` After all, one of my goals was winning against you.`
` However, I've lost interest.`
` So there is no longer any point in making moves any longer."`
`"......What do you mean...by my turn not coming...?"`
`I'd thought that Beato getting tired of the game meant I'd be released...and that I'd be able to escape Rokkenjima.`
`But for some reason, Beato's repeated words...about the difference between abandoning the game and settling it...`
`caught my attention...`
`......Just what is it she's been saying, ...and why the bad mood...?`
`At that time, I suddenly heard a voice from behind me.`
`When I turned around, ...there was someone I thought I might, or might not, remember from somewhere...`
`...A mysterious girl, with no light in her eyes, was standing there.`
`"......What this kid's saying goes something like this.`
` ...She means putting the lid on this game and leaving the pieces as they are.`
` The game will be locked away for all eternity, without ending."`
`"The only way for you to return to your original world is to win against Beato.`
` ......So, if Beato abandons the game, `
`...get it?"`
`Suddenly, in a different place...was a girl wearing a bright pink dress.`
`...I had a feeling I'd met her somewhere too, but I couldn't remember.`
`More important was the meaning of her words.`
`...If the game is abandoned, then...huh?`
`"......That's right.`
` A match won't be resolved unless enemies and allies meet.`
` ......It would mean that you'd never be able to win and escape from this world for all eternity."`
`"What it comes down to, I guess, ...is something like taking the key to the cage that you're locked in,`
` fastening it to the collar of a pigeon or something, and letting it fly."`
`"......This isn't funny, Beato.`
` We didn't come this far to watch such a boring game.`
` Calling it a day like this is no joke."`
`"......I agree with Lambda.`
` I came here to make Battler win and to make you writhe in defeat.`
` I still haven't achieved that goal.`
` ...I won't stand for you abandoning the game at a time like this and running away."`
`"I acknowledge that it would mean the curtain call for a game that disappoints you Ladies.`
` ...However, I, the host of this tea party, am fickle.`
` Once it's lost its fun, I know no way of entertaining.`
` ...I believe that's been my witch-like way of doing things from the very beginning.`
` There are no problems, yes...?"`
`".........`
`...Certainly.`
` I won't go against your creed."`
`"I won't accept it...`
` ...Quit fooling around, how much do you think I've supported you...?`
` You think I'd be okay with that after all this preparation?`
` Don't mess with me...!!"`
`"I am saying that I have tired of it.`
` Nothing more, nothing less."`
`"That's not gonna fly...`
` We'll have you continue this game.`
` You wanna win against Battler, right?`
` You wanna win and make him surrender, right?!`
` You're almost there, aren't you?!`
` Am I right?!"`
`"......D-Don't ask me that.`
` ...But...I have an opinion too.`
` Let me say it."`
`"......What?"`
`"This is a fight you picked.`
` I'm prepared to settle this once and for all.`
` ...I've come close to surrendering many times, `
`but I've never had any intention of escaping partway through, leaving the match undecided."`
`"...Since I'm here, showing the will to fight,`
` ...you'd better not run away, Beatrice."`
`"......I agree.`
` Getting Battler involved and then leaving without giving him victory or defeat is just too irresponsible."`
`Suddenly, even Gretel was there.`
`...And everyone was calling Beato irresponsible.`
`"Hoh.`
` ...It seems I'm mostly being called irresponsible because Battler will, as my opponent, be stuck.`
` ......In that case, Battler,`
` will you step down from being an opponent, as I shall?`
` That way, I will have done nothing worthy of criticism."`
`"If I step down, will I be able to leave Rokkenjima...?"`
`"There's no chance you'll be able to leave.`
` Just be covered in dust and let it pile up on your shoulders."`
`"......Quit fooling around.`
` What an irresponsible person.`
` You've killed such a large number of people.`
` On top of that, using a witch's power, you've done it over and over.`
` Killing in gruesome ways!`
` ......I definitely won't let you escape without taking responsibility...!"`
`"Responsibility.`
` ...Hoh, what is it I should do to take this so-called responsibility?"`
`"Fight until a resolution is reached.`
` Battler will sit in the chair across from you, never giving up and fighting until he beats you.`
` So you too, fight until you're defeated.`
` If you don't like that, try and defeat Battler...!!"`
`"I won't forgive you...if you leave everything unresolved and abandon Battler in this chair, `
`...locking him up and never letting him return...`
` ......I won't forgive you...!!"`
`"...Gretel."`
`To be perfectly honest,`
` I didn't really understand from what standpoint Gretel was trying to save me.`
`...But in her words, `
`I could feel a strong determination to save me from this insane game world no matter what.`
`So, I responded in kind.`
`"Beato,`
` face me."`
`"........."`
`"I am here.`
` Across from you, in the seat of your rival.`
` ...Get it?`
` As long as I continue to sit here,`
` I won't allow you to escape.`
` ...So don't escape. Fight."`
`"Isn't this a fight you started?`
` You did all that crap over and over, making a complete mess of things!`
` How could I let you end it because you're tired, after all this time?!!`
` I am your opponent!!`
` As long as I'm here,`
` I won't let you escape!!"`
`"Are you listening, you irresponsible witch?!`
` Try saying somethiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing!!!"`
`After I yelled at her, ...Beato went silent for a while.`
`Whether my words had reached her, or whether she was thinking about something completely different, ...I couldn't tell.`
`But for a while, she was silent,`
` ...gazing at me with an expression I could read no emotion from,`
` ...and when she realized that I'd noticed, she averted her gaze.`
`Then, she turned her back to me...and said this...`
`"So, since Battler will not quit as my opponent, ...the Ladies are saying that my abandonment of this game will not be acknowledged.`
` ......In that case, let's ask.`
` Let's see if the man over there was qualified to be my opponent in the first place."`
`"......Qualified?"`
`"...Probably has something to do with that test or whatever just now."`
`"......What are you planning to do...?"`
`"...D-Don't tell me you're..."`
`"I will now determine whether or not you are qualified to be my opponent.`
` ......Ready, Battler?`
` If those qualifications are acknowledged, I will stay in my seat and continue the game.`
` And I shall promise to fight for all eternity until the outcome is decided."`
`"Heh!`
` I was ready for that from the beginning."`
`"......However,`
` if you are not qualified,`
` ...you must disappear.`
` If the opponent disappears, there is no game.`
` I can leave this place openly.`
` ......Are the Ladies satisfied?`
` Interruptions will not be necessary."`
`"............`
`...Go ahead, do as you like."`
`"......B-Battler...`
` You...make sure you answer well..."`
`"The very reason I'm here is because I'm qualified, right?`
` Heh, there's nothing to be scared of...!"`
`"......`
`......Y-You couldn't be..."`
`Gretel grew suddenly pale.`
`...I'd thought her to be the calm, collected type, so that expression surprised me.`
`"...Well then, Battler.`
` I shall have you repeat it in red."`
`"Y-You're telling me to repeat something?`
` Heheh, ...damn you, stealing my signature move.`
` ...But can I use the red truth too?`
` How...?"`
`"......I-If you wish for it to be that way, you can do it.`
` It's easy."`
`"#ff0000My name is Ushiromiya Battler#ffffff.`
` ...W-Whoa, pretty cool."`
`"Stop it!!`
` I know what you're after...!!`
` But stop that!`
` He's...!!"`
`When Gretel yelled, Beato glared at her.`
`Then, her form was wiped away in an instant.`
`"Shut up.`
` Leave your seat for a while.`
` You too, Ladies.`
` If you interfere, I will not hold back."`
`"......We won't get in the way.`
` Go ahead, do as you like."`
`"B-Bern, this is bad!!`
` She's trying to erase Battler!!"`
`"...What's that...?`
` What's...she planning...?"`
`"Well then, I shall question your qualifications.`
` ......Interesting.`
` Attack and defense are reversed from a normal game.`
` This is a very precious experience, coming at the very, very end.`
` ......Ready? Listen carefully.`
` I will speak with the red first."`
`'!s0`
`#ff0000And I opened this game in order to fight Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler.#ffffff`
`"...I know that.`
` So what?"`
`"Repeat it.`
` ......'Ushiromiya Battler's mother is Ushiromiya Asumu'."`
`"What?!`
` ...Why's Mom's name popping up all of a sudden...?"`
`"I do not require chatter.`
` Just repeat it in red."`
`Beato urged me with the same indifferent tone.`
`...But I don't have a clue what she's trying to do.`
`...I have absolutely nothing to feel guilty for that would trouble me if thrown in my face, and there's nothing that I'm hiding.`
`There's nothing that could trouble me by demanding that I repeat it.`
`...So, why do something like this...?`
`"Sure, I'll repeat it.`
` #ff0000Ushiromiya Battler's mother is Ushiromiya Asumu.#ffffff`
` ...The red sure is convenient.`
` No need to bother myself with bringing a copy of the family register."`
`"Idle chatter is unnecessary.`
` Let's continue.`
` 'Your name is Ushiromiya Battler'."`
`"...Sure.`
` #ff0000My name is Ushiromiya Battler#ffffff."`
`"It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that Ushiromiya Battler was born."`
`"#ff0000It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that Ushiromiya Battler was born.#ffffff"`
`"It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that you were born."`
`'!s1`
`...`
`...nguh, `
`......?!`
` ...?!?!"`
`At that time, my throat suddenly closed...`
`I was rapidly assaulted with a choking suffocation.`
`......Wh-What's going on...?`
` ...O-One more time...`
`"It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born...`
` ...Damn, `
`it was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born...`
` ......Wh-What the hell?`
` Even though I was doing it so easily a second ago, I suddenly stopped being able to get the red to work...?!"`
`".........Do you refuse to repeat it?"`
`"I'm not refusing anything...!!`
` It's not working for some reason...!!`
` It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born...!!`
` Why?!`
` Dammit, why can't I use the red?!`
` What the hell?!?!"`
`"......Nngg..."`
`"........."`
`My Mom is Ushiromiya Asumu, right?!`
` Why can't I say that fact in red?!`
` What's going on...?!`
` Th-This is...gghh-!!`
`"If you try to forcefully speak red that cannot be spoken, you choke.`
` There is no need to strain yourself.`
` ......Allow me to use the aforementioned fact to press you in blue.`
` ...Do you remember?`
` The blue is used to proclaim a theory for the opponent to deny.`
` They are then burdened with the responsibility of denying that in red, and if they do not, it becomes your victory.`
` ......Then let us begin."`
`#5decffDue to my previous demand to repeat and your subsequent refusal, `
`I proclaim that you are not qualified to be my opponent.#ffffff`
`#5decffAfter all, Beatrice opened this game...`
`in order to fight with 'Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler'.#ffffff`
`#5decffThis gave you the responsibility, as my opponent, `
`to declare in red that you are 'Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler'.#ffffff`
`#5decffYou have refused to repeat that.#ffffff`
`#5decffThis means the loss of your qualifications.#ffffff`
`"...D-Deny something about that in red...`
` ...Quickly!!"`
`"S-Sure...`
` I-`
`#ff0000I am Ushiromiya Battler#ffffff...!`
` Because I can say that in red, I should be your opponent!!"`
`"It may be a fact that you have the name Ushiromiya Battler.`
` However, `
`#5decffpeople's names are not exclusive.#ffffff`
` #5decffThere is a possibility that multiple humans have the name Ushiromiya Battler.#ffffff"`
`"#5decffIn short, this is what it means.#ffffff`
` #5decff...You are a different person with the same first and last names as Ushiromiya Asumu's son, Ushiromiya Battler.#ffffff"`
`"...Wh-What'd you say...?!!`
` Don't be so stupiiiiiiiiid!!`
` I'm Mom's child!!`
` Ushiromiya Asumu's child!!`
` `
`#ff0000It was from Ushiro`
`#ffffffmiya Asumu that...`
`ah, `
`ngagh, `
`...nnnggghh...!!!`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, but_4e825:`
`"Damn!!`
` Why?!`
` Why can't I say that I was born from my Mom?!`
` How could something so stupid be true?"`
`"No need to suffer.`
` I will not toy with you.`
` ...This is checkmate.`
` #ff0000You are not Ushiromiya Asumu's son#ffffff."`
`......Wha......`
`"You're...`
`kidding...me......"`
`"Who are you?`
` What person calling themselves Ushiromiya Battler?"`
`"W-Wait a second...`
` ...I am...Ushiromiya Battler...`
` It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born, and I'm Dad and Mom's son...!"`
`"No.`
` There is no way that you're my opponent, Ushiromiya Battler.`
` With this as proof."`
`"Proof, you say?!"`
`"You do not know of that sin six years ago."`
`"......Uh, `
`......th-that's......"`
`"No, the true Ushiromiya Battler would not have committed a sin.`
` But a sin did occur in the end, that span of six years became a blank space,`
` and a man who knew nothing of that time took on the name Ushiromiya Battler and appeared on Rokkenjima.`
` ......That truth...goes like this."`
`Six years ago, ...my opponent, the true Ushiromiya Battler, was already dead.`
`You were part of a plot by Rudolf having something to do with distribution of the inheritance, `
`...a body double set up in Ushiromiya Battler's place.`
`"...H-How could something that stupid be true......?`
` ......That's...so...ridiculous......"`
`"...B-Battler...!`
` Get ahold of yourself...!!"`
`"............Well, `
`...if he can't counter back, there's nothing more to do.`
` ...Battler did not possess that qualification.`
` That's how it is."`
`"A-Are you okay with that, Bern?!`
` If you accept that, you'll lose too, right?!"`
`"Won't you win?`
` ...Why are you taking Battler's side...?"`
`"...N-Nnnn..."`
`"What a shame, Battler.`
` ......What a real shame that you didn't have the qualifications to be Beatrice's opponent.`
` I was careless myself,`
` betting on an unqualified piece.`
` ......It's my utter defeat, Beatrice."`
`"...There is no victory or defeat.`
` The opponent will simply disappear.`
` Or perhaps I should say that he was never there to begin with."`
`"But then, ...who......am I...?`
` Am I...not Dad and Mom's kid...?!`
` Who am I...? What am I...?`
` ......If I'm not Mom's kid, ...then what, are you saying I'm a kid they picked up somewhere, like a stray cat?!"`
`"If that is the case, it would mean that you do not share Kinzo's blood.`
` Either way, you are not qualified to compete in this game."`
`'!s1`
`......you're kidding me......"`
`"Enough.`
` ...From the very beginning, I was faintly aware of the possibility that you weren't Ushiromiya Battler.`
` ...So, I had to question you.`
` I had to ask about something the real Battler would have known."`
`"......What a shame.`
` I even bet on the one-in-a-quadrillion chance of a miracle...`
`that you might really be Ushiromiya Battler.`
` But it seems you really are a different person with the same first and last names."`
`"......Nnng, ...nnnnn......"`
`Bit by bit, ...Battler's form began to be clouded in darkness...`
`No, maybe it was the other way around.`
`...The whole world was clouded in darkness, leaving only Battler...`
`Battler was down on all fours, hanging his head and repeatedly questioning himself.`
`...However, he was not given an answer...`
`In the world stained with darkness, Beato spoke something and Lambdadelta ran up to him, yelling something very quickly,`
` but it already seemed very far away, and it didn't reach Battler's ears...`
`'!s0`
`...not knowing who he himself was, `
`...erased...`
`himself......`
`"Battleeeeeeeeeeeeer, ...aahhh......"`
`"Now my opponent has disappeared.`
` ...Well then, if you'll excuse me.`
` And Ladies, you should get ready for your journey.`
` No more festivities have been prepared for in my territory.`
` It was good seeing you.`
` ...Goodbye."`
`Without saying anything more,`
` she clouded her own form in darkness as well...and disappeared...`
`"......A-Are you...okay with this?!`
` Battler...d-disappeared, right?!`
` I know how much you hate losing. Are you really okay with this?!"`
`".........Weren't you betting on my defeat?`
` Good for you then.`
` Congratulations, Lambda.`
` Let's meet again in some other world, okay?"`
`"Well, this is a world of endless Fragments.`
` The chances of us having some connection again somewhere are probably less than one in a quadrillion.`
` ......Anyway, it was fun.`
` Bye-bye."`
`"Ah, ...wait up, Bern...!!!"`
`Chasing after Bernkastel, who had disappeared first, Lambdadelta disappeared as well...`
`After that, everyone was gone, ......and the study was now completely empty.`
`It returned to silence, almost as though no one had been there from the outset.`
`...No one was here in the first place.`
`The silent study spoke that wordlessly, and the sound of the wind and rain began to fill the room bit by bit...`
`In a world where everything had sunk into darkness, Beato questioned herself.`
`"...As I thought, ......from the very beginning, magic should only have been used within Mariage Sorcière."`
`"......Seems so.`
` ...I also...`
`...thought that with Ange."`
`"The witches' alliance is you and I.`
` It started with those two.`
` ...Including other people was our first mistake..."`
`"......It's just so fun.`
` ...We wanted to add someone close to us into that circle."`
`"And we wished that the witches' alliance would get really large,`
` that everyone would be able to use fun magic together, and that we'd all be happy."`
`"However, ......only you and I were able to understand magic after all."`
`"We are...the only two witches in this world, who were brought together by a miracle.`
` ......And now, as long as I have Beato, I don't need anyone else."`
`"......Me too.`
` As long as you are here, I don't need anyone else anymore."`
`"In the very first moment that Mariage Sorcière was formed, `
`...it was already complete."`
`".........That is...so.`
` That is truly so..."`
`It was once a witches' alliance to make everyone happy together with magic.`
`...I wonder when it got this screwed up?`
`What did I want to do when I started this game?`
` ...I can't really remember even that.`
`No, I may remember,`
` ...but that's a feeling I now wish to throw away to the far side of oblivion.`
`"......It's okay.`
` Why not forget everything?`
` Let's have a Mariage Sorcière for just the two of us.`
` ...We'll acknowledge each other.`
` And no one will hurt us.`
` So we won't be hurt. We won't cry.`
` Let's forget everything.`
` ......Hey, Beato.`
` ...We are...eternal..."`
`"............Maria...`
`......uuuuuuuu, ......uuuuuuuuuuuuu...!!"`
`"Amakusa, could you turn that off?"`
`"Whoops, my bad.`
` You don't like M. Zakky?"`
`"I'm just not in the mood."`
`Amakusa turned the radio off.`
`The world of cheery sounds was immediately swallowed up by the roar of the sea...`
`and blotted out by the ocean's gray...`
`"......Can you see it?`
` Over there's where the harbor was at the time."`
`"............"`
`The boat captain pointed, but I couldn't really recall that scene of 12 years ago.`
`...I thought I'd surely be able to immediately remember how things had been at the time,`
` ...but no memories came back to me.`
`After that incident, the island was sealed off and left to the wild.`
`...I couldn't satisfy myself with the thought that this was just inevitable, and it felt sad and painful for some reason.`
`......Ah, but I at least remember one thing.`
`You might say that it'd probably be the same anywhere on the sea, ...but I remember at least one thing.`
`The cries...`
`of the seagulls.`
`I do remember...those.`
`...When I was young, I rarely went to the ocean.`
`...So everything that symbolized the ocean meant Rokkenjima and a family gathering to me.`
`In short, ...it was a symbol for the happiness of going out with my family.`
`However, at this point in time, it seems doubtful whether that even was happiness.`
`In my younger days, the trip had felt like a relaxed family vacation, but considering my parents' situation at the time, `
`it was surely a very difficult trip to handle, with the distribution of the inheritance filling the place with the smell of gunpowder.`
`I can remember giggling all over the place, completely ignorant of my parents' feelings...`
`"...Rokkenjima, huh?`
` The place of all beginnings, and the end of the line for all journeys."`
`Amakusa, in an attempt to speak for my innermost feelings, tried to sound cool.`
`The boat slowly rounded the island.`
`...I hoped that viewing it at a different angle might bring back my memories of the island's silhouette at the time just a little,`
` but in the end, even when that inlet was hidden completely by cliffs, I wasn't able to remember anything...`
`"...Captain, please tell me...`
`about that other harbor you mentioned."`
`"Sure.`
` ......Rokkenjima supposedly has only one harbor.`
` But that's only for public appearances."`
`"On the back of the island, there's another hidden harbor.`
` ......Like Rokkenjima itself.`
` It has a second face, which no one knows about..."`
`"......Rokkenjima is an island owned by the Ushiromiya family.`
`"So this island...has two harbors and two mansions.`
` He sure spent a lot just to keep a mistress."`
`"Who knew about this other harbor...?"`
`"Very few.`
` Kinzo-san, the butler Genji-san.`
` Those of us involved with the boats,`
` and a very small number of the oldest servants.`
` ...Both the previous owner of the Nanjo clinic and that Kumasawa baa-san knew.`
` Naming them off like this makes it sound like there were quite a few, but basically, there was a small number of people who knew."`
`"Please...tell me about that other mansion."`
`"...I was only told that there was a mansion called Kuwadorian.`
` Since I wasn't allowed to leave the boat, I never saw it, not even once."`
`"So it was far enough away that you couldn't see it from the harbor?"`
`"I don't know.`
` ...But it was a hidden mansion, after all.`
` It was probably built where you couldn't see it from the outside.`
` ...Anyway, Kuwadorian was the biggest secret of that island."`
`"There's a theory that Beatrice lived in Kuwadorian, or else was confined there.`
` What do you think, Captain?"`
`"...I did sometimes carry miscellaneous goods to Kuwadorian.`
` And that included a lot of stuff that only women would use, and expensive stuff at that.`
` ...I'm also convinced that theory is true."`
`"So does that mean you never saw Beatrice directly, Captain?"`
`"Nope.`
` Came and went for about 20 years, and I never saw her once."`
`"Twenty years...!`
` Whew, that means she was at least 20+.`
` Look's like she wasn't some mademoiselle."`
`"But one day, *bang*, all coming and going to and from Kuwadorian suddenly stopped.`
` That was about 30 years ago, `
`...so around Showa 43 (1968), I think."`
`"*bang*?`
` You mean suddenly?"`
`"...We came to the Hidden Side on a set schedule to carry food and trash back and forth.`
` ...Ah, right, the Hidden Side's what we called the harbor linked to Kuwadorian."`
`"I get it.`
` ...So then?"`
`"One day, we got an urgent message from Genji-san.`
` He said that until we heard differently, there was no need for us to go to the Hidden Side anymore."`
`"And did you hear differently?"`
`"Not really.`
` Long story short, one day, I was suddenly told that they wouldn't need regular service to the Hidden Side anymore...and that I didn't have to take food there either.`
` ...At first, I thought I was being fired.`
` But I quickly figured it out.`
` ...Going by the reactions of the servants who knew of Kuwadorian, I managed to guess somehow."`
`"......Beatrice died, and there was no longer any need to take food or people to care for her?"`
`"That's what I think.`
` From that point on, I was never told to take a boat to the Hidden Side.`
` However, after that, Genji-san came to see me face to face and got pushy, `
`strongly urging me never to speak of anything related to the Hidden Side until I died."`
`"So, if that hidden mansion was abandoned for 20 whole years, `
`......why was Aunt Eva there?"`
`On that day 12 years ago...`
`...Ushiromiya Eva somehow escaped harm alone in a hidden mansion 2 kilometers away from the mansion.`
`Why was she in a hidden mansion that had been forgotten for 20 years......?`
`"I saw on the talk shows.`
` Even I don't have a clue what happened.`
` Not once did I guide Eva-san to the Hidden Side.`
` I have no idea how or why she knew about or reached Kuwadorian."`
`"I wonder if it was possible to reach this Hidden Kuwadorian by land."`
`"...If, as we heard, the forest was dense and uncultivated,`
` I seriously doubt a well-dressed lady person'd be able to bush-crash it."`
`"So what about by sea?`
` Maybe there was a motorboat or something."`
`"Are you kidding?`
` That two-nighter typhoon was awful.`
` No way you could'a used a boat."`
`"So what if...there was an underground passage or something between the mansion and Kuwadorian.`
` Wouldn't it have been a pain to have to charter a boat each time he wanted to visit his mistress's house...?"`
`"You mean a tunnel long enough to connect mansions on opposite sides of a 2 kilometer island like Rokkenjima...?"`
`"...Well, I'd like to laugh at the thought, but this rich guy made a whole hidden mansion for his mistress.`
` Guess I can't deny the possibility.`
` ...What do you think, Captain?"`
`"I'm a man of the sea.`
` I don't know about holes.`
` But the Japanese military dug a 25 kilometer tunnel on Iwo Jima.`
` Wouldn't surprise me if 'that' Kinzo-san could dig at least 2 kilometers."`
`".........There really is something wrong with this island.`
` Even now, not one of us really knows a thing about it."`
`The boat reached the shore.`
`They would have to walk a short ways to reach the mansion.`
`"...I'll wait here.`
` The mansion's that way.`
` The path from back then's probably still there, but I'll bet it's covered with plants.`
` Make sure you don't get lost."`
`"Right, let's go."`
`"Thanks for everything, Amakusa.`
` You wait here too."`
`"......Well, I had a feeling you'd say that."`
`"I'm just delivering something.`
` It'll be troublesome for them if you come too.`
` I imagine your toxin is strong."`
`"Toxin?`
` Oho."`
`"I'll be back soon.`
` Today, our main goal is Kuwadorian.`
` ...After I deliver this, I'll come right back."`
`Ange put on her knapsack, holding the flowers she would offer.`
`"Give her some space, young'un.`
` ...See you soon, little lady.`
` Your family's waiting for you."`
`I had never been on a road like this, but I had no trouble finding my way.`
`If I walked straight ahead, it would probably guide me to the final destination for everything.`
`It was true that the vegetation was incredibly thick, and if I didn't pay attention, I would lose track of the path.`
`...But the road that was left was much clearer than I'd guessed it would be.`
`Still, that didn't change the fact that it was a bad road.`
`...Contrary to the distance shown on the map, I was forced to walk a long way...`
`...The forest was deep and dark.`
`At the time, I had been threatened into staying away from the forest because a witch lived there.`
`Of course, that fear is gone now, ......but...I feel it.`
`Because I was me,`
` ...I could feel the presence, like an aura, of the Golden Witch, Beatrice...`
`Here and there were massive fallen lumps of rock along with overgrown trees and ivy.`
` ...And the voices of birds and bugs.`
`Yeah, I feel it.`
`......I feel...that the witch...is here...`
`Ahead, an ivy-covered construction site fence and warning sign stood.`
`'No entry, Tokyo Metropolis'.`
`That was written on it.`
`Yeah, that's right.`
` When you think 'Tokyo', you tend to think of a city,`
` but Rokkenjima is also located within the Tokyo Metropolis.`
`...Apologizing to the sign for my rude mistake, I climbed the fence.`
`When I crossed the steep slope beyond that, ......my field of vision rapidly expanded,`
` and a fresh sea breeze blew through my hair...`
`It was like the top of a little hill.`
`...Below me was a vast view of the island.`
`I could only see desolated forest and rock walls spread out below me.`
`...But I realized that the mansion was probably somewhere around there.`
`The steep downward slope beyond this hill had probably been caused by earth and rocks collapsing from 12 years of wind and rain.`
`It had become a slant filled with crags that you might even call gentle cliffs,`
` and it would be easy to tumble down, though it looked like climbing back would be pretty difficult.`
`......In any event, it seemed that proceeding any further would be impossible.`
`If I continued any further, I wouldn't be able to return.`
`In other words, ......this is...the border.`
`This place is 1986 and 1998.`
`And, it is that day and today.`
`The boundary between this world and nirvana.`
`"......This spot is...`
`this journey's final destination, it seems."`
`As the strong winds blew Mammon's and Sakutaro's hair, they looked down from the hilltop...`
`"...From here, I can't really tell.`
` Where's the mansion?`
` Let's get closer."`
`『Uryu, ...that's impossible.`
` We won't be able to come back.〝`
`...We won't be able...to come back.`
` ...Is that it?`
`I see.`
` ...This is 1998, `
`...and I am the Ushiromiya Ange who has been left all alone.`
`At first, this was a journey to die.`
`But not anymore.`
`It's become a journey to accomplish something...`
`"Yeah.`
` ...So, I'm sorry, you two.`
` Although, as I was back then on that day, I would've gone down that cliff without any hesitation."`
`"Come on, this is pretty lame for the skyscraper-jumping Ushiromiya Ange."`
`"Sorry."`
`『This place is as good as any.`
` ......After all, you can feel the wind of that day.〝`
`"......`
`...Was the wind...really like this?"`
`『Yeah.`
` Very soon, they will come.`
` .........Everyone.〝`
`Sakutaro said it as though it was completely natural.`
`...And...I believed it.`
`Dad.`
`Mom.`
`Onii-chan.`
`All of my relatives, and those fun servants.`
`And......Maria onee-chan.`
`"It's me.`
` ...It's Ange.`
` ......I've...come back."`
`When I started my journey to expose the past of 12 years ago, my goal had been abstract, and I hadn't understood.`
`But now, ...I have no doubts.`
`This journey...was induced by several thoughts and fates over 12 years.`
`A journey to reach an end for me, Ushiromiya Ange.`
`And, a journey reach an end as the last witch of Mariage Sorcière.`
`I came here as the last daughter of the Ushiromiya family...`
`and as the last witch...`
`"...Dad, Mom, Onii-chan.`
` ...Sorry.`
` Let me greet Maria onee-chan first."`
`A strong tailwind urged me on.`
`That tailwind took just my soul out from inside my body...to the vast forest beneath me.`
`And, though from here on I couldn't see, I believed that it flew me to the mansion on that day, to where everyone was, ...to where Maria onee-chan was.`
`And so, `
`...even though my body was on the top of a hill, a strong wind blowing against me,`
` ...my soul was now certainly dancing through that sky...`
`The vast, vast sky of Rokkenjima.`
`...Below me was the green of many trees.`
`But...I understand.`
`I can comprehend the presences of my family and relatives...and all the servants.`
`......And...Maria onee-chan too.`
`I could even comprehend...Maria onee-chan as a witch.`
`It was vast, more so than any vast space I had imagined up until now.`
`"......Maria onee-chan,`
` can you hear me...?`
` Listen...!!"`
`Ange called to the Maria of that day.`
`She told her of the long journey she'd undergone.`
`Of her long-delayed realization of just how much she'd wounded Maria in her youth.`
`She understood magic...and now understood everything about the world Maria had wanted to show her.`
`It was very warm, overflowing with love and happiness.`
`...She wanted to become even happier by sharing that world, `
`but I trampled it.`
`"So now, I finally understand everything.`
` ......I understand magic...!`
` Our magic is surely very faint and fills the space beside us.`
` ...But it isn't something that anyone can see with their eyes.`
` ......Magic is...`
`...yes, I can say it clearly."`
`——Without love, it cannot be 'seen'.`
`Sorry, Onee-chan.`
`...I've already been excommunicated from the alliance of witches,`
` but now, I understand how wonderful it is.`
`And......I know that, after the day I wounded you, Mariage Sorcière...`
`was transfigured into something different from what you truly desired.`
`......Even the magic that spat anger by cursing people was probably important to Onee-chan in those days.`
`Onee-chan's environment was sad enough to permit that.`
`"But now,`
` ......those sad days...are over.`
`'!s1`
`...let's return Onee-chan's alliance of witches...`
`...back to the original Mariage Sorcière."`
`The grimoire was in my hands before I realized it.`
`...The strong winds were rapidly blowing its pages one after another...`
`That world had been kind in the beginning.`
`How could you give birth to magic that would make candy fall from the sky?`
`How could you give birth to magic that would make tomorrow's dinner creme croquette?`
`How could you give birth to magic that would make the weather good when you went out the next day, making your whole day fun?`
`New spells of happiness were created one after another, coloring her world with kindness...`
`Those days were flipped through one after another,`
` ......and months began to flash by...`
`The pages with drawings that had once been colorful...`
`gradually began to change into the color of black ink...`
`...Eerie magic circles and demon summonings.`
`Evil magic for harming people.`
`How could you give birth to magic that would cause the class bully to catch a cold?`
`How could you give birth to magic that would seriously injure someone in class so that they died?`
`How could you give birth to magic that would cause a bus loaded with all the bullies to fall off a cliff?`
`Malicious spells were created one after another, `
`...burying the pages and her heart...`
`"Because I hurt Onee-chan, `
`Mariage Sorcière ended up like this.`
` ......Onee-chan isn't a black, evil witch.`
` ...She was a white, ...pure, innocent, `
`...kind witch..."`
`"...I'll...return it to how it was.`
`I'll bring back the original Maria onee-chan, `
`...the one who scattered magic to make people happy across the entire world.`
` ...That's the reason I came here.`
` I was guided by fate.`
` ......Maria onee-chan, can you hear me...?`
` ......Show yourself before me......!!"`
`That voice rode an even stronger wind and was sent 12 years into the past...`
`'!s0`
`...the wind gradually ceased, `
`......and silence fell...`
`*crunch*, *crunch*.`
` ...I could hear the sound of gravel being stepped on.`
`I listened to those footsteps, surprised at this miracle.`
`...Without a doubt, those were Maria onee-chan's footsteps.`
`"......M-Maria onee-chan......"`
`"It's Kasumi.`
` ......Looks like I finally found you, eh, Ange-chan......?"`
`"............"`
`...Before I knew it, Aunt Kasumi and her black-suits, a total of seven people who didn't resemble Maria onee-chan in the slightest,`
` were standing there, surrounding me.`
`And it felt like my voice had been just about to reach Maria onee-chan, too...`
`...Because of these guys' toxin, ......that magic was cut off...`
`Ange clicked her tongue at that, but Kasumi probably didn't hear it that way.`
`"......Hmmmm.`
` Are those flowers for your deceased family?`
` ...How admirable.`
` You're going to throw them, right?`
` Go ahead, we'll wait that long."`
`...Just what are you waiting for...?`
`...But Ange could more or less guess.`
`The way the black-suits unnaturally stuck their hands into their pockets clearly brought to mind the likelihood that they had handguns.`
`......This is a deserted island.`
`There could be no more convenient place to dispose of someone.`
`I have absolutely no interest in the family matters of the Sumadera family.`
`...But if I die, all that wealth will go to them.`
`Unlike me, they're probably very interested and concerned about this matter.`
`Of course, it seems that if the massive amounts of stock I own suddenly go to them, it'll be pretty bad for the Ushiromiya Group as well,`
` and they're apparently having a secret feud, fighting over me all by themselves.`
`...That's probably why President Okonogi gave me Amakusa as a guard.`
`......Having Amakusa wait on the boat was a regrettable mistake...`
`"Aunt Kasumi, how long have you been waiting for this ambush...?"`
`"Since early morning.`
` Thanks to that, I'm completely tired of waiting.`
` After all, there are no cafes or dressing rooms here."`
`"No toilets either, so I guess you had to elegantly drop a load behind a tree.`
` ......ack-"`
`"A lady with half Sumadera blood flowing through her veins will not use such filthy words.`
` ......You really are Sumadera Kyrie's child.`
` Not a trace of grace."`
`She grabbed me by the hair and forced my face up to hers.`
` And then spat at me.`
`...My words might be filthy, but they're no worse than her spit.`
`"......Every time you talk to me, Aunt Kasumi, it's always about Mom.`
` ...Am I really that much like my mother?"`
`"Yes, you are.`
` ......That impertinent gaze.`
` Your mouth and nose are the same too.`
` ...Freewheeling and irresponsible.`
` ...You thought nothing of the long history and tradition of the Sumadera family...and selfishly flew out of the house.`
` Thanks to that, my entire life has been devoted to cleaning up your mess...!"`
`"I guess your life really has been covered with crap."`
`When I was slapped on the cheek, my ear was smashed, and for an instant, my head rang...`
`......My hair was pulled, spinning me around, and I fell to the ground.`
`And in a flash, the ground was kicked and I was struck with sand.`
`"Yes, you truly are like Nee-san.`
` That gaze!`
` That gaze like you're mocking me somehow.`
` Yes, I remember so many things!"`
`"......You're a sad person.`
` I'll bet that since you were young, you always got compared to Mom and scorned.`
` ...And for your entire life, you'll never be released from that wretchedness."`
`"A little girl like you couldn't possibly understand.`
` ...You see, your mother is a loser who threw everything away and ran away from the Sumadera family, right...?`
`'!s1`
`how much trouble I went through because of that loser?!!"`
`"Any trouble you went through has nothing to do with me.`
` Sorry, but what am I supposed to do about something that happened before I was born?`
` ......When will your life begin?`
` ...It never will.`
` For all eternity, you'll always, always continue to be sneered at by my dead mother until you die.`
` ...If only you'd just die.`
` Why are you living?"`
`"You little piss...!!`
` You all...!`
` Make her some tea."`
`"Heheheh...`
` Leave it to us..."`
`"You big-mouthed shitty brat.`
` Let us teach you a little lesson."`
`The black-suits dashed up to me, violently grabbed me by the nape of the neck, and dragged me down.`
`"Do whatever you want to her until my break is over.`
` Teach my cute niece her place."`
`Sumadera Kasumi.`
`When I think about it, she was a pitiable person.`
`To the outside world, women of the Sumadera family were trained to be in a position that supported and deferred to men.`
`...But in actuality, strong leadership was required from them, so that they could manage all the common people.`
`The role demanded of them really was that of a 'female commander', like a literal reading of the word 'okami' (女将).`
`Managing the Sumadera family with all its traditions was not something that could be accomplished with just an ordinary level of dignity.`
`It was an unimaginably heavy responsibility.`
`Normally, this would have been demanded of Kyrie.`
`Kyrie had undergone that harsh training.`
`And Kasumi, as the younger sister, should have been able to take it easy.`
`No, on the contrary, she had lived like a lazy, selfish and affluent princess, sneering at Kyrie, who had been given the heavy responsibility.`
`...However,`
` Kyrie had suddenly been disinherited.`
`She had refused the fiancé her parents had arranged...and had gotten pregnant by her lover, Ushiromiya Rudolf.`
`From the Sumaderas' perspective, even though the Ushiromiya family held a vast fortune, it was a low-level family that had already collapsed.`
`And to become not even a legal wife, but a mistress to the second son of that family...`
`Normally, a daughter of the main family would be shown no mercy for such dishonor.`
`They would wrap her up in a mat, place a pole on end, `
`and throw her either into the Pacific Ocean if the pole fell to the right or the Sea of Japan if it fell to the left.`
`......But Kyrie's punishment ended with disinheritance, an unbelievably warm-hearted decision.`
`After that, the Sumadera family began receiving favorable treatment from a section of the Ushiromiya group.`
` ...There must've been some kind of backroom deal.`
`In other words, Kyrie openly left the Sumadera family under the pretense of gaining financial support from the Ushiromiya family.`
`Kasumi had watched it happen in shock.`
`No, she even disparaged her dishonorable sister as a loser.`
`...But, eventually...`
`She realized that the heavy responsibilities Kyrie had borne would be passed on to her,`
` and then, for the first time, she saw that she'd been outwitted...`
`"Because of your mother, my life was ruined.`
` ...No, you could even say she killed me once.`
` On that day, I was killed once and thrown into a hellish life..."`
`"......Isn't that what you get for making light of life until then?`
` ...Gyack!`
` ......Gah...gah..."`
`"Don't you ever stop talking, girl?!`
` Hyaah!"`
`The black-suit punched me in the gut, and I doubled over.`
`But I was quickly grabbed by the nape of the neck and made to stand up again.`
`Kasumi cold-heartedly looked down at me, smoking a cigarette...`
`The painful days after Kyrie had left were floating through her mind.`
`Until then, she had been allowed to be a simple lady, freewheeling and naive.`
`...Only the older sister, Kyrie, had been harshly trained, and she, the younger sister, had been able to live as nothing more than a princess.`
`Then, suddenly, everything got flipped over...and her life came crashing down...`
`"My life, lifestyle, and the way I lived...were all stolen from me.`
` ......Do you know how much I was derided by those relatives who didn't know the details, all because of my sister's dishonor...?`
` I detested her.`
` I detested your mother enough to make me spit blood..."`
`"Glad to hear it.`
` Keep up the good work.`
` ......Graggghh!!"`
`A kick landed in Ange's side as she crawled on the ground.`
`Ange didn't stand up again.`
`...So, she continued to lie there like a caterpillar as she was kicked each time she spoke up.`
`"...I saw Nee-san at an Ushiromiya Group party once.`
`'!s1`
`......looking very happy......`
`and laughing.`
` ...She...`
`pushed everything onto me...`
`and found happiness...`
`...only for herself......"`
`"......So what?`
` How is taking it out on me going to make you happy?`
` Will taking it out on me turn back time and change history or something?`
`'!s1`
`......gah, `
`......ghackk...!!"`
`"You said something a short while ago...`
` When will my life start?`
` ......No matter how much I despise you or take out my frustrations on you, I can't turn back time.`
` ...So, must I keep hating my sister even though she's gone, until I die?"`
`"You've got to be kidding me.`
` ...How long will I have to be tormented by my sister's ghost?`
` So I thought of something.`
` ......If I could accomplish one thing, I'd be able to forget all of my hatred and start over."`
`Ange was about to lash back out at her, but stopped.`
`...Because she'd be kicked again if she responded.`
`...Even if Kasumi didn't say any more, Ange had a pretty good idea what she meant.`
`Kasumi thought that by taking revenge against Kyrie's daughter, Ange, she'd be able to put an end to her hatred.`
`......Talk about pushing your problems onto other people.`
`"Come on, stand up.`
` If you like this island that much, I'll bury you deep in it.`
` ......You don't want to die at your age, right?`
` Don't you feel like saying 'Sorry my mother caused you so much trouble', or something?"`
`'!s1`
`say something like that?`
` ......Gwah, `
`......ghhh...!!"`
`『Uryu-!!`
` Ange, Angeeeeee...!!〝`
`"Ange-sama, no...!`
` You mustn't provoke them...!!`
` You should at least make it seem like you're going along with them, so you can buy some time...!"`
`'!s1`
`you should throw your foolish pride...`
`out with the garbage..."`
`『Oh, what about Amakusa-san...?!`
` If Amakusa-san comes, I'm sure...!〝`
`"...It's no use, I can't see him...`
` ...You idiot, Ange-sama...!`
` Why did you leave Amakusa behind...?!"`
`I didn't need Mammon to tell me.`
`...I was seriously regretting it already.`
`I walked a long way.`
` The forest was very thick.`
`...I've got no doubts that signs of activity here won't reach the boat...`
`During the time it took for Kasumi to finish casually smoking a whole cigarette, `
`I was continuously tormented by the black-suits, as she had told them to.`
`The moment I grabbed at my head, my scalp was kicked by someone at a bad angle, and my head was filled with stars...`
` The feeling of stars flickering in this gray, twisted world...`
`was one I remembered clearly.`
`My life was very similar to the one Sumadera Kasumi led.`
`...After all, as the Successor to the Ushiromiya family, I was tormented constantly with various kinds of bullying...under the guise of education and training.`
`Yes.`
` Having the inside of my head filled with stars like this...is a feeling I know well.`
`When being reprimanded for some error in manners I seemed to have made,`
` the discussion always turned to whether I was fitting to be the Successor or not.`
`...On and on about the honor of the Ushiromiya family, and how deep that was.`
`...By the time the conversation reached that point,`
` I'd forget what mistake I was being blamed for in the first place.`
`No, in fact, it was the same for Aunt Eva.`
`After all, sometimes she'd ask herself "Umm, what was it again?"`
`...But in the end, she wouldn't be able to remember, and would say something like...`
`"If I'm angry, it must be your fault, Ange.`
` The fact that you're at fault is what matters, so who cares if I can't remember what it was you did."`
`...There'd be some ridiculous reasoning like that, and then she'd keep on punishing me.`
`Yes.`
` Aunt Eva's punishment wasn't something that would continue until I learned something, or acknowledged my mistake, or apologized.`
`......It would continue until Aunt Eva wanted to stop.`
`So this violence was a bit nostalgic, in a way that made me want to vomit.`
`...I opened my eyes...and look, there's Aunt Eva.`
`Right next to Kasumi, who's smoking a cigarette,`
` I can see Aunt Eva, almost as though the two of them are laughing together.`
`When I think about it, even Aunt Eva's life might be a thing worthy of my sympathy.`
`...The responsibility and pressure of being a member of the Ushiromiya family, which she often mentioned to me,`
` had probably caused her great pain.`
`After all, people can't make insults that they've never been the targets of themselves...`
`It was probably the same for Aunt Rosa as well.`
`...As the youngest child of the honorable Ushiromiya family, she must've gone through many tough times.`
`So, it was just like what Aunt Eva did to me...`
`Just like what Sumadera Kasumi is doing now...`
`...Aunt Rosa...must have been the same.`
`People tend to push the pain they're burdened with onto other people.`
`Otherwise, they can never escape from that pain.`
`...So on and on, in eternity and perpetuity, the chain of pain and sadness does not end.`
`'!s0`
`...Maria onee-chan's magic was...`
`so incredible.`
`With her magic, ...she didn't have to bear the pain caused by Aunt Rosa.`
`The pain probably was pushed onto her.`
`Its weight probably tormented her.`
`...But Onee-chan didn't carry that burden on her own shoulders.`
`......She purified it...and filled her world with happiness.`
`So I'm sure...`
`...If Maria onee-chan had had children in the future...`
`She probably wouldn't have pushed the pain that had been forced on her onto her children.`
`...That chain of pain and sadness that stretched back for who knows how long, `
`which she couldn't understand and which she had inherited, which had been forced onto her...`
` ......Maria onee-chan cut it with her magic.`
`"......Whaaat's wrong?`
` Got a bone to pick with me?"`
`"............"`
`In the past, I would have snapped back.`
`...I would've met her hatred with hatred, so that they'd cancel each other out.`
`...No, nothing got cancelled out.`
`The thing being forced on me ended up right there on my shoulders.`
`Just like how even now, ...I hate her.`
`So, now that I...`
`...know of magic,`
` ...I'll look at the human called Ushiromiya Eva again.`
`......What I could see through to...`
`...was a sad human form, no different from me, who had lost her family and who bore deep wounds in her heart.`
`Unable to withstand the pain of that torn heart,`
` she was doing nothing more than howl sadly, like a lion crying in pain, ...like a child.`
`...Even Ushiromiya Eva was someone I should have felt compassion for.`
`She needed someone to understand the difficulties and pain of her childhood years.`
` ......Even she, who was the only survivor of the Rokkenjima crime,`
` who was faced with the curiosity of all of society, who was publicly slandered and forced to have salt continually flung into the wound,`
` had needed someone's compassion.`
`In order to let Eva forget her pain and sadness at least a little,`
` ......the black witch...taught her magic, just like the times it had possessed Aunt Rosa.`
`It was the same magic of anger and sadness...`
`that Beatrice had taught Maria onee-chan when she was mourning for her torn-apart friend, Sakutarou.`
`...That same magic...that witch...had probably dwelled inside Aunt Rosa too.`
`......So I mustn't hate Ushiromiya Eva.`
`...Maybe...`
`...I should've become her ally,`
` as the only person in the world who could understand her.`
`...What did I say to her when I was young, when she returned alive all alone...?`
`Could it be...`
`...that I acted...`
`...as though she'd killed my family and returned on her own...?`
`............`
`...I can't believe it.`
`...Aunt Eva, who has never been more than a object of and a synonym for hatred throughout my life,`
` ......is turning into...a 'human' I can understand...`
`So,`
` ......I can see, right next to Aunt Eva, ...the form of the black witch, who taught her the black magic...`
`Aunt Eva...was crying.`
`It was only natural.`
`......Not only was no one willing to understand the pain of losing her husband and son at once,`
` ...but her only relative had insulted her, ...saying 'Give me back my Dad and Mom'.`
`......I can make the excuse that I was merciless because of my youth.`
`...However, ...to her at the time,`
` it had probably been cruel enough to sever the last thread in her heart.`
`.........In the following days, the talk shows and magazines publicly slandered her.`
`The truth of her husband's business and character...and even her beloved son were negated.`
`She no longer had anything left.`
`She could do nothing but cry and howl, ...trying to forget the pain and sadness at least for a while.`
`After all, she could only feel a tiny bit of release, and only during the time that she howled.`
`And so, ......the black witch taught her how to howl.`
`The one I hated...was the black witch.`
`Black magic can probably release one from that pain for an instant.`
`...However,`
` it never lifts that weight from a person's shoulders.`
`On the contrary, it forces that weight onto further victims,`
` ......filling the world with hatred.`
`......If only Aunt Eva knew of white magic...and had a true witch nearby...`
`...Shouldn't that...`
`...have been...`
`...me......?`
`Didn't I learn the magic to create happiness from Maria onee-chan?`
`......If I'd taught her...with that magic,`
` ......could we have...`
`...built a future with a completely different relationship?`
`Up until now, `
`......I've hated Aunt Eva constantly.`
`...So I didn't notice the black witch beside her.`
`...Without love, it could not be 'seen'.`
`I didn't...`
`...have any love for her...`
`So now, finally...`
`......I'll glare at the black witch, `
`...the one I truly should hate.`
`"...Oh.`
` ......Whaat's this?`
` You can 'see' me?`
` Hehheheheheh...!"`
`".........I 'see' you.`
` ...The one I should've hated wasn't Aunt Eva.`
` ...It's you."`
`"Whoa, awesome.`
` To think that a lowly Human could 'see' a witch like me.`
` ...So?`
` Are you trying to say something with that glare?`
` Do you hate me?"`
`"......Hate?`
` ...Yes, I do.`
` ...But...that's not quite it.`
` ...I just think you're sad."`
`"Sad?`
` ...*giggle*giggle* Ahhahahahahaha!`
` What're you saying?! Come on, go ahead!`
` Why not hate me as much as you waant?!"`
`"...I won't hate.`
` Hating you...`
`...means I'm doing nothing more than inheriting Aunt Eva's hatred.`
` ...I'll put a stop to hatred.`
` ...I'll accept Aunt Eva's pain, ......purify it, and throw it away."`
`"Ahhahahahahahahaha!!`
` What kind of epiphany do you think you've had?`
` Is your head all right?`
` Seriously, if only you'd just give up and diie!`
` Kyaahhahhahahahahahaha!`
` You guys, kick her more and more, okay?`
` Not her face, though.`
` 'Cause it'd be boring if her pitiful face got any better!"`
`'!s0`
` ......Gwah!!`
` ......Nngg..."`
`The black-suits persistently kicked my stomach and back.`
`...As though they had been ordered to by the black witch.`
`"...My, my, are you still not suffering after all that...?`
` ......You keep staring right at me.`
` Do you hate me?`
` I'll bet you do.`
` Same here.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*..."`
`Kasumi sneered at me.`
`...But for some reason, I had the feeling that she was crying behind that expression.`
`Just like me, the pain of being forced into an unreasonable life would never, ever heal.`
`...The sad lion gasping in pain from the thorn he can't get out continues to howl...`
`"Hey, Sumadera Kasumi, take a look.`
` Over there, it's you as you used to be.`
` ...Don't you feel better now?`
` You used to be standing there, but now you're on this side, right?`
` Heheheh, isn't it great?`
` Don't you like having the roles switched?!"`
`'!s1`
`...great......`
` Ahhahahahaha, how can you make that kind of face, Ange...?!`
` Go on and cry, you want to, right?!"`
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha!!`
` Yes, yes, of course she wants to cry!`
` Make her cry.`
` Didn't someone make you cry back then?`
` So make her cry too.`
` *giggle* You too, Ange.`
` If only you'd just break down and cry!`
` Kyaaahhahhahhahhahha!!"`
`"...Aha, ...ahahahahahahaha!!`
` Cry, Angee!`
` I want to see your crying face!`
` Cry, and try saying 'I'm sorry, Aunt Kasumi'...!!"`
`"Yes, make her say those words.`
` ...Aren't those words painful?`
` Isn't being made to apologize for something that isn't your fault...just the worst pain...?`
` Make her feel the same way...`
` By doing that, you can relieve your pain.`
` ...Hehheheheh, yeah, that's it.`
` Be a little more honest with yourself, okay?`
` If only you'd just let your emotions run free more, and more, and mooooooooooore!"`
`...The black witch provoked Kasumi.`
`And Kasumi began to give herself over to that dark emotion.`
`...By turning deep sadness into an evil alcohol and forcing it down, trying to forget it for just an instant, `
`nothing would change.`
`'!s0`
`...were themselves...`
`sad.`
`And, I couldn't forgive the black witch who had imposed that sadness on Kasumi......`
`......I had gone limp, which seemed to have stopped the black-suits' kicking competition.`
`...Or maybe the kickers were getting tired too.`
`Kasumi didn't order them to stop, but at some point, they did.`
`However, I was reflected in Kasumi's eyes, and they burned me with flames of hatred.`
`...She had been tempted by the witch to do that in order to relieve her own pain.`
`"......Sumadera Kasumi,`
` you aren't done yet.`
` You've got much more trampling to do, right?`
` Can you forgive what happened to your entire life with just a little violence?"`
`"...I can't.`
` ...I still can't forgive her with just this."`
`"Right?`
` There's no way you can forgive her!`
` Do it more!`
` More of the flames of hatred!`
` Nothing can warm you except the fires of hate.`
` After being frozen in the snow fields of anger and sadness, the only flame that can warm you is hatred...!!`
` Say it, okay?`
` Scream it!!`
` If only you'd just burn yourself to ashes with a roar of haaaaaaaaaate!"`
`"...U-Ushiromiya Angeeeeeeeee!!`
` I cannot live...without hating you!!`
` Hehhehehehahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"Sumadera Kasumi, look at that bundle of flowers.`
` ......These flowers are for your dead family, right, Ange?"`
`The black witch grinned at me unpleasantly, using her chin to signal Kasumi to pick it up.`
`Kasumi picked up the flowers I was going to offer,`
` ......brought them all the way over to me, dropped them, and made a show of trampling them...`
`Her expression was filled with hatred...and a frantic quality that couldn't be explained with hatred alone.`
`...She trampled them over and over again as though her sadness was reaching the bursting point.`
`So the sound of her trampling it was just sad.`
`"......Oh, still not suffering yet?`
` Then what about this?`
` Sumadera Kasumi!`
` Use this."`
`"...N-No, `
`...not that......"`
`The object the black witch pointed at......was Maria onee-chan's grimoire.`
`Kasumi also noticed it...and picked up that book, which was heavier than it looked...`
`"Whaat's this?"`
`"*giggle*`
` ...Why not read it?`
` Eheheh, you might fall over laughing, okay?"`
`Kasumi opened the grimoire,`
` ...skimmed over the contents, and snorted derisively.`
`"Give it back...`
` ...That's...Onee-chan's......"`
`Of course, my hand couldn't reach.`
`...My stomach was once again kicked by the black-suits, and I doubled over...`
`"See?`
` This book's really important to Ange, right?`
` Gotta belittle the things that are important to her, okay?`
` That'll work better than punching or kicking for a girl like her.`
` ...You know that better than anyone, don't you...?"`
`As though remembering something painful, Kasumi's face twisted for an instant.`
`...But that quickly disappeared, changing into a scornful smile directed at me.`
`"*giggle*giggle*`
` Whew, what a creepy book.`
` ...Did you write this......?"`
`"...Stop it, ...give it back......"`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*!!`
` Look at that face...!`
` Belittle it more, belittle it more...!`
` Teach her the pain of having your dignity trampled, that's the only way to soften your own pain...!"`
`"Heh, heheheheh, what's with this embarrassing book...?`
` ......I'll admit I did have a little interest in fortune telling as a girl."`
`"But isn't this going a bit too far?`
` Magic? Ew.`
` ...You're one of those, aren't you?`
` It's like in those cartoons, where a girl says that something-somethiiiing spell and transforms into a witch, right?`
` You like those, don't you?`
` ......How pathetic.`
` *giggle*giggle*."`
`Cackling, Kasumi opened to a random page and showed it to the black-suits.`
`The black-suits looked too and guffawed.`
`That sneer didn't wound me.`
`...But I couldn't forgive it.`
`...After all, that sneer was ridiculing Maria onee-chan.`
`I don't hate Kasumi.`
`...But for forcing that unhealing anger and sadness on Kasumi, ...I cannot forgive the black witch...`
`That black witch ate into Aunt Eva, Sumadera Kasumi, and Aunt Rosa,`
` ...tormenting them for an eternity without letting their wounds be healed.`
`......I can't forgive her...`
`...I can't forgive......the black witch...`
`"Wow, this is just great...!`
` ...Magic for making candy fall from the sky, ...you say?!!`
` Ahhahahahaha...!`
` What's this?`
` Sprinkle water cleansed by the sun with sugar...?`
` Stick the magic staff in, and then an incantation, ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ahhahahahahahahahaha!!`
` What the hell?!`
` Ahhahahahahahahaha...!!`
` It huuuuuuuurts!!"`
`The black-suits were also rolling around, guffawing.`
`Then, grinning, the black witch whispered something into Kasumi's ear.`
`...After glaring at me with a grin, ...Kasumi took that page-`
`"...Ah..."`
`Kasumi grabbed hold of that page, tore it off, crumpled it up, ...and threw it away...`
`『...S-So cruel. ...That was...Maria's magic......〝`
`"Oh, really?`
` Heheh, how sad."`
`...It was one of the spells to summon happiness...`
`that Maria had made with Sakutarou.`
`Anyone knows that making sugar water, coloring it, and leaving it by the window...`
`isn't going to make candy fall from the sky.`
`But after repeating that every day, ...one time on her way home from school...`
`She had found several pieces of candy scattered around...`
`......How happy must that miracle have made Maria onee-chan?`
`...Didn't she treasure that candy, eating it during her night alone with Sakutarou to distract herself from her loneliness?`
`'!s0`
`...had been torn and thrown away...`
`and had disappeared...`
`The whole miracle of happiness that magic had given birth to...`
`had been torn and thrown away...`
`"Oh, this part's great too...!`
` Magic to make tonight's dinner cream croquette?`
` Ahhahahahahaha!!`
` ...What's next?`
` Magic to make bell peppers taste good?`
` Heh, that's not bad either, so stupid!`
` Ahhahhahhahha...!!"`
`"Tear that too.`
` Eheheh!!`
` If only you'd just tear it more and moooooooore!!"`
`With a brutal, loud laugh, `
`...the black witch made Maria onee-chan's spells get torn out one after another...`
`'!s0`
`...torn, `
`...and thrown away...`
`"Stop it, ...stop it...!!`
` Don't...defile Lady MARIA's magic...!!`
` Don't defile it...with your filthy toxin...!!"`
`Mammon cried and yelled, ...but she had no way of reaching Kasumi.`
`"Come on, why not defile it?!`
` Miracles of magic?`
` Magic to bring happiness?`
` No way, nothing like that exists!`
` Don't you know that you can't heal pain and sadness without pushing it onto someone else?`
` ...Hey, you also had those magic friend things, right?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Sumadera Kasumi, open to that page."`
`"What's this?`
` Magic friends?`
` ......The Seven Sisters of Purgatory?`
` Aha, what a creepy name!`
` *giggle* It says they can fly at awesome speeds and finish off the enemy.`
` Ahhaha, Ange, if you can use this kind of magic, shouldn't you use it right now?`
` ......Ahhahahahaha.`
` Foolish!"`
`The page that wrote of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory was also heartlessly torn away.`
`...The page itself was just paper.`
`It wasn't Mammon's vessel or anything.`
`But the tearing, denying toxin burned Mammon from the inside...`
`Mammon's face twisted from that heat and pain...`
`"......Gah, .........ack, ......"`
`『Are you okay, Mammon?!`
` Hold on...!!〝`
`"...This much is...no problem...`
` ...It's not me, ...but Ange-sama......who's in pain......"`
`However, Mammon's expression was twisted with unbearable anguish and humiliation...`
`『Stop it, black witch...!!`
` Why are you doing something like this?!`
` Why...can't you use magic for happiness?!!〝`
`"...Oh, you're a magic friend too, right?`
` *giggle* I'll defile you too.`
` Sumadera Kasumi, look for this guy's page too, okay?"`
`"What's this one?`
` What's with this crappy scribble of a lion?`
` ...Sakutarou?`
` What a weird name!`
` My best friend, it says.`
` Really?`
` This is your friend? A close friend?`
` This lion is? Is it, is it?"`
`"Ahhahahahahahaha!!`
` It really is a crappy scribble.`
` This ugly lion is totally you."`
`"To think she had something like this as a friend... That Ushiromiya Maria kid's mind is so pathetic it's embarassing, what a joooke.`
` ......She's like, a moron.`
` If only she'd just give up...and diiiiiiiieee...!"`
`『U...ryu...`
` ......Don't make fun...of Maria...〝`
`".........St...op...it......`
` ...Don't break it......"`
`""No waay.""`
`There was a shrill sound.`
` ......The page had been filthily ripped out...`
`'!s0`
`that Onee-chan had drawn...`
`was violently ripped in half......`
`"What a crappy pictuuuure.`
` Kyahhahahahahahahahahahaha...!"`
`"You all laugh too, okay?`
` Ahhahahahahahahaha...!"`
`A pair of the black-suits laughed vulgarly...`
`and heartlessly trampled the two halves that had been torn and thrown away...`
`『Uuuuuuuuuuuu, ...hic!`
` ...Uuuuuuuuuuu...〝`
`"...Sakutaro, ...hang in there......"`
`『I'm...not sad...`
` ...I just...can't stand it...`
` ...I can't stand that...`
`...Maria's being made fun of, `
`and I can't do anything about it...〝`
`".........`
`...To Humans who can't 'see' us, ......it's as though we don't exist...`
` ...We can only interact with Humans that need us.`
` ......That's why......we're furniture......"`
`As Sakutarou and Mammon...supported each other,`
` ...they crouched down, ...sobbing...`
`I couldn't stand it either...`
`...Those who can't 'see' how wonderful the world of magic is...can't understand it.`
`You can't explain to humans who can't understand.`
`So it gets belittled.`
`......If you could show them it...`
`...But you can't...`
`Because, in front of Humans who are filled with the magic-resisting toxin and who can't understand magic,`
` magic cannot be used...`
`"I really don't get it.`
` From this delusional diary, I've got to assume that something's wrong with your head.`
` ...It really is fun to take a peek into your mind.`
` You creepy child."`
`"Both you and Maria.`
` ...And that stuffed animal and the furniture over there too, right?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` Ahhahahahahahahahahaha!"`
`"Aah, I could laugh.`
` You don't have any friends, do you?`
` You're aaalways all alone, so stuffed animals are your friends?`
` What a pitiable child.`
` Heheheheheheheheh...!`
` Don't worry, I understand.`
` I know what it's like to live that way.`
` ......So I'll accept it.`
` You really are a pitiable child, right?`
` Ehhehehhahahahahahahaha!"`
`......To you, it probably would look...`
`...like something made by a pitiful child.`
`That's right.`
`If a hundred people were to read Onee-chan's diary, a hundred people would probably think the same thing.`
`...I used to be like that too.`
`'!s0`
`......despite all of that, `
`...Maria onee-chan...`
`...summoned a world of happiness.`
`......Don't deny...`
`...that magic, ...that happiness...`
`"Such a stubborn child, you are.`
` ...Very well.`
` This is the last one.`
` I'll tear apart the source of the truly foolish magic that you and Maria believed in.`
` Sumadera Kasumi, read this page, okay?"`
`"Hmmm, what's this colorful page...?`
` ...What's this?`
` ......Magic to...`
`...always be friends with my beloved mother...?"`
`『St-Stop iiiiiiiiiiit!!`
` Not that page...!!〝`
`"Aha.`
` This magic's really simple, isn't it?`
` It looks like even I could do it.`
` ......Even I could remember an incantation this short.`
` Shall I give it a whirl?"`
`"*giggle*giggle* It really is a short incantation, isn't it?`
` Okay, give it a try, let's have everyone spit it out!"`
`With expressions that ridiculed it from the bottom of their hearts, the black witch and Kasumi...tapered their mouths.`
` ......And they said it aloud...`
`"Uu-uu-."`
`The black-suits stared blankly, asking what the hell that was supposed to be.`
`Then Kasumi answered, cackling.`
`"This is supposed to be an incantation.`
` Are you kidding me...?!`
` Ahhahahahahahaha...!!!"`
`"Come on, why don't you guys try it too?`
` Uu-uu-uu-."`
`The black-suits imitated that moaning voice, making fun of it...`
`————'Uu-uu-.'`
`That was the incantation...for the magic that would let her always be friends with her beloved mother.`
`"What the hell, how stupid...!!`
` If you could make family relationships better just by saying uu-uu-, the world would always be peaceful.`
` Ahahahahaha!!"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!`
` A stupid moaning voice!`
` Too bad that if you do this over and over again, people'll think you're a pathetic, stupid kid!`
` Are you a moron?!`
` Wahhahahahahaha, waaahahahahahahha!!"`
`『Stop iiiit... At least don't belittle...that magiiiiiiiic...〝`
`......It was the day of a picnic, when Maria onee-chan and Aunt Rosa were alone...`
`It was written that this was one of the top five happiest days of her life.`
`Onee-chan was singing a song she'd just learned from her Mama.`
`...Her mother had been delighted.`
`But partway through, Maria forgot the lyrics.`
`But, since she saw that her mother was so happy, she tried to sing until the very end.`
`With 'uu-uu-uu-'.`
`...Even though she'd only pretended to know the lyrics, her mother had enjoyed it a lot...`
`After that, 'uu-' remained as an incantation to remember that day she'd spent in fun and happiness with her mother.`
`Of course, even though she seemed to find it funny at first, Aunt Rosa eventually tired of hearing it,`
` and eventually started scolding Onee-chan when she said it,`
` ...but to Onee-chan, it was a memory of a fun day that she'd never forget...`
`So among the spells that Maria had created, it was the oldest and the first...`
`Kasumi stuck her fingernails into that page too...`
`"...Stop it, `
`......don't tear it...`
` At least spare...`
`...that page......"`
`"Hahahahahahahahaha!`
` No waay!!"`
`'!s0`
`was...`
`erased.`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!`
` Aaaahhahhahhahhahha, aaaaahahahhahahah!!`
` Is this your magic of happiness?`
` Hilarious, hilarious...!!"`
`"There's no way there could be magic to make you happy, right?!`
` Magic is made out of anger and hatred, right?"`
`"Happiness is what you call the feeling of release you get only when you've pushed all the hatred you bear onto other people.`
` The happiness you all are talking about is a phantom that doesn't show up outside picture books!!"`
`As Kasumi laughed her head off, she slammed the grimoire against the ground and stepped on it.`
`"Can't stand it?`
` Hey, you can't stand it, right?!`
` You white witches of happiness?`
` If you can't stand it that much, why don't you show us?!`
` Show us your magic!!`
` If it exists, then you just have to show us, riiiiight?`
` ......A witch who can't use magic isn't a witch!!`
` That's why we're the real witches.`
` You're just brats trying to escape reality with a dream!!"`
`'!s1`
`...if I can show you magic, `
`...will you...`
`believe in Onee-chan's magic......?`
`"Huh?`
` Kyahhahahaha, yeah, sure!!`
` I'll believe!`
` If you can use magic and show me, that is!!`
` Let's see it, you stupid braaaaaaaaaaaat!!"`
`............`
`......`
`Silently, slowly,`
` ...I stood up.`
`...Sensations of this cramped world, such as the pain in my body, felt truly trifling...`
`"Oh, looks like you've still got enough energy to stand up, Miss Great Witch.`
` *giggle*giggle*!"`
`"Now that you've stood up, what are you going to show us?`
` Show us some magiic...!"`
`"......Magic...exists."`
`"Whaat?`
` What's this kid saying...?!`
` Did you guys hear that?!"`
`"Silence!!!`
` ......Heh, isn't that interesting.`
` ...You people always refuse to show this power of miracles because of the magic-resisting toxin.`
` ......Disciple of the white witch, MARIA,`
` let's see some magic...!!"`
`"........."`
`"...Do you have any clue how many humans have believed in that miracle before being betrayed?`
` ......*giggle*`
` Everyone believes!`
` Everyone is betrayed and despairs!`
` And they learn that true magic can only be gained by the power of black witches, like me...!!"`
`"......Hitting someone with your hatred is nothing more than a sin.`
` That isn't magic.`
` ......I'll show you real magic."`
`"......Y-You........."`
`The black witch winced slightly.`
`However, Kasumi sneered at me even more.`
`"Then let's have a look.`
` So, what kind of magic will you show us?`
` Magic to make candy fall from the sky?`
` Or else magic to make cookies multiply?`
` ......Whaaat?!"`
`The instant I opened my eyes, a tremendous wind arose.`
`"...Wh-What is this, all of a sudden......?!"`
`"Come, arise, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory."`
`"......Whaaat...?"`
`There was a flash behind me, and in an instant, seven pieces of high-level furniture were gathered there.`
`It was a power that far surpassed the magical strength I'd had in my prime.`
`It was a power that matched even Maria onee-chan and Beatrice.`
`"The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here...!!"`
`"...A-Ange-sama...!"`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, enj_4e1677:`
`...I couldn't use you or your sisters.`
` ...This isn't some cheap emotion, like wanting to get back at my bullying classmates."`
`"...In order to protect Maria onee-chan's......Mariage Sorcière's world, `
`...I now order you to show me the miracle of magic."`
`"I-It's impossible...`
` No matter what you try, before such a mass of toxin......"`
`The Seven Sisters also remembered what had happened in that classroom.`
`...If they could have obeyed Ange's order, they would have.`
`...However, ...surrounded by the toxin that runs thick in Humans, they hadn't been able to display the miracle of magic.`
`...And they remembered very well how deeply that had hurt Ange...`
`But Ange spoke very quietly.`
`"In that case,`
` you all believe too."`
`"...Huh?"`
`"......Mariage Sorcière was created to bring people happiness.`
` ...And also to fight the black witch."`
`"In order to show that miracle to the foolish black witch, `
`...who denies the world that one of the founders, the Witch of Origins Lady Maria, gave birth to, `
`...and in order to protect that world, `
`......believe.`
` In magic.`
` In witches.`
` In miracles, right now...!"`
`When Kasumi gave an order to the black-suits, one of them took out a gun and pointed it at Ange.`
`"You'll show us magic, right?`
` Then let's have it.`
` Use magic to shoot this man down with a fireball or lightning or something.`
` You get one chance.`
` ......Show us before I count to three, got it?`
` If you can't, then you'd best prepare yourself, okay?`
` Ehheheheheh!"`
`"............`
`.........Shoot."`
`"What's with this kid?`
` Hehheheh, she's lost it."`
`The black-suit pointing the gun laughed at Ange's detached attitude.`
`"Ahhahahahahaha!!`
` Are you serious?!`
` This girl's lost her mind!`
` In that case, get yourself shot! If only you'd just diiiiiiiiiiiiie!"`
`『Ange...!!`
` ...I-It's impossible!`
` You can't block bullets with magic...!!〝`
`"No.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of.`
` ......Compared to my magic, to the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, bullets are nothing."`
`"A-Ange-sama......"`
`Mammon was perplexed by Ange's absolute trust.`
`...If she could comply, she would have.`
` On that day as well.`
`But, ...because she had been unable to do anything, she had hurt Ange......`
`"Hehheheh, you brat.`
` If you can use magic, let us have a look right now."`
`"What's wrong?`
` We're tellin' you to show us magic, right?!!"`
`"Come on, no need to hold back, okay?`
` *booom*!`
` Show me some magic!!`
` Hihhehhehheh!"`
`The black-suits jeered at her.`
`But Ange simply concentrated her mind in silence...`
`"If only you'd just shoot!`
` She's even telling you to try and shoot, you guys!"`
`"...This kid's already lost her mind from fear.`
` Bye-bye, Ange-chan.`
` ...Go and pretend to be a witch as much as you want in heaven.`
` ...Fire."`
`"Heheh, you sure?"`
`"Fire!`
` Die, Ange!!"`
`"If you can do it, then give this magic of yours a try!!!"`
`The black-suit cocked the gun, and sneering...pulled the trigger.`
`"............"`
`The sound of gunfire rang out, `
`...and the world...stopped.`
`A red spray scattered out...`
`...and chunks of flesh flew.`
`"...Huh, ......ah..."`
`"What are you doing, Mammon?`
` ...Don't tell me you'd let a boorish pebble of a bullet like this reach Ange-sama."`
`Lucifer lined up the bullet perfectly, and with a single swing, ...sliced it...`
`And, ...in the chest of the black-suit who had apparently fired the gun, ...was a hole as big as a fist...`
`"......Every now and then,`
` I get to go first."`
`Half of Leviathan's body was covered with blood, and a cold smile was on her face.`
`...Then, slowly, ......the pitiful prey that she had brought down...fell over.`
`"...Y-You pierced...a Human...!!!"`
`"Idiot!`
` Do you still not believe?!`
` In our master's magic power...?!!"`
`"Are...you...kidding me......?!?!`
` Y-You materialized...in front of this many Humans?!?!"`
`"...Wh-What is this? ...What?!"`
`Kasumi and the rest were flustered...`
`He certainly seemed to have fired his gun...`
`'!s0`
`...it hadn't hit Ange, `
`......and why...`
`...was the person who fired...`
`hurt instead...?!`
`"...This is...magic.`
` ...Great job, Leviathan."`
`"I'm most honored...!!`
` You foolish Humans who dare oppose our master!`
` Now is the time of judgement! Prostrate yourselves!!"`
`"Wh-Why...?!!!`
` You shouldn't be able to bring magic into the world of Humans...!!`
` They shouldn't be able to 'see' magic, and they shouldn't be able to be touched by magic!!`
` ...Why?!!"`
`"......Because this...is true magic."`
`"...Gah, ...aaaaaaaaaaarrrggggg...!!"`
`"Wh-What are you people doing?!`
` K-Kill, kill!!!"`
`'!s1`
`"Like I'd allow you the disrespect of pointing a gun barrel at our master...!`
` Die."`
`Those words were a requiem.`
`...The man's chest had already been pierced by Lucifer, who had become the Stake of Pride in an instant.`
`*thump*!`
`With the sound of the second person falling, the black-suits now realized for certain that their lives were in peril...!!`
`"W-Waaaaaaaah, s-s-save me...!!!"`
`The instant one of the black suits doubled over in shock...and turned on his heels to escape from that place,`
` ...the Stake of Sloth...`
`"......Be thankful that your violence against our master will be repaid with this alone.`
` Die!!"`
`In his right eye, a hole as big as a walnut opened, and his head split.`
`Belphegor was sprayed with blood, and her face twisted demonically with the joy at being able to use her full power...!`
`"Ooh, waaaaaaahhh?!`
` Who's that?!`
` Who's there?!`
` Where are you?!"`
`The black-suits were flustered, pointing their guns in every direction.`
`But they didn't understand what was happening.`
`They knew that something terrifying was coming for them from somewhere,`
` but they didn't know where...!!`
`"Dumbass!`
` Th-The enemy is right before your eyes!`
` The witch's furniture is after you!!!"`
`But they couldn't 'see'...!!`
`Because they didn't believe in magic, they could not 'see'...!!`
`Just as the black witch said, Satan was standing boldly right in front of a black-suit.`
`However, the black-suit couldn't 'see' her at all...!`
`"*giggle*...!`
` Did you think Humans could see our forms?`
` That they could follow us?`
` Ahhahahahahahaha, stupid Humans!!`
` Time to pay a fool's price for forgetting your awe of magic!!"`
`"Eee, eeeeeeeeeeeekk!!!`
` What is this?!`
` What's going on?!"`
`"......You can't 'see' it.`
` Because you have no love."`
`"...Impossible!!`
` Even though there are so many Humans here, even though the magic-resisting toxin is everywhere, ...why can you manifest your magic?!`
` Who...are you?!?!"`
`"......A witch.`
` And unlike you, a real one."`
`"Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaat, damn iiiiiiit, you biiiiiiiitch!!"`
`As though announcing his candidacy for becoming the fourth victim, one of the black-suits pointed his gun at Ange.`
`...And the trigger was...`
`Ange glared at him coldly...and simply ordered.`
`"D-Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Next one.`
` Satan."`
`"Satan of Wrath, already right here!!`
` Blockhead!!`
` You think a simple bullet could hit Ange-sama or us now?!!!"`
`The Stake of Anger...pierced and smashed the bullet fired by the black-suit...`
`and continued straight on, towards the man's face-`
`"......Know your foolishness...and regret in hell!!`
` Die!!"`
`With a terrible explosive sound, the upper half of the man's head was smashed.`
`Bathed in scattered flesh and blood, Ange quietly asked one more question.`
`"...Hey, Aunt Kasumi.`
` ......Do you still...`
`not feel like believing in magic?"`
`'!s1`
`There's no way...something so ridiculous...`
`could exist...!!`
` I-I won't accept it...!!`
` There's no way magic exists...!!!"`
`"Yes, that's right...`
` There's no way magic exists...!!`
` There's no way witches exist!!"`
`『...M-Magic exists!!`
` Witches exist...!! Uryu-!!〝`
`"......That's right.`
` Magic exists.`
` Witches exist.`
` ...And, in this world filled with anger and sadness, it can become the key that opens the door to the world of happiness...!!`
` I won't let...someone like you deny that!!"`
`『The key to a world of happiness lies in every person's hands...!`
` No one...has any right to steal that away...!!〝`
`"You pitiful Human who cannot understand this.`
` ......If there had been magic in your life, it would probably have turned out differently, becoming much more peaceful."`
`"When I think that in your entire life, you were never able to meet with a true witch, `
`...I pity you."`
`"Eee, ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!!"`
`Kasumi let out a piercing scream.`
`At the same time, two of the black-suits came for me at once, thrusting their guns at my head.`
`...Like they were trying to use me as a hostage against something their eyes couldn't 'see'.`
`...Against the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, who had now reached the level of weapons, this was completely pointless.`
`"Damn, where are you?!`
` Keep on attacking, and this bitch is dead!!`
` Show yourself!!"`
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha!!!`
` What the hell's he sayin'?! And his guts look so tasty too.`
` ......Ange-sama, leave the next one to me!"`
`"Go ahead. Kill him."`
`"Thank you so much!! I'm so happyyyyyy!!`
` Diiiiiee!!!"`
`The man's chest split, and his guts poured out.`
`...This terrible way of dying threw the other man into a total panic.`
`However, Asmodeus's form was already at his back,`
` grasping his neck...and smiling obscenely...`
`"What a cutie.`
` ...Hey, hey, where do you wanna get pierced?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* Ange-sama, got any ideas?!!!"`
`"The head."`
`"Certainly, my masteer!!`
` Die!!"`
`The final black-suit had his head smashed by the Stake of Lust,`
` and as his insides scattered, he twisted and fell.`
`In the gruesome world where six people lay in a sea of blood, `
`......witch and Human confronted each other.`
`"......Sumadera Kasumi.`
` I sympathize with your sad life from the bottom of my soul.`
` ...I'm willing to grant you magic that can seal up that unfillable hole in your heart.`
` If you can believe, that is."`
`"D-Don't be...ridiculous...!!`
` I-I...will never accept something like this!!`
`As Kasumi, who was scared out of her wits, stepped backwards,`
` ...she picked up a handgun that someone had dropped.`
`Then, shaking, she pointed it at Ange...`
`"That's right, Kasumi...!`
` Shoot with that gun...!!`
` Turn your hatred into a bullet and shoot...!!"`
`"Eeek, eeek...!!`
` I'll kill you... I'll kill you...!!`
` If I don't kill you, I'll never be paid back for the life I've lived...!!"`
`"Yes, kill!`
` Pull the trigger!!`
` Take all of the anger and pain from your shabby life until now!`
` Use it all against her!"`
`"If you don't, you won't be released from your pain and anguish!!"`
`"......Stop it, Aunt Kasumi.`
` ...You mustn't listen to the black witch."`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kas_4e252:`
`...my entire life...`
`...has been a wreck...!!"`
`"In that case, my magic might be able to turn that life into something bright and peaceful, bit by bit, starting now.`
` If you can believe in magic...and just have a change of heart, `
`I'll be able to open the door to a new world for you."`
`"There's no such thing!!`
` The salvation she speaks of is obviously just some fairy tale!`
` Your life is gonna be covered with thorns until you die anyway...!!`
` Let her hear that cry of agony!!`
` You can't regain anything that was lost, ...right? Sumadera Kasumiiiiiiiiii?!?!"`
`"That's right, you might not be able to regain anything.`
` However, I know you'll be able to create something new.`
` So, Aunt Kasumi,`
` throw that gun away.`
` ......I might be able to teach you too...about a world of happiness."`
`'!s1`
`...eeeeeeeeeekk...!!`
` Y`
`......You know,`
` because your mother ran away, `
`......I was forced to marry her fiancé in her place...!!"`
`"There was a man I swore I'd spend my life with!`
` And I was forced to break up with him!`
` You think you understand how I felt when I was forced to be wed in your mother's place...`
`and was held by a man I had barely even talked to?!?!"`
`"I wanted to kill her!!`
` But Nee-san just went and died on her own!`
` That's why I'll kill you!!`
` Otherwise, my thorn-filled life will never eeeeeeeeeeeeeeend!!"`
`...From Kasumi's eyes,`
` tears of passion dripped down.`
`So pitiable...`
`...This person's tears were so clear and beautiful.`
`But for that very reason, ...she hadn't been able to fully withstand her sad pain,`
` and had been given no choice but to listen to the black witch's temptation...`
`".........So sad.`
` ...In that case, I'll at least release you...your soul...for all eternity, and free you from the bonds of resentment.`
` ......That might be the only bit of charity I can give right now."`
`"Diiiiiiiiiiiee, Ushiromiya Angeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`"Goodbye, Aunt Kasumi.`
` ......Take a long rest in a quiet world."`
`I no longer feel anger or hatred for you.`
`I just want to let your soul rest in peace.`
`Kasumi's handgun spat fire.`
`Slowly, that bullet continued through a world frozen to the utmost limit, ...aiming for ANGE's forehead.`
`"Mammon."`
`"...Y-Yeah!!`
` Mammon of Greed, right here...!!"`
`"Thanks."`
`"Because I met you and Sakutarou, I was able to understand everything."`
`『...Ange...〝`
`"Look away, Sakutarou.`
` ......Mammon,`
` release that woman.`
` And protect the honor of Mariage Sorcière...!!"`
`"Y......Yes!!`
` ...Prepare yourself, Sumadera Kasumi!!"`
`Even though the world was frozen, the Stake of Greed flashed like lightning...`
`...and had already gotten behind Kasumi...`
`"If there's any virtue in you, we'll meet again on the mountain of Purgatory!!`
` ......Diiiiiiiieee!!!"`
`The upper half of Sumadera Kasumi's head was smashed.`
`...Her cage of flesh was shattered, `
`...and she was finally released...`
`"......Next is you.`
` ......The black witch.`
` ...By now, I think even the fact that you look like Aunt Eva is inexcusable to her."`
`"Heh, ...heheheheheh.`
` ...If my form still looks like Ushiromiya Eva,`
` that means you still haven't been able to forgive 'me' inside yourself."`
`"I understand, Ange.`
` ......Even you want to be released from your thorn-filled life more than anything."`
`"............"`
`"In that case, ...I thought of something interesting.`
` I'll show you magic as well.`
` ......I won't be the one to kill you."`
`With the worst of smiles on her face,`
` the black witch changed her form into something like a black mist,`
` ...or else a vast swarm of black flying insects, which began to swirl around me.`
`Then, that black mist began to gather bit by bit, ...shaping itself into the form of a human.`
`".........What's this supposed to be...?"`
`Hehheheheheh!`
`You've got at least a vague idea, don't you?!`
`It's the woman you hated and despised the most!`
`The woman who hated and despised you the most...!`
`'!s0`
`......over there was...`
`Aunt Eva's form, `
`...as she had been during her life.`
`...Her hands...were holding a gun.`
`"......Aunt Eva...`
`died."`
`"*giggle* Long time no see, Angeeee.`
` ...I've come back from hell to kill youu!`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`Aunt Eva glared at me with a mad laugh.`
`"But...I'm not that surprised.`
` Aunt Eva was that kind of person."`
`"I imagine my funeral came as quite a relief to you, right?`
` I feel the same, since I'll never have to see your face again...!`
` But I had just one regret."`
`"And this is it!!"`
`"......Killing me?`
` ......Was that your last request?"`
`How pitiful.`
`...Even after death,`
` ...my aunt wasn't released from her pain...`
`"The black witch's power is itself the source of my magic.`
` Anger and hatred taught me how to work hard and persist.`
` Completely different from this magic to escape reality that you speak of!"`
`"...The magic you speak of is nothing more than stress reduction through outbursts of anger.`
` ...Our magic is different.`
` It can remake the entire world.`
` ......It's in a totally different class than your wicked magic."`
`"*giggle*!!`
` In that case, let's settle which is the victor right now, black or white...!!`
` You see my black magic miracle, reviving even after death and pointing a gun at you like this.`
` How exactly do you intend to stop that with a miracle of white magic?"`
`"I've surrounded you with the magic-resisting toxin.`
` You can't call the Seven Sisters anymore.`
` That miracle just now won't occur again...!!"`
`"......Having it occur despite all that is why it's called magic.`
` ...Okay.`
` Mammon, lend me your power."`
`...But Mammon didn't respond.`
` She didn't appear.`
`Certainly, as she'd said,`
` the magic-resisting toxin had burned everything up like a wasteland parched by a blazing sun...`
`......This...might be a little tough.`
`"It's useless to call out.`
` Never again!`
` The Seven Sisters of Purgatory will never answer!"`
`"And...`
`being able to call them even so is what makes it magic, right?"`
`".........`
`...How pitiful.`
` So long, Ange.`
` The few days we spent together were fun in their own way.`
` This is goodbye.`
` ...Aren't you glad...that the end of the line for you turned out to be this place?"`
`"Yeah, seriously.`
` How thoughtful of you."`
`"Thanks.`
` Then this is farewell."`
`The barrel of the gun rose slowly, `
`...so that you could see all the way down it.`
`Then, `
`......the trigger was slowly......`
`At that moment,`
` ...the gun exploded.`
`...It wasn't that it fired.`
`...It burst.`
`......You're...kidding me...`
`...In shock, inside a frozen space, `
`...Eva looked at the ruptured gun.`
`When time melted, the fragments would probably smash into her face all at once...`
`"...Mammon of Greed,`
` right here."`
`"............You're...kidding me..."`
`Behind Eva's back, Mammon stood.`
`......She had already penetrated the target I had given her.`
`...Which was...the gun.`
`"Is this...enough magic for you,`
` ......Aunt Eva?"`
`'!s1`
`Angeee......"`
`Then, time melted.`
`The fragments of the burst gun and exploding gunpowder burned her face.`
`Letting out a shrill scream, she covered her face and rolled around...`
`...It was pitiful.`
`"...Your luck was bad.`
` ...This is game over,`
` Aunt Eva."`
`I signaled to Mammon.`
`...So that Eva would be freed quickly from the pain of her burnt face as she writhed around.`
`"......Thank you, Mammon.`
` ...This time, I want to apologize again, and from the bottom of my heart, for calling all of you powerless on that day in the classroom.`
` You were excellent furniture for protecting witches."`
`"......I'm the one that's grateful.`
` ...I feel truly honored at being able to meet a good witch...a good master in the end, and at being able to fulfill my duty as furniture...!"`
`Mammon had understood.`
`This would be the final job I'd give her.`
`Mammon quietly walked up to me.`
`Then, she looked down at Eva.`
`"...Aunt Eva,`
` thanks for sticking with me for so long.`
` This is farewell.`
` <Have a nice dream>.`
` <See you in hell>."`
`'!s0`
`Then, ...the light sound of her forehead being bored into rang out.`
`...The battle of gunpowder smoke and fury...of white and black magic...ended.`
`I get the feeling it was a long......truly a long journey.`
`And the world slowly...`
`sank into darkness......`
`The stars that should've been sparkling......lay not in the sky, but were scattered beneath me.`
`...When I realized that the pearl and ruby made a red and white stream,`
` I noticed that it was a vast nighttime scene spread out below...`
`I was in the sky of that nighttime scene, neither standing nor flying,`
` ...but simply floating.`
`...From nowhere in particular, I could hear a *clap*clap*clap*,`
` a truly dull applause.`
`I know.`
`...It's the one who ordered me to go on a journey, `
`"......Congratulations, `
`Endless Witch, ANGE Beatrice.`
` At the end of your travels, you understood everything about magic."`
`"...Yes.`
` ......I now...understand everything about magic.`
` ......I am...a witch.`
` ...The last witch who inherited the magical world created by Mariage Sorcière."`
`"......No one besides you...can tear Beatrice's world to pieces."`
`"Because I know witches, ......I learned how to resist them."`
`"............"`
`"...Magic is made of love and sadness and anger.`
` ...No matter how cruel a witch Beatrice might have been,`
` the source of her magic is exactly the same."`
`"......And that's why I wish I could leave that world of hers alone.`
` ...After all, in her eyes at least, that world is complete."`
`"......But then you'd have to give up on your family."`
`"............`
`...That's right.`
` So, I don't like doing it, but I have to fight.`
` ......The very reason I left on this journey to become a witch...`
`...was so I could bet on the faint chance that I'd be able to take my family back someday."`
`"Unless you kill Beatrice, only worlds of isolation can exist for you.`
` ...As one who has traveled to billions of Fragments, I guarantee it."`
`"......I understand.`
` ...I can't afford to have compassion.`
` ...I must make my heart a demon...`
`...and tear her heart to pieces."`
`"...It's good that you're steady in that resolve.`
` I was worried that, as another witch like her, you might grow attached and lose your will to continue."`
`It felt a bit hollow hearing that from a person whose face was almost always expressionless.`
`Bernkastel.`
`...The mysterious witch who invited me on this journey.`
` ............`
`"At times, I've suspected that you might've lied to me."`
`".........Why?"`
`"...I am the Ange of 1998, so even if I save my family, they will only be saved for the Ange of 1986.`
` ...They won't be saved for me.`
` So I've sometimes felt like I was being deceived."`
`".........`
`...That is correct.`
` I deceived you."`
`"...But now I'm grateful.`
` ......After all, `
`in the end, you did teach me how to get my family back."`
`"......I didn't teach you anything.`
` ...If you know something, it's because you've reached that mental state by yourself, as a witch.`
` That mental state is different from my own.`
` ......I personally cannot understand it, but if that's the truth, then congratulations."`
`"I'm not a player in this game, but a piece.`
` You said that to me, right?"`
`"......Yes, I said it."`
`"Now, I fully understand that role.`
` ......A piece doesn't need emotions.`
` It just has to give its all for victory's sake."`
`"......Yes.`
` That is correct.`
` A game requires that you each make the best possible moves, right?`
` If your moves get distorted by hesitation and confusion, your opponent will be confused as well."`
`......Sorry, Beatrice.`
`But...don't hate me.`
`...'Ushiromiya Ange' still needs her family.`
`So, I have the right to fight you, ...so that I can take them back.`
`And, you have the responsibility to be challenged by me to a fight.`
`......So...don't hate me.`
`In exchange...`
`If you do win in this game, `
`I'll give you my blessing as well.`
`Come on, let's go.`
`......As the piece I am, it's finally time for my true turn.`
`Sorry, Beatrice.`
`I won't hand Onii-chan over to you...!!!`
`The world whitened...`
`It wasn't white.`
`...It was a gold color as bright as can be.`
`There...was the beautiful Ushiromiya family rose garden.`
`However, the flowers on the roses were all gold.`
`...The nectar was also gold-colored.`
` The butterflies gathered there were gold as well.`
`......This is...the Golden Land......`
`The promised land that the witches of Mariage Sorcière had finally been guided to...`
`There, all wishes are granted, and all magic and dreams are born.`
`......In that garden of gold roses...`
`were two...and only two...witches.`
`I appeared as an uninvited guest,`
` making that atmosphere tremble with unrest.`
`......What was to them a wind of misfortune shook the golden roses.`
`The incredibly beautiful scene formed by the golden rose petals scattered by the wind...`
`was clearly something not of this world...`
`The two who had been taking a walk on a path of golden roses noticed me and were surprised.`
`"...Ange...?`
` ......Beato, it's Ange...!!"`
`"......How did you get here...?`
` ......Leave us alone.`
` I shall no longer invite anyone here."`
`Beato spoke coldly.`
`......She seemed like a completely different person from the boldly sneering woman she had once been.`
`She had closed off her heart...and shut herself up in a world where she was alone with Maria onee-chan.`
`A world where she could always be alone with a friendly Maria onee-chan,`
` lecturing about magic while drinking tea.`
`...With no one to hurry them...and nothing to hold them back.`
`A world where not a single person who might hurt them existed.`
`Yes, to the two of them, it was a small, perfect universe...`
`"......Sorry.`
` ...I can't have you shutting yourself up in here.`
` ...We can't continue the game unless you come back."`
`"I said I stopped because I'd tired of it.`
` I will not return to the game again."`
`"......Beato will always be here with me.`
` Here, we'll drink tea together and think of lots of ways to play...!`
` You can play with us too, Ange."`
`"...MARIA,`
` I believe I said that mustn't happen.`
` I am satisfied as long as I have you alone."`
`"Say that you too are satisfied as long as you have me."`
`".........`
`...Yeah.`
` ...Thank you.`
` The only person who needs me that much is you, Beato.`
` So, I'll be with you.`
` Just us is enough."`
`"......MARIA, ...thanks...`
` ......I am grateful......"`
`Beato held Maria tight,`
` even creating a small, warm universe between their joined arms...`
`......It was probably the birth of the smallest universe in the world.`
`...The smallest universe in the world, which a pair who needed each other could give birth to...`
`No matter how small it was, it was a complete world.`
`......But, I had to tear it apart.`
` ............`
`"...Sorry,`
` ......but I can't let it go like that.`
` I came to smash this Golden Land of Mariage Sorcière."`
`'!s1`
`...are you going to break...`
`...my world......?`
` A-Are you saying that this world is causing anyone other than Maria and me trouble...?!"`
`"You've left Onii-chan waiting all this time...`
`in a game you started and then abandoned without finishing!`
` If you don't return to your seat, the contest won't end for all eternity...!!"`
`"......Hahahahaha, ha...!`
` There is no longer a single player in that game.`
` Battler vanished, and I did as well, coming here.`
` That game is already over."`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, enj_4e1819:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, enj_4e1820:`
` Will you defeat Battler and give birth to the world you truly wished for?!`
` Or will you be defeated and everything swallowed up by your magic released?!!`
` Take responsibility until the very end!!"`
`"......Don't, Ange.`
` Beato will spend her time in this world, alone with me for eternity.`
` ...And I don't need anything else, as long as I have Beato.`
` ...Here, all wishes are granted.`
` Everything is here."`
`......This Golden Land is made up of nothing more than the crystallization of Beatrice's and Maria onee-chan's thoughts.`
`'!s0`
`@`
`destroy it......`
`.........I will destroy this Golden Land, `
`......which must be a final, peaceful world in Beatrice's eyes...`
`"Onee-chan, that's wrong.`
` This Golden Land is a liar.`
` It won't grant the one wish you truly want granted."`
`"......That's not true!!`
` Anything can be granted here!`
` Look, there's even a nice Mama here!!"`
`Gold butterflies gathered behind Maria,`
` forming into a kindly smiling Aunt Rosa.`
`......After smiling sweetly at me,`
` it became golden petals and crumbled.`
`"Here, anything can be created.`
` Even Ange, even Battler, even George onii-chan, even Jessica onee-chan...!!"`
`"You can summon as many as you want, and everyone is nice...!!`
` You come too, Ange, and let's play together...!!"`
`......Sorry, Onee-chan......`
`"And what about Sakutarou...?"`
`"......!"`
`Upon hearing Sakutarou's name, Onee-chan looked like she was choking.`
`"Stop it...`
` Do not speak that name..."`
`Beato's expression changed as well.`
`And she hugged Maria, guarding her shoulders.`
`...Sakutarou's name was still taboo for Onee-chan.`
`"Why can't I say it?`
` It's the name of Maria onee-chan's best friend.`
` ...Why won't you invite that close friend to this wonderful Golden Land?`
` Why, in this Golden Land where any wish can be granted, is Sakutarou the only one you cannot summon?"`
`"Th-That is...`
` ...It's all right, MARIA.`
` You don't have to remember Sakutarou-"`
`"......Sakutaro was killed by Mama!!!!"`
`Maria onee-chan flew into a rage with a terrible expression on her face.`
`Surprised by that voice, the butterflies throughout the garden flew up, `
`...blowing around like a typhoon of flower petals.`
`"Yes, I know.`
` Aunt Rosa...took your precious stuffed animal, Sakutarou, and tore him apart...!!"`
`'!s0`
`Maria's scream became a storm that violently scattered the golden petals and leaves.`
`It truly was a storm of gold.`
`"Stop...!!`
` Stop stop stop...!!!`
` Why are you trying to reopen the wound in MARIA's heart...?!`
` Don't defile the sleep of this precious friend to both Maria and myself...!!"`
`"In that case, why don't you revive that precious friend for her with your magic?"`
`"I'd do it if I could...!!`
` But that stuffed animal was an article Rosa created herself!`
` The magical meaning of that individual object being torn apart is-"`
`"Don't try to fool anyone.`
` Why can't you revive Sakutarou?`
` There's only one answer.`
` It's because you aren't a real witch!"`
`"......I can revive him...!!`
` With my magic, I can revive him as often as I want, like this!!`
` I could even bury this garden in Sakutarous...!!"`
`"Yeah, I'll bet you could, with your magic!`
` But Onee-chan definitely wouldn't be able to see the Sakutarous you create!"`
`"......You know why, right?`
` I'll say it again.`
` It's because you aren't a real witch...!!"`
`"Stop iiiiiiiiiit!!`
` Why do you keep saying such mean things, Ange...?!`
` Beato can use a lot of magic...!`
` She's a wonderful witch...!!"`
`"She couldn't revive just Sakutaro, ...but she can do absolutely anything else...!!`
` So, I can at least...do without...`
`Sakutaro..."`
`"No, Onee-chan, that's wrong.`
` ......There's nothing a witch can't do.`
` As soon as she couldn't do that,`
` it was clear that Beatrice wasn't a real witch."`
`"Th-That's wrong...!!`
` It's because Sakutaro's stuffed animal vessel was something Mama made specially herself, and-"`
`"And that's why she can't revive him?`
` Is Beatrice's...your magic so inconvenient?"`
`"Gah, ......i-in that case, ...are you saying you can revive Sakutarou?!`
` Are you saying you can do that with your magic?!"`
`"I can."`
`"......What......?"`
`"Maria onee-chan!!`
` I'll show you some real magic.`
` I'll revive Sakutarou for you!!"`
`'!s1`
`Really...?`
` Even Beatrice couldn't do it, right...?`
` ...R-`
`Really...?!"`
`"Yes, I can!`
` In exchange, promise me.`
` Once I've revived Sakutarou..."`
`"Yes...!"`
`"...Leave this Golden Land."`
`"......!"`
`"I-I will not permit that...!!`
` This world is MARIA's and mine!!`
` If MARIA leaves, `
`...it will break...!!"`
`The minimum number of Humans it takes to create a universe is two.`
`Otherwise, that world is destroyed.`
`To drag out the witch shut away in the Golden Land, I'll have to destroy this world...!`
`"...Yes, that's the proof that you aren't a witch.`
` ...A real witch can create a universe alone.`
` The Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches!`
` ...The very existence of this alliance proves that you aren't a witch...!!"`
`"N-No...!!`
` I won't hand MARIA over...!!`
` I hate you, leave right now...!!`
` Get out of heeeeeeeeeeeere!!"`
`"Dragging everyone into a game of your own accord, then getting bored and chasing them out when your mood changes!!`
` How selfish can you be?`
` Take a look, Beatrice!!`
` And you, Maria onee-chan!!`
` This...is true magic......!!!"`
`"...W-Will you really revive Sakutaro...?!"`
`"There's no way you can!!`
` This is a Golden Land for Maria and me alone...!`
` There is not a single spell that an outsider like you could use!`
` As you are now, you couldn't even create a single butterfly!!"`
`"Be quiet, Beato!!`
` Don't get in Ange's way...!!"`
`When Maria yelled, `
`...the storm suddenly stopped, and the area returned to silence.`
`......The scene, as a massive number of golden petals that had been blown upwards quietly drifted down,`
` ...was fantastical, as though a golden snow was falling...`
`Maria, thinking about this unlikely, if-only miracle,`
` had unconsciously joined her hands together as though praying.`
`...Beato watched Maria do this, her heart racing.`
`'!s0`
`...Maria would...`
`...this world would...`
`But...it's unthinkable...!`
`Absolutely impossible...`
`That stuffed animal, which had been the only one in the world, was torn apart and thrown away,`
` and not a thread remained.`
`Reviving it was certainly and absolutely impossible...!!`
`#ff0000This is my Golden Land#ffffff...!`
`#ff0000A world where magic that isn't mine certainly cannot exist#ffffff!!!`
`'!s1`
`If you think you can do it, `
`...let's see what you've got, Ushiromiya Angeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`At Beato's scream-like cry, the world lost its sound.`
`I slowly...recited the incantation...for true magic...`
`"......Come, try to remember.`
` Maria's close friend, Sakutarou."`
`"...Try and remember what form you had."`
`"......Try and remember what a lovable stuffed animal you were."`
`"Huh, .........ah, ...ah......"`
`"............!"`
`...Expressions of shock rose to both of their faces.`
`Then, ...pushing Beato's elbow aside, Maria dashed forward...`
`"-kutaro......`
` ......Sakutaro......!!"`
`Then, `
`......she clung to us both.`
`"...It's all right.`
` Sakutarou...isn't going to disappear.`
` ......`
`『Uryu.`
` Maria, I'm home.〝"`
`'!s1`
`...Sakutaro, `
`...uuuuuuuuuuuuuuu, `
`waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuu!!`
` Sakutarooooooo, `
`...I wanted to see you...`
`...so much......"`
`'!s0`
`......that stuffed animal lion, `
`...Sakutarou.`
`Its softness, its texture, its stitches, its everything, `
`......Maria had forgotten.`
`But, `
`......the instant she hugged that stuffed animal, it all came back to her vividly...`
`『Uryu.`
` Maria, `
`...I'm home.〝`
`"Sakutaro, Sakutaro...!!`
` Is your body all right?`
` Does it hurt anywhere?`
` Even though...something so horrible was done to you, are you all okay...?!"`
`『Uryu...!`
` Ange revived me with magic, so I'm perfectly fine...!〝`
`"Thank goodness, `
`...thank goodness...`
` Welcome back, Sakutaro...`
` Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!"`
`『From now on, I'll always be with you, Maria.`
` Together for eternity.`
` ...So,`
` don't let go of me, okay......?〝`
`"Yeah, ...won't let go...`
`...for all eternity........."`
`Then, still hugging Sakutarou,`
` she looked up at me with tear-filled eyes...`
`"...Thank you, Ange...!`
` ......Ange's magic is amazing...`
`...How?`
` How can you revive Sakutarou?!`
` When Beato couldn't do it...!"`
`"......Impossible...`
` ...Impossible...`
` ...How?`
` ...How can a human other than me use magic in my Golden Land?!?!`
` This is...`
`...completely impossible...!"`
`"What are you so flustered about, Beatrice?`
` .........This is...magic, right?"`
`"There's no way that's magic...!!`
` #ff0000This is my Golden Land#ffffff!!`
` #ff0000A world where magic that isn't mine certainly cannot exist#ffffff!!`
` And my `
`#ff0000magic was not able to revive Sakutarou#ffffff...!!"`
`"There's no way it could!!`
` #ff0000That is a special stuffed animal#ffffff!`
` #ff0000Made by Rosa for her daughter's birthday, and in the entire world, the only#ffffff-"`
`"......Ah,`
` .........nngg,`
` .........aaah..."`
`".........See,`
` ...it's magic, right?"`
`'!s1`
`...ooh, `
`...aah, `
`...aaahhh, `
`......aaaaaaaahhh..."`
`'!s0`
`@`
`She looked at Maria and Sakutarou innocently frolicking around, `
`...looked at me, `
`......and then...`
`...fell to her knees, `
`...with even her hands pressed to the ground, `
`......and cried.`
`"Beatrice...! This really is magic, right...?!`
` It's magic, right?!`
` Beatrice...!!!"`
`"......Indeed...`
` ...It is magic...`
`'!s1`
`real...`
`magic......"`
`"Why can Ange use a magic that even Beato couldn't?!`
` Why?!`
` Why?!`
` Ange's amazing, Ange's an amazing witch!`
` A real witch who's much, much more amazing than me...!!!"`
`"Yeah, that's right, Onee-chan.`
` .........I am the Witch of Resurrection, ANGE.`
` ...There's nothing that can't be revived by me."`
`"Amazing, incredible!!`
` Even Beato said that the magic of resurrection was the hardest!!`
` ANGE's incredible!!`
` A really real Great Witch...!!!"`
`At that time, Maria's and Sakutarou's forms flashed gold,`
` ...and the forms of the two became golden flower petals...that crumbled away...`
`As the two became a golden wind and swirled together,`
` ......they left for some other peaceful place, not here.`
`Beato had, ...as promised, banished Maria from the Golden Land.`
`"...Goodbye, ...Maria onee-chan.`
` And...be happy forever.`
` ......Don't worry, you definitely exist in Onee-chan's world too.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` But that isn't ~ib~you~ib~."`
`'!s1`
`...Maria...`
` ...As your close friend, `
`......I celebrate this reunion...from the bottom of my heart......"`
`On Beato's face...was a mixture of what was probably every expression a human could muster.`
`It was `
`joy,`
` anger, `
`and sadness.`
`"......That's...the source of magic, isn't it?`
` ......Without love,`
` without sadness,`
` without anger,`
` ......magic cannot be 'seen'."`
`The ground shook.`
` ...An earthquake.`
`......It gradually summoned greater and greater fissures...`
`and began to tear Beatrice's final paradise apart.`
`Golden butterflies fluttered about, trying to escape, but there was nowhere to escape to.`
`...And...Beatrice was the same.`
`The Golden Land began to crumble away.`
`The earth crumbled downwards like a floor falling through, `
`......and Beatrice was sucked into the depths of a jet-black darkness.`
`Then, she was mercilessly slammed against a jet-black floor.`
`...It was a dimly-lit...smoking room.`
`There was no door to exit by, and while there was a window, it let no light...`
`into Beatrice's shadowy smoking room.`
`Even though Beato was moaning from the pain of being slammed against that cold, hard floor,`
` she shakily rose to her feet...`
`There was a seat there...`
`...And the game table, ...still just as it had been when she'd left it.`
`The game board also remained in the same state that Beato had left it in.`
`"That's your seat.`
` Sit."`
`'!s1`
`...for me to sit in......?"`
`Beato put a hand against her own seat...and laughed sadly.`
`"Win or lose.`
` That's all you've been given.`
` A tie during the process of reaching that point will probably be permitted."`
`"......However, you won't be allowed to suspend the game and throw it away!`
` Will you win and survive, or lose and disappear?`
` Until one of those two things happens, you will not be permitted to rise from that chair!!`
` That should be your only duty as the host of a witch's game, as the Golden Witch, Beatrice...!!"`
`Laughing weakly, Beato...`
`sat in that seat.`
`...Then, she rested her elbows and covered her face with both hands, `
`......showing off a smile with nothing but her mouth.`
`"......Not permitted to escape an unwinnable game...`
` ...Then, very well.`
` ...Why don't I repeat this...until I lose...?"`
`"Quit being so fainthearted!`
` Win.`
` Use the best moves you have...!!`
` You started this game!`
` You have a duty to make the best moves possible!!`
` Give all that indecisive fooling around a rest!"`
`At that time, there was a violent sound.`
`...Beato felt a cold, pathetic sensation on her leg.`
`"...Gotcha...!`
` I finally got you, eh, Beatooo?"`
`"Oh, Great Lady Lambdadelta, is it...?`
` ......To think that you were still here."`
`Beato's foot was caught in an ice-cold steel shackle,`
` ...tying her to the chair she sat in.`
`...She would no longer be able to escape from this seat.`
`"Hoohhohhohoho!`
` You won't be able to escape anymore, got it?`
` I can be more persistent than I look. Surprised?"`
`"......It's more surprising that you don't realize how persistent you look."`
`"You are not permitted to leave early or suspend this game.`
` You'll fight for all eternity in order to win, okay?`
` ......You don't want to lose, do you?`
` You want a little peek at the kind of wonderful world you'll be thrown into if you lose?"`
`"DON'T WORRY.`
` You can win, because I, the Great Lady Lambdadelta, will be looking after you `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`constantly `
`~ib~until you win~ib~`
`, for all eternity...!!"`
`"............`
`...Hmph, ...hahahahaha.`
` ......But even if I wish to fight, there is no opponent seated across from me, correct...?"`
`"......Don't worry, I found Battler."`
`When Bernkastel appeared and clapped her hands,`
` Battler appeared from the sky and plopped into the opposite chair.`
`Battler's eyes were slightly opened, but there was no sparkle in them, almost like a doll's.`
`Without one of the pillars that established his soul, `
`......he had fallen into the depths of the depths of darkness...and had been drifting about all this time.`
`...He should have then scattered and disappeared like mist.`
`Bernkastel had managed to scrape him together.`
`It's incredible that she managed to bring him back into a human form.`
`However, even though his flesh had returned, his soul had not.`
`...It had been blown away by Beatrice after having its existence denied.`
`It wouldn't come back easily.`
`"......Battler won't run from this fight either.`
` Not until he defeats you.`
` ...Just because your chances of winning are shrinking doesn't mean you'll be permitted the inelegance of abandoning everything and running.`
` Even he doesn't want that.`
` ......Isn't that right, Ushiromiya Battler...?"`
`Battler didn't answer.`
`...His heart was still...dead.`
`His eyes wavered slightly at the question, but he couldn't answer.`
`"Battler...!`
` Get ahold of yourself!`
` You are here.`
` And the enemy is before your eyes...!`
` Fight!`
` Fight to win!!"`
`Battler lazily repeated that, speaking incoherently.`
`......He'd come back.`
`The wound he bore on his soul was no small thing.`
`That was only natural.`
`Beatrice had woven her red, and he had been denied.`
`He had learned that the mother he'd respected was not his birth mother,`
` ...and he didn't know who he was.`
`...He was not...`
`Ushiromiya Battler......`
`"Don't talk stupid!`
` You are Ushiromiya Battler, no one else!`
` No matter who acknowledges that or denies that, make sure you believe it yourself...!!`
` After all, you're the only one who can create your own world.`
` Don't lose the world where you're Ushiromiya Battler!"`
`'!s1`
`......who...`
`am I......?`
` I'm not my mom's child, right...?`
` Where was I born from...?"`
`Battler asked that question as his eyes, which still hadn't regained their sparkle, stared lazily up at the ceiling.`
`Of course, she answered right away.`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` Beato proclaimed it with the red truth.`
` ...So I'll proclaim it too.`
` #ff0000Ushiromiya Battler is not Ushiromiya Asumu's son.#ffffff"`
`"......Hmph, ...in that case, he is not qualified to be the opponent in my game, correct...?"`
`"Beatrice, repeat it.`
` 'Ushiromiya Battler is not Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild'."`
`"............"`
`As Beato wrinkled her forehead, `
`...a painful-looking smile rose to her face.`
`"So you refuse to repeat it.`
` Beato proclaimed two red truths, `
`'#ff0000Battler is not Asumu's son#ffffff'`
` and `
`'#ff0000No one except Kinzo's grandchild Battler is qualified to be her opponent#ffffff'.`
` The following theory will allow Battler to be accepted without creating any contradictions.`
` Here's my blue truth, listen to it...!"`
`#5decffThe one qualified to be Beato's opponent is 'Kinzo's grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler', `
`and whether you're 'Asumu's son' or not isn't a problem.`
`Thus, even if you aren't Asumu's son, you can still be Kinzo's grandchild.`
`As long as you're Rudolf's son!#ffffff`
`"Hmph, it was just a silly word game, wasn't it?"`
`"......Your blue truth is valid.`
` Beato, your counterargument with the red truth?`
` If you cannot counter it with the red, Battler's qualifications as an opponent will stand unchallenged."`
`"............"`
`......Battler was still out of it.`
`He still couldn't really understand what she was saying for him.`
`...But even so, his spirit was starting to come back, bit by bit...`
`'!s1`
`......who...`
`...am I...?"`
`"Get ahold of yourself!`
` You are Ushiromiya Battler!`
` Yeah, maybe Mother Asumu didn't give birth to you.`
` But so what?!`
` That doesn't change in the slightest the fact that she was a mother to you, right?!"`
`"......For example, what is Ushiromiya Ange to you?`
` You might not share the same blood, but she's still your little sister, right?!`
` It's not about blood, it's about bonds, right?!"`
`"......That's...right...`
` ...Even though we don't share the same blood, ...Ange is...`
`...my little sister."`
`"Say it in red!`
` Say that Ange is your little sister!!"`
`"......`
`#ff0000Ange is...my little sister#ffffff.`
` ......Ah, ......I could say it."`
`She hugged Battler, who was still out of it and slumped in his chair, strongly from behind.`
`So much that it hurt.`
`"I don't know why Mother Asumu wasn't your birth mother.`
` But still, up until today and even now, you believe that she's your mother, right?!`
` In this world, there are plenty of people without even a mother, `
`...without even a family!!"`
`"Did Mother Asumu ever let you feel lonely?`
` Never, right?!`
` Don't throw your peaceful family away so easily!!`
` Your family bonds have gotten too thin after leaving your family for six years!!"`
`"You have to feel those family bonds much, much more strongly!`
` Remember!!`
` For Mother Asumu's sake as well, don't lose your love over a foolish witch's rant like this!"`
`".........`
`......You're right...`
` ...Mom was...always on my side...`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, but_4e867:`
`...and I wanna go home...`
` Where's...`
`all my...`
`...family...?"`
`The light still hadn't returned to Battler's eyes.`
`But...tears appeared.`
`"Your little sister is waiting at home for you to come back.`
` If even you don't come back, ...she'll be all alone forever...!`
` For your little sister's sake, please, win this witch's game...!!"`
`'!s1`
`...my...`
`little sister......`
` ...But I still...`
`...don't get it...`
` ......Why...`
`do I have to keep repeating this incomprehensible, cruel game with Beato...?`
` ......I've...`
`had enough......"`
`"In that case, settle this game quickly and go back home!!`
` Ushiromiya Battler, how long are you going to play around in a place like this?!`
` Your little sister is waiting for you to come home!!!"`
`......That's right.`
`Battler had been caught up in this strange game before he even knew it.`
`And, still unable to understand why he was fighting,`
` he had been constantly sucked into the witch's pace, played with and made to fight.`
`That should've been his most simple and first question.`
`...Because he didn't understand that, he had lost his purpose in fighting...!!`
`That's why my voice won't reach Battler's ears...!`
`Instead of a vague purpose, like winning against the witch, or because he couldn't forgive her...`
`...He has to be aware of a purpose for which he must win.`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, but_4e882:`
` ...I want to go home to Dad and Mom...`
`and Ange...`

`...enough, `
`enough..."`
`"Battler's soul...is starting to come back."`
`"......But it can't quite reach."`
`"You've had enough, right?!`
` Then fight so that you can return to your family!!`
` Destroy Beatrice and go home!!"`
`"No, ...I've had enough of witches...!`

` #ff0000Finish her...!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000Then, take your family back!!#ffffff`

`"......Beato did that...`
`...to my family......?"`
`"...Hmph, ......as she says.`
` I will not run away or hide from it.`
` ...I stole Ushiromiya Ange's family away from her."`
`"Battler is my toy!`
` His father and mother are both my toys.`
` ...I won't give them back to you.`
` ...You may continue to wander all alone forever, awaiting the return of a family that will never come back...!"`
`From Ange's arms that held him, ......the painful, sad days...`
`that had been experienced by his lonely little sister...flowed into Battler...`
`...Because he'd been playing around in a place like this,`
` ......his little sister had been left all by herself, ......had been forced to endure...`
`...all that pain......!!`
`"...Ange, ......Ange......!!`
` Damn, ...I......what am I doing......?!!`
` Thanks, Ange...`
` Your Onii-chan...has been forgetting something important this whole time...!"`
`Battler tried to turn around,`
` but Ange was hanging onto his head with an incredible force, so he couldn't turn back.`
`...Was it sweat?`
`Hot drops were splashing on the nape of Battler's neck.`
`...What they were...he knew from holding Ange's arm that clung to him.`
`......Because it stained Battler's hand, his fingers, ...red.`
`"......Blood...`
` ...A-Ange?!`
` A-Are you okay?!`
` H-Hey...?!"`
`It dripped and splashed.`
`He didn't know what was going on.`
`Battler didn't know, because he couldn't turn around,`
` but the hot drops that stained his entire back were surely...blood.`
`'!s1`
` In order to come here, `
`there was a single rule...`
`I had to follow...`
` ......This...`
`is it.`
` ...Letting you, Onii-chan, `
`...know...`
`that I was...`
`...Ange......"`
`...It was so hard......`
`Even though Onii-chan was right before my eyes, ...I couldn't even say that......`
`As long as I followed this rule, ...I should've been able to stay by Onii-chan's side for all eternity.`
`'!s1`
`to play in the game against the witch...`
`for eternity with Onii-chan...`
`'!s1`
`......that's no good.`
` ......Onii...`
`nnn...`
`...chan, `
`...you have to come back...`
` ......Your sister's waiting for you...`
`...at home...`
` ......That person isn't me,`
` ......but this way, your sister...`
`will be saved......"`
`"Ange?!`
` Ange!!`
` There's so much blood...!!`
` So much, so much!!"`
`He wanted to turn around, but Ange was gripping his head too tightly.`
`However, judging by the blood that was pouring out and Ange's pained breathing,`
` he realized that something seriously wrong was happening to her right now.`
`"......Don't...worry......`
` ...I am only...a piece...`
` ......You know, in chess, ...they have this move called a sacrifice..."`
`"Sacri...what?!`
` Who cares about chess?!!`
` Let's get you some first-aid quickly!!`
` Let go for a second, Ange...!!"`
`"......A sacrifice...is an abandoned piece.`
` For a tactical gain, you intentionally accept a loss and let a piece go..."`
`In chess, the ultimate goal is victory.`
`...So, if it can bring you to victory in the end, there's nothing wrong with sacrificing a few individual pieces.`
`Ange had cooly made a decision.`
`......She had been taught over and over again that she was a piece, not a player.`
`...In order to act like a piece and save Battler, right now, she would have to become a sacrificial piece herself.`
`......Battler had to know.`
`His purpose in this witch's game couldn't be something as abstract as finishing off the witch.`
`He had to win the game, release himself, and bring his family back home.`
`Why?`
` ......Because he had family, a little sister, who was waiting for him to come home.`
`A being was created so that Ushiromiya Ange's voice could reach you.`
`That's me, ANGE Beatrice...!!`
`I'll sacrifice the piece I am to give to you the will to fight, to give you purpose!`
`My purpose isn't to play with you in a witch's game for all eternity!`
`I came to bring you Ushiromiya Ange's mourning and sadness!`
` That is my unshakable purpose!`
`"......Ange!!`
` Ange!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaarrrghhh!!!"`
`The white, thin arm that held Battler...became pale and transparent, almost like wax.`
`...And even so, the fresh blood...stained it so cruelly...`
`'!s1`
`...disappear now, but...`
` ...Onii-chan, fight with all you've got, `
`......and I'm sure, you'll...`
`...come back to me......`
` ......I'll be waiting, `
`......always......`
` ...I'd planned on helping you out a lot more than this, `
`...but I couldn't do anything.`
` ...Sorry............"`
`"D-Don't worry about that...!!`
` You...taught me, didn't you...?!`
` You taught me why I have to win...!`
` And that...I've got to win for certain...and come back to you...!!"`
`"What......am I doing, lazing about in a place like this...?!!`
` Yeah, I won't play around anymore...!!`
` 'Cause I'll come back, I'll come home!!`
` I'll definitely come home, bringing a souvenir, I promise...!!!"`

`...As though...just a human's insides had been pulverized and tossed there like scrap.`
`...As though Ange, who had been standing there until a second ago, had been crushed......`
`"Ange...?`
` ...Wh-Where's Ange...?`
` Where did Ange disappear to...?`
` H-Hey!`
` Where did Ange go?!"`
`The two young-looking witches said nothing...`
`...and just silently looked at the mountain of blood and meat and clothes.`
`But...I didn't want to accept it.`
`...I definitely didn't want to accept it!!!`
`".........I was right in front of you.`
` ......I was watching the whole time.`
` Watching what happened......to Ange behind you."`
`"...D-Do you know...?`
` ......Where...did Ange go......?"`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, bea_4e997:`
`tore chunks of flesh the size of a thumb off her...`
`and threw them away.`
` ......I was watching.`
` I saw as countless cruel tools, burned red-hot in the witch's furnace, approached Ange from behind, `
`and one bit at a time, ...pecked at her, twisted her, ripped chunks off her, ...and tore her to pieces."`
`"......Ange should be proud.`
` In order to share some last words with her brother, `
`...she stopped herself from gasping at that pain until the very end..."`
`...As if something like that could have happened...`
`'!s0`
`...what had fallen there...`
`...was without a doubt, what she had been wearing on her head, those pink-jeweled...hair ornaments.`
`To be honest, I'd thought they were a bit too childish for her and didn't suit her...`
`...So I remembered them well.`
`......Why did Ange wear such cheap hair ornaments all the time...?`
`No, no, `
`...the thought that this is Ange...`
`...couldn't possibly be...`
`uu, uuuuuuuuuu...!`
`".........You're pretty blunt, Beato."`
`"Battler didn't see it, `
`so you could've just said she turned into butterflies and flew away, or something."`
`'!s1`
`You guys also...`
`...s-saw...`
`...that happen...?`
` Y-`
`You saw...`
`Ange...`
`get torn into little bits...?`
` You were watching, `
`......and yet, `
`...you stayed...`
`so calm the whole time......?!"`
`Without answering, Bernkastel, Lambdadelta,`
` and Beatrice stared at me,`
` ...some in pity, ...others in derision, ...watching me......`
`Since she'd called herself Gretel,`
` and after what had happened with Virgilia in the last game, ...I'd thought she might be Beato's underling,`
` and I'd been wary of her, not trusting her even though she was an ally...`
`'!s0`
`......after learning that it truly was Ange, `
`...without even being allowed to see her face, `
`......I turn around...`
`and find...`
`something...`
`like this...`
` ......Aaaaaaaggghhh......!`
`"Why does it matter?`
` ......All this about your little sister."`
`"...What...did you say......?"`
`"After all, you'll never return from this place for all eternity anyway.`
` ......Whatever happens to your little sister in a world where you don't come home has nothing to do with you.`
` As long as you play here, the Anges of countless worlds will live in isolation,`
` and the same pain of her final moments just now will be forced upon her, spread over a period of more than a decade."`
`"......However, that is of no importance, correct?`
` It cannot be 'seen' by you from here.`
` You cannot observe it.`
` An unobservable fact cannot be proven except by the red truth."`
`"Therefore, your anxiety over Ange's misfortune after this may be needless.`
` ......She might, surprisingly, be able to live a casual life without ever having to work thanks to Rudolf's inheritance, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`...That's...`
`a lie.`
`From Ange's arm, every part of that sad future world had poured into me in an instant.`
`'!s0`
`I keep on...`
`lazing about forever...`
`and playing in a place like this......!!`
`...I...`
`never thought about anyone but myself...`
`I must defeat her!`
` I'll take back my family, `
`back to where Ange's waiting, ...and come home as soon as I can......!`
`Because even as I hang around with the witch like this,`
` Ange's heart continues to be torn to bits by sadness...!!`
`"......Ange, is this...`
`...what you wanted to see...?"`
`'!s0`
`...yet with all my might, `
`...pointed...`
`"......Beatrice..."`
`"Indeed."`
`"......Resume this game.`
` ......I won't run away anymore, ...and I won't let you escape."`
`"Bring it on.`
` I can no longer escape or hide.`
` ......Let us decide this between you and me for good."`
`"......One shall win.`
` One shall lose and be destroyed.`
` No other resolution can exist."`
`"......I'll win.`
` No matter how long it takes, I'll definitely smash you...!!`
` There aren't gonna be any more compromises, interruptions or losses by default in this contest!!`
` I won't run away!`
` I won't let you get away!!"`
`"Try and defeat me with everything you've got...!!`
` There's absolutely no need for stupid tricks and deceit, for intermingling and acting friendly!!`
` You and I are enemies...!!!`
` I have to settle this as soon as possible......and bring my family back to Ange!!!"`
`...Unwavering resolve.`
`...Certain willpower.`
`The certain willpower of a Human becomes certain magical power.`
`...That leads to a miracle...and promises that it shall be so.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`Yes, this is a promised, ~ib~certain miracle~ib~.`
`.........Are my chances at victory not even one in a billion...?`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` No, shall it be ~ib~certainly impossible, without any Fragment of a miracle~ib~?`
`Before I knew it, a cold, stiff chain had bound my other leg without a sound,`
` tying me to the chair...`
`......All that's left is to either be killed and lose to Battler...`
`or resist and continue in an endless tie for all eternity.`
`...Or perhaps I should say it's to continue tying until I've prepared my heart for death.`
`Either way, I...`
`......Must fight to lose, and nothing more.`
`I have already been bound by the chains of eternity.`
`And Battler won't let me escape either.`
`...Should I pathetically beg his forgiveness...?`
`Should I beg for compassion by appealing to his pitying heart...?`
`Should I forget appearances and prostrate myself?`
`Because of the chains, even that choice will not be granted me.`
`...Checkmate.`
`This is a perfect stranglehold.`
`............However.`
`I am the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
`The demon lord of gold who reigns in the Golden Land.`
`Even in a fight to lose, there is an attitude fitting for me.`
`And I have the right to adorn my death in a manner suited to me.`
`"......I am no different.`
` I'll make you accept the existence of my magic, and the door to the Golden Land will open on this island.`
` You shall become the guest of honor at that first tea party."`
`"Everyone besides you has gathered already, you see?`
` Because the honored guest's arrival has been delayed, the tea party cannot begin."`
`"Your father, mother, cousins and everyone else are getting tired of waiting for your arrival."`
`"Sure, that's perfect, that's just perfect!!`
` What the hell is magic, what the hell are witches...?!!`
` I'm done playing with you!!`
` Here we go, Beatrice...!!!"`
`"Come as hard as you can, for there will be no compromise, interruptions or losing by default.`
` One shall win, and one shall be destroyed.`
` If you have no desire to lose, then you must defeat me, kill me.`
` However, I won't be killed so easily.`
` Until you can prepare a fitting end for me, I can resist over and over again."`
`"Can you do that?`
` ...No, you probably can.`
` You surely can.`
` Come on, come and kill me.`
` ......"`
`".........Is it that hard?`
` Then let's go with the usual.`
` ........."`
`'!s1`
` As if I'd be killed!`
` Even if I can't win, I can at least harass you enough to stop you from snatching victory, riiiiiiiiiiiight?!"`
`"Hoh, that's a good look on your face!`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` Uhhyahhahahahahaha, `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"Try and kill me, `
`try and kill me, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeroooooooooooooooooooohhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!"`
`......I don't have a clue what's going on.`
`Please, someone explain in a way even I can understand...`
`what happened yesterday.`
`I was in the kitchen of the mansion, grabbing some food without permission.`
`If you open up that massive business-class refrigerator, you can find anything.`
`You can eat and drink as much as you like.`
`...Even if the typhoon didn't clear up for a week, I'd have more than enough to eat.`
`With wine in one hand, I was helping myself to some dry-cured ham.`
`I wonder just how expensive this wine and ham are.`
`You ingredients are out of luck too.`
`If only you'd had Gohda-san to cook you, you could've been reborn as much more incredible food...`
`I looked at the clock.`
`Very soon, it would be 24:00.`
`October 5, the second day, would end.`
`......The insane October 4, yesterday, seemed like a lie.`
`...That's how much...nothing had happened after that test thing.`
`Nothing happened.`
`No phone call came, and no letters came.`
`No person came, and no one attacked me.`
`Nothing happened at all.`
`I wanna start demanding a refund on all the time and energy that tension stole from me,`
` ......because after that, for an entire day, a full 24 hours...`
`...Nooothing happened.`
`So surely, nothing's gonna happen now.`
`......A full 24 hours ago...`
`...Beatrice called me to the spot in front of the mansion's entrance.`
`There, I was given a strange test to determine the Successor to the Headship or whatever.`
`I gave a serious answer in my own way, but it somehow hadn't meshed with the other side.`
`Beatrice got pissed for no reason and fell silent.`
`I yelled at her to try and say something, but she gave no answer.`
`When I asked where Maria was, she just told me to go to the chapel and left.`
`To tell the truth, it was an anticlimax.`
`...No matter what kind of weird test you give, at least tell me whether I've passed or failed.`
`Are you trying to say 'Thanks for coming, your results will be mailed to you later' or something?`
` ...Quit messing with me.`
`Anyway, I then headed to the chapel.`
`...After failing their tests, both George-aniki and Jessica were killed.`
`I couldn't let Maria get killed too.`
`...Also, I might get a chance to catch some person trying to kill her.`
`As a little kid, I often heard from Jessica that you'd get in trouble if you went near the chapel,`
` so I'd never been there, but I at least knew where it was.`
`I couldn't find any trace of a person there,`
` ......but there was a key bundle lying in front of the door.`
`I thought this might be someone telling me to open the door, but after trying all the keys, I found that none of them fit.`
`I also called Maria's name, but there was no answer whatsoever.`
`I searched around the chapel, but there was a limit to what I could do in the pitch black with just a flashlight.`
`I realized that this key bundle might be a set of master keys, which could make it possible to open the door to the mansion.`
`I found no sign of Maria, so I returned to the mansion.`
`The mansion was wrapped in silence.`
`And, in a horrible stench.`
`However, it's amazing how good humans are at adapting.`
`The inside of the mansion must still be wrapped up in that smell.`
`However, I grew completely used to it and stopped minding it.`
`It didn't seem any worse than any old house where someone had burnt some meat.`
`At first, I was bewildered by the stench, but I decided to head to the dining hall for the time being...`
`and found those corpses that were so pitiful, Gohda-san and the rest had hesitated to speak of them in detail.`
`It was the remains of Aunt Natsuhi and the others who'd become the first victims.`
`Half of each head had been completely split open,`
` and it was so gruesome that even without knowing a thing about examining corpses, I could say that they were 100% dead...`
`...And on top of that, the remaining halves of their faces were left like normal, so it was even easy to identify them.`
`...Really convenient corpses, these were.`
`And in addition to those six bodies...was one more.`
`This seventh corpse......was Maria.`
`She lay next to Aunt Rosa, as though sleeping alongside her.`
`......I cried.`
`At the death of an innocent young girl.`
` And at the cruel way my dad and the rest had died.`
`I raced through the mansion swinging the hat-stand spear, yelling 'Come out here, bastard'.`
`...But I couldn't find any trace of anyone else.`
`Thinking they might be planning to hide somewhere and attack me from behind, I went around searching for hiding places,`
` sometimes growing more cautious,`
` and sometimes intentionally letting my guard down in various ways, but in the end, not even a kitten appeared...`
`Then, morning came.`
`...My tension and fatigue combined with my drowsiness, making for the worst kind of dawn.`
`Humans are pretty incredible.`
`...Even when a murderer might been hiding somewhere, we prioritize drowsiness and fatigue over our own lives.`
`...By that time, I was starting to feel pretty ridiculous.`
`After all, for a full six hours before dawn, I'd walked around the mansion, yelling at the culprits to show themselves.`
`My search had been a careful one, and I'd tired myself out and let my guard down.`
`Even so, no one came to attack me.`
`Basically, I lost patience with them and figured they could do whatever the hell they wanted......`
`The boat won't come until the typhoon passes.`
`They said on TV that it won't pass until tomorrow, so I've got another full day today.`
`Lazing about lost its interest,`
` ...and even though I knew it would probably make the police mad, I decided to play detective a bit.`
`First was the dining hall, where the very first murder had occurred.`
`The six who had been killed in the beginning really were pitiful.`
`...The weapon used was probably a gun.`
`Maybe their heads were split by something powerful, like a magnum bullet or a shotgun.`
`It was a reasonable theory to hold.`
`Compared to that, the seventh corpse, Maria, had died in a much better and cleaner way.`
`At a glance, I could see no external wounds and didn't understand how she'd been killed.`
`But by her mouth were traces of bubbles that she might've spat out,`
` and it looked like a typical death by poisoning that you might see in a TV drama.`
`Wasn't Maria called out to the chapel and given a test...?`
`...So why was she in the corpse-filled dining hall, lying next to her mother, dead...?`
`Even if the cause of death was poison, ...who gave it to her?`
`Her clothes weren't disturbed at all.`
`It's hard to imagine that she was forcibly pushed down and given an injection of poison.`
`......It's probably better to assume that she was given a capsule of poison or something and made to swallow it.`
`But compared to the scattered and violently mutilated corpses in this room, Maria's corpse was too clean.`
`If they had a gun, they only needed to pull the trigger.`
` But poisoning, whether by having her drink it or by an injection, would take a lot more effort.`
`Considering the culprit's brutal nature, you'd think Maria's death alone was given special treatment.`
`Why was only Maria given a sleep-like death?`
`......True, being killed is always a pitiful thing,`
` ...but for some reason, Maria's death alone seemed very courteous to me...`
`Both of Maria's hands were joined on her chest, as though the dead person had put them there herself.`
`...Did Maria do that herself before dying...?`
`...Isn't this usually something done by someone else after the person dies...?`
`As though sleeping with her mother, whose head was half crushed, Maria dozed in peace.`
`...For some reason, that contrast really bugged me.`
`Including the direct cause, it's probably safe to say that Maria's death is shrouded in mystery...`
`And more than anything else.`
`The biggest mystery of this dining hall...was the 'pitfalls'.`
`...The 'pitfalls' that both Uncle Krauss's group and Gohda-san's had mentioned.`
`After the first six were killed, five more fell through 'pitfalls' and were captured.`
`......What are pitfalls?`
`Those things that suddenly open and you fall through them, right...?`
`The room had a solid floor with a carpet that looked dignified, if a bit worn out.`
`...No matter how you looked at it, it was single piece.`
`If a pitfall had opened up, there would have to be a seam just in that place.`
`...And, if there had been some trick like a pitfall, wouldn't it creak when you walked on it??`
`No matter how much I walked around, feeling the carpet, I just couldn't imagine that a pitfall was hidden here.`
`Anyway, it'd be one thing if a single person fell, but a full five people did.`
`...By putting together everyone's stories, each one of them had fallen from a different location,`
` so at the very least, there had to be five separate places with pitfalls.`
`......So what does this mean?`
`Was this room actually made with pitfalls across the entire floor,`
` so by pushing a button, you could open up a pitfall in the location of your choice, ...some kind of contraption like that??`
`That kind of ridiculous mechanism would be surprising even in a ninja mansion.`
`...But if Dad and the rest had heard about this, `
`I wonder if they'd say 'I wouldn't put it past Grandfather to do it, to make it'.`
`...At any rate, I didn't learn anything more from the dining hall.`
`Do the pitfalls not exist?`
` Or do they exist, but I just can't find them, amateur that I am?`
`I can't say for sure.`
`Since they claimed that the pitfalls were there,`
` ...I can't ignore them, even if I can't find them...`
`The next ones to be killed were Jessica and George-aniki.`
`I'd discovered George-aniki when I'd been called out for my test.`
`He had been called out to the arbor in the rose garden...and, probably, shot in the forehead with a gun.`
`Jessica had been called to her own room on the second floor of the mansion.`
`The door to her room was locked.`
`But that wasn't a problem at all, since I had a master key.`
`Inside the room, ......it was horrible.`
`...But after the dining hall, I was used to corpses, ...so I'd built up a bit of an immunity.`
`The phone receiver was loose and dangling.`
`...Had she been killed while still on the phone with me?`
`Jessica was leaning against the wall right next to it, `
`...with half of her head split open.`
`As far as I could tell by glancing at the scene, ...it looked as though she'd been killed while on the phone.`
`In that case, had the culprit been right there before her eyes?`
`......I hadn't gotten that impression when listening to Jessica's voice over the phone.`
`I'm pretty sure Jessica said... 'They got me'.`
`It's probably best to assume that she'd already received a fatal wound at the time of the phone call.`
`That's right, and she also said this.`
`"When you come, Battler, I'll be a corpse with half of its head split open."`
` Yes, that's what she said.`
`......From what I could tell by looking at Jessica's corpse, there were no wounds on her other than the damage to her head.`
`Could she have had an injury serious enough to make her prepared for death, and then died halfway through the phone call?`
`But the way she'd talked on the phone made me think that she'd escaped harm for the time being.`
`You shouldn't be able to have a casual conversation over a phone if the culprit's right before your eyes.`
`So, did the culprit come in partway through the phone call and kill Jessica...?`
`......No, that can't be right.`
`After all, this room was locked.`
`...Wait, that doesn't tell me anything.`
`...If the culprit stole a master key from one of the victims, locking the door would be meaningless.`
`But she had no external wounds other than her head.`
`......In that case, should I assume that the fatal wound she was prepared to die from and the actual external wound that damaged her head were two different things,`
` and that both of them were made to the same part of the body?`
`In other words, Jessica was struck severely to the head...and received an incredibly bad wound.`
`Then she called me...and either lost consciousness or died while on the phone.`
`Then, the culprit came and damaged her head again, ...something like that.`
`After being called to this room, Jessica was attacked by the culprit and received a serious injury.`
`Then, the culprit thought she'd been killed...and went away for the time being.`
`...But Jessica miraculously started breathing again...and called me with what would become her dying message.`
`Then, the culprit realized that they'd failed to kill her...and rushed back to deliver the final blow after Jessica fell unconscious from massive blood loss...`
`......That seems to add up, more or less.`
`Except for how Jessica was able to accurately predict the nature of that final blow.`
`And, there was one more thing that bugged me about the phone call from Jessica.`
`Jessica had said this...`
`"George nii-san's done for too.`
` That was...an instant death."`
`...She said it almost as though she'd witnessed George-aniki being killed.`
`But while you certainly could see the rose garden from the window in Jessica's room,`
` and you could even see the roof of the arbor where George-aniki had been summoned, ......it was very far away.`
`Add on the fact that it was the night of a typhoon, and it's very hard to imagine that she was able to witness everything that happened by the arbor from this window.`
`...And more than anything else.`
`Jessica left before George-aniki.`
`So she shouldn't have known that George-aniki's test took place by the arbor.`
`Why did Jessica know...that George-aniki had been killed...?`
`......Also, during my search of the entire mansion, I found Kyrie-san's corpse as well.`
`It was in one of the old guest rooms, at the back of the first floor.`
`In the past, before the construction of the guesthouse, the relatives had spent the night in these.`
`...Kyrie-san's situation matched Jessica's perfectly.`
`She'd probably been killed during her phone call with me.`
`The receiver was hanging untidily, ...and Kyrie-san lay crumpled in that corner.`
`But the way she had been killed was very different from Jessica.`
`Her head wasn't smashed.`
`...Instead, a stake with an occult design was buried into her forehead.`
`...It was so gruesome, ...so I pulled it out.`
`After pulling it, I realized that this might get me into trouble with the police later.`
`So, a little too late, I set it down by Kyrie-san's side.`
`Its tip was sharp and stained with enough blood that it must have penetrated fully to the brain.`
`I didn't know what kind of metal it was made of, but it was about as heavy as a paperweight.`
`Certainly, if you were stabbed all-out with something like this, it might cause a terrible wound.`
`......I...probably knew what that stake meant.`
`...It's one of those.`
`The style of killing from the fourth twilight onwards in the witch's epitaph.`
`...It's probably that 'gouge with a stake and kill' thing.`
`However, a human skull is very firm.`
`......No matter how much someone mustered their strength, could it really have been pierced so neatly...?`
`No.`
`...By my reasoning, this stake wasn't the cause of death, but had just been used to damage the corpse after death.`
`She was probably killed with a gun or something, like George-aniki,`
` ......and the stake had been stuck into the hole left by the gun.`
`...Thinking of it that way makes it easier to accept.`
`But...was Kyrie-san really killed with a gun?`
`As she said on the phone, even though she was holed up inside a locked room, Kyrie-san was being attacked.`
`In fact, this room had been locked.`
`...Also, `
`...she mentioned a golden thread or something flying in and attacking her.`
`In fact, there were four places around Kyrie-san's corpse with holes that could have been caused by some kind of attack.`
`'!s0`
`a golden thread attacked her...`
`...through the keyhole...?`
`I looked at the door from Kyrie-san's perspective.`
`If it had been one of those old keyholes you see in old mystery movies,`
` where you can peek through to the other side, then it would've clearly been possible to stick something through it.`
`But even though the doors in this mansion were old-fashioned, the locks were the familiar, average cylinder style that you could find in any normal house.`
`...In other words, they weren't constructed in a way that would let you penetrate through them.`
`So no matter how thin an object you might try to stick through the keyhole,`
` it's unthinkable that something penetrated through from the outside and attacked.`
`......A cylinder lock.`
`......And a keyhole......?`
`But despite that, Kyrie-san definitely said that something like a golden thread had flown in through the keyhole,`
` ...spun around while aiming for her, and attacked her...`
`'A golden thread attacking through a keyhole'.`
`......I couldn't understand what it meant at all.`
`But, even so...`
`...Kyrie-san probably predicted that I wouldn't be able to understand all this.`
`And it wasn't just Kyrie-san.`
`Jessica said it over the phone too.`
`...No, since the very beginning, from the time we talked with Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san and got the phone call from Uncle Krauss's group, `
`...everyone has said the same, consistent thing.`
`......Grandfather summoned witches and demons...and is killing people with magic.`
`They'd been shown that right before their eyes.`
`These weren't tricks or fakes.`
`There was no choice but to believe it.`
`...With one voice, they had all said that.`
`When the mystery woman calling herself Beatrice appeared,`
` even I had pretty much believed that she was a real witch and might start summoning goat monsters right and left.`
`...However, after being left alone for a whole day, my feeling of tension had faded completely.`
` I was now able to think that something so stupid definitely couldn't be true.`
`Did they lose their heads a little in an extraordinary situation where their lives were exposed to danger.........`
`and mistakenly think that a witch was attacking them with magic?`
`......But multiple people gave the same kind of testimony, and on top of that, none of their opinions conflicted each other.`
`...If it had just been a single statement, I'd be able to suspect that they just didn't see what they thought they saw,`
` ...but doing that now is pretty...difficult...`
`Then, right next to the back door, I found Uncle Krauss with his head half smashed.`
`...Even though he'd escaped the dungeon of Kuwadorian...`
`and somehow made it this far by a secret underground passage, ...he had been killed.`
`Buried into the gruesome cross-section of his half-crushed head...`
`was a stake with an occult design, like the one that had been buried into Kyrie-san's forehead.`
`And in this situation, it was very hard to imagine that this stake was the weapon used.`
`...He had been killed with a powerful gun like the six in the dining hall,`
` and after death, had been jabbed with a stake like Kyrie-san.`
`I wonder if the golden threads that Kyrie-san spoke of attacked Uncle Krauss too.`
`Does there exist some kind of tool, like an endoscope, that's very thin but can be moved about at will......?`
`And that can also attack people...?`
`No way. I've never heard of anything like that.`
`But even so, ...if this fact had been revealed to one of the relatives,`
` maybe they'd say 'I wouldn't put it past Grandfather to make it'...`
`Since I can't deny the existence of golden thread X that can be moved at will and attack people,`
` I can either accept that this mysterious weapon exists, or else...`
`I'll have to accept that this was a murder committed with magic.`
`To find the next corpse, I had to go out through the back door and search around outside a bit.`
`Behind the mansion, in the wild-grown bushes that were almost swallowed up by the forest, there was something like an old well, `
`...and right next to it...were Doctor Nanjo and Shannon-chan's corpses.`
`Both corpses had their heads smashed.`
`...And, though they weren't stuck in, there were stakes lying right next to each damaged head.`
`...Each corpse was atrocious, but having to look directly at Shannon-chan's lovely face, which had been half blown away, was very painful...`
`Then, there was the well.`
`I'd heard that inside it was a secret underground passage to the mysterious mansion, Kuwadorian.`
`...By this time, I'd begun to think that Beatrice and her accomplices might've used this underground passage...`
`and left for Kuwadorian.`
`Even though there had apparently been at least ten of them, I hadn't seen a trace of anyone.`
`...It seemed very likely that they'd already escaped to a different location.`
`There's the typhoon.`
`They can't go out to sea.`
`It goes the same for the forest.`
`There's no way they could traverse such a deep, uncultivated forest on foot.`
`In that case, they had only one place to go.`
`The mysterious hidden mansion, Kuwadorian.`
`...Through the secret underground passage at the bottom of the well...!`
`...By this time, I had entirely lost my fear of being killed if I happened to come across the enemy.`
`Don't fuck with me...!`
`This time I'll storm into your mansion...!`
`"......Ah, ...wh-what the hell...?!`
` ...D-Damn it...!!"`
`The old well had a firm cover on it.`
`The cover was an iron grill.`
`The gaps between the bars were perhaps 20 centimeters across.`
` You could peer inside, but it really wasn't something a human could pass through.`
`If I hadn't known better, I wouldn't have thought it anything more than a simple cover to prevent falls.`
`...But from what Kyrie-san had told me, I knew that its purpose was to prevent intruders from entering the secret underground passage in its depths...!`
`But the cover was extremely firm and rigid, and no matter how much I pushed or pulled, I couldn't even get close to opening it.`
`I couldn't find any obvious lock.`
`It might be sealed by some mechanism.`
`But no matter how much I investigated it, I couldn't find anything to release it.`
`......The biggest piece of information Kyrie-san had tried to give me, gambling her final moments,`
` ...was the underground passage in this well...!`
`"Don't think I'll be stopped by something like this cover...!`
` I'll smash it to bits...!`
` I'll search for a tool...!"`
`I had an idea.`
`...After all, I'd seen the various tools in the gardening shed when we'd locked Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san in there.`
`But the shutter to the gardening shed was locked.`
`On top of that, the key was with Gohda-san, who was dead on the inside.`
`...In other words, this gardening shed was a closed room.`
`There's no way to open it from the outside.`
`In that case, I've got to break the shutter.`
`There has to be a tool for that somewhere.`
`...Kinda feels like I'm going in circles here.`
`Then, while searching for that, I learned that the source of the stench that had permeated the mansion this whole time...was the underground boiler room.`
`The boiler room was dimly lit, humid, smelled horrible, and on top of all that, was incredibly creepy.`
`But there were several large tools there, and I managed to find a fire hatchet and some massive wire cutters.`
`And......Grandfather's corpse.`
`No, strictly speaking, I should probably say that I found a burnt corpse of a person who was probably Grandfather.`
`Someone's corpse had been stuffed into the blazing fires of the boiler...`
`However, by coincidence, I was able to notice the number of toes on the corpse.`
`...Both feet had six toes.`
`...That's right, I think I heard it from Dad some time long ago.`
`Something about Grandfather having polydactyly, with extra toes.`
`According to old Ushiromiya family tradition, it seems that those with extra fingers or toes had some kind of good fortune and were treated as a good omen.`
`...And because of that, Grandfather was selected to be the Successor or something......`
`But I wonder if I can be certain this is Grandfather's body just from the number of toes.`
`After all, Grandfather was supposed to be the leader of the group of culprits.`
`I didn't have a clue why he'd get stuffed into a boiler in a place like this and die.`
`A mysterious corpse, burning and spitting out a terrible stench amid the flames...`
`...If it really was Grandfather,`
` ......did that mean that the leader of the group of culprits wasn't Grandfather, but that Beatrice after all...?`
`Grandfather was used because he was convenient...and was then thrown away?`
`......Unfortunately, it didn't look like I'd be given a chance to hear Grandfather's side of the story...`
`Now that I had obtained a tool, I thought about rushing to take on the cover to the well,`
` but I decided to break the shutter to the gardening shed first.`
`...I had plenty of time to kill anyway.`
`I figured I should check on the condition of Gohda-san's and Kumasawa-san's corpses.`
`I hit the shutter with the hatchet, breaking into it,`
` stuck the wire cutter into the crack,`
` and scissored it around, opening up a hole.`
`Then, I faced Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san's corpses once more...`
`As a result, I learned a new fact.`
`First, they had not died by being hung by the neck.`
` Both of their feet were solidly on the floor.`
`...And on both of their foreheads were signs that they'd been shot with a gun.`
`The loop seemed longer than a normal noose.`
`On top of that, the length was different on each to match the height of each person.`
`In other words, the lengths had been adjusted so that both Gohda-san, who was tall, and Kumasawa-san, who was short, `
`had their feet solidly but barely on the ground.`
`Also, while the ropes carried both of their weights as their heads lolled, both of them had some slack below their knees.`
`This meant that if they'd stood up with these loops around their necks, there would've been some extra length.`
`In other words, these loops wouldn't have been that great for hanging people.`
`The direct cause of death was probably a shot to the head.`
`It was gruesome.`
` Their insides were still dripping out from those gaping holes, staining their faces a deep red.`
`It's probably best to assume that they were then hung, pulled up, and left exposed like that.`
`...If they'd been shot with a gun, they would probably have been lying down on the floor.`
`...If that had been the case, you wouldn't have been able to tell they were dead even if you peeked through the window.`
`The mountain of stuff would've gotten in the way, so if they'd been lying down, they would've been hidden.`
`To make the deaths of these two known to the rest of us who couldn't go inside,`
` they would've had to hang them like this, making it visible from the outside.`
`...Was this...done to get back at us for thinking that those two would surely be safe if we left the key with them...?`
`I wonder where the shutter key we gave Gohda-san, which should've ensured their safety, is now...`
`That key...was in the pocket of his trousers.`
`The gardening shed key had been kindly left there, and even the plate was attached.`
`In other words, the gardening shed had been a closed room after all.`
`And that gave rise to another question.`
`...Because this can't be explained by a hanging.`
`If they didn't commit suicide, then those nooses were set up by the culprit.`
`...It might have been possible to shoot them through the window, but it's really unthinkable that someone could've tied two loops to the beam from the outside.`
`And furthermore, there's no way they could've lifted up the heavy corpses.`
`In other words, to do all of this, they would've had to go inside.`
`But the key was in Gohda-san's pocket, and the shutter had been locked.`
`In other words, the gardening shed had been a closed room.`
`Gohda-san had said that there was only one key to this shutter.`
`...But is it possible that there was a copy...`
`and that the culprit was in possession of it...?`
`If we're allowed to theorize that there actually was a duplicate of the gardening storehouse key...and that Gohda-san just didn't know about it, `
`then this isn't even close to a closed room.`
`......But why is it that, despite the fact that almost all of the other corpses were shot to death and left almost completely alone,`
` just these two corpses were intentionally hoisted up?`
`I couldn't help but feel something a bit odd about that...`
`After this, if we assume that the mystery corpse in the boiler was Grandfather's,`
` ...the deaths of 16 people have been confirmed.`
`There were 18 people on this island.`
`I'm here, and there are 16 corpses.`
`Kanon-kun's corpse is the only one I haven't been able to confirm.`
`According to Kyrie-san, he had been killed while climbing out of the well...and had fallen down into it.`
`So with the well closed up like this, it's impossible to check.`
`I tried shining a flashlight through the bars, down into the darkness in the depths of the well.`
`But it seemed that the jet-black darkness had no intention of showing me its depths with a light of that level...`
`It looked like I'd have to break the bars after all.`
`Using the hatchets and things I'd dragged from the boiler room and the gardening shed, I tried breaking the cover of the well.`
`But the metal bars were extraordinarily sturdy, and breaking them wasn't easy.`
`...I hit them with the hatchet over and over, until my hands started feeling weird, and eventually gave up on breaking them...`
`...It's impossible.`
`If they were at least wood, I might've been able to break them.`
`But this metal...`
`That's right, there's no way you can slice through metal bars like butter with a human's strength.`
`...I can't even begin to understand...that story about how Kanon-kun cut through metal bars.`
`I heard that a light like a red laser beam grew out of his arm...`
`and that he sliced through the metal bars like he was cutting through butter.`
`Cutting through metal bars like butter...?`
`...And what's with the red laser beam?`
`Does that mean he secretly had a burner on him or something...`
`and used that to burn through the bars...?`
`Still, just what kind of laser......could cut through metal bars like butter?`
`...It almost sounds like the kind of laser beam you'd find in those robot anime I'd loved as a kid, doesn't it?`
`Does something like that actually exist...?`
`And how did Kanon-kun get that laser beam...?`
`No matter how much I want to ask him, he's already been killed.`
`Plus, even his corpse is now in the depths of the well, beyond this cover.`
`If Kanon-kun could slice through metal bars, I'm sure he could handle this metal cover in a single swing.`
`...It...feels just like the closed room Gohda-san was locked in while holding the key.`
`Only one person can open the door, but they're locked inside...`
`...If only I had that power of Kanon-kun's, I'd be able to do something about this cover myself...`
`............`
`Just who is Kanon-kun?`
`He couldn't really be...a non-Human being capable of using a strange power, right?`
`Kyrie-san told me to believe in witches, and I even met an insane woman calling herself one.`
`...Could Kanon-kun possibly be...`
`a human on the witch's side...?`
`...Or else, `
`......the culprit?`
`......What the heck.`
`...Am I gonna start treating him like the culprit...just because I can't find his corpse?`
`Hoh, ...treating him like the culprit because there's no corpse...?`
`And who was the one babbling about the suspicious being innocent...?`
`......Very well, I couldn't bear having you push all the crimes on Kanon and building a human culprit theory that way.`
`I will guarantee it with the red...`
`#ff0000Kanon is dead.#ffffff`
`#ff0000Among the five people in Kyrie's group, he was the first to die.`
`In short, he was the 9th victim.#ffffff`
`"...Since there's no corpse, ...I can't say for sure...`
`that Kanon-kun is dead."`
`So, my whispering in red does not reach the piece you...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ......But it did reach `
`~ib~you~ib~`
`, right......?`
`At a glance, this was a mass murder due to something strange that could only be thought of as magic.`
`...Golden threads that attacked through key holes.`
`No, we even have testimony that something gold flew around the dining hall when the first six died.`
`The two might've been the same weapon.`
`Then there was the closed room murder of the garden shed, and the laser beam that could cut metal bars.`
`...And that wasn't all.`
`There was much, much more...like the group of goat monsters,`
` the story of a witch who could create pitfalls just by snapping her fingers, the rabbit-like demons who had fired golden threads...`
`I think there was more, ......but each part was all screwed up.`
`I couldn't possibly accept it...and was forced to suspect that it was some kind of trick or mistake.`
`...But why in the world had everyone spoken with one voice, saying the same thing without contradictions in their testimony...?`
`It's not only the magic.`
`There's Maria's mysterious death.`
`Why Jessica knew that George-aniki had been killed.`
`The mysterious burnt corpse that I couldn't confirm really belonged to that damn geezer.`
`...And more, and more.`
`All stuff I don't get...!`
`I tilted the wine bottle up and gulped.`
`...I don't have a clue what's going on.`
`After dinner last night, the kids were chased out and told to go back to the guesthouse, `
`......and then there was a massacre in the dining hall.`
`Kyrie-san and the rest were dropped through pitfalls and captured.`
`Then, Jessica and George-aniki were called out to take a test or whatever and killed.`
`Even though Kyrie-san's group was able to escape the dungeon somehow, all of them got killed in the end.`
`And at the very, very end, even Maria was killed, leaving me all alone.`
`......In short, I did nothing except stay locked up in the guesthouse.`
`During that time, a huge incident occurred and ended.`
`What can I call it except incomprehensible?`
`I don't have a clue anymore!`
`"Now I'm nothing but a drunk.`
` You plan on leaving only me alive...?`
` Show yourself right away and come to kill me already.`
` It's too much of a pain, so I won't search for you.`
` You show me your true form yourself...!`
` I won't run or hide, so come at me with arrows or bullets or whatever...!"`
`I haven't gotten any sleep since yesterday, so I'm incredibly sleepy.`
`You wanna kill me, go ahead.`
`I decided to return to the guesthouse and boldly rest in a bed.`
`...When I exited the kitchen and passed through the lobby, `
`......that portrait of the witch came into view.`
`The big clock did too.`
`...It was almost exactly 24:00.`
`Then, the sound of the bell rang out, proclaiming that 24:00 had arrived...`
`As I listened, ...I looked up at Beatrice's portrait.`
`Exactly 24 hours ago, I met you.`
`What were you trying to say...?`
`And where did you go?`
`Just who in the world are you......?`
`Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
`I haven't solved a single one of the riddles surrounding you...!`
`Show yourself...`
`......And fight me...!!`
`Then, ...the witch showed herself.`
`Like a guest of honor finally appearing, she showed herself on the landing at the top of the big staircase...`
`"So, you finally show yourself...`
` ...I've been kept bored for a whole day."`
`"......Correct.`
` I gave you a whole day.`
` Was that enough for you to fully exercise the rights of the Human side?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I was bored, after all.`
` I did a heck of a lot of it."`
`"......Ange...was a good piece."`
`"Don't you...speak Ange's name."`
`"......She appeared through a miracle, sacrificed herself, and gave you the tenacity required for certain victory."`
`"Don't you...speak Ange's name."`
`"......That brutal death was something you needed.`
` If you hadn't seen that death, you wouldn't have grown serious.`
` Without the wake-up call of Ange's ill-fated future, your tenacity for victory would not have been born."`
`"I told you not to speak Ange's name...!!"`
`"......In short, she was a necessary sacrifice.`
` Otherwise, an anger great enough to kill me would not have been born in you.`
` The rivalry between us cannot be destroyed."`
`"Damn you, Lady Bernkastel, it's more fitting to call that a trump card than a piece.`
` ...No matter how much a piece acts, it does not stray from the board.`
` But no matter how much power a trump card wields, it is always thrown away after it is used."`
`"Ange was truly a good trump card for you."`
`"Don't you...speak Ange's naaaaaaaaaaaammme!!!"`
`At Battler's angry roar, Beato finally stopped talking.`
`"...You know, I don't have time to play around in a place like this anymore.`
` ...Even a tie will keep Ange waiting.`
`'!s1`
`...take my family, `
`...and go back home!!`
` I won't waste a second playing witch games with you!!"`
`"In that case, what should you do?`
` You know, don't you?"`
`"Yeah!`
` I'll beat you down!!`
` I'll blast away all witches, magic, illusions and delusions!!`
` Come on, let's get started!!!`
` I won't let you trick me again!!`
` Resume the game, okay?`
` I'll tear apart the witch's veil concealing the outright lie you are!!!"`
`"You talk too much.`
` All you have to do is honestly say 'I'll kill you'."`
`"Yeah.`
` If those are the words you want, ...I'll say them.`
` This is the first and last wish of yours that I'll lend an ear to."`
`"......I thank you."`
`"I'll......"`
`"............"`
`"Very well!!`
` Let us begin, Battler...!!`
` Yes, the time for the witch hunt has come...!!`
` Try and chase me, try and corner me, try and kill me! I expect a lot from you!!`
` Try and show me what your little sister gave you in her last moments...!!"`
`'!s0`
`...Battler's cry burned the world with a white light.`
`And, if you opened your eyes amidst the darkness, ...the two of them could be seen in a rose garden...`
`"......Who shall make the first move?"`
`"Me."`
`"How bold."`
`In the rose garden, beautiful rose petals danced.`
`The color of those rose petals...was red.`
`Did the fact that they faced each other in this beautiful rose garden...`
`prove...or make claim to a red, single truth?`
`......That must be why the roses are red.`
`But in the language of flowers, ...roses represent passion.`
`...Not truth.`
`The flower for truth is a forget-me-not.`
`And that flower...is blue.`
`"I'll bore through everything with my blue truth.`
` ......From the very beginning of everything.`
` I'll start from the very first game!"`
`"Very well.`
` Let's see what you've got.`
` ...Come."`
`"Here I go......`
` I've already proclaimed it, but I'll say it again.`
` ...This isn't just for the murder of Doctor Nanjo in the last game.`
` This'll tear apart every scene from every game since the beginning...!!"`
`"#5decffUshiromiya Kinzo is already dead!`
` So the true number of people on the island is 17!`
` By adding in an unknown person X, that makes 18 people.`
` By supposing the existence of this person X, the crime is possible even if all 17 people have alibis.`
` By this, even though the number of people reaches 18, it's still possible for culprit X to exist and carry out crimes, even if all 18 people seem to have alibis!!#ffffff"`
`You can break through all of the murders in Episode 1 by supposing an unknown person X.`
`Furthermore, it's even possible to explain the mystery of Kinzo's evaporation from the closed room sealed by the receipt...`
`by making the bold assumption that Kinzo wasn't there in the first place.`
`Unless Beato counters this with the red truth,`
` the Illusion of the Witch from Episode 1 has been completely smashed.`
`......This blue truth is valid.`
`The wedge of blue truth that Battler had thrown stabbed right through the top of Beato's left foot.`
`...Was the red blood pouring out from there...a protest being made by her red truth...?`
`Beato shut one of her eyes tight, enduring the unbearable pain of the blue truth that denied her.`
`"Hmm, not bad.`
` ...But I mustn't be denied yet, I mustn't be killed yet.`
` ...This is not yet enough.`
` ......In the subsequent games, there were mysteries that couldn't be explained with that alone, right?"`
`"...Which mysteries?"`
`"In the final stages of the second game,`
` George took Gohda and Shannon with him, barricaded them in Natsuhi's room, and was killed.`
` The key that unlocked Natsuhi's room was locked up inside the room, and all of the remaining keys that could unlock that door were in Rosa's hand.`
` Even if a culprit X existed, it should have been impossible to construct that closed room."`
`The blue wedge that pierced Beato shook.`
`She was resisting, fighting to pull it out.`
`"No, that doesn't shake my blue truth.`
` If culprit X were to obtain a master key, that's not even close to a closed room."`
`"No, it was impossible for the culprit to obtain one.`
` #ff0000All of the master keys were under Rosa's control!#ffffff"`
`"But that's meaningless if Aunt Rosa was the culprit!`
` #5decffAunt Rosa handed a key over to culprit X by some method, assisting in the closed room murder!`
` And after that, she retrieved the key by a similar method!#ffffff`
` Too naive, Beato!!`
` I'd already guessed that much at the time!"`
`"...*cackle* Yes, you did, didn't you...`
` ...Gwaaargh...!!!`
` ......Agh, ...ack-"`
`The wedge that had been gradually losing its sparkle and had seemed as though it was about to be pulled out...`
`regained its strong blue again thanks to Battler's additional blue truth...and dug into Beato again, eating into her foot.`
`Beato let out a cry of anguish at that pain.`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, bea_9e449:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, bea_9e450:`
` Not yet, `
`......not yeeeeeeeet!!"`
`"On to the third game.`
` The six linked closed rooms, the murders of Aunt Rosa and Maria, Dad and the rest's deaths in the hall, the murders of Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi...`
`#5decffall of that can be explained if we suppose that Aunt Eva was the culprit.#ffffff"`
`"This argument was already won back then.`
` And even that final riddle you proposed through EVA, `
`#5decffthe murder of Doctor Nanjo, can be explained with an 18th unknown person X.#ffffff`
` That breaks through the whole third game!!! Can you counter that?!"`
`"Guh, aah...!!`
` ...O-Of course...!`
` This much is...nothing to worry about...!`
` In that case, how do you explain George's disappearance from the guesthouse?`
` I shall add to the red truth.`
` #ff0000George did not go down the stairs of the guesthouse.#ffffff`
` He flew out through the window!"`
`In the final stages of the third game, George suddenly vanished from the second floor of the guesthouse.`
`Eva, who had been on the first floor, claimed that no one had come downstairs,`
` but because of the blue truth, George could've snuck down to the first floor and escaped while Eva was busy carrying Krauss's and Natsuhi's corpses outside.`
`But by adding an additional red truth, Beato had denied that possibility.`
`To go outside without going down the staircase to the first floor, he would've had to leave by the window.`
` But all of the windows had been locked from the inside...!`
`"So what?`
` It's just like you said.`
` He flew out the window, right?`
` There was a lawn, so we couldn't tell if he'd jumped down, and it was raining so hard.`
` Any light traces would've disappeared."`
`"I'll use the red truth again.`
` #ff0000All windows and doors leading to the outside were locked from the inside.#ffffff`
` #ff0000Furthermore, it is impossible to lock any of those from the outside!#ffffff`
` George had no technique by which to lock them...!"`
`"I'll use more of the blue.`
` I said it myself at the time.`
` #5decffIn that case, everything works out as long as someone locked the window after George-aniki escaped through it!#ffffff`
` Nothing difficult about that!!"`
`"Gwaaaaaaaahhaaaaah...!!`
` Gguuuuhhh... Can I not...escape after something like this...?"`
`Beato couldn't remove the blue wedge that was buried into her foot.`
`The fake witch was burned more and more by that forceful blue...`
`"There's still nothing that shakes my blue truth in any of the first three games.`
` ...In that case, the only game that can prove you're a witch...is this game, the fourth game."`
`"...Since I haven't countered you with the red, that is so.`
` I shall have to prove witches using only this game.`
` ......Very well.`
` Give me everything you've got."`
`"There's nothing strange about the murder of the six people in the dining hall.`
` #5decffThe 18th person X went wild with a gun and killed everyone.`
` As for the pitfalls, there's a chance that pitfalls truly were hidden there,`
` and it's possible to explain it using Kyrie-san's theory, supposing that poison dart-shooting device X, which can knock a person out instantly, exists.`
` The murders of George-aniki, Jessica, and those who escaped from the dungeon can also be explained with guns, just like the dining hall.#ffffff`
` There's nothing strange about it!"`
`"But I'm sure you've got a counterattack, right?`
` Bring it on!!"`
`"Your greatest sword, this 18th person X, is based on the theory that Kinzo was already dead.`
` I knew you would make that claim.`
` That's why I took Kinzo out of his study.`
` All members in the family conference welcomed that Kinzo, right?`
` #ff0000All of those who met at the family conference acknowledged the presence of Kinzo!#ffffff"`
`"That's right.`
` But Grandfather was seriously ill, bedridden on the verge of life and death, right?`
` If he was so worn out that he looked like a different person, maybe no one would've cared, right?"`
`"I'll counter with this.`
` #5decffThat Grandfather was a different person, a body double.`
` A different person the relatives mistook for Grandfather!#ffffff"`
`"Then I'll counter with this.`
` #ff0000No person would mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight.`
` No matter what disguise might be used, they would not mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight!#ffffff"`
`"Then I'll use this.`
` #5decffIn the second game, when you announced with the red truth that there were five master keys, even though there could've been more than five in first game,`
` you changed the premises of the later games.`
` So, it's possibile that Kinzo's life or death status was changed for the 4th game alone.#ffffff"`
`"#5decffTherefore, Kinzo's presence in the fourth game doesn't serve as proof that he was present in the previous games...!`
` Therefore, even if we suppose that the six murders in the dining hall were carried out by Grandfather, it contradicts nothing!#ffffff"`
`"Then let me counter this way.`
` #ff0000Kinzo's life or death status is the same at the start of all four games.`
` The setup was not different for the fourth game alone...!#ffffff"`
`"Repeat it.`
` 'Kinzo was alive at the start time of every game'!"`
`"I refuse to repeat it.`
` I won't answer, Battler.`
` I won't give you the red truth you so desire...!"`
`"...Damn, ...you're standing in my way, geezer...!!`
` Are you putting yourself on the line to protect Beatrice, this most beloved witch of yours?!"`
`Swaying, that damn geezer came into view.`
`...Heh, is he trying to be some kind of knight, blocking the path between me and Beato...?!`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle* Battler,`
` are you capable of surpassing me...?"`
`"I won't let you reach, I will not let you reach, ...not to the Golden Witch's height, you seeeeeeeeee?!`
` Fuhhahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Your thoughtless reasoning cannot surpass even me alone!`
` Die!!!"`
`Kinzo's jet-black cape spread as though it would swallow the world,`
` becoming the snout of a vast black dragon that came at me, trying to swallow me in one gulp.`
`...Faced with that black dragon's roar, I calmed my breathing and closed my eyes lightly...`
`"I'll swallow you up in a single gulp!!`
` Disappear, inexperienced fooooooooooool!!!"`
`"......Quiet, you damn undying ghost."`
`"Hoh, so you call me a ghost?`
` So, you intend to see it through to the end, this theory that I am already dead!!`
` That will prove fatal to you!!`
` Be swallowed up by the first twilight of the fourth game and disappear!!"`
`The black dragon's vast mouth, its snout, its fangs...swallowed Battler whole...!!!`
`In that instant, Battler suddenly opened his eyes!`
`"Thanks, Beatrice.`
` Your third game became a foothold for my counterattack."`
`"What...?"`
`"See ya, damn geezer.`
` This is goodbye.`
` ......As a basis for claiming that 'Kinzo was dead' even in the 4th game, I propose the following theory!"`
`"Very well, come with all you have, my descendant!!`
`"Here I go, you damn geezer!!`
` #5decffMy theory's that the name of Kinzo gets passed on as the title of the Ushiromiya Family Head!`
` Ushiromiya Kinzo was already dead.`
` And he passed 'that name' on to someone else!`
` Everyone acknowledged that!!`
` That way, 'All of those who met at the family conference acknowledged the presence of Kinzo'!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffThere wasn't even any need for someone to disguise themselves as Grandfather.`
` Because everyone acknowledged a new 'Kinzo'!`
` So, 'they didn't actually mistake Kinzo by sight'!!`
` As long as this theory is not denied, nothing can change the fact that you're dead!!!#ffffff"`
`"This is the final blow.`
` Damn geezer, I demand that you repeat it.`
` 'Among all of the people there, not one had multiple, different names'!!"`
`"I...can...not......!!`
` Gah, gwoooooooooooooooooooragghgghghh!!"`
`"Rest in peace, damn geezer.`
` Thank me. You were finally able to die.`
` This is your requiem, take it and drop dead!!"`
`"#5decffUshiromiya Kinzo was already dead!`
` That's right, you definitely deserve to be pitied, since whenever we find your corpse, it's always completely burnt.`
` That was a device to hide the fact that time had passed since your death!!`
` Then, you passed that name on to someone else!!`
` With this theory, even though 'you' were dead, 'Kinzo' was able to appear at the family conference!!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffHow's that? This is checkmaaaaaaaaaaaate!!#ffffff"`
`Several dozen blue stakes bored into Kinzo's ghost.`
`Their terrible destructive power wouldn't let the ghost recover again...!!`
`"...Be...atr...ice......"`
`"......Kinzo,`
` ...thank you for everything.`
` ...Rest...in peace...`
` I will not forget...my time spent with you......"`
`Dispersing along with the shadow of the black dragon as golden flower petals scattered,`
` ...Ushiromiya Kinzo became a gold-colored cyclone and disappeared...`
`Even after death, he had fought for the sake of the woman he'd loved.`
`...There's no doubting that your love and madness were the real thing...!`
`"......Nggg, ......Battler......"`
`"Don't hate me.`
` ...Let the dead sleep.`
` Don't wake them.`
` ...You're up next.`
` This is the end for you too."`
`Beato still couldn't pull out the blue wedge that pierced her foot...`
`She realized that she was on the verge of death...`
`"I've gone along with you a whole bunch.`
` I think I've more than fulfilled any responsibility I had to play with you.`
` ...But it's about time to finish things up.`
` I've got a lonely little sister waiting at home."`
`"...Let me take my leave with my whole family...!!"`
`"...Then kill me.`
` ...In that case, try and kill me!`
` ...I won't run or hide, and by now I won't even be able to avoid it!!`
` Come ooooooooooooooooooooooon, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!!"`
`"You've got it!!`
` With the 18th person X from the 'Kinzo was dead' theory, everything that remained has been pierced through!"`
`"#5decffGeorge-aniki and Jessica's deaths in the fourth game can also be explained by culprit X!!`
` And the five who escaped from the dungeon and were killed, and the two in the gardening shed, and Maria in the end!`
` All of those can be explained with 18th person X!!`
` There's nothing strange there at all!!#ffffff"`
`"With this, I've fully explained the culprit using humans for all games!!`
` Beatrice, ...this is...checkmaaaaaaaaaaaate!!"`
`"Uu, ...whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh......aah...!"`
`Beatrice, who couldn't dodge, had several blue stakes driven into her and was skewered...`
`Beato grabbed at them, trying to pull them out somehow...`
`'!s1`
`...that got meee...`
` ......It huurts......`
`...This'll......kill me, won't it......?`
`...If I don't pull these out, `
`......I'll die...`
`I've had enough of the pain...`
` ...I've had enough of......`
`...the...anguish...`
`With both hands, ...Beato firmly grasped one of the blue stakes.`
`...Naturally, the power of the witch-denying blue truth burned her hands.`
`...Unable even to hide her tears at the pain, Beato howled and tried to pull the stakes out with all her might...`
`If I can't pull these out, ......I'll die......`
`...This is......my final counterattack......`
`"Then Battler,`
` ...how do you explain my several acts of magic...?`
` ......The very first time those appeared...was in the second game, when I fixed Maria's pumpkin marshmallow.`
` At that time, Rosa definitely witnessed that magic."`
`Certainly, at that time, Rosa witnessed gold butterflies gathering and the fixing of a marshmallow by the miracle of magic.`
`"...*cackle*cackle*...`
` ...Rosa alone witnessing it isn't very credible, right...?`
` That's why I increased the number of witnesses to the uppermost limit later on.`
` ...Which is what...happened in this last game..."`
`"The summoning of my minions!`
` And brutal murders due to magic!`
` All of those were witnessed by a great many people...!!`
` That is itself...proof that my magic exists...!!`
` How do you explain that, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerr......?!!!"`
`"......Stalemate."`
`"......Wh-Whaat...?"`
`"'Magic exists because magic exists'.`
` Didn't the rules of our Braun tube trial say that you couldn't use that kind of argument?"`
`"......Y...es, ...you're right......`
` ...Heh, ......hahack, ...guh..."`
`"No matter who `
`or how many people `
`witnessed magic,`
` that cannot become proof of magic's existence!!"`
`"Whether all the magic you've shown exists or not, I can ignore it all and explain things with Humans.`
` That's my undeniable right.`
` ...Am I wrong?"`
`At those words, the blue stakes let out an even brighter light, knocking my hands away.`
`'!s1`
`...pull them out after all......`
`...ggghh......`
`As Battler is now, even if I pull up a witness for each individual bit of magic and demand an explanation, he'll probably use some kind of move to deny all of them.`
`...Not just the magic with the marshmallow I showed Rosa, ...but all the miracles of magic.`
`So, I can no longer even claim to be a witch without questioning him about something like how a marshmallow was fixed...`
`I'm in such an inferior position that I must fight over such trivialities...`
`It may be...`
`...impossible for me......`
`...I know that...`
`This was to be a game without victory from the very beginning.`
`...So, it was only natural that the day of my defeat would eventually come.`
`'!s1`
`up until today...`
`...just to lose to Battler......?`
`......I began the game...`
`thinking I might be able to win.`
`Even if I wouldn't be able to win easily, I believed that in a game repeating endlessly, a miracle would eventually occur.`
`...After all, I had certain willpower on my side, an unwavering desire to win with certainty.`
`...However, I've now lost that miracle completely.`
`And, that certain willpower resides in Battler, ...leaving me certainly without even a one-in-a-million chance at a miracle.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`Or perhaps I should say I've been left without a miracle ~ib~or~ib~ certainty...`
`I will have no victory...and no end through a tie.`
`'!s1`
`is to continue on resisting...`
`...until defeat is given to me...in this game...`
`That's right, I...`
`...am fighting......only to be killed by Battler......`
`...I looked into Battler's eyes.`
`That which was reflected inside them...wasn't me.`
`......The figures of the little sister waiting for his return...and the family he had to bring back were reflected in those eyes.`
`To him, my existence is already...not even that of an individual.`
`...Obviously.`
` From the very beginning, he has been trying to deny the individual that I am.`
`......Yes, ...that last game...`
`sure was fun...`
`I was only tricking him a bit, `
`...but for just a short period of time, it felt like we understood each other, ...and that was fun...`
`...That's right, `
`...I should've made my move then...`
`I should have continued for eternity with Battler still totally fooled...`
`'!s1`
`...that's just no good, right...?`
`......That...`
`just wouldn't be true victory......`
`"......Is this...checkmate?`
` Beatrice?"`
`Beato had been run through with several blue stakes, skewered over and over to the ground while still standing.`
`Because of that, she wasn't even able to fall over,`
` ......and, still looking up into the sky, ...was sewn in place...`
`That tragic form...`
`might have been a fitting end for the cruel witch who had endlessly toyed with 18 people's lives and who had killed constantly for hundreds and thousands of years.`
`Gently, ...as though someone was mourning over something, ...rain began to fall.`
`...Amid that rain, Beato was soaked...and crucified...`
`"...Is it over, Beato?"`
`'!s1`
`...even let out a squeak......"`
`"Not yet.`
` You aren't a woman who'll let things end with just this."`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, bea_9e558:`
`...ridiculous...`
`  ......How can you look at this...`

`"......Hoh...`
` ......So you would expose me...to even further shame...?`
` Isn't it settled already...?"`
`"Stand up.`
` Our brawl still isn't over."`
`"......Not over, ...you say......?"`
`"That just now wasn't you losing.`

`"I'll break through you.`
` How could I let you run away like this?"`
`"............"`
`"I won't let you run back to the darkness of illusions while you're still all hazy like this.`
` ......I'll break through you.`
` Completely.`
` So stand up.`
` Don't act all frail like that!`
` You're still hiding several moves!`
` I can tell!"`
`".........Why...won't you just let me escape...?"`
`"Dad, Mom, and Ange.`
` All the cousins and all the relatives.`
` And all the servants.`
` You toyed with them so much and killed them...!!`
` I definitely won't forget, won't forgive that inhumanity!"`
`"I can still feel...Ange's arms on my shoulders...!!`
` I won't forgive your inhumanity...!!`
` So I won't let you get away like this...!!!"`
`Battler's eyes burned with the flames of hatred...`
`...The time had long since passed during which pitiful behavior would have earned his compassion.`
`...After being tricked once, Battler will never sympathize with me again.`
`'!s1`
`......this is like the boy who cried wolf, isn't it......?`
`......What am I supposed to do......?`
` ......What should I do......?`
`...Is fighting endlessly only to avoid admitting defeat...a fitting endless torture for the Endless Witch?`
`......Is endlessly harassing Battler, to avoid giving him victory, ...also part of being the Endless Witch......?`
`'!s1`
`......Is this...`
`...what the Endless Magic is......?`
`I've...`
`...had enough......`
`I've...`
`...had enough...`
`...of endlessly being toyed with......`
`by witches...`
`I will have no victory...and no tie.`
`...In that case, there's only one result that can release me.`
`...Hmph, ...hahahahahahaha...`
`Since the time I succumbed to the path of witches.`
`Since the day I made that contract with demons.`
`......It was promised that I would meet my end through tragedy, was it not......?`
`"What's wrong?!!`
` Golden Witch, Beatrice!!`
` If you are the ruler of Rokkenjima, show me a majesty fitting for that, even at the very eeeeeeeeeeeeennddd!!!"`
`Lightning.`
`...The world was smashed with white.`
`......Fitting last moments...for the ruler of Rokkenjima.`
`Haha, ......hahhahahahahahahahaha......`
`"Hahhahahahahaha, ...wahhahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!!"`
`"............"`
`Still pierced by the blue stakes, ...Beato faced the rainy sky and let out a cry of laughter.`
`Then, she slowly raised her face...and stared at Battler.`
`"......Fool.`
` ...Just when I was about to praise your good fight and hand over victory...`
` ......You shall regret that pride..."`
`"This isn't something for you to hand over.`
` I'm gonna take it from you!!`
` The same goes for you, right?!!`
` You could never accept an easygoing victory where I just say 'Maybe witches existing isn't so bad'... Isn't that the very reason you intentionally fell apart like that at the end last time...?!!!`
` That's right, last game, you took pity on me just once, didn't you?!!"`
`"So now I'll pay back that debt! Stand!!!`
` My enemy, my Golden Witch, Beatrice!!!"`
`"Hahhahaha...`
` Fool.`
` ......You foooooooooooool, hhahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` You simpleton...!!`
` You think you'll get another chance?!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!"`
`When Beato yelled, the blue stakes that had pierced her chest blew to bits and disappeared.`
`...However, the blue wedge that had pierced her foot in the very beginning did not vanish.`
`"You can't pull it out yet.`
` You can't pull out the blue truth of the 18th person X...!!"`
`"I will respond to one thing you told me to repeat.`
` As you reasoned,`
` #ff0000Kinzo is already dead at the starting time for all games!#ffffff`
` However, this means that you can take one person out!!`
` #ff0000Before now, I have proclaimed that no more than 18 humans exist on this island.`
` I will lower that by one for Kinzo!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000No more than 17 humans exist on this island!!`
` That excludes any 18th person.`
` In short, this 18th person X does not exist!!`
` This applies to all games!!!#ffffff"`
`"What do you know?`
` Looks like you're still hiding some pretty crazy stuff up your sleeve after all...`
` The island, which had no more than 17 humans on it, has been set up to appear as though there were 18.`
` Taking one off makes it 17, so we've finally reached the correct number.`
` ......This way, the wedge I knocked into you has been removed.`
` We'll have to start the fight over, back from square one...!"`
`The blue wedge that had sewn Beato in place broke apart.`
`......There was no longer anything piercing her.`
`The scars on her body had disappeared completely.`
`There stood, ...just as Battler had hoped for, ...the figure of the majestic Golden Witch who ruled Rokkenjima.`
`"...Then come, Battler.`
` Once more from the beginning.`
` Try and break through everything with the blue truth.`
` I too will no longer play, run, or hide."`
`"If you are worthless, then I shall end this match right here, right now.`
` With my grand victory, I'll make you regret your refusal to compromise for all eternity!!!`
` Come, starting from the first game!"`
`"Right!!`
` From the first twilight of the first game!!`
` #5decffThere's nothing strange about the murder of the six relatives that were found in the gardening shed at the start!`
` The crime was possible for any of those who didn't have an alibi!!#ffffff"`
`"Valid.`
` Continue, what about the next closed room murder, with Eva and Hideyoshi?!`
` Even the chain was set for that closed room!`
` I shall add to the red truth.`
` #ff0000Both deaths were homicides!`
` It is not the case that, after the construction of the closed room, one of them committed suicide after committing murder!`
` Furthermore, the murder was carried out with both the victim and the perpetrator in the same room!`
` No method exists for the perpetrator to commit murder from outside the room!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffSuppose that the culprit was a human without an alibi.`
` In other words, the dead!`
` We weren't able to identify some of the first six corpses because of their smashed faces.`
` Maybe one was actually a disguised corpse, and culprit X killed those two after making us think they were a victim and hiding away!`
` Then, after the closed room murder was constructed, the culprit hid under the bed and waited for all of us to come and leave!!#ffffff"`
`"Very well, next!`
` Kanon was killed in the boiler room, correct?`
` I shall add to the red truth.`
` #ff0000All of the survivors have alibis!`
` Let us include the dead as well!!`
` In short, no kind of human or dead person on the island could have killed Kanon!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffIf no one could kill him, then he might've been the one to kill!!`
` Kanon-kun might've killed himself.#ffffff"`
`"Repeat it!`
` 'Kanon-kun did not commit suicide'!"`
`"#ff0000Kanon did not commit suicide#ffffff."`
`"One more.`
` Repeat it, 'Kanon-kun's death was a homicide'."`
`"I refuse to repeat it."`
`"By that refusal, it may be possible to view it as a homicide, but you've already proclaimed in red that no one could've killed him.`
` In other words, it wasn't a homicide.`
` This is the same as the linked closed rooms from the third game."`
`"#5decffKanon-kun died for a reason that was neither suicide nor homicide.`
` The details are unknown, but he died due to an accident.#ffffff"`
`"#5decffBecause of the Devil's Proof, I refuse to explain what kind of blunder could've led to an accidental death where a stake was driven into his chest!!#ffffff"`
`"Hohoh, now that you have borrowed the power of demons, you are without peer!`
` It is valid!"`
`"In that case, what about the murders after that in the parlor, of Genji, Nanjo, and Kumasawa?!`
` Naturally, `
`#ff0000Maria, who was in the same room, did not kill them!`
` And of course, their three deaths were homicides!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffWe can explain those murders with culprit X, who hid away using an unidentified corpse.`
` After all, those three had their faces smashed.`
` It's completely possible that one of them was a body-double corpse!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000I guarantee the identities of all unidentified corpses.`
` Therefore, there were no body double tricks!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffThen you can explain it with simultaneous murders.`
` Each of them had a gun, pointed it clockwise, and blew each others' faces off at the same time!`
` After that, Maria collected those guns and hid them!!#ffffff`
` How about that?!!!"`
`"What?! ...What a ridiculous argument!!!`
` H-How amusing...!!`
` Then what about Natsuhi in the end?!"`
`"I shall add to the red truth!`
` #ff0000Natsuhi's death was a homicide!`
` There were no unidentified corpses, and all of the survivors have alibis!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffYou can explain it with an indirect murder due to trap X!`
` Something was done to Aunt Natsuhi's gun.`
` It could have been a trap gun, built to send a bullet right into the forehead of anyone who tried to hold it up and shoot it!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000The bullet buried into Natsuhi's forehead was not fired from her gun!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffIt's possible that Aunt Natsuhi was lured out by that letter, whose contents were unknown!`
` She was called out into the hall.`
` Then, she was forced to stand at a specified location at a specified time and murdered by trap X, which used a gun that had been installed there beforehand!!#ffffff"`
`"Wonderful!!`
` These reckless arguments of yours are even starting to feel pleasurable now!`
` Out of respect, I shall hand the first game over to you...!!`
` Well done!!`
` ......Gaaaah!!!"`
`The instant Beato acknowledged her defeat in the first game,`
` the stakes of the blue truth once again pierced her chest, letting out a terrible sound...`
`"...Ku, ...gwah, ......gaaaaaahhh!!!`
` This is still...hardly painful, ...and it's not over yet!!`
` Come, now for the second game!!"`
`Beato just barely pulled out the stakes that had pierced her chest,`
` ...but even though there was no hole left behind, she still seemed to be bearing a deep wound that was letting out a massive amount of blood.`
`And, she was tormented by an equally fierce pain...`
`But Beato grinned, grinding her teeth, and pushed for the next game to start.`
`But I won't feel sympathy for her.`
`...Just by her existing there, we've been killed and harassed over and over,`
` ......and Ange's been burdened with a future of isolation...!!`
`"Correct, just by my being here and laughing, this eternal hell will continue...!!`
` I won't give your little sister back...!`
` Let her cry over the family that shall not return for the next thousand years...!!"`
`"Damn iiiiiiiiiittt!!`
` No compassion, no mercy! On to the second game!!`
` I'll start with the first crime!`
` Right after it happened, I penetrated to the truth of the closed room murder where the six were killed in the chapel.`
` #5decffSomeone secretly borrowed Maria's key...and secretly returned it to Maria's bag after the crime was over!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000From the time Maria received her key to the instant Rosa unsealed the envelope the next day, the key passed through no one's hands!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffThat door might've had an auto-lock, just like Gramps' study.`
` In other words, it was unlocked before the crime, with a rock or something wedged in so that it couldn't close completely.`
` Then, someone gave the key to Maria.`
` The lock was automatic, so it's possible to make a theory where the key wasn't needed!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000There were no doors with auto-locks other than Kinzo's study!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffThe victims locked the door from the inside.`
` One of the six was the culprit, and this person killed the other five, then pretended to be dead!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000The six were already dead by the time they were discovered!`
` All of their deaths were homicides!`
` All six were genuine victims and did not take part in a mutual murder!`
` There was no simultaneous murder!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffThere were people, Kumasawa-san in particular, who had no alibi at the time.`
` If we assume that someone was hiding on the inside, then we've got no problems!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000There was no one hiding in the chapel.`
` Therefore, the shut-in murder you suggest does not work!#ffffff`
` What's wrong, is that all, Ushiromiya Battleer?!`
` It's not so easy once you get to the second game, riiiight?!"`
`It was a thundering exchange of red and blue truth.`
`The stakes and wedges of blue truth that I sent flying attacked one after the other, and Beato cut them down one after another with her red truth, her red treasured sword, knocking them down.`
`But the blood she'd lost from the first game was probably serious.`
`This intense exercise was putting an even greater strain on her.`
`I could also see her breath grow ragged.`
`That's why I can't hold back now!`
`...I'll corner that witch!`
`This time I'll break through her!`
`"Not yet, aah, it's useless, it's all useless!!`
` My twisted logic isn't finished yet!!`
` Then what about this?!!"`
`"#5decffThe food they were given had small bombs in it, which exploded from inside their stomachs.`
` In other words, the crime was possible through trap X!`
` The exact nature of bombs they could swallow without noticing and which could also blow open their stomachs is a Devil's Proof!`
` I refuse to explain!!#ffffff"`
`"Pfft, hhahahahahahahhahahahhaha!!`
` What the hell's thaaaaaaaaat?!`
` Small bommmmmmmbs?!`
` Waahhahahahahhahhahha!!"`
`But Beato failed to knock down the blue wedge as it flew at an angle like a breaking pitch.`
`It let out a loud *thunk*...and gouged itself deep into her left shoulder.`
`However, even as the breaking pitch hit her, her laughter didn't seem to be stopping.`
`...Yeah, I get it, even I think that theory's pretty screwed up...!!`
`"Hah, laugh as much as you want!!`
` Got a problem with that?!!"`
`"None!!`
` Quite a pleasurable, reckless argument!!!`
` Next up is the closed room with Jessica and Kanon!"`
`"No problems there!`
` #5decffIf the culprit was one of the servants, they could've used a master key.`
` It's not even a closed room!#ffffff"`
`"After that, there was an attack in the servant room from a mystery person who seemed to be Kanon, and Nanjo and Kumasawa were killed, right?!`
` I had already proclaimed Kanon's death in red before that time.`
` So, who was that Kanon?!"`
`"#5decffIf Kanon-kun's death was proclaimed with the red, there's no way he was alive.`
` Therefore, there's a chance that the one who attacked that group was in a disguise that made everyone mistakenly think it was Kanon-kun!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000They would never mistakenly think any other person was Kanon!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffThen, just like the heredity of Kinzo's name, there's a possibility that Kanon's name was inherited by someone.`
` You could suppose that Kanon-kun was killed, a different person succeeded that name, and that this person attacked them!!#ffffff"`
`A sound like a watermelon being squashed rang out, and a blue wedge was buried deep into Beato's left flank...`
`Maybe it hit in a bad place, since it seemed to be really effective.`
`After leaning over and moaning for a while, `
`...she laughed it off as though trying to make it seem like no big deal.`
`Yeah, I get it.`
`That must've hurt a lot...!!`
`"Hyahhaaaaaaaahhh!!`
` Once again, you've set up some Human as the culprit as if it were nothing!!`
` You truly are gabbing on about things you'd never be able to open your mouth and say on the game board!!"`
`"And yet it's valid!`
` That reckless argument is pleasurable!!`
` ...Truly pleasurable.`
` ......This isn't pain, ...it's pleeeeeeasure!!"`
`When Beato howled, the wedge that had pierced her was blasted away.`
`But the wound remained, and she continued to be tormented by a fierce pain.`
`"You ready? I'll keep going.`
` My blue truth for the last murder in the second game, the three who died in Aunt Natsuhi's room, should still be valid even with the 18th person X denied!`
` Do you have a counterargument for that in red?!`
` If you don't, the second game is all mine too!"`
`"No, I don't!!`
` Fighting over such trivial matters bores me!!`
` I'll give it to you, I'll give you the second game!!`
` Gwaaaaaaaaagghghh!!!!`
` ......Fff, ...gwooooooooooohhhh......!!"`
`The instant she acknowledged her loss in the second game, two blue stakes gouged through Beato's chest this time...!`
`The witch's lungs were gouged, as were her intestines.`
`Her face twisted in anguish.`
`Her body twisted as she gasped in pain.`
`"Does it hurt...?"`
`"Huuuuurt?`
` ...No, no, this just tickles.`
` Uhhyahhyahyahyahhyaaaaaaahhh!!`
` ...At least compared to having your entire body torn to bits and turned into a pile of scrap meat, like your sisteeeeeeeer!`
` I'll make you scrap meat too, then you siblings can be all mixed together like ground beef and pork, *giggle*giggle*, kyahaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"Ahh, ...aaaaaarrrrrrrrggggh!!`
` I'll beat you to death, I'll tear you to bits the same way!!`
` Next!`
` The third game!!`
` How long are you gonna sit around, all worn out like that?!!`
` I've only just started knocking you down to hell!!"`
`"...Guh...gah, ...aaaaaaagghhh!!`
` Naturally, as if something like this could wear me down!"`
`"You're right. We're still just getting started!`
` Come, let us begin the third game, starting with the six linked closed rooms!`
` You supposedly did penetrate this closed room at the time.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` But then you ~ib~killed off Kinzo~ib~...!!"`
`At the time, I theorized that Gramps was the culprit,`
` and that after killing the other five and stringing the keys across each room, he'd constructed his own closed room in the boiler room...`
`...And that there, he'd died in an accident while carrying out some kind of scheme, burning to death in the boiler.`
`But now I've declared that Gramps was already dead.`
`So I've denied my own theory myself, ironically enough...!`
`However-`
`"There's no problem!`
` #5decffPlenty of people besides Gramps could've committed the crime!`
` You could even claim that all the adults holding the family conference were in on it!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000All five master keys were discovered, each in the pocket of one of the servants!`
` The individual room keys were found inside envelopes alongside the corpses!`
` In short, all keys related to the linked closed rooms were locked inside the linked closed rooms!!`
` No key could have been returned from outside the room using the crack of the door, the crack of the window, vents or any place of the sort!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffThen they were killed with poison gas!`
` Even if a key couldn't pass through, gas could, right?!`
` The murder was carried out from outside the closed room!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000All of them had what appeared to be gunshot wounds that were fatal!`
` Murdering them from outside the room would have been impossible!!`
` I shall say more with the red!`
` When the five other than Kinzo were killed, the killer was definitely in the same room as them!`
` I already proclaimed in red at the time that there were no suicides!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffAfter the murder of each person in their respective rooms, the culprit created a linked closed room.`
` But the culprit had no way to return just the key to the very last room.`
` And yet, they were able to do it.`
` After all, the first person to discover a corpse just had to pretend to find the key and pull it from the pocket of one of the corpses!!#ffffff"`
`She couldn't fully block the retort of that blue stake...!`
`Beato was pushed back by the blue wedges that were unleashed on her one after another, finally failed to block one, and once again took a severe wound.`
`"Nnnn, nnnnggg, ...gyaaaaaahhh!!"`
`As she howled in pain, she pulled out the blue wedge that had pierced her right arm.`
`...Beato's entire body had been torn apart and pierced with blue wedges, stakes, and blades, over and over again,`
` and now she was totally covered in blood.`
`But even so, Beato grinned.`
`Cackling as though this was amusing...!`
`"Fuhhahhahhaaaaaaahhh!!`
` How could a man who promised to bring Ange's parents home voice a theory where those parents are culprits?"`
`"Splendid, even that's just fine, riiiiiiight?`
` Go be a big, happy family getting their hands dirty with mass murder,`
` then return to Ange stained with blood that will never come oooooooooff!!`
` How could we expect anything less from the people who returned alive from the witch's islaaaaaaaaaand?`
` Just what that mincemeat Ange neeeeeeeeeeeeeds, hyahhaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!"`
`"Aaaaaarrrrgggghhh, shut uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuupp!!`
` I'll kill you!!`
` I'll tear you apart!!`
` No need to waste your time begging for your life, I'll definitely give you the worst kind of death by my own hands!!"`
`"Yes, you probably could do it...!!`
` I've explored the depths of cruelty for over a thousand years, and you probably will gift me with a fitting end for all that...!!"`
`"Ooh, does that hurt?`
` Is it harsh?`
` Or does it ticckklllllleee?!"`
`"Is that supposed to torment me, come on, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeer, there are still mysteries leeeeeeeeeeeeft!!"`
`Beato had already countered my first powerful move, the 18th person X,`
` by making the number of people on the island 17.`
`But just limiting the number of people to 17 didn't overturn the theory that Aunt Eva was the culprit.`
`I can crush most of the murders in the third game this way...!`
`Blood dripped from all over the body of the Golden Witch...`
`I cornered her, this time thoroughly without mercy.`
`This isn't a game played to decide who wins and who loses.`
`...Yeah, we aren't playing.`
`Even the time I spend playing and fighting like this...delays my trip home.`
`In her isolation, Ange will continue to have her heart torn apart by loneliness and sadness...!`
`I have to go back to Ange as fast as I can!!`
`"......You're all worn out.`
` Standing at death's door, are you?"`
`"...*cackle*cackle*`
` ...It still...doesn't burden me...`
` ...Something like this......!`
` ...*cackle*cackle* It tickles...!!"`
`"It looks like you don't need any mercy."`
`"I never asked for it in the first place."`
`"I'm going all out."`
`"Do so.`
` When our roles were reversed, I showed no mercy.`
` So you ought to do the same when given the chance."`
`"Otherwise, I'll summon another isolated Ange from a different world,`
` and this time, I'll tear off her arms and legs, stick her with a spear and roast her, okaaaaaaayyy??`
` Uhhyahhaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!"`
`"Shut uuuuuuuuuuup!!`
` Never again!!`
` Not my family!`
` Not my relatives!`
` Not any of the servants!!`
` I won't let you make them your playthings!!"`
`"...I've already broken through all of the mysteries in the fourth game with the blue truth.`
` ......The only one left is the very last one from the third game.`
` ...Only the murder of Doctor Nanjo."`
`"...Oho, ...have I already been cornered so far...?`
` ...*cackle*cackle* What a precarious state I'm in...`
` ...Iiihhihhihhihhi, ...ghagh, *cough*cough*!`
`"`
`She coughed violently, spitting up blood.`
`...Her insides had been punched through so many times.`
`It was only natural.`
`"In other words, the mystery of Doctor Nanjo's murder is the last line of defense for you being a witch, right...?"`
`"......As you say.`
` If you defeat that, it will mean that all of my mysteries have been defeated.`
` ......Unless I counter one of your truths with some new red truth...or present a new mystery,`
` I...will die."`
`".........`
`...You don't look like someone who's been pushed into a corner, standing on the brink.`
` ...You still have some kind of hidden pitch up your sleeve, right...?"`
`"Well, who knows...?`
` I have already tired of a too-long life after a thousand years...!`
` I've started to think that having this life ended by a rival like you, whom I stumbled upon at the very end, ...might not be so bad."`
`"*cackle*cackle* You can do it, can't you?`
` Do it.`
` ...I beg you, kill meeeeeeeee.`
` I'm always the one killing, and I've never had the experience of being kiiiiiilled!"`
`"I've killed the 18 of you hundreds of times, but I haven't been killed myself even once,`
` so I wanted to experience it just once myseeeeeeeeelf, hehihihihihihihihi!!"`
`It was a graceless show of boldness, unchanged from before.`
`...But blood dripped from her mouth, her once beautiful dress was covered with holes,`
` and blood poured from all over her body, making her physical appearance stand in sharp contrast to her attitude.`
`Maybe the shot she'd taken to the flank was still tormenting her,`
` since she was still pressing down on it unconsciously, without a trace of grace.`
`...But I've got no time for pity.`
`As long as I feel sympathy for this witch, my family and I won't be released from this place.`
`...Until I defeat her, we won't be able to go home...!!`
`In the outside world, it may be possible for even enemies to understand each other when circumstances change.`
`But pure evil does exist.`
`Evil that brings misfortune just by existing...and is to be spared no compromise.`
`Just by its continued existence alone, ......it's evil!!`
`"I don't pity you.`
` Just like how you didn't show pity for any of us...!"`
`"......Well, of course.`
` All of you are just pieces in the game!`
` It's just unbelievably fun to think about which six to kill in the beginning, how to kill the next two, `
`and whether I can find a much, much more grotesque method of murder, you seeeeeeeeeee??"`
`"Hey, Battler, I've reformed a little, so forgive me this time too.`
` If you do, I'll change my methods of killing into something a little better, okay?`
` I'll listen to how you want them to be killed and in what order, got iiiiiiit?"`
`"It's so fun, toying with people's liiiiiiiiives!!`
` I'm sure you could think of a way to turn Ange into a pile of scrap meat much, much more thoroughlyyyyyy!!`
` Come, Battleeeeeer!!`
` Try to expose the truth of Nanjo's murdeeeeeeeeeeeer!!"`
`The 18th person X has been defeated.`
`But I won't give in...!!`
`I'll stop that witch's breathing cold!!`
`The end of the third game.`
`It was announced in red that the survivors at that point in time--Battler, Eva, Jessica,`
` and Nanjo--were all uninvolved with Nanjo's murder.`
`And it was also proclaimed that he was murdered directly, by someone before his eyes.`
`All other people had the strongest possible alibi...by having their deaths proclaimed in red...`
`......I'll...break through this, without using the 18th person X...!`
`Think, don't stop thinking...!!`
`Her red doesn't only bind me, it's also supposed to be her weak point...!`
`I've got to somehow use it against her......!`
`'!s0`
`...there's still a gap...!`
`Yeah, ...this way, I can break through it.`
`This way, Beatrice's legend of the witch is finished.`
`"...True, the others probably were dead.`
` #5decffHowever, their deaths were not proclaimed in red at the instant Doctor Nanjo died.`
` Strictly speaking, it was in the fight between me and EVA after Doctor Nanjo's corpse was found.`
` In other words, if someone was alive at the time Doctor Nanjo was killed, and then died before EVA made that proclamation, you can sew right through that crack!!`
` In other words, it's like this.#ffffff"`
`"#5decffSomeone who was first confirmed dead by EVA's proclamation was a culprit.`
` They cleverly played dead earlier and waited for us to come and go...!`
` Before their death was announced in red, we were made to think that they'd died.`
` Then, they killed Doctor Nanjo...and later died for some reason!`
` After that, EVA proclaimed their death in red!!#ffffff`
` That theory can explain Doctor Nanjo's case!!"`
`"How's that, Beatrice?!"`
`When he forcefully asked that question, ...there was a terrible sound that could only be likened to that of a compressor,`
` and a blue stake that was as thick as a log...`
`appeared from under the earth and skewered the Golden Witch, Beato, pulling her up into the air...`
`Ugly tearing sounds rang out,`
` and each time, ...a blue stake or wedge would appear and pierce Beatrice's body.`
`...When that finally ended...`
`Her tragic form was exposed there, pincushioned by more than ten stakes and wedges all over her body and dripping with blood, ...dangling and crucified...`
`...There was none of the dignity of the brutal witch who had sneered at the honor of the dead and toyed with and killed hundreds of the living.`
`The rain, which had started falling at some point, ...quietly tormented the crucified witch...`
`As Battler heaved with his breathing, he waited for some kind of answer from the Golden Witch...`
`...Although it wasn't long, `
`it took the witch a bit of time to show any signs of life...`
`"......It hurts...`
` ...It huuurts......"`
`"...You got...what you...deserved.`
` ...Now you can experience a portion of the pain felt by all those you've killed..."`
`Even as he said that, it seemed Battler had lost a little of his momentum at this extremely pathetic sight.`
`...Even if it was an enemy,`
` he couldn't look straight at a woman exposed in such a brutal fashion.`
`But even so, ......unless he destroyed Beatrice,`
` this battle...wouldn't end...`
`'!s1`
`......I beg you......`
`...hic..."`
`Huh...?`
`...Beato let out a sob...`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, bea_9e797:`
`...huuuurts......`
` ......End it...`
` ......End it......`
` ...Even with this, I still...`
`...can't die...`
`hic...`
` ......Even though it hurts so much, `
`......I still...`
`...can't die......`
`......hic...!"`
`'!s1`
`...asking...`
`...of me...?"`
`"......End it......`
` ......Release me......from this pain......"`
`Beato's expression...was soaked with blood and tears.`
`Battler certainly had been tricked by her at one point.`
`...So he was probably able to suspect that her expression...that even her tears were an act.`
`However, ......Battler...believed in those tears.`
`......After all, those tears...`
`had the red of truth mixed in with them.`
`"...What should I do?`
` What can I do to end your pain...?"`
`'!s1`
`...expose...everything.`
` ......This is...`
`......my...`
`heart."`
`"...Your heart......"`
`"......ll...me."`
`"......Beato..."`
`'!s1`
`...ll`
`...me...`
` ......Just...`
`...let...`
`me...`
`die......`
`...hic, `
`......nngaaaahhhh......"`
`Were those tears from pain and torment, ...or else...`
`Either way, that pathetic expression...`
`was painful for Battler to look at, even after burning with such anger...`
`"...Quickly, ......go back...to...Ange......"`
`"I'll listen to your request.`
` Not so that I can go back, ...but to end your pain."`
`'!s1`
`ou... `
`......Battleeer......`
`...nnnngggggg..."`
`In her last breaths, Beato summoned up all of her remaining strength...`
`and managed to close both of her hands into fists...`
`A red light began to gather at those fists.`
`'!s0`
`......as though appealing to the heavens for something...`
`"...You'll......be able to kill me...`
` ......All of me...`
` ...My heart......`
` ......Crush it.`
` ......Pierce it.`
` ......Okay...?"`
`The red light around both her arms gradually began to strengthen...`
`"......Ple...a......"`
`After saying that much, ...her face tilted to the side a bit.`
`Then, her right arm lost its light and flopped down.`
`...But her left arm alone did not lose its light...and remained held out towards the heavens.`
`Then, ......before Battler's eyes,`
` another Beato appeared with a faint form, transparent like a curtain.`
`...The crucified Beato had already lost consciousness.`
`'!s0`
`...her eyes expressionless, `
`......and spoke.`
`"......`
`#ff0000Ushiromiya Battler.`
` I will now...kill you.#ffffff"`
`"......And...?"`
`"......`
`#ff0000And right now,`
` there is no one other than you on this island.`
` The only one alive on this island is you.`
` Nothing outside the island can interfere.#ffffff"`
`...I...understand.`
`This is...`
`the 'last mystery' Beatrice will be able to make as a witch.`
`She's...trying to offer it to me.`
`Entreating me...to solve this final mystery...`
`and kill her...`
`"Do it......`
` I'll accept...your final mystery."`
`"......#ff0000You are all alone on this island.`
` And of course, I am not you.`
` Yet I am here, now, and am about to kill you.#ffffff"`
`"Like a souped up version of Doctor Nanjo's murder...`
` ......So...?"`
`"......Who...aaam I...?"`
`"Is that......your final question?"`
`'!s1`
`aaam I......?"`
`Then, ...Beatrice slowly approached me and, still expressionless, ......held me...`
`......Yeah, I get it, Beato.`
`I'll......kill you, don't worry......`
`I also...slowly held her head.`
`......Then I, as a piece,`
` left the game board...`
`'!sd`
`@`
`A fork was stuck into a shortcake peeking out of a gift box, `
`and there were decanters with drinks of various colors lined up on a side table.`
`But the color of the partially finished drink that had been poured into a cup was venomous, matching none of the decanters.`
`Someone had probably been playing around, mixing various things together.`
`That can be lots of fun, if you don't mind the taste.`
`On top of the fluffy bed were several colorful, big pillows like something from a dream.`
`And on this bed that looked like something out of a child's dream world,`
` Bernkastel lay face down, `
`and Lambdadelta lay face up, clutching a pillow and relaxing...`
`"Ahhahahhahhahha, it was pretty thrilling this time, wasn't it?`
` I got reeeally panicky when Beato said she'd stop the game."`
`".........What a rude witch, to start a game like this and try to end it by throwing it away."`
`"Wasn't Ange a good piece?`
` After Beato ran for it, Ange dragged her back and made her resume the game.`
` Although it's a shame that she gave Battler a little too much enthusiasm."`
`"......After all, I knew Battler was a softy."`
`"No kidding.`
` He looked like he might even go easy on Beato, his enemy."`
`"......I was uneasy that, like the last game, he might actually feel compassion for Beato and take the game in a weird direction.`
` ......Ange was a trump card to get Battler back on track when he mistook his goal.`
` ......Although I wanted her to support him a bit more before using her up.`
` She really did get used right off the bat.`
` What a waste for a piece that required so much preparation."`
`"Hehheheheh!`
` Good thing I shackled her with that rule about not giving her name!`
` If that hadn't been set up, the brother-sister tag team would've swallowed Beato up and won in the blink of an eye."`
`"......I thought it'd be a chance for them to press her all at once, `
`but your mark was so restrictive that I couldn't make the best use of her.`
` ...Aaah, what a waste that piece was."`
`"Isn't it obvious that such an unfair piece would have to be retired right away?`
` Well, in the end, she did a good job of preventing the suspension of the game, and that helps me out too.`
` The way she made both our interests match is what made her a truly wonderful piece."`
`"......She was an innocent kid like Battler, so it was easy to get her to do as I said.`
` ......Morons and impulsive types make the best pieces.`
` ...Aaah, I really can't stand losing that piece."`
`"By now, that kid's minced meat!`
` Hey, let's make hamburgers out of her later on☆`
` Oh wait, didn't you like gyoza more?`
` I wonder what little sister tastes like, *giggle*, hilarious!"`
`".........Is it really okay for you to be so relaxed?`
` Thanks to Ange, Battler has gotten all fired up.`
` I'm pretty sure he's started a hot pursuit of Beato, making this game take a big turn in my favor, right...?`
` I mean, didn't Battler just solve almost all the mysteries up until now?"`
`"Huuh?`
` Nooot even close!`
` Almost all of Battler's blue truth was wrong!`
` Beato's lukewarm red is full of holes.`
` If she had any brains in her, she'd slip through it easily by setting up a suitable web of twisted logic.`
` ...Yeah, it really ticks me off.`
` If it were me, I'd thoroughly cut down all of it with the red."`
`"......Oh, really?`
` And I was sure that those were all correct.`
` ...Well, I don't know about that small bomb part though."`
`"Not all of Battler's blue truths were valid.`
` ...When talking about the first game, Beato clearly declared that `
`#ff0000she guaranteed the identities of all unidentified corpses#ffffff!`
` This defeats Battler's theory about the culprit of the Eva/Hideyoshi closed room murder being someone who faked up a corpse."`
`"Next, Kanon might've died in an accident in the boiler room, but...*giggle*!`
` What kind of accident could drive a stake into his chest?`
` Are you a moron?`
` I'll slice it with that red treasured sword thing."`
`"#ff0000Kanon did not die in an accident!#ffffff`
` For the next one, the murders of the three including Genji in the parlor, the thought that it was a simultaneous murder where they shot each other in a clockwise pattern at the same time is laughable.`
` #ff0000Genji, Kumasawa, and Nanjo are not killers#ffffff!"`
`"The final trap X to kill Natsuhi was also ridiculous.`
` #ff0000The thing that shot Natsuhi wasn't a trap, it was a real shooting murder with a gun raised and trigger pulled!#ffffff`
` *giggle* Sucks for you...!"`
`"...You shouldn't do that.`
` Saying something like that in red.`
` That kid's trying to say that she bounced Natsuhi's bullet back with magic and killed her."`
`"Ohohohoh, oh my, how terrible of me, you're right...!`
` Even the blue truth for the second game was way too naive.`
` #ff0000When the six were murdered in the chapel, the culprit was inside the chapel!#ffffff`
` That guy keeps trying to explain things using trap X.`
` What the heck is trap X, some weird mystery novel cliche?"`
`"It's also laughable to say that, in the case where Nanjo and Kumasawa were killed in the servant room, someone else inherited Kanon's name.`
` #ff0000No one else can go by Kanon's name!`
` A different person can't claim that as their name!#ffffff"`
`"And that theory about borrowing the master key from Rosa for Natsuhi's room is also worthless!`
` #ff0000After the master keys came into Rosa's control, never did any of them leave her hands!`
` Except for the time when she lent one to Battler to unlock Natsuhi's room.#ffffff`
` I can keep on going, but just taking a quick look at them turns out like this, get it?"`
`"......Forget taking a quick look, ...you've just denied Battler's blue truth for the first and second games across the board.`
` ......My, my, what a shame.`
` If Battler heard, he'd faint."`
`"...Right?`
` Beato wasn't cornered at all.`
` ......Looks like that kid's a pretty good actress after all.`
` I'm sure she planned to make it look like she was getting cornered this game,`
` and then sometime next game, *bang*, she'll slice it up with a single red stroke to make Battler freak."`
`"*giggle* And then I'm sure she'll say it again with a huge smile.`
` 'Witches neeever get into a pinch'!`
` Pff, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"......Then that whole tragic atmosphere as though Beato was getting cornered was all an act?"`
`"Isn't it obvious?!`
` She really is a great actress!`
` Even though she wasn't cornered at all, it felt like an astonishing, last-episode climax!`
` She's totally the winner for best supporting actress this year!!`
` Oh, but of course I'm the star!`
` You'd do fine too, Beeern!"`
`"......At the end, she said something like 'Kill me' and laid out a big riddle.`
` Wasn't that her last stand, with Beato to be finished for good if that riddle was solved?"`
`"*giggle*giggle*...!`
` Come on, were you seriously tricked too, Bern?`
` That wasn't even close to a last stand!`
` Beato's still holding back a killer hidden move.`
` ...When she stuck out both hands to give the final riddle, did you notice how she lowered just her right hand?"`
`"...Yeah, now that you mention it.`
` ......Is that what that meant?"`
`"Sure is!`
` That kid still had plenty of hidden moves left!`
` And none of the mysteries have been solved...!`
` That tension, like she'd been exposed and the next episode would be the last...`
` She truly is a genius at acting.`
` Yeah, I wanna see her knock Battler down to the very bottom right away!"`
`"That kid's been totally encouraged by her 'North Wind and the Sun Strategy' from last time, right?`
` I'm sure Battler will sympathize with Beato again and fall for it completely...!`
` After all, a single tear from a woman can fool a man, totally economical and profitable!!"`
`"......I wonder if Battler will get caught by the same move again.`
` I've got to spur him on so he never feels sympathy again.`
` ...Although Ange's mincemeat seems to have done that pretty well."`
`"A power-up from an Ange-flavored hamburger?`
` Ohhohohohohohoho!`
` Of course, I won't lose either.`
` Starting here, I'll thoroughly support Beato to rally her up enough to compete with Battler.`
` ...Beato won't lose.`
` I mean, I'm threatening her with a wonderful punishment game if she loses♪"`
`"......Your punishment games are seriously not cool, so you should go a little easy on her."`
`"I've decided what to do for your next punishment game, Bern.`
` Wanna hear? Wanna hear?"`
`"No."`
`"Come ooon, ask me☆`
` Guess what, guess what?`
` I'll lock you in a wonderful, wonderful castle.`
` That castle will be surrounded by pure white castle walls, 12 kilometers to a side.`
` With a height of 10 meters.`
` Magic and tricks are prohibited!`
` You really couldn't jump over that, right?"`
`"1,440,000,000 cubic meters?`
` ......You can stop there, I already know what you're going to say."`
`"Eheheheheh!`
` And that place will start getting buried with gems, one every day!`
` I'll lock you in it until the castle walls are packed with them, and you've been buried to death with gems.`
` Isn't that a wonderful, romantic punishment game?"`
`".........If you multiply the length of the walls by five and make it one tenth its current height, I wouldn't mind if you shut me in it right now."`
`"Really?!`
` That would make it 3,600,000,000 cubic meters, right?!`
` The time period for the punishment game would more than double, right?!`
`'!s0`
`@:dwave_eng 0, lam_9e328:`
`Lambdadelta playfully approached Bernkastel, who yawned, looking bored, as she touched the bottom of Lambdadelta's chin as though cuddling a cat...`
`"You're betting on Battler's victory.`
` And I'm betting on an eternal tie for the two of them.`
` ......Doesn't that mean no one's betting on Beato's victory?"`
`".........I wouldn't.`
` Her chances of winning are zero."`
`"Ohohoh!`
` How truly pitiful, being told by the Witch of Miracles that there's no chance of a miracle!`
` Although I wouldn't bet on her either, right?`
` I can say that with certainty!"`
`"......It's also pretty sad when the Witch of Certainty says that you're certainly screwed."`
`Unusually for them, they giggled together...`
`"I wonder how this game will resolve itself..."`
`"......Yeah, that's the one thing we can't predict.`
` ...That's why it's fun."`
`"I won't permit escaping or suspensions any longer.`
` I'll certainly make them continue their game, and I won't let them run away...!`
` Even though I can't even imagine what will happen next,`
` I know it certainly won't end that way."`
`".........At the very least, it won't end with Beato's victory."`
`"I mean, think about it.`
` Neither of us `
`is betting on Beato's victory!`
` In other words, if it looks like Beato is gonna win, she'll have us two Great Witches as enemies...!"`
`"......Exactly.`
` Our powers are most in equilibrium when balancing between a tie and Battler's advantage.`
` If it tips too much in Beato's favor, both of us will line up along the same vector and drag Beato back."`
`"In other words, the instant Beato's in a superior position, ...she'll have to deal with both of us as enemies.`
` ......Ehheheheheh!`
` A common front with Bern, sounds fuuun♪"`
`"......Thanks.`
` ...But I'm not going into a konpeitou candy bath with you."`
`"Aaaw, and I was gonna cover you with melted marshmallows `
`while taking a konpeitou shower."`
`"......How pitiful.`
` That child is a living toy, a doll you caught so that you could play with me, Lambda."`
`"I'm good at playing with dolls.`
` ...I really can do it well, okay?`
` I'm proud of being able to play with a single toy for hundreds of years without getting tired of it."`
`"......You're her ally at some times and oppose her at others,`
` toying with her for all eternity.`
` ...How pitiful. That kid is now our doll."`
`"Hehheheh, that's right, that kid is our doll.`
` No end has been prepared for that kid except the ones the two of us desire.`
` In other words, I can say for sure that this can only end by repeating a tie for eternity because of me,`
` or else with Beato losing and being destroyed because of you, Bern.`
` ......Heheh, ...as far as this game ending with Beato's victory goes..."`
`"......I will proclaim it as the Witch of Miracles."`
`"Then I will proclaim it as the Witch of Certainty."`
`""Beato certainly cannot win.`
` And a miracle certainly will not occur.""`

` Who was that person, who was it?!`
` She didn't say her name! That's mean!!`
` Hey, don't you think so too?!"`
`"...I have a general idea.`
` ...Or rather, I imagine most people would've figured it out."`
`"Most people?!`
` Well I don't get it, and it was that character's first appearance, wasn't it?!`
` If she doesn't say her name, I won't understand, the players won't understand, no one will understand, right?!"`
`"......Beato, don't bother telling her.`
` See?`
` Isn't she a funny kid?"`
`"I-Indeed.`
` ...Lady Lambdadelta's innocent airhead side is truly precious and amusing.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Come on, come on, why won't you tell only me, you meanie?!!`
` In exchange, I'll teach you a special secret that only I know!`
` So tell me!"`
`"...Hoh.`
` A special secret, you say?!`
` I want to hear, I want to hear...!"`
`"Bleah!`
` If you want me to tell you, first tell me who that girl really was!`
` The secret I know sure is awesome!`
` After all, it's about as awesome as knowing that Santa-san is actually daddy!`
` Huh?`
` *giggle*!`
` I said it☆ Sorry, I'll bet you're so shocked that it turned your world upside-down, right?!`
` Ohohohohoh!"`
`"......So, your father was the one who came to your place, Lambda?"`
`"He came...wait, what do you me-an?"`
`"...Lord Santa Claus only visits the homes of children with pure hearts.`
` I guess he didn't come to your place, did he?"`
`"Well, Lord Santa Claus is gracious.`
` Unless you're a re-ally bad scoundrel, he'll give you a present.`
` After all, he even gave them to me!"`
`"......As you grow and your heart is hardened, he stops coming, doesn't he?`
` How old were you, Beato, when he stopped coming?"`
`"Indeed.`
` He kept coming until I was about 12.`
` When my maiden's heart awoke, I quickly got somewhat embarrassed about Lord Santa coming."`
`"After I wrote 'Thanks for everything, that's enough,`
` so make sure you splurge on the last set of presents', he stopped coming.`
` Oooh, and I was looking forward to it too!`
` How old were you when he stopped coming, Lady Bernkastel?"`
`"......I was pretty wild.`
` ...It happened fairly early.`
` I think when I was about 9.`
` ...Something about that beard really irritated me, so I waited in my futon with some sewing scissors ready, trying to cut it off.`
` ......What a painful age."`
`"So, ...as far back as Lady Lambdadelta can remember, Lord Santa Claus never came to see her, huh?`
` ......He usually comes until the last year of elementary school or during middle school."`
`"...Maybe we should take her to a doctor.`
` I hear that being too precocious can have negative side-effects on the growth of mind and body.`
` ...Yeah, you can definitely see some of those.`
` ...Those negative side-effects."`
`"Hey, wh-what are you people talking about?!!`
` Bleeeeah!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Wahahahaha, it truly is boisterous when three witches gather!"`
`"...If you're talking about a secret on that level, I doubt this will be worth listening to.`
` Can I go now?`
` I have to get ready for the next game."`
`"What, hey, wait a sec!`
` Tell me who that woman really was!!"`
`"...Well then, tell me this special secret of yours first.`
` If it's good enough, then I'll tell you."`
`"Hohohohoh!!`
` Okay, I'll tell you, 'cause it really is a special secret!`
` ...Remember, in this game, there was a girl who found the gold and became the new witch, right?"`
`"Indeed.`
` And just what kind of secret might that person have?"`
`"Ehheheheheh!`
` I figured out who that girl really is.`
` Does anyone know?`
` *giggle*giggle*!`
` There was a hint in the way she talked."`
`"Remember, that girl said it a lot, didn't she?`
` 'If only you'd just blaaaah',`
` right?!`
` Yes, that phrase is the key point!`
` If only? Ifffonly?`
` Evvvvonly?!`
` Yes!"`
`"She was actually...Ushiromiya Eva!!`
` What do you think?!`
` Are you shocked?!`
` Ohohohohoh!!"`
`"Hoh...!`
` I never noticed that!`
` ...Muu, to think that there would be a hint in a place like that."`
`"...You're a real good sport, Beato.`
` This kid tends to get full of herself, so try not to overdo it.`
` See you, I'm leaving."`
`"Wait, wait!`
` It's not fair if you just listen to my secret and don't tell me yours!!`
` Tell me who she really was!!"`
`"...Your secret was so amazing that mine just wouldn't match up.`
` ...So in exchange, I'll teach you a special secret.`
` I'll tell you the name of the culprit in this game called 'Higurashi no Naku Koro ni'."`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, don't say it!!`
` I'm still playing i-t!!"`
`"...Ahhahahahahhahhahhahha...`
` See you, Beato.`
` The black tea was delicious.`
` However, the repertoire of jam on the crackers was lacking.`
` Add some gochujang chili paste every once in a while.`
` It goes great with Russian tea.`
` Later."`
`"Oh, I see.`
` I shall try it.`
` I'll call for some after preparing the next game.`
` Until then, feel free to polish up your strategy at your leisure."`
`"Yes, I'll do that.`
` This last game was pretty interesting.`
` Later."`
`"He-y, wait a sec, tell me-!!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` My, my, you two really are close."`
`"............`
`...Yes, that's right.`
` ...Oh, I really like you, Bernkastel.`
` You could even say I love you.`
` ...I want to gouge out your eyes so that you see no one other than me.`
` ...Oh, that would be so wonderful.`
` It'd be great to dunk them in black tea.`
` Aha!"`
`"To think that you would be so entranced, Lady Lambdadelta.`
` ...I have a serious responsibility.`
` Still, this last game really was close!`
` I was a breath away from getting Battler."`
`"......Beato,`
` can I ask you something?"`
`"What is it?`
` I won't tell you that girl's name.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"...When are you gonna stop fooling around?`
` ...Are you even trying to win?"`
`Lambdadelta threatened her with a low voice that she had never used in front of Bernkastel.`
`...It completely blew away the calm atmosphere that had been there until a moment ago.`
`"......You know `
`I'm supporting you because you're supposed to be a witch who can win against Bernkastel.`
` If you don't have the power to win against her, `
`then I'll abandon you right away, okay...?"`
`"......How harsh of you.`
` What about me dissatisfies you?`
` ...As you know, my game board is perfect.`
` Lady Bernkastel will never be able to win..."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` Your board truly is impressive.`
` It truly is an impressive and perfect game board that Bernkastel definitely won't be able to win in, not even after a hundred years, `
`or even a thousand years."`
`"...That's why I made you a witch in exchange for letting me borrow it.`
` ......If I stop being your guardian, you'll immediately go back to being a Human.`
` ...Make sure you don't forget that, no matter how much incredible magical power you hold, ...you are nothing more than a temporary witch."`
`"...I-I understand.`
` ...I'm grateful to you..."`
`"Don't speak so casually to me.`
` I'll forgive that when Bernkastel's around, but not when she isn't.`
` I'll bet you've started to forget how much you owe me."`
`"Th-That is......n-n-not so..."`
`"...Aah, you really are disgusting.`
` Go ahead and talk the way you usually do.`
` But be mindful of what you say.`
` ...I have a surprisingly short temper, you see?"`
`"I-Indeed..."`
`"Let's get back to what we were discussing.`
` ...Your game board truly is perfect.`
` ...You should be able to defeat Bernkastel without any trouble.`
` ...But that kid won't surrender easily.`
` She'll challenge you over and over."`
`"That is no problem.`
` ...It has been certified by you, Lady Lambdadelta.`
` ...My game board is perfect."`
`"Yeah, that's right, it's perfect.`
` ......But are you, the player, perfect as well?"`
`"......What do you mean by that...?"`
`"What do I mean?`
` That's what I want to hear.`
` ......You play around a lot in your game.`
` ...Sometimes, that ends up confusing Bernkastel, so at first I thought it was some special strategy of yours."`
`"......But I get the feeling that's not quite true.`
` Rather than toying with the opponent in a match you can win, `
`...you don't actually care whether you win or lose, right?"`
`"R-Ridiculous...`
` How could that be...?"`
`"You know what?`
` Your role is to make Bernkastel surrender.`
` In other words, that means being the victor in this game for all eternity.`
` ...As long as you keep trying to become the victor 'with certainty', then I'll give you my power as the Witch of Certainty.`
` ......However."`
`"If you fight in a way that doesn't eliminate any possibility of your loss,`
` ...that's a different story."`
`"Of course, this is a game...`
` Just as Lady Bernkastel will lose when I win,`
` ...I will sometimes lose when she wins.`
` The possibility of loss always exists.`
` Therefore, I will-"`
`".........This is why you're useless.`
` There's no need for you to be a game board.`
` You just have to be a bird cage that can lock Bernkastel up here for all eternity."`
`"...What's the role of a bird cage?`
` Making certain the little bird inside never escapes.`
` ...What's a bird cage worth if it has cracks that sometimes let a bird out?"`
`"......O-Of course, games exist for the purpose of winning.`
` And it is impossible for me to lose.`
` ...Therefore, I will continue to win...`
` ...As you wish, for all eternity..."`
`"Good answer, that'll be fine.`
` ...I'll allow you to play around and use fakes as part of your tactics.`
` It ended up being useful during parts of this round."`
`"......But you know what?`
` If you make a move hoping for anything else other than victory,`
` ......make sure you're prepared for something amazing, okay?"`
`"I-I will not do such a thing...`
` I swear it...!"`
`"......Because originally, you weren't even a witch, and at any time, `
`I'll remind you what a truly shabby creature you were.`
` ......If you betray my expectations, that is.`
` As soon as you do, you can look forward to a fun, fun punishment game."`
`"...In the world of billions of Fragments, ...I'll send you into the most miserable one and seal you there.`
` ......You were already miserable to start with, so there's gonna be some reeeally miserable Fragments out there for the picking.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"............"`
`"Oh, I love you Bernkastel.`
` ...Struggle in Beatrice's bird cage as much as you like,`
` and over the course of a thousand years, realize that you can no longer escape."`
`"...And when you surrender,`
` ...I'll train you so that you can't do anything other than cry in the palm of my hand."`
`"......*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*`
` Ahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!"`

`@:dwave_eng 0, bea_9e89:`
`"...Dried plum black tea.`
` ...The kind that goes for 200 yen a pack."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!`
` ...For a thousand years, I have been fond of black tea, but I did not know of such a thing.`
` ...I will never tire of living in this world."`
`"......Beato,`
` you don't have to display such hostility.`
` ...I am just a wandering witch.`
` I didn't come with the intention of violating the rules of your territory."`
`"...*cackle*cackle* Hostility? I bear nothing of the sort.`
` ...I am just terribly concerned with seeing to it that the legendary witch, Lady Bernkastel, is well attended to."`
`"...You misunderstand.`
` I am powerless.`
` Before a witch such as you, who possesses the dreadful power to kill an individual a hundred times, I am completely powerless."`
`"That a powerless Lady Witch like you possesses a power that none can approach is what is truly terrifying.`
` After all, that Great Witch, Lady Lambdadelta, was dethroned by you alone."`
`"...I only won an endurance contest.`
` She simply got tired."`
`"That is not what Lady Lambdadelta said though.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle* Too much humility can be unseemly, Lady Bernkastel."`
`"...That girl has a dreadful power.`
` ...The power to kill an individual 'without fail'.`
` However, 'without fail' doesn't exist in this world.`
` No matter how many times you divide one, you can never reach zero.`
` That girl has the power to bring the odds of failure down to 'almost exactly zero', ...the power to give rise to 'almost perfect certainty'.`
` ...I hope I never have to fight such a terrifying witch again."`
`"However, you have the power to cause success without fail, 'as long as the odds are not zero'.`
` ...Though you say 'without fail' doesn't exist in this world, you possess an infallible power yourself.`
` ...How very terrifying, *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"...The power to kill an individual 'endlessly'...`
` ...I think you're the more terrifying one."`
`"You jest.`
` ...From your point of view, mine is but a trifling power.`
` This is most certainly what one would call empty praise."`
`"...Call it flattery to make up for the cost of staying here.`
` ...I am a fleeing traveler who crosses the #fefefeFragments#ffffff, continually running from boredom.`
` ...I simply came around because I heard you'd started something interesting.`
` Have no doubts that I will choose to leave as soon as you are no longer interesting."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!`
` I, Beatrice, am deeply and humbly delighted to have the great Lady Bernkastel as an observer.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` And so, your impressions?"`
`"...Lambdadelta is terrifying because of her cruelty, but she's a girl I can understand.`
` ...You do seem to be capable of affection, but I can't understand you at all.`
` That makes you much more terrifying than her."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!`
` I am fickle by nature.`
` Do forgive me.`
` ...Besides, I believe you also enjoy entrusting your fate to the roll of fickle dice, right, Lady Bernkastel?"`
`"...When I roll the dice, I have a roll I clearly want to get.`
` Unlike you.`
` You, on the other hand, never let the dice fall from your hand.`
` So, whatever the roll might have been, you're never disappointed.`
` Whatever roll the dice show you, you are satisfied 'without fail'.`
` ...In that sense, you far surpass me."`
`"...You're one I really don't want to fight with.`
` Inside of you, there's nothing but zero.`
` That's why I can't win against you with my power.`
` ...It's the worst compatibility.`
` ...Perhaps Lambdadelta, on the other hand, has a good compatibility against you.`
` Since she would be able to kill your 'endless' nature."`
`"*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` ...Oh yes, witches truly are the best people to enjoy black tea with.`
` One doesn't get bored.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"...Then, I'm relieved.`
` Boredom is the only poison that can kill me.`
` ...So, don't kill me, okay?`
` Lady Beatrice, Endless Witch."`
`"If such is your wish, I, Beatrice, shall show you an even better time.`
` ...In that case, wouldn't it be best if I brought the next chessboard in right away?`
` It seems the next tale would do more for you than another cup of black tea."`
`"..............."`
`"Just wait for a moment.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*!"`
`...Something troublesome seems to have taken a liking to you.`
`I'd really like to lend you my power, but as you just heard, that girl's power and mine have a very bad compatibility.`
` Unfortunate as that may be.`
`But you really are pitiful, so I'll help you out just a bit.`
`First of all, about that girl.`
`She does have the name Beatrice, but that doesn't necessarily mean she is 'one individual woman'.`
`Get what I mean?`
`In other words, she's not some Human.`
`Her existence is a personification of the rules of this world.`
`To beat her, you have to expose the rules of this world and unravel them.`
`Perhaps this can be likened to learning the rules of chess by watching a game.`
`First, take a good look at the chessboard.`
`Then, learn the movements and roles of the pieces.`
`Then, look for the conditions required to win at her game.`
`When you've managed to reveal all these things, her heart will be exposed.`
`After that, you can rip it apart or crush it as you please.`
`...I am being quite generous.`
`In the past, when I had a human body, it took me a hundred years to notice even this much.`
`This is my meager farewell gift to you, the pitiful one captured by Beato.`
` It's just like a spoon.`
`A spoon can be used for more than just drinking soup.`
`You can use it to dig through the prison you're locked in, or as a weapon to gouge the witch's eyes out.`
`...Of course, you can also use the spoon to continually sip the watery soup inside your eternal cell.`
`...Don't get the wrong idea. I have no intention of becoming your ally.`
`I do feel empathy for you, but I won't help you.`
`...It's like I'm sitting in front of the television yelling at you on the other side, even though my voice won't reach you.`
`SO, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I AM A WITCH, RIGHT?`
`I intend to enjoy this endless tale that Beato is going to weave until I tire of it.`
`But that alone won't hold my interest.`
`...That's why I'll lend you my power.`
` It's all so that I don't get tired of this.`
`I am the cruelest witch in the world.`
`Whoever the opponent may be, I'll make them surrender with certainty.`
`...Even if it's Beatrice, the Endless Witch, okay...?`
`You are my game piece.`
` Give it your best shot.`
`I'll give you advice sometimes, out of her sight.`
`Don't bore me, okay...?`
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*...`
`'!sd`
`The room was colored with hygienic tones...in other words, an emotionless white.`
`...It was a room at a certain university hospital.`
`Neither her doctors nor the person herself had any doubts that this room, `
`which had a price so high that no commoner could afford to spend a single night there, would be the last room she ever saw...`
`Was the person on the bed...`
`...Eva?`
`Even if someone told you that was so, she was unbelievably aged and worn out.`
`The well-built man in a suit waiting in the corner near the door was having a whispered conversation through an intercom with someone outside.`
`...He was a guard protecting Eva's person.`
`After telling the person on the other end of the intercom to wait, he approached Eva's bed.`
`...Eva had been awake for a short while.`
`...However, she stared at a single point in empty space, as though her mind was not in the same place.`
`"...Ange (縝寿)-san has arrived in the lobby below.`
` Should we let her pass?"`
`"............"`
`For a long time, Eva didn't answer.`
`However, bit by bit, her eyes began to regain their focus, and she gave a small nod, indicating that she didn't mind if they called Ange.`
`...It had been Eva who called her.`
`And she was right on time.`
`By this point, Eva would refuse anyone who wanted a meeting without an appointment.`
`The room was dark, even though it was still light outside, ...because the curtains were always closed.`
`...There was always one guard waiting in the room, and three more waiting in the corridor and the lobby.`
`They were all there to protect Eva's person...`
`Eventually, there was the sound of a knock.`
`Also, there was a message from the intercom that the guest's body check had been completed with no problems.`
`The door was unlocked, then opened, `
`......and a high school aged girl was standing there.`
`"Chairman,`
` Ange-san has arrived."`
`Eva reacted and turned her face towards the guest.`
`However, instead of reacting to the guard's call, maybe it would be better to say that she reacted to the smell of Ange's makeup.`
`...After being shut up in this room for so long, Eva was sensitive to even small changes in smell.`
`"............`
`So you came,`
` ...Ange."`
`"...I came.`
` You did call me."`
`On Eva's face, there was no trace of a person warmly welcoming their niece.`
`...And on Ange's face, you couldn't see the expression of one pleased to meet with their aunt.`
`Eva waved her arm, which had grown as thin as a withered branch, and motioned for the guard to leave.`
`The guard bowed silently and went out into the hall.`
`"...It's not only stuffy, but dark too.`
`"......Is your plan for that hit man you hired to shoot me through the window...?"`
`"......I wish I could get hired to assassinate you.`
` All I'd have to do is relax at home for a month and the job would take care of itself."`
`"...Heheheheh, hahhahhahhahha..."`
`Their discussion was quite morbid for an aunt and niece.`
`...However, they didn't look like they were joking.`
`...At the very least, Eva believed that someone was after her life.`
`All of the Ushiromiya family's massive fortune had come into the possession of Ushiromiya Eva.`
`...It was said that this fortune also included the 10 tons of hidden gold that Ushiromiya Kinzo was rumored to have hidden.`
`While this vast wealth lay in Eva's cunning, sly, and suspicious hands, no one was able to complain,`
` ...but it was rumored that as soon as it was passed on to Ange, who was no more than a young girl, certain people were plotting to snatch it away.`
`By now, Eva and Ange were Kinzo's only descendants.`
`...If Eva died, all of the wealth would go to Ange.`
`...And if Ange were then to be killed as well, `
`...that wealth would go to the family of Ange's mother, Kyrie.`
`In this sense, not only Eva, but Ange as well,`
` ...were in a position where it wouldn't be odd at all for their life to be targeted by some unknown person.`
`...And Eva had hated Ange for a long time.`
`This was because she knew that, after losing her only precious son, George, `
`...the inheritor of her own wealth would be none other than the girl who had been absent at that family conference 12 years ago, `
`and who had survived.`
`Eva shunned Ange, disliked her, and even hated her.`
`She isolated Ange in a special school and separated her from the youth and happiness normal people have, trying to keep her as a pet until death.`
`...However, Eva had succumbed to an incurable illness,`
` and ironically, ...her remaining life was estimated to be the same as Kinzo's had been at that family conference 12 years ago.`
`Both Eva and Ange...hated each other.`
`Even though they were each other's last blood relatives, ...they hated each other so much that they hoped the other would die quickly...`
`"......And?`
` Why did you go to all the trouble of calling for me...?"`
`"...I don't have much time left.`
` ...These quack doctors still can't detect any of the poison that's filling me up.`
` ......I know.`
` I'm sure it's some secret assassination drug used by those Soviet KGBs.`
` ...Ooh, I'm gonna be killed, I'm gonna be killed...!!`
` Isn't that great?! Very soon, I will die, which will surely be quite a load off your back...!"`
`"............`
`...What a pitiable person."`
`This always happened.`
`...They immediately deviated from the main topic, distorting it into a more unsettling discussion.`
`Eva, who was absolutely paranoid, believed that someone was always after her life.`
`And in actual fact, after inheriting the vast wealth of the Ushiromiya family,`
` she had used wild methods just like Kinzo had done in the past, repeatedly making money by any means necessary and creating many enemies along the way.`
`With a massive supply of capital, she had plotted to aggressively buy businesses that were starting to have rapid growth, `
`making them buy it back at a high price under the guise of reconciliation.`
`...Ironically, it was the same type of action that her husband's company had been hit with 12 years ago...`
`She had repeated this constantly for 12 years.`
`...She had also earned a lot of hatred.`
`If her husband had heard of this from beyond the grave, he might have defended her, saying that the loneliness from losing her family fueled her actions.`
`...However, of all the people who knew her now, none would defend her.`
`For some time, Eva eloquently spoke of how her life was being targeted,`
` listing off names of people who hated her,`
` and sneering at the fact that she still hadn't been killed.`
`Even though Ange heard her own name included in that list,`
` there was no particular change in her expression, and she waited indifferently for Eva to tire herself out...`
`"......You see, `
`...I really hate you."`
`"I'm honored.`
` Same here."`
`"......I built this future for George's sake.`
` ...To think that it would be snatched away by you.`
` ...To think that it would be stolen away by Rudolf's daughter...`
` ......I can't bear it.`
`'!s1`
`...without even leaving behind a child...`
` ......That, `
`...I cannot forgive......!"`
`"...If only you'd just give all of your fortune to charity.`
` What about all those religious people you used to go so far out of your way to find?"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*!`
` They all say the same thing.`
` ...My excessive wealth has become a burden to me.`
` And they always say something about how I need to give it up and cleanse myself.`
` ...Ahhahahahahahahahaha!`
` Then I thought of something.`
` I stopped donating!"`
`For a time, Eva had searched for the founders of several strange and new religious cults, perhaps seeking peace in her heart.`
`...But they gave her heart no relief, `
`and if anything, they ended up increasing her paranoia further...`
`"......If you have too much money, why don't you start buying up thoroughbreds and make some corned beef?"`
`"I've thought of something even more interesting.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I've worried over it a lot.`
` What could I do to make things horrible for you?"`
`"...I thought about killing you.`
` I also thought about erasing all of my wealth, leaving you penniless, and selling you off to a slave trader or something.`
` Wouldn't that be wonderful?`
` You'd have your arms and legs chopped off and be forced to take customers until you died.`
` Aaah, that would be so wonderful, `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"......Is this fun for you?"`
`"Oh yes, it is.`
` It's fun to scare you, `
`...but very soon, I will die.`
` ...So I thought about how I might continue to cause you pain even after my death.`
` ......And then, ...*cackle*cackle*!!`
` It was surprisingly simple.`
` ...I called you because I wanted to talk about it."`
`".........I have midterms coming up.`
` Keep it brief."`
`"...I have decided.`
` I will have you inherit all of my fortune."`
`"............`
`...Oh?"`
`"Not only that, `
`...but I decided that until the very day I die, `
`...I'll expand that fortune as much as I can, inflating it to massive proportions before having you inherit all of it.`
` ...*cackle*cackle* Can you even imagine what that would be like...?"`
`"...I don't get it.`
` Because it's stupid."`
`"Ehhehhehheh, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` That's right, you don't get it, do you...?!`
` Look forward to it, it really is fun, being rich...!`
` Every day, youkai from across Japan come to play."`
`"From now on, your entire life will be followed by talk shows and weekly magazines.`
` The media will criticize me no matter what I do or don't do!`
` If I donate, they'll attack me for being bourgeois, and if I hesitate, I'll be abused as a miser.`
` Oh, every day really is wonderful, you see?`
` I decided it'd be great let you have that kind of life, when you're so young and have so much ahead of you.`
` Doesn't that sound absolutely wonderful?"`
`"......Looks like the public's opinion of all you've done was spot on."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Too true, yes, that is too true.`
` ...Go ahead, abuse me as much as you want.`
` Soon, you will face that same criticism.`
` ...Japanese culture dictates that good people live in honorable poverty, while the wealthy should just die.`
` No matter what you do or do not do, you will eventually be lifted up as a symbol of envy and hate across Japan.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"I wonder how twisted your life will become after living that way...`
` You have no allies!`
` No one will listen to your worries.`
` Abusing you will become a public sport.`
` And no one can stop that!"`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, eva_9e79:`
`oh, I'm really looking forward to it.`
` ...I wonder how you will live your life...and how you'll end it...!`
` Enjoy to the fullest a life of being unable to trust anyone in the world, being unable to love anyone, being unable to talk with anyone...!!`
` I'll be patiently waiting for you to take that story of hardship down with you into hell.`
` Heheheheh, `
`ahahhahahahahahahaha, `
`wa-hhahhahhahhahhahhhahahahahahahahahahhahha, `
`gkk, `
`*cough*cough*, `
`ghah!!"`
`Her insane laughter turned into a painful cough.`
`Without changing her expression in the slightest, looking completely unconcerned, `
`...Ange stared at the only survivor of Rokkenjima.`
`Perhaps because he found the violent coughing suspicious, the guard gave a short knock on the door and rushed in at the same time.`
`Ange glanced at him, wordlessly making it clear that she didn't intend to move a step from where she was.`
`...Ange was prepared for some kind of trap to frame her in Eva's death.`
`However, that was fortunately a needless fear.`
`As the guard rubbed Eva's back, he poured hot water from a thermos into a mug.`
`As he did, Eva kept coughing, apparently in pain.`
`Ange figured that this was probably the last she'd see of the Rokkenjima Witch's final days.`
`Eventually, the coughing subsided, and Eva regained her normal breathing.`
`...However, the glittering madness inside her eyes hadn't subsided in the slightest.`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Now, I will give to you...`
`that cursed mass of gold and the Ushiromiya Family Headship, `
`...as well as...`
`...the name of the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
` ......Enjoy the insane, twisted rest of your life, fitting for the name of the witch...!"`
`"I don't need that.`
` More importantly, tell me.`
` ...On that day, what happened on Rokkenjima?`
` ......I don't believe it was an accident.`
` Tell me the truth about what happened that day, and why Father and Mother and Nii-san died...!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!`
` Oh, yes, that is the best way I have to harass you, isn't it?`
` ...What happened on that day?`
` What happened on this day in 1986...?`
` ...You want to know what they said before they died, riiight...?"`
`"I won't tell yoooooouu, `
`aaahhhyahhyahhyahhyah!!`
` I'll leave behind the cursed gold!`
` But you know what? I'll take the truth you seek with me to hell...!`
` That's the best way I can torment you!!"`
`"Oh, are you mad?`
` If you want to hear it so much, try going to hell and asking your family there!`
` In that case, you'd better die right now, right?!`
` Ahhahahahahaha, if only you'd just give up and die right now!!`
` Waaahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`That laugh continued until she started coughing again.`
`And that cough did not subside until she started moaning and going into convulsions...`
`October 4, 1986.`
`On Rokkenjima, the Ushiromiya family's customary...and final family conference was held.`
`And on the next day, October 5...`
`'An extremely unfortunate accident' occurred, and the Ushiromiya family was wiped out.`
`'Fortunately', Ushiromiya Eva escaped from that...`
`and inherited almost all of the Ushiromiya family's fortune.`
`However, due to the many turbulent rumors surrounding the Ushiromiya family, the way Eva acted afterwards, `
`and her unnatural actions 'at the time of the unfortunate accident', the public was in an uproar over whether this might have been a conspiracy to get all of the inheritance for herself.`
`Under pressure from the public, prosecutors repeatedly tried to investigate the matter, `
`and the media began tracing the outline of a conspiracy they called the Rokkenjima Suspicion,`
` but in the end, they weren't even able to find proof that this 'unfortunate accident' was a crime.`
`However, because the media continued to give the impression that the Rokkenjima Suspicion was a conspiracy of Eva's,`
` public opinion began to believe that she was the true culprit.`
`...Of course, that was also influenced by the bad impression caused by all that easily-condemnable, overbearing financial activity,`
` which she had carried out using that vast wealth.`
`Every time she did something and the rumors started spreading, the media would bring back the Rokkenjima Suspicion, `
`blaming the criminal justice system by saying that she was the true culprit, and that the only reason she hadn't been arrested was because even the police had been bribed.`
`So the impression that she was a great villain grew stronger and stronger...`
`Her heart eventually degenerated, `
`...and ironically, it began to transfigure her into the kind of human that the public expected...`
`By now, Eva had no one she could trust...and no family.`
`...After her beloved husband passed away, the talk shows occasionally mentioned his company, `
`saying that it was run recklessly, while criticizing and disgracing its former accomplishments.`
`Even her beloved son, George, `
`was dramatized as the stereotypical 'rich, lazy son' that the public expected,`
` ...and no one even wanted to know what a simple and honest character he had possessed.`
`...As to how much all of this hurt Eva and ran her to ruin, ...no one cared.`
`The public was only interested out of curiosity...`
`about how a super-rich evil woman who killed her whole family lived her pitiful later years.`
`So that happened more and more, `
`...and eventually...`
`...Eva's personality was transfigured until people started calling her a lunatic...`
`It was said that this sometimes reminded her of her father, whom she had once admired, in his later years, `
`and that she laughed at herself with scorn...`
`And, on the day of that final family conference...`
`Because Ushiromiya Rudolf's daughter, Ange, had been sick and had stayed with her mother's family, she had not participated.`
`At the age of 6, she had lost her family and had gained Eva as her guardian.`
`Since Ange had become Eva's only blood relative,`
` Eva 'took very good care of her'.`
`She had imposing guards surrounding Ange's person at all times, to prevent her from coming to harm.`
`...Ange had even her right to play with friends, to come home from school together, and to enjoy the seasons together...stolen away.`
`'So that she can live a full and pleasant school life',`
` Eva had sent Ange to an elegant boarding school that took care of her every need, completely isolating her from the world.`
`She didn't even know the popular songs that girls her age might hum.`
`She was never given a chance to enjoy window shopping with her friends or stuffing her mouth with crepes,`
` ...much less an encounter with a member of the opposite sex to make her heart throb.`
`Ange did not have a single friend.`
`If anyone carelessly acted friendly with Ange, they would be scolded by the guards, or else the teachers.`
`...All of them were strictly ordered not to let shabby humans approach the daughter of the esteemed Ushiromiya family.`
`During that time, the talk shows were always mentioning Ushiromiya Eva, always spreading rumors about her countless financial misdeeds.`
`...Those who knew who her 'daughter' was naturally began to keep their distance.`
`...Even now, she was called a witch at school, and anytime something bad happened,`
` even if there was no proof, it would be whispered--whispered as though if were absolute truth--that she had imposed her will on the school staff.`
`The environment makes the person.`
`By now, she had a heart as wild as those around her feared.`
`...No one trusted her, so she never bothered to believe in anyone.`
`No one loved her, so she never even tried to love.`
`And when Eva caught an incurable illness on top of all this,`
` it was whispered that this too was a conspiracy, and this time, Ange was set up as the mastermind...`
`Everyone whispered that the daughters of witches are witches too.`
`Even the talk shows and the weekly magazines whispered that.`
`'!s0`
`accepted it as though it was definitely...`
`no, `
`as though it was obviously true.`
`Therefore, since she already believed that she was a witch, `
`when she heard that the name of the Golden Witch was being turned over to her, she only felt like saying 'You just figured that out now?'`
`However, she was at least sure of one thing.`
`This title of witch that she had inherited...would definitely never be inherited by anyone else.`
`She would be the last Head of the Ushiromiya Family, and the last lonely...Golden Witch...`
`Ange could be seen on the roof of a skyscraper.`
`Compared to the winds of the world that had beaten down upon her until now, this strong, cold wind was warm and pleasant.`
`Below her lay a beautiful nighttime scene, and a dazzling river of red and white lights.`
`It was supposed to be clear out that night.`
`...So there really should have been countless stars stretching out over the sky.`
`...However, the light from the ground was too bright, so you couldn't see them at all.`
`...Ange couldn't help but think that what she truly sought must lie in that unseen starlight.`
`The world of reality below her looked so far away from here.`
`...She could imagine that this place was the closest to the world she really should be in.`
`......There was only one thing that Ange cursed.`
`Why had she not been able to go to that family conference, on that day 12 years ago?`
`Even though, if she had gone, it would probably have been possible for her to stay with her family forever.`
`...Lately, ...she'd been dreaming about her family over and over again.`
`The person I was 12 years ago calls out frantically, urging them not to go to the family conference.`
`But both Dad and Mom are too far away, and my hand won't reach them.`
`Battler nii-san always loved me a lot, and he'd always pat my head, `
`......but even though it looks like that hand's about to touch me, even it does not reach.`
`For some reason, I started having that dream over and over.`
`...Every time I had that the same dream, `
`I uselessly tried to stretch out my hand even more forcefully, over and over and over.`
`Even if only Battler nii-san had lived...`
`......Then, perhaps, we'd at least be able to support each other in my cold and lonely reality.`
`But his hand never reaches me.`
`Even if I climb to the roof of this tall building, `
`...I'm so far away from all of them.`
`...A mysterious girl appears in my dreams and urges me.`
`She urges me to find the truth of what happened 12 years ago.`
`"............`
`...If only I could learn...`
`...everything that happened to Father and the rest of them on that day, `
`......would they come back?`
` At least one of them...?!"`
`There was no way...`
`that anyone would answer that question for her.`
`I get it.`
`......In this world, I have no family or friends.`
`So, `
`......let's go.`
` ...Let's go home.`
`...To where my family is.`
`From the start, ...Ange's figure had been on the outer side of the fence.`
`The scenery below her eyes was distant, beautiful, and so fantastical that it actually didn't give rise to fear.`
`If I look down, I'll surely be swallowed up by the world below.`
`...So I looked up.`
`Because I wanted to be taken to the world above, the world where my family was.`
`......Who cares about vast wealth?`
`Who cares about cursed gold?`
`Who cares about the Golden Witch, Beatrice?`
`What I really want, even a mountain of gold couldn't get me...`
`What I need for that...is to take a single step forward, ...just that little bit of courage.`
`......At that moment,`
` ...I definitely heard a voice.`
`It was a voice I knew.`
`A voice that had...called to me in my dreams for so long...`
`Before my eyes...in other words, in mid-air above that jet black nighttime scenery...`
`...There was the figure of the girl I'd seen in my dreams...`
`She spoke again, with the same voice I'd heard in those dreams.`
`"......Your assistance is required."`
`"...My...`
`...assistance...?`
` Who needs it...?"`
`"......Your family needs it.`
` ...Your family has been eternally imprisoned in the span from this day 12 years ago until the following day."`
`"I-If I save them, `
`...does that mean my family will come home?!"`
`When I asked the question I had most wanted to, the girl cruelly stopped talking and hung her head.`
`"...I cannot promise that.`
` The enemy is the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
` ...A mighty opponent.`
` I cannot oppose her.`
` ...But, another Golden Witch might be able to manage something."`
`"......I-I don't know...what you're talking about."`
`"...The only one who can oppose the Beatrice of 1986...`
`is the final Beatrice of 1998.`
` ......In other words, you.`
` Ange.`
` ......#fefefeANGE#ffffff Beatrice."`
`"That witch from 12 years ago...`
`...took away my family......?"`
`"That's right.`
` She is your foe.`
` ......The root cause that always leads to your future of isolation."`
`"............`
`'!s1`
`...family's...`
`...foe."`
`"...In exchange, I will search for a Fragment with the ideal world that you wish for, a world where your family comes home.`
` ......I make no promises that your desire will be granted.`
` ...Beatrice's game board in 1986 is quite perfect."`
`"...I had planned on bringing you that ideal Fragment as a present today, but I still can't find it.`
` ......This is a very firm fate.`
` I haven't seen the likes of it since the time I fought Lambdadelta."`
`".....................`
`I-`
`I don't know...`
`what you're talking about."`
`"......I'm giving you a chance for revenge.`
` ...In exchange, I promise to search for and bring you the happiest resolution among the possibilities you're capable of accepting."`
`"............Revenge..."`
`"...It may be a fruitless effort.`
` Even if you succeed in your revenge, there's no definite proof that your family will return.`
` Even if you manage to hit a miraculous probability, you may only be able to bring one person back, if that."`
`...Ange understood the meaning of that dream.`
`...The dream where it seemed that, with just a little more stretching, her hand might be able to reach at least Battler nii-san.`
`"A miraculous probability...means it's still higher than zero, right...?`
` Is it 1%...?"`
`"...Trying to read any probabilities before the result is useless.`
` So I cannot tell you that number."`
`"But it'll definitely be slightly more likely than if I do nothing."`
`"Yes.`
` As long as you do not throw that desire of yours away.`
` But be prepared.`
` It is extremely close to zero."`
`".........`
`Okay.`
` I'll take you up on that offer."`
`"...Are you sure?`
` You probably won't be able to return here again."`
`"This isn't the world I'm supposed to be in.`
` ...I'll find the world I am supposed to be in myself.`
` Tell me your name."`
`"The Witch of Miracles, Bernkastel.`
` And by that name, `
`I acknowledge you as the Golden Witch, ANGE Beatrice.`
` ...As of now, you are a true witch."`
`The instant she proclaimed that I was a witch...`
`...I felt dizzy, as though something inside me had changed drastically.`
`At that time, I heard a *clunk*.`
`...It was the sound of the door that opened to the staircase to the roof.`
`It was Aunt Eva's guards.`
`...They're only 'guards' in name.`
`Aren't they the cage that wraps the tightest around me, shutting me in?`
`They saw that I was already on the other side of the fence and dashed forward, horrified.`
`"20, we've found the target.`
` Requesting backup on the roof."`
`"Ange-san...!`
` We were looking for you!`
` It's dangerous there, so quickly, come this way!"`
`"......What's that?"`
`"...My fan club.`
` ...I'm pretty popular."`
`"No point in getting caught.`
` ......Let's go."`
`Looking annoyed, Bernkastel turned on her heels.`
` ...In the jet black sky.`
`Watching that perfectly casual gesture, I followed her as though it was completely normal.`
`"Ange-san!!!`
` Wait!`
` Don't be hasty, look ooooooooooouuuut!!"`
`"Aaah, it's useless, it's all useless.`
` Well then, <see you again> next time.`
` Please send a limo to get me.`
` 'Cause everyone else will be there too.`
` See you."`
