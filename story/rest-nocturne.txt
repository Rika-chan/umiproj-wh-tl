`"You idiot!!`
` Isn't it obvious?!!`
` It'll be fun to kill her and see your face twist in pain, why else?!!`
` Gahyahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"Look, look, don't turn your eyes away, look at it.`
` Look, look, look!`
` It's magic, it's furniture, no matter how much you try to deny me and magic, look, look, look, look, look!`
` Gyahhahhahahaha!!"`
`"Sorry, Battleer.`
` It was pretty fun.`
` Sure, I just did what Teacher told me, but look how great it turned out!`
` Apparently, if you start out all hostile and needlessly brutal, then turn incompetent and soft at just the right moment, you can spark a huge bump on your affection meter, ri-ght?`
` Kyahahahahahaah!!"`
`That lonely tone...was the desolate sound of the wind blowing by.`
`The glittering rose petals on these bushes...were all golden.`
`The cloud of gold butterflies that had once danced through this golden rose garden like fluttering rose petals...`
`was no longer anywhere to be seen...`
`The master of the Golden Land is the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
`She might be called inhumane and cruel.`
` Arrogant and outrageous.`
` Or perhaps...naive and simple.`
`That laugh of hers, which lost its grace more and more the longer it continued, ......could no longer be heard.`
`The Golden Witch Beatrice...`
`sat like a doll, resting in a deck chair adorned as beautifully as the golden rose garden itself.`
`...She wasn't relaxing there.`
`Her eyes were empty.`
`She didn't respond to any questions.`
`Even so, she was not permitted to sleep.`
`Beatrice sat like a doll...`
`Her hair was down, and Virgilia was carefully tending to it with a comb.`
`The usual Beato would surely have spent this time complaining about this and that regarding her hairstyle.`
`...However, she made no response, showed no reaction.`
`So it really only looked like Virgilia was combing the golden hair of a large doll...`
`There was a table alongside them.`
`On it sat a chessboard, ...along with a jumble of black and white pieces locked in a closely-fought battle.`
`However, this setup looked somehow different from normal chess.`
`...Maybe the game was similar, though not identical.`
`And on the other side, ...sitting back in his chair as he contemplated his next move, was a young man.`
`...No, perhaps it wasn't his next move he contemplated.`
`Every once in a while, he would change the positions of the pieces, reconsidering the situation after every change.`
`Maybe he was reconstructing previous games, trying to discover the thought process behind the moves that had been made.`
`In the past,`
` Kinzo, the Ushiromiya Family Head, once said that learning chessboard arrangements was like taking a journey through the thoughts of the old masters.`
`Ushiromiya Battler...was on a journey.`
`A search for the thought process...that had led the Golden Witch to create this arrangement and make these moves.`
`Battler took a black piece that should have been moved forward...and returned it to its original place, sighing deeply.`
`Battler's pieces were white.`
`However, on this chessboard, the black encampment was on Battler's side.`
`He was reconstructing that arrangement, trying to play Beato's role...`
`"...The more I do this, the less I understand your moves."`
`Even Battler...didn't expect that Beato would respond to that statement.`
`Or rather...he was pretending to talk to himself,`
` ...thinking there might still be some chance of her responding.`
`Beato's eyes...reflected nothing.`
`And her mouth told nothing.`
`"....................."`
`After begging him to kill her,`
` ...the Golden Witch had become a corpse that had given up on life.`
`She wasn't sleeping.`
`...She couldn't step down from this game and was therefore forbidden sleep.`
`So, those words must have reached her ears.`
`However, ...they probably hadn't reached her heart.`
`The Golden Witch would not sneer at Battler's moves, nor would she praise them or belittle them.`
`By now, ...Beatrice was nothing more than a living doll.`
`Even so, she would glance at him every once in a while.`
` It would be an empty glance, but a glance nonetheless.`
`Sometimes, she would seem to make some sort of gesture...`
`or even move her lips.`
`However, her movements never managed to communicate anything to Battler...`
`"How did you decide on this move in this situation?`
` ...I don't get it at all.`
` I don't understand your moves."`
`".................."`
`"...Beato,`
` Battler-kun is talking to you..."`
`".................."`
`"...Say something.`
` Giggle, or guffaw, or something.`
` ...Even use that shrill laugh of yours, if you want."`
`...Can you believe it...?`
`That shrill laugh of Beato's...will never be heard again.`
`However, even if she couldn't answer, his voice surely reached her.`
`...That was what Battler believed as he said these words.`
`So he said it again...`
`"How did you decide on this move in this situation?`
` I don't get it at all.`
` I don't understand your moves."`
`"............`
`...So, you don't understand what this child is thinking?"`
`Virgilia answered in her disciple's stead.`
`Up to this point, she had done her best to avoid speaking for Beato.`
`After all, there was a chance that Beato would respond in some way, and Virgilia didn't want to be the one to steal that chance.`
`...So, Battler was going to have to bear with this silence...`
`...until Beato herself answered.`
`Virgilia could no longer bear to watch Battler like this...`
`Besides, Battler also wanted to hear what Virgilia had to say.`
`He believed that conversation would reach Beato's heart...`
`"Yep.`
` I don't have a clue.`
` ...The more I try standing in Beato's shoes and moving the pieces like this, the less I understand."`
`A serial murder following an epitaph.`
`With that as a victory condition, I tried reconstructing the games from the witch's side,`
` ...but I never ended up making the moves Beato did.`
`In those games, I could find several incomprehensible moves that clearly worked against that victory condition...`
`"...I don't get it at all.`
` This journey through her thoughts is just too rugged."`
`"Even so, you won't give up, will you?"`
`"I won't.`
` ......I promised."`
`Kill...me.`
` ...Let me die...`
`"I promised to let her die peacefully.`
` ......And I'm the only one who can do it."`
`...Beato's right ankle was bound with a heavy, cold, steel shackle.`
`It wasn't tied to anything, so it didn't restrict her movement.`
`However, it symbolized restriction.`
`It was a visualization of the bonds...that prevented her from leaving the game until she either won or lost...`
`And, ...the shackle was probably hurting her.`
`The mercilessly cold shackle...`
`tormented her over and over inside her waking dream.`
`".........Ghh.........ah..."`
`So, there was never any sign of relief in her empty expression.`
`Her eyelids would sometimes tremble like she was having a nightmare, ...and every once in a while, she would let out a pained gasp.`
`Unless I win,`
` ...Beato will never be released from the curse that prevents her from sleeping peacefully...`
`"...Are you sure you want to be doing this?`
` It seems the 5th game has already started."`
`"............`
`...Not interested."`
`Why should I take part in any game unless Beato is my opponent...?`
`If that's the only alternative,`
` then it's a much better use of my time to reconstruct previous games while taking a journey in search of Beato's thought process...`
`"I'll be the next Game Master.`
` Any objections?`
` You've got none, right?"`
`"...I've got nothing but objections.`
` Beato conceded the fight and is unconscious.`
` Isn't this a loss by default and 'game over' for her...?"`
`"I'll admit a lot's happened to Beato, and she's basically been KO'ed for now.`
` But that doesn't mean she's lost the will to fight.`
` That's why I'm acting as her assistant.`
` Get it?"`
`Beato was lying down on a deck chair, almost as though she was sleeping.`
`However, she wasn't sleeping,`
` ...and she wasn't awake either.`
`She was nothing more than a living doll that had given up on victory, who had asked Battler to perform her last rites, `
`and who had surrendered everything...`
`Of course, if everyone just sat around, the next game...the 5th game would never be made ready.`
`So, Lambdadelta had succeeded Beato as the next Game Master and announced that she'd prepare the next game.`
`"Quit messing around.`
` This is a game between me and Beato.`
` I don't know who you two are, but I'm not gonna let you carry on without us."`
`"No one asked for your opinion.`
` What'll you do, Bern?`
` Accept my challenge? Or not?"`
`"............`
`...Sure.`
` Go ahead and inherit her role."`
`"The hell... Quit messing around!`
` I don't know who you people are, but I'm not gonna let you ignore Beato and me and just carry on by yourselves!"`
`"Hey, take it easy.`
` Okay, sure, a new player means you'll face new kinds of moves.`
` I'm sure you'll see a lot of stuff that confuses you, `
`but even that might lead to some big hints, get it?"`
`"Who cares!!`
` Quit saying whatever you want and deciding everything on your own!!"`
`"......Beato's game has repeated four times, and you still don't understand anything, right?`
` In that case, I expect that swapping out opponents might lead to some huge hints."`
`"That's none of your business!`
` This is our game! Beato prepared it, and she designated me to be her opponent.`
` I don't know what hole you two crept out of, but I don't want you screwing things up!"`
`"......In that case, wake Beato up and make her get the next game ready.`
` Can you...?"`
`"...B-Beato won't be getting up for a while.`
` Anyway, we don't even need to have another game.`
` The four games she's already laid out are more than enough!"`
`"And even if we do have some fifth game, there's no reason it shouldn't just be a puzzle Beato lays out and I take on.`
` There's absolutely no reason for you two to butt in!"`
`Battler couldn't hide his irritation at the two witches called Lambdadelta and Bernkastel,`
` who had shown up well after the game's start, and who were now trying to take charge on their own...`
`It looked like these witches were of an even higher rank than Beato...`
` So high, in fact, that even Beato's teacher, Virgilia, couldn't even come close.`
`Battler had the feeling he'd seen these two several times before.`
`However, this was the first time he'd known their names and spoken to them directly.`
`"You can't get the next game ready without waking Beato.`
` That's why I'll prepare the next game!"`
`"We aren't so patient `
`that we're willing to wait forever for Beato to regain consciousness.`
` Right, Bern?"`
`"......I don't like boredom.`
` It really ticks me off."`
`"We really don't give a damn whether you're bored or not."`
`"Come on now.`
` Leave everything to this <perfect> Lambdadelta-sama, okay?`
` I'll take over as the Game Master.`
` DON'T WORRY, I won't play with too much 'absolute perfection'.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~Just like Beato~ib~, I'll set up plenty of incomprehensible fakes, clues, and bonus hints.`
` I'll make this game a huge hint that'll help you understand Beato's world even better, okay?"`
`Letting my voiceless emotions explode, ...I slammed the table hard.`
`The two witches didn't flinch at all.`
`...One grinned.`
`The other looked indifferent, as though nothing had happened.`
`The two of them just stared at me silently.`
` ...As though they were reproaching me.`
`"What's this?`
` Not satisfied?`
` Are you saying you'll step down from my 5th game?`
` Isn't that a loss by default?"`
`"......Battler won't step down.`
` Of course he'll participate in the 5th game."`
`"Don't just decide that yourself!!`
` I'm not gonna play along with you two.`
` I don't give a shit!"`
`"Hmmm...`
` ...Then it really is a loss by default, right...?`
` The witch side wins this game.`
` Is it really okay to end this with the Humans surrendering...?"`
`"......If you step down, the game will end with your loss by default, get it?`
` ......If you wanna guarantee that your lonely sister always meets with miserable circumstances in an endless number of worlds, `
`that option is indeed open to you."`
`When Bernkastel mentioned Ange, ......Battler's expression changed instantly.`
`"...Y-You bastard,`
` don't you dare talk about Ange so lightly..."`
`"......Because you have an ally in me, Bernkastel, the Witch of Miracles,`
` ...there exists the possibility of a miracle in which Ange's family comes home to her.`
` Well, if you do throw that chance away and guarantee that Ange's endless futures all end in sorrow, that might be pretty interesting too."`
`I vaguely understood what she was saying.`
`Until I win in Beato's game, I'll remain trapped in this bizarre world.`
`And if I abandon that victory, ...then most certainly, my parents and I will never return to Ange.`
`For Ange's sake, ...even though I know that the witches are toying with me,`
` I must keep on fighting...`
`"Nng, ......d-dammit......"`
`"......What's wrong?`
` You look unsatisfied.`
` Have you already forgotten how angry you were...when your sister was turned to mincemeat...?`
` You know, that spectacle where she was torn to bits, ripped to pieces by countless red-hot pliers.`
` You'd better watch more closely next time, okay...?"`
`Bernkastel pointed the palm of her right hand upwards.`
`...As she did, a pale light gathered there, ......and some kind of blue-glowing crystal appeared there.`
`...A scene was reflected on its sharp surface,`
` ...but it wasn't the scene that surrounded them now.`
`If you looked deep into that crystal, ...that Fragment,`
` then you would probably learn what was reflected on there.`
`If you stared at it,`
` then you'd surely see the end Ange finally reached......after waiting 12 years and giving up everything for the sake of her beloved brother.`
` ......The scene of her death throes...as her entire body was torn to bits while she still lived.`
`"...D-Damn...you......!"`
`Without thinking, he grabbed at her collar,`
` but as soon as he touched that which made up her form, it disappeared like foam on the waves.`
`Then, as naturally as though she'd been there from the beginning,`
` Bernkastel was leaning against a distant wall.`
`"......If you step down from the game,`
` this'll become not just a Fragment, but a definite reality.`
` I won't be the one to create that future.`
` You'll do it yourself.`
` ...So decide, okay?`
` Figure out what you wanna do with your beloved little sister's future."`
`Battler's fists shook with anger,`
` ...but even if he swung them down, he wouldn't be able to hit Bernkastel.`
`This witch was like a phantom, or a cat who wouldn't even let someone pet her if she didn't wish for it.`
`And, ...she was telling the truth.`
`For Ange's sake, I can't step down from this fight.`
`Even if these unpleasant witches hijack the game board.`
`"Heheheheheh.`
` That's just like you, Bern.`
` You're even heartless when you threaten people.`
` ...That's how it is, Battleeer.`
` You aren't allowed to step down from the game board.`
` You and Beato are nothing more than pieces on the board that exist to distract us from our boredom.`
` ...Even your incomprehensible anger and irritation make for a wonderful treat to satisfy us."`
`"Well, what you're doing now only makes for a cheap snack though."`
`"......Like those curry-flavored potato wafers that sell for 30 yen a pair."`
`""*giggle*giggle*, ahhahahahahahaha...!!""`
`"Y-You damn...witches..."`
`"......*giggle*`
` Fight for Ange's sake, okay?`
` And for Beato's too, right...?"`
`In a way that was admonishing...or perhaps babying,`
` ...like the headache you get after eating something too sweet, `
`Bernkastel tormented Battler and smiled.`
`By now, the host of this tea party, Beato, was absent.`
`...The guest witches were already making themselves at home.`
`"...What'll you do, Ushiromiya Battleer?`
` Will you surrender to fate...?"`
`".................."`
`"Just step down.`
` You've had enough of being toyed with as a witch's piece, right?`
` Heheheheh, it sure is tough being one of Bern's pieces.`
` I'm sure she'll use you and throw you away just like she did with Ange.`
` Geheheheheh!"`
`"I'm not giving you the option of stepping down.`
` ...Keep fighting for the sake of your sister's future.`
` I'm your ally.`
` Until you win, I'll support you so you can reach that future.`
` For all eternity, until I get bored.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*."`
`I can't let her provocation and cajolery rile me up...`
`These witches know I get mad easily, and they're trying to take advantage of that...`
`...Battler withstood it all...and finally relaxed his clenched fists.`
`"......If you wanna start this 5th game of yours, ...go ahead and do it.`
` Do whatever you want."`
`"Yes, I will do whatever I want.`
` ...Hey, where are you going?"`
`Even though Battler acknowledged this 5th game, he turned his back on them,`
` much to Lambdadelta's surprise.`
`"If you're gonna be Beato's substitute,`
` ...then I'm sure that Bernkastel witch over there can stand in for me if she wants."`
`"......Not a bad idea.`
` Better than a loss by default."`
`"What the heck?!`
` Are you gonna just ignore this Episode 5 that I put so much effort into making?!`
` Rude, ruuude!"`
`"...Battler says he's going to take a break for a while.`
` Until he comes back, I'll be his substitute.`
` How's that sound...? Battler...?"`
`"......You do that."`
`"............"`
`"...What's wrong, Lambda?`
` So, you'll refuse to play if it's against me, instead of that fool Battler...?"`
`"Ehheheheheh!!`
` Of course not♪`
` I'm glad I get to play with you, Bern!`
` Come on, let's play, let's play!`
` Let's play together in Lambdadelta-sama's super <hyper> and <cute> Episode 5!"`
`"......This technically is a world Beato created.`
` You aren't going to ruin the atmosphere of the story, are you...?"`
`"Don't worry about that.`
` I'm really good at reading between the lines for that sort of stuff.`
` I made sure to use a Beato-ish atmosphere to make a tale that's even more interesting."`
`"Battler, make sure you come back as soon as your break's over, okay?`
` It'd be a shame to miss this.`
` I've set up plenty of bonus hints that'll get you closer to Beato's secrets♪"`
`"...Or at least that's what it'll look like, when it's actually filled with misdirection that makes stuff more and more confusing.`
` Wait, hey, Battleer! Why aren't you listening when a witch is talking?!"`
`Without answering, Battler disappeared into the darkness.`
`After shrugging and cackling,`
` the witches immediately started playing with the game board they had stolen from Beato......`
`"Can those witches really understand Beato's game?"`
`"...Since they're using the same game board, they cannot do anything that this child cannot do.`
` However, they can do things that this child wouldn't do."`
`".........`
`...What do you mean, things she wouldn't do?"`
`"The materials of chess exist so that you can play chess.`
` You 'cannot' use them to play cards.`
` However, when it comes to throwing chess pieces at your opponent and scribbling on the board, `
`...such things are not impossible to do.`
` However, that would be blasphemy against the game of chess,`
` so people 'choose not to' do that."`
`".................."`
`That definitely...wouldn't be chess anymore.`
`Beato's eyes seemed to cloud slightly with sadness.`
`"......Damn them.`
` ......This game's between me and Beato.`
` ...I won't let anyone else defile it."`
`At that time, gold butterflies gathered and Ronove appeared, holding a tea set with black tea.`
`"Would you like some more tea?"`
`"......If you wouldn't mind."`
`"Certainly.`
` ...So, `
`how goes this journey of yours in search of Milady's thoughts?"`
`"I don't have a clue, but I'm enjoying it."`
`"However, ...are you sure about this?`
` Is it truly all right for you to relax here?"`
`"...You mean that game those witches just started all by themselves?"`
`"Indeed.`
` Just now, when I went to serve them some tea, the murders of the first twilight had already taken place,`
` and it seemed as though the next murder would occur shortly."`
`When Beato and I were playing, `
`the game would be paused whenever someone left their seats.`
`...However, those witches wouldn't pause that game just because I wasn't around...`
`".........Ronove, did you see their game?"`
`"Just a part of it."`
`"How was it?"`
`Ronove lifted the pot high with an elegant gesture as he poured the black tea.`
`After finishing that, he finally spoke.`
` He gave us his impressions of it.`
`"It...did not have love."`
`"...What do you mean, love?"`
`"My apologies.`
` That is how a woman might put it.`
` ...As a man,`
` ...one might call it dishonorable."`
`I understood what those words meant.`
`When I met Virgilia's eyes, she shook her head slightly and stared at the floor...`
`"......I believe it resembles Milady's games greatly, on the surface.`
` However, its foundation is quite different."`
`"Does it go against the rules of Beato's game?"`
`"No, it does not.`
` Lambdadelta-sama actually does understand the rules of Milady's game very well.`
` ...However..."`
`"..............."`
`Battler stood up.`
`There was no need to make Ronove say any more.`
`"Battler-kun..."`
`"...Sorry, Ronove.`
` I know you went to all the trouble of pouring this for me, but tea isn't what I need."`
`"So, you will go after all?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...We don't need any outsiders in our game."`
`...These guys weren't even here in the beginning.`
`Because I've been loafing about, crazier and crazier witches have been introduced,`
` ...and now they've hijacked this game between me and Beatrice.`
`"I've gotta take it back.`
` ...Right now, I'm supposed to be the one taking care of Beato's game board.`
` ...That means I can't just sit around here."`
`"......Thank you.`
` I wanted to let this child hear those words."`
`"I'm sure she hears them.`
` ......Milady is simply unable to answer."`
`Beato lay there silently, like a living doll with dull eyes...`
`The game board she had created herself had been hijacked by incomprehensible people...`
`and was being turned into a mess...`
`If I was designated to be her opponent...`
`...Then Beato must have created this game for me.`
`I've...got to take it back.`
`"...Wait here.`
` I'll go and take it back."`
`"....................."`
`Of course, Beato didn't respond in any way.`
`...That's right.`
`If she can't respond, ...then I have to protect it in her place.`
`"I'll be right back.`
` ......Virgilia, Ronove.`
` ...I'm counting on you two to look after this golden sleeping beauty."`
`"Yes. Leave it to us."`
`"...See you later, Battler-kun.`
` And please,`
` ...in the game without this child, try to find some part of her.`
` If you can,`
` ...then even if this child is absent, it will mean you have fought with her."`
`"......You're right.`
` ...Aaah, `
`...it's all useless.`
` What am I doing?"`
`Let's go.`
` ...And let's take it back.`
`"Sorry to keep you waiting, witches!!`
` My break is over!!"`
`When he faced the jet-black heavens and yelled this, `
`the whole world shattered, as though it were made out of thin glass.`
`Then, ...as though it had been that way since the beginning,`
` ......it transformed into that smoking room where Battler had fought Beato so many times, ...and which the two witches had now hijacked.`
`"What do you think you're doing?`
` You're only coming back now?`
` It's way too late!`
` Not only has the game reached the second day, it's already at the finale, get it?!"`
`"......You never showed up, so I just advanced things on my own."`
`Yeah, like you even waited for me in the first place...`
`"Bern was waaay more skillful and thrilling than you were. Right?!"`
`"Shut up.`
` I'm the player.`
` You substitute witches can just take a step back now."`
`"......Well, I don't really mind if you join in starting now, but there's probably no need for you anymore."`
`"Seriously.`
` After all, we're already at the climax!`
` After this, Bern will probably corner me and win."`
`"What the hell......?!"`
`"......Nothing wrong with that, is there?`
` Why don't we let him watch the final endgame?"`
`"Of course.`
` Come on over, Ushiromiya Battler.`
` It's almost completely over, but here's the <cute> and <elegant> game I made!`
`Episode 5.`
`End of `
`the Golden Witch!`
`Right now, no humans exist on this island except for those in this parlor.`
`And, with one exception, it has been shown that none of them have committed murder.`
`And, the culprit is among these people.`
`"......Whoa, whoa.`
` ...That means...it's conclusive, isn't it...?"`
`"Unless the culprit is a witch who committed murder with magic, that is..."`
`"...It was you?!`
` You killed George, killed my husband?!`
` Why?!!`
` Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?!!"`
`"...I-I didn't kill anyone...!`
` I-I...d-didn't...!!"`
`"..............."`
`In a panic, and with a voice that was far from calm,`
` ......in a manner that was, to put it coldly, unsightly, ...Aunt Natsuhi denied the suspicion placed upon her...`
`However, ......there was no longer any way around it...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~She~ib~ stood up, ...brushed back her long hair, pointed at Aunt Natsuhi, and said it one more time.`
`"...You're the culprit,`
` Ushiromiya Natsuhi-san."`
`"It's Natsuhi, please open up...!!"`
`As she knocked loudly and repeatedly, Natsuhi yelled.`
`Shortly after, there was a heavy clunking sound, and the sound of the door to Kinzo's study unlocking could be heard.`
`As the door opened, a heavily sweet, venomous odor flowed out.`
`Natsuhi was always ashamed of how she automatically grimaced at that,`
` even though she thought it rude to the Family Head...`
`Krauss was waiting for her inside the study.`
`Natsuhi flew into his arms.`
`"......I-Is Father... ......Is he......"`
`"Calm yourself.`
` ......Doctor Nanjo is examining him now..."`
`With an uncertain gait, Natsuhi walked towards the center of the study, supported by Krauss.`
`There, a dignified bed fitting for the Ushiromiya Family Head could be seen, along with Nanjo, Genji, and Kumasawa...`
`"Doctor Nanjo,`
` i-is Father......"`
`After sighing deeply, Nanjo left the side of the bed.`
`On the bed, Kinzo could be seen lying down, asleep......`
`"......He died peacefully.`
` ...I don't think Kinzo-san had any regrets."`
`"Ah, ...aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh...`
` Father, ...Fatheeeeeeeeer...!!"`
`...Sobbing, Natsuhi slumped over the chest of that man, who had fallen into a sleep from which he would never awaken.`
`"...M-Madam, ...please...stay strong..."`
`"Father, Father...!!`
` This is...just too sudden...`
` Aaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!"`
`"..............."`
`Natsuhi couldn't stop crying over the death of the man whom she had loved like a second father.`
`Kumasawa rubbed Natsuhi's back, consoling her...`
`Krauss slumped into his late father's favorite chair.`
`By sitting there, he might have been immersed in memories of his departed father.`
`Or perhaps he thought that by sitting there, he might be able to understand just a bit of the madness of Kinzo's later years,`
` which he had never been able to comprehend before...`
`And Nanjo, just as he had when Kinzo once sat in that chair, contemplating a chess move, `
`...turned his back and looked down over the outside world through a crack in the curtains...`
`"...If only he'd been sick in bed for a year or so first.`
` I do wish he could have died after a grace period during which the proper arrangements could have been made."`
`"It's the other way around.`
` ...We should be glad that he was in high spirits until the very end."`
`"At least that's true as far as public appearances are concerned..."`
`Nanjo understood that as well.`
`Ushiromiya Kinzo, who had risen like a comet and glittered like a supernova in the post-war business world, had died.`
`His funeral would probably be of a fantastic scale.`
`And it would also be the ceremony marking Krauss's inheritance of the Headship.`
`He would have to arrange everything as the host of the event, carry out funeral diplomacy perfectly, `
`and make it clear to all that the Ushiromiya family still had enormous influence in the political and financial spheres.`
`As Nanjo watched Krauss, he was vividly reminded of the time when Kinzo had been suddenly selected as the Ushiromiya Family Head,`
` when Kinzo had been lost and confused.`
`In this way, he was able to understand Krauss's distress and sympathize with it...`
`Natsuhi's sobs eventually subsided.`
`Watching this and leaving Kumasawa to care for Natsuhi as a fellow woman, Genji returned to where Krauss was.`
`And, as though asking what should be done, Genji lowered his head slightly.`
`"......Genji-san and I will deal with the formalities.`
` Krauss-san, perhaps you should contact the relatives first."`
`"..............."`
`Krauss, with his hands still over his eyes, didn't respond...`
`Perhaps even though he had known this day would come, `
`Krauss really couldn't hide his shock at how suddenly it had reached them.`
`"......Leave this to Doctor Nanjo and me.`
` Krauss-sama, I suggest that you first speak with Madam."`
`Maybe she heard that, or maybe it was a coincidence.`
`As though responding to Genji's words, Natsuhi came over.`
`Her eyes were red from crying so much,`
` but she apparently understood the heavy responsibility that had been imposed on them even better than Krauss did.`
`"Starting now, you are the Head of the glorious Ushiromiya family.`
` Let us show everyone, inside and out, that you have splendidly succeeded your Father.`
` ......As your wife, I, Natsuhi, am prepared to serve you until the day our coffins are laid down alongside each other!"`
`".................."`
`Trying to encourage her husband, who was overcome with shock, Natsuhi lent him some reassuring words.`
`When Krauss finally lowered the hands that had been covering his face,`
` ...he looked up at the ceiling with a blank expression and let out a deep, deep sigh...`
`"...Please, stay strong.`
` There are a great many people who will plan to devour everything Father has left behind.`
` We must fight to protect Father's honor and wealth.`
` That is the first responsibility of the Ushiromiya Head."`
`"...I understand.`
` I do understand."`
`"Doctor Nanjo, Genji, please take care of the legal and funeral arrangements.`
` Especially you, Genji.`
` I ask that you take particular care and see to it that the funeral will be a fitting one for Father."`
`"...Certainly."`
`"And Doctor Nanjo.`
` Father didn't pass away in a hospital, ...so..."`
`"Indeed.`
` An autopsy might be required, depending on circumstances..."`
`"Can't you do something about that...?`
` Even though he has passed away, Father's body is precious.`
` Any damage done to it would not be acceptable..."`
`"I understand how you feel.`
` ...However, it is also important to deal with these matters properly.`
` And, umm, ...I don't really know how to say this,`
` but several of the relatives might make things difficult, yes...?"`
`...Who knew how those vultures after the inheritance might try to find fault with them?`
`They might claim to have found some reason to suspect the cause of death,`
` using that as a point of contention to start some trouble.`
`Right now, it was important not only to pay Kinzo's remains the respect they were due, but also to solidify the position of the new Family Head, Krauss...`
`"...Understood.`
` Please keep it to an absolute minimum.`
` Make sure that Father's dignity is not damaged, even by mistake."`
`"That will be fine.`
` Do not worry.`
` ...In any event, leave Kinzo-san to us and stay by Krauss-san's side.`
` ...Things will start to get quite difficult from here on out."`
`"I understand.`
` ...And you too, dear... Please stay strong."`
`"..............."`
`Krauss was still staring blankly at the ceiling with a befuddled expression on his face...`
`She understood the shock and heavy responsibility he bore.`
`Natsuhi understood her husband's feelings as much as anyone.`
`"...I will contact the relatives.`
` Please rest for the time being."`
`"............"`
`Krauss didn't respond.`
`...Natsuhi, thinking him to be just a bit unreliable at the moment, decided she must offer her support.`
`Seeing her husband like this actually spurred Natsuhi to action, and a resolute expression rose to her face.`
`"Things will get busy from now on.`
` Let's start by doing whatever we can right now.`
` ......I'm sure my husband wants to have some time alone with Father.`
` We should step out for a moment."`
`"...Good point...`
` After all, this will probably be the last time he gets that chance."`
`Being in charge of a funeral is tiring work.`
` There's no time to shed tears.`
`If Krauss were ever to be given time to cry for his dead father, that time would have to be now.`
`Everyone agreed with Kumasawa's words.`
`Even so, Krauss continued to blankly gaze up at the ceiling and didn't respond in any way.`
`Natsuhi urged the servants to go.`
`"I'll go talk to Jessica too.`
` ...That child is now the Successor to the Headship.`
` I'll make sure to tell her to be fully prepared."`
`"Wait."`
`As they each started to make their way out of the study, Krauss finally spoke.`
`They stopped walking.`
`"Yes?"`
`"...Wait."`
`"......Yes??"`
`Hadn't she already stopped walking, just like her husband had asked?`
`But despite that, he told her once again to wait.`
`From those slightly weak words, Natsuhi understood that he'd probably stopped her because he wanted her to be by his side.`
`"The rest of you, downstairs.`
` I will stay with my husband.`
` Please call us on the phone if anything happens."`
`"...Certainly."`
`"I thought I told you to wait!!"`
`When Krauss suddenly raised his voice, everyone jumped and turned around...`
`Unable to comprehend what she had done to spark her husband's wrath, Natsuhi ran up to him.`
`"What's wrong, dear...?`
` Have I said something rude...?`
` If so, please forgive me."`
`"No, no, that's not it, that's not it...`
` Wait a second, give me some time."`
`"Yes, I understand.`
` It's important to sort things out inside your heart.`
` ...We were just going to leave this place in silence to give you some time, okay...?"`
`"And I'm telling you to wait before doing that......`
` ......Listen up. No one move.`
` Not even an inch...`
` ...If you're tired, then feel free to sit in whatever chair or sofa you want.`
` So just stay quiet and don't talk, don't do anything!"`
`...Those unreasonable words felt like a glimpse of how Kinzo used to be.`
`Natsuhi couldn't hide her slight surprise at this behavior, which almost made it seem as though Kinzo had possessed her husband.`
`Natsuhi told the servants to wait for the time being.`
`She ordered them to sit on a sofa a short distance off, approached her husband, and spoke to him in a small voice...`
`"...If you order it, I will wait however long you ask. I won't move.`
` So please, try and calm yourself..."`
`"...No, ...that's not it, that's not it..."`
`Was it really blood, or was he actually being possessed?`
`Krauss's disorderly style of speech strongly resembled Kinzo's...`
`As she watched this, Natsuhi became certain that Krauss was Kinzo's son after all,`
` and that he was the true Successor, more suitable than any other person.`
`"......Natsuhi,`
` come here."`
`Krauss stood up and headed towards the window, trying to lengthen the distance between himself and the servants waiting on the sofa by even a small amount.`
`Natsuhi realized that he must have something secret to discuss.`
`"...Yes, dear.`
` ...What is it...?"`
`"......Father dying...`
`is bad."`
`"But he has already passed away.`
` We cannot turn back time."`
`"That's not it.`
` ...It's bad...that it happened now..."`
`"...What do you mean?"`
`"I've been putting Father's fortune up as collateral.`
` I won't be able to hide it when the division of the inheritance comes into question."`
`"Wh-What...?`
` C-Collateral, you say?`
` How much...?"`
`"...You remember how I helped out Kondo-kun back in Melody Land?"`
`"Didn't I tell you to break ties with that person?`
` I thought you said you'd refused him...!`
` Why?!"`
`"There is such a thing as a man's honor!`
` I couldn't refuse!"`
`Krauss claimed to hold honor as a virtue.`
`...However, Natsuhi knew that he most often used this as an excuse for when he reluctantly went along with some deal that he just couldn't refuse.`
`"Th-That wouldn't be a problem if we had plenty of money on hand...!`
` But didn't you borrow quite a lot of money for the plan to turn this island into a resort?!"`
`"Yeah, I did!`
` And there were people here and there who lent me a hand along the way!`
` If I'm going to repay them, I can't just sit around on my hands!`
` You need money to repay people!`
` You need money to make money!`
` You can't even get started without money!`
` And even the plan for this island would be proceeding smoothly if only there hadn't been problems with the planning company!"`
`"I made contact with a government official in the city.`
` I even got the governor's word that this would become the newest travel destination in the Tokyo Metropolis!`
` The groundwork I laid was completely perfect!!`
` Random chance and bad timing were against me!`
` It was just a bit of bad luck.`
` Like a traffic accident!!"`
`"That was no accident!`
` It was fraud!`
` You were tricked!!`
` They were never drawing up plans for turning this island into a resort in the first place!!"`
`"That's not true!!`
` Hijikata-kun's vision was simply overflowing with foresight!`
` The way his eyes always focused on the whole world and the future...`
`taught me that things I always believed to be mere dreams were only the tip of the iceberg of what is possible!! Expand your dreams! To the whole world, to the future!`
` You heard him say that too, right?!"`
`"Yes, I heard...! And I think I remember telling you what I thought after we returned home!!`
` I said that he was suspicious,`
` that he only spoke of dreams and didn't have his feet planted on the ground,`
` and that you must not have any further relations with him!!"`
`"Hijikata-kun is a wonderful, pleasant young man!!`
` One could learn a lot from the way he lives!`
` I can respect him despite his youth!`
` I won't have you insulting him!!"`
`"That's what you said about the whole moon tourism thing!!`
` You kept saying it was visionary, that it looked to the future, that it had high aspirations, and what was the end result?!`
` Eventually, you yourself admitted that it was utter nonsense, right?!!`
` I was sure something was wrong ever since that strange man showed up claiming to be a high-ranking NASA official!"`
`"That foreigner was nothing more than an international swindler!`
` Both Mr. Sonezaki and I were victims in that case.`
` Right now, his vision isn't mistaken!`
` In the future, there will surely come a time when the richest people in the world develop a liking for space travel.`
` And, the very first enterprise in that area will probably be monopolized by a single private company.`
` That viewpoint is not mistaken!`
` There was simply a group of international swindlers who were trying to take advantage of that fact and deceive investors across the world-"`
`"And I'm trying to tell you that this Sonezaki man was one of them too!!`
` Just how gullible are you? Why do you always just accept these suspicious offers without any doubts?!!"`
`"Take that back!`
` Mr. Sonezaki is a man with a brilliant future ahead of him!`
` There's nothing suspicious about him!!`
` Because the dreams he speaks of anticipate the future, they sound crazy to people who can't see into the future!`
` A woman like you can't see into the future!!"`
`"Yes, a woman like me can't see into the future!!`
` But I can see the present!`
` Right in front of me, I can see a pitiful husband who's been taken in by sly, double-crossing swindlers and still trusts them implicitly even after he's been tricked!!"`
`"Shut your mouth!!`
` You don't understand anything about money or business or economics!!`
` Don't try to butt in on your husband's job!!`
` A wife should be satisfied with doing housework!`
` Keep your mouth shut!!!"`
`"............!`
` ........."`
`Without another word, Natsuhi fell silent, just as Krauss had hoped she would.`
`She was already far beyond anger and sadness.`
`And the emotion that lay on the other side of those...was an almost indifferent pity.`
`Krauss, who had been in awe of Kinzo since he was very young, had started to subconsciously admire the way his father lived.`
`...Without realizing it, he had come to believe that he could only be recognized as a man in his own right if he surpassed his father.`
`However, Kinzo had been a mad genius, the likes of which had never before been seen in the Ushiromiya family's long history.`
`That talent was a gift from heaven,`
` ...and it definitely wasn't genetic, much less something that could be learned.`
`To give the two of them a chance to talk alone, `
`Natsuhi told the servants not to tell anyone about Kinzo's death, and they left the room for the time being.`
`Then, she invited Krauss to her bedroom...`
`and made him tell her everything about their current financial situation.`
`These were things that Natsuhi hadn't been told about, under the assumption that a woman had no business knowing.`
`Natsuhi had herself made a point of avoiding this area in the past, thinking that it wasn't a wife's place to intrude on such matters.`
`However, this might also have meant that she had abandoned her duty, as a wife, to protect her family.`
`The depths of this sin had been made quite clear to Natsuhi...`
`Krauss was probably tired of trying to defend himself.`
`Perhaps because he had gotten a headache, he hid his face and sank into silence...`
`Natsuhi noticed that the water in the electric kettle was boiling and stood up to refill her cup with black tea.`
`When she touched the cup of black tea, she noticed for the first time.`
`The sound of the cup and saucer clinking together told her that her fingers were shaking...`
`Krauss had built up a large debt to obtain funds for his various projects...and to cover the losses when they failed.`
`Of course, he had put the mansion and property up as collateral.`
`However, doing such a thing aboveboard would result in the mortgage being registered.`
`In other words, there would be a record that Krauss had put Kinzo's wealth up as collateral to obtain a loan without anyone's permission.`
`Kinzo, Eva, and the others must not learn of such a thing.`
`Therefore, Krauss had been putting those assets up as collateral using the worst possible method.`
`"......I signed over the deeds and power of attorney..."`
`"And...what does that mean...?"`
`What Krauss was saying probably meant that he had, in essence, signed away the rights to his assets.`
`If these assets had been used as collateral for a loan, then Krauss would still have some leeway under the law.`
`He would have to deal with a bank, which would have absolutely no compassion,`
` but they would be able to work something out within the rules set by society.`
`...However, signing away the deed and power of attorney was a whole different story.`
`In other words, even the mansion they were living in.`
` If the person holding the deed were to decide to ignore his agreement with Krauss...`
`and sell the mansion to a third party right this moment, they would have no recourse whatsoever.`
`Far from using collateral for a loan, this was basically the same as selling their house to borrow money...`
`"...In other words, ...the moneylenders have the power to make or break the Ushiromiya family as they please.`
` If they were to suddenly sell our house on some slight whim,`
` ......we'd have to pack our bags and leave right now, wouldn't we...?"`
`"That is technically true.`
` However, everyone I have had dealings with is very reputable.`
` This isn't consumer financing.`
` It's a transaction based on trust between economically literate men."`
`"I trust them.`
` And they, in turn, trust that by lending me money, I will achieve great success in business and give them massive returns on their investment.`
` I signed over the power of attorney as a sign of good faith and so that they wouldn't have to doubt in the certain success of my business.`
`"What happens if I hesitate now?`
` Wouldn't that mean even I have no confidence in my own business?!"`
`".................."`
`If you were such a successful businessman, we wouldn't be in debt now, would we...`
`...Natsuhi only barely stopped herself from saying that.`
`"...Father is dead.`
` What happens next?`
` Will your debt be exposed to the light of day...and will your siblings hold you responsible?"`
`".........That won't be all.`
` ...It will probably lead to criminal charges..."`
`"C-Criminal charges...`
` Wh-Why is that...?"`
`"......It's better if you don't know.`
` ...Anyway, ...this must not be learned of by anyone..."`
`"..............."`
`Krauss looked at the floor shamefully, shaking his head over and over...`
`If it would come to criminal charges, ...then he must have broken some laws.`
`He's probably been so intent on raising a large sum of money...that nothing had mattered to him but survival.`
`...Krauss had seriously believed that he would succeed with several businesses...and that he would definitely gain huge profits.`
`So, he had figured that even if he stepped over a few legal lines, `
`he would be able to pay everything back before too long and pretend that the whole thing had never happened.`
`...This may gave been the factor that lessened his resistance towards breaking a couple laws.`
`And now Kinzo's death, the worst possible thing, had occurred, `
`and they wouldn't be able to keep it all hidden for long...`
`"...What will happen to us?"`
`"Th-There is no need to worry...`
` You may not believe it, but conditions are most certainly on the rise now.`
` The value of the city real estate I invested in will rise rapidly.`
` Right now, I am working on a project to integrate those and construct a massive business tower.`
` This will be the most reliable of all my investments so far and will prove to be the most successful."`
`"...However, it will take a little more time for that to bear fruit.`
` It's absolutely certain, but that doesn't mean it will happen now..."`
`"...Will the success of that venture be enough to pay back our debts?"`
`"Of course it will.`
` I'll be able to wipe out all the debt I've accumulated so far...!!`
` So have faith in me.`
` I only need a little more time!"`
`"But Father is already dead!`
` We don't have that kind of time anymore, do we?!"`
`"I know, I know that...!!`
` That's why...I have to obtain money from somewhere and pay off those debts right now!`
` Anyway, I need money...`
` Money, a lot of it, right now!!`
` Aaaaaaaaarrrrgghhhhhh...!!"`
`As Krauss roared and clutched at his head, he writhed about as if in pain.`
`As she watched, several emotions swirled about in Natsuhi's chest.`
`Her emotions conflicted as she felt pity for her husband...while also feeling that he was a fool.`
`...And, she felt a mixture of resentment and regret towards her own irresponsibility in letting her husband run wild for so long.`
`Even if this day hadn't come, it should have been clear that they were in a very critical situation.`
`And yet he had carelessly waited for this moment to come...`
`and was now writhing about.`
`...Her husband was so foolish...and so pitiful.`
`It would be easy to let herself get fed up with this.`
` ...However, she was his wife.`
`For a wife, ridiculing her husband as a fool would run in conflict with her responsibilities.`
`...If he was a fool, then she would have to support him enough to compensate...`
`However, she didn't have a clue what she should do...`
`Since there had been such a massive amount of money within arm's reach,`
` it was only natural that Krauss had tried to dip his hands into it...`
`It would also be easy to tell him to be a man and give up on all of it.`
`But that would also run in conflict with her responsibilities.`
`She was Ushiromiya Natsuhi.`
`...The woman who had become Krauss's wife and sworn to support him, the new Head of the Ushiromiya family, for her whole life.`
`She had to somehow help her husband in his efforts to raise money.`
`...She understood it logically.`
`But she couldn't suppress the indescribable dejection that seemed to rise up from the dark depths of her heart...`
`"That's right, F-Father's hidden gold...!`
` 10 tons of gold is worth 20 billion yen!`
` If I had that...`
`that's right, if I had that, all our problems would be solved...!"`
`"Natsuhi, that's it! The witch's epitaph!`
` Let's solve that, let's solve it together!`
` If we can just find the gold, everything will work itself out!!`
` That's right, it must be hidden somewhere on this island!!`
` If we had that, if we had that...!!"`
`"Th-That hurts...`
`dear, `
`...p-please stop it..."`
`Krauss, acting as excited as if he'd thought up a perfect, brilliant plan, grasped Natsuhi's upper arms tightly.`
`Natsuhi couldn't help but be dumbfounded.`
`She wasn't just taken aback because she'd heard him bring up something as fake-sounding as the hidden gold.`
`This was Krauss, who usually mocked the story of the hidden gold,`
` saying that it didn't exist and that it was all an illusion his father had created to borrow a lot of money.`
`That was why Natsuhi was doubly taken aback...`
`"Yes, let's have Jessica help us too.`
` Maybe some things can only be solved with a child's sensitivity!`
` This is a family crisis.`
` All of us have to stick together!!`
` Yes, it's a fanciful riddle that Father created...!!`
` We should be able to solve it, ...and there's no reason we wouldn't be able solve it...!`
` It's the only way!!"`
`"Oh, Natsuhi, this is wonderful,`
` we still have an option left, and right here next to us!!`
` The gold is on this island!!`
` If we had it, every one of our problems would be solved!`
` Waha, wahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Natsuhi, call Jessica here right away!`
` Let's overcome this family crisis together!!`
` Yes, right now!!`
` The gold is on this island, it's right beside us!!`
` ...Wah!!"`
`Unable to withstand the pain in the arm he was twisting in his excitement, Natsuhi knocked Krauss aside.`
`Krauss tripped over the edge of the bed and flopped over onto the floor...`
`"P-Please get ahold of yourself!!`
` And please calm down...!!`
` Do you really think that this Ushiromiya family crisis...could be solved by something as dream-like as that...?!!"`
`"......N-Natsuhi......"`
`"Please, cool your head and think of a realistic plan to gather money...!!`
` I'm going to go cool my head as well...!"`
`"...Wait, ...Natsuhi..."`
`Maybe he had come to his senses the instant he fell over.`
`Krauss tried to tell Natsuhi to stop, but she just kept walking.`
`After closing the door forcefully, Natsuhi dashed away...`
`Natsuhi ran through the corridor.`
`Even though she didn't want anyone to see her like this, she ran headlong into Genji...`
`"...My deepest apologies.`
` Madam, have you been injured...?"`
`"I-I'm fine.`
` Leave me alone...!!"`
`"......Certainly."`
`"Oh, ...Genji.`
` ...How are things going in Father's study?"`
`"...It is just as you left it.`
` Although Doctor Nanjo is in the parlor."`
`"Is that so...?`
` ...Do you have the key to the study?"`
`"Yes.`
` Right here."`
`"Give it to me.`
` ...Let me have some time alone with Father.`
` If my husband asks where I am, tell him you don't know."`
`"...Certainly."`
`After grabbing the key to the study that Genji was holding out to her, Natsuhi rushed up the stairs.`
`She then flew into the study,`
` ...finally let out a wail, ...and cried.`
`"......Father......`
` Please forgive our foolishness...!!`
` My husband and I...`
`...aren't capable of inheriting all that you created...!`
` Please, ...please, `
`.........forgive us for our foolishness and our crimes...`
` And, `
`...if you can forgive us, `
`......please guide the way for us fools......"`
`Clinging to Kinzo as he slept in the bed, Natsuhi cried even harder.`
`She kept imagining Kinzo sitting up suddenly and patting her head.`
`No, Father isn't the type of person to pamper...`
`More likely, he'd yell at me to stop being so noisy.`
`......However, neither of these imaginations came true.`
`...Because it was an undeniable fact that Kinzo had entered an eternal sleep.`
`But even so, Natsuhi begged the sleeping Kinzo to forgive and help them...`
`It was still only a few hours after his passing.`
`Perhaps his soul was still here, listening to her.`
`...Believing this, Natsuhi begged for Kinzo's forgiveness and help even more earnestly...`
`"Too noisy.`
` Haven't I always said that I hold silence as a virtue?"`
`"......Huh-"`
`That voice made Natsuhi jump up in surprise.`
`When she faced in the direction that the voice had come from, .........she saw Kinzo sitting at the study desk, folding up his reading glasses...`
`"Did you get in a fight with Krauss again?`
` ...Neglecting his wife like that... That Krauss only inherited my bad traits."`
`"...F-Father..."`
`"...What a wretched-looking face.`
` Wash it.`
` Aren't you the wife of the Successor of the Ushiromiya family?`
` You mustn't let the servants see you wear such a shameful expression."`
`"...Y-Yes, Father...`
` ...My apologies..."`
`...Natsuhi understood.`
`This was just an illusion, ...one that Natsuhi had created out of her desire to speak with a memory of Kinzo as he once was.`
`No, that wasn't it...`
`...She believed that just for now, Kinzo's soul had shown itself to her.`
`She was sure that doubting this would cause it to vanish in an instant...`
`"It seems that at the instant the family Headship was passed on, the family has reached a crisis..."`
`"...Y-Yes, Father...`
` I wasn't able to support my husband...`
` ...I am truly...very sorry......"`
`"Hmph.`
` The Ushiromiya family is so very cursed.`
` It was in a terrible state when I succeeded the Headship too.`
` That makes your suffering seem almost cute in comparison."`
`Kinzo's succession to the Family Headship had come suddenly.`
`At the time, he had been nothing more than a single young man from a branch family, far separated from the Ushiromiya main family.`
`The main family might have had honor and tradition, but Kinzo had had nothing to do with that.`
`Then, the principal members of the main family were wiped out in the Great Kanto Earthquake, along with their businesses.`
`On top of that, there had been a complicated antagonism between the members of the family at the time,`
` and the elders had all tried to impose their will on the others in that sinking ship.`
`Because of this, they weren't even able to elect a leader to revive the Ushiromiya family.`
`They then found a common ground and selected Kinzo, a youth with absolutely no ties to any of the opposing elders, to be the Head.`
`So the elders hadn't really entrusted Kinzo with the rebuilding of the Ushiromiya family.`
`Kinzo had been nothing more than their puppet, with his arms and legs pulled in opposite directions...`
`"......Yes.`
` ...I know a lot about your days of suffering, Father."`
`"And then, the war started.`
` At the time, I was already tired of life.`
` I hoped I would die on the battlefield, but I wasn't sent to the front lines.`
` ...However, the state of the war grew worse with every day, and the time for the decisive battle on the Japanese mainland seemed to grow ever closer.`
` As terrible as it may sound, I prayed for that day to come quickly..."`
`After listening to the approaching footsteps of that reaper day in and day out,`
` ...it is said that Kinzo started cutting his ties with this world one by one.`
`And then, on that day when he had severed all his regrets, when he reached a state of enlightenment...`
`It is said that he had a mystical experience.`
`...It is said that he met her.`
`The Golden Witch, Beatrice...`
`"I made a contract with the witch and was given the power of gold and madness.`
` ...On that day, the old me died, and a new me possessing the insane power of magic was born."`
`"...I know.`
` And after the war,`
` you used your ingenious cunning to revive the Ushiromiya family."`
`The now-deceased elders who knew Kinzo at the time...`
`had whispered to each other that Kinzo must have bumped his head on the battlefield and returned with a different personality...`
`That was how much Kinzo had stood out after the war.`
`Whether the story about Kinzo meeting a witch was true or not,`
` there could be no doubt that the extraordinary experience of war had prepared him for death...and let him reach a state of enlightenment.`
`If he wanted to describe the mystical experience following all that as a meeting with a witch, `
`that claim certainly shouldn't be dismissed out of hand...`
`"...That's right.`
` ...You returned from the war,`
` conquered the witch Beatrice, and became the Head of the Ushiromiya family in the truest sense..."`
`"Correct.`
` Before I met Beatrice, I was nothing more than a puppet, only the Head in name.`
` ......I only became the Head after conquering the Golden Witch."`
`"...Father...`
` Umm, ...will this Golden Witch aid my husband Krauss, now that he's the new Head...?"`
`"Oh, she will.`
` Assuming that he has truly succeeded the Headship."`
`"Wh-What do you mean by 'truly succeeded'...?"`
`"I mean it depends on whether he bears the responsibility and pride of the Ushiromiya Family Head in the truest sense.`
` ...Natsuhi, you should understand this.`
` The Headship is not inherited by blood.`
` It is inherited through spirit and conviction.`
` ......Even though Krauss is my eldest son, he cannot be called the true Head if he does not possess these things!"`
`"And, if that spirit were to dwell in a human, even someone other than Krauss, they would make a splendid new Head.`
` Beatrice will lend her power to that true Head.`
` ......Isn't that right, Beatrice?!!"`
`When Kinzo called the witch's name, ...gold butterflies seethed out of every corner of the room.`
`This fantastical scene had an otherworldly beauty to it.`
`It was like standing in the midst of a blizzard of golden flower petals being blown about a rose garden of gold.`
`As Natsuhi stared at this scene in shock, the gold butterflies gathered and formed a human shape...`
`Then, ...the witch of the portrait appeared...`
`"Indeed.`
` I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, the Golden Witch Beatrice.`
` ...I am free to run rampant!`
` I listen to no one's orders."`
`"And there's only one person in the world who can control her.`
` Me.`
` ...That is why I am qualified to be the Ushiromiya Family Head."`
`"Hmph.`
` So, it's that pride of yours that qualifies you?"`
`"Pride requires self-confidence and bravery.`
` And, it is the embodiment of the insatiable desire to gain power to match those traits.`
` ...That is why I control you."`
`"......Watching men who speak of pride turn those desires into reality can be quite pleasant.`
` The 'quiet man of action' is nothing more than an excuse used by the extremely lucky.`
` ...A true monarch also speaks of what he doesn't have.`
` And he makes that pride a reality without fail.`
` ......If one is to control me, they must possess such a monarch's pride."`
`"Do you understand, Natsuhi?`
` A true monarch fears no hardship.`
` They declare that they will overcome anything without fail.`
` Even if they haven't yet figured out how.`
` This gives hope to the weak.`
` They gather, revere the monarch, and swear to assist him.`
` This is where power is gained and his word is carried out.`
` Engrave that into your heart."`
`"......Y-Yes, Father..."`
`Natsuhi understood.`
`Through this mystical experience, ...Kinzo was telling her how to prepare herself to overcome hardship.`
` ...Even after his own death.`
`Feeling a warm sensation rise up in her chest, she let the valuable words Kinzo had given her echo through her mind over and over.`
`...A true monarch...`
` In other words, `
`the true Head of the Ushiromiya family...must not fear hardship.`
`Such a person must believe they can overcome any hardship...`
`If they can't even believe it about themselves, then they'll have no chance of overcoming their challenges...`
`...She suddenly felt very ashamed of the way she'd entered this room, `
`...sobbing and asking Kinzo what to do...`
`"I...was foolish..."`
`"............"`
`"...Of course there's no time for crying when an Ushiromiya family crisis is upon us.`
` And now that we have inherited the Ushiromiya family from you, Father, we must protect its honor no matter what."`
`"Hoh.`
` ...Even though you can't even draw a blueprint on how to repay Krauss's debts?"`
`Beatrice laughed unpleasantly...`
`...no, that wasn't it.`
`She was testing Natsuhi, to see whether she possessed the mental readiness to be a true monarch.`
`Natsuhi wasn't confused anymore.`
`She answered clearly, gazing into Beatrice's eyes.`
`"Yes.`
` At this moment, I have not yet discovered the method we should pursue.`
` However, my husband is the new Head of the Ushiromiya family, and I am his supporting wife.`
` So, I will proclaim it in my husband's place."`
`"Let us hear it."`
`"Ushiromiya Krauss and Natsuhi will definitely overcome these trials and protect the honor of the Ushiromiya family.`
` You have nothing to worry about, Father."`
`"...Do you know the scope of Krauss's debt, as well as the horrible state things are in?"`
`"Yes.`
` If the worst happens and we are ordered to leave this mansion tomorrow, we won't be able to refuse.`
` During the distribution of the inheritance, the relatives might even file a criminal complaint."`
`"However, there is no need to worry.`
` We will repay all of the debts before then and restore our honor."`
`As she stood at attention with a resolute attitude, `
`Natsuhi proclaimed this clearly with Ushiromiya Kinzo and Beatrice as witnesses.`
`For a while,`
` they remained silent, as though weighing Natsuhi's resolve.`
`Then Kinzo chuckled and turned away...`
`"...How vexing.`
` ...Why couldn't this person have been my son...?"`
`"The very fact that a woman with such a disposition married your son is another sign of your great luck."`
`".........`
`Beatrice,`
` this is my final order."`
`"Now that you are no longer the Head, I am not obligated to obey your orders."`
`"Hoh.`
` In that case, obey the orders of the new Ushiromiya Family Head."`
`"You are no longer the Head, and Krauss is not yet the Head.`
` Whom are you suggesting that I serve?"`
`"I will leave that to you.`
` It is up to you to decide who is qualified to succeed the Ushiromiya Family Head, and who is fitting to bear the mark of the One-Winged Eagle.`
` ...You will ensure that it is so."`
`"I refuse.`
` I won't listen to the orders of a man who isn't the Head."`
`"No, this is different.`
` This is a will.`
` The last order that the Head left behind for you."`
`"...*cackle*`
` Then it seems I will have to obey.`
` After all, I can be quite accommodating."`
`"Liar."`
`"Hoh?"`
`"You're only doing this because it caught your interest, aren't you?"`
`"I can't hide anything from you, can I?"`
`"Natsuhi."`
`"Yes, Father..."`
`"Go and overcome your hardship."`
`"...Y-Yes."`
`That might have seemed like a mere response to Natsuhi,`
` but to Kinzo and Beatrice, it seemed to be something of much greater significance.`
`Beatrice nodded deeply,`
` and with a motion as elegant as her dress, she bowed deeply before Natsuhi...`
`"The Ushiromiya family alchemist, the Golden Witch Beatrice, is present.`
` I shall give you my aid to assist the Ushiromiya Family in overcoming another crisis..."`
`"...Thank you.`
` I will need your power.`
` We will most certainly overcome these trials."`
`"I will not hold back on my support for your cause, but there is something I must warn you about beforehand.`
` I understand that your troubles now could be solved if I were to grant you a vast quantity of gold, like I did when I saved Kinzo from his crisis.`
` However, that is something I cannot do."`
`"......Is that so?"`
`"Sorry, Natsuhi.`
` Beatrice's gold came from a contract limited to my generation.`
` It was agreed that it could only be passed on to another if that person solves the witch's epitaph."`
`"The gold is sealed away by the epitaph.`
` As long as that is not solved, you cannot be given the golden magic."`
`"......I understand.`
` Then I shall search for another method by which we can save ourselves from this crisis.`
` ...My husband said his plan would take time, but he also said that it would surely be sufficient to repay our debts.`
` If we can buy enough time for that to happen, we will be able to overcome this trial."`
`"Good, Natsuhi.`
` Continue."`
`"But Kinzo is already dead.`
` The doctor and servants are preparing his funeral.`
` You were about to contact the family members.`
` By your own hand, you will bring an end to this ploy for time.`
` *cackle*cackle* How charming is the guillotine where you lower the blade yourself..."`
`"...............Ah-"`
`Startled, Natsuhi looked up at the ceiling.`
`There wasn't actually anything there.`
` ...But even so, Natsuhi had found something.`
`"So, ...the magical power has descended."`
`"Natsuhi,`
` ...have you made up your mind?`
` What magic of miracles do you desire from me?"`
`...Once again, all of those who had witnessed Kinzo's corpse were gathered in the study.`
`Krauss was still impatient and clutching at his head.`
`Genji was as expressionless as ever.`
`Nanjo and Kumasawa wore bewildered expressions on their faces.`
`But in stark contrast to all of them, Natsuhi wore a resolute expression.`
`"Dear, let me ask you one more time.`
` Your plan for raising money is absolutely certain?"`
`"......Y-Yes.`
` Give it a year...no, just half a year, and it will certainly bear fruit!`
` But it's just impossible to hope for anything right now..."`
`"Then we will wait."`
`"B-But you said it yourself.`
` ...Father is already dead..."`
`"Father has not passed away.`
` He's still there, as healthy as ever."`
`When Natsuhi said this, everyone jumped and looked up.`
`...Because they instantly understood what those words meant...`
`However, Krauss alone didn't get it right away and asked her.`
`"What...`
`do you mean by that...?`
` Father is already...`
`in reality...right there..."`
`"I will say it again.`
` Father is still in good health.`
` He is busy with his research, so he'll be even less able to leave his study than usual.`
` Because of this, we must handle all external affairs ourselves...`
`so that Father can devote himself to his research without being burdened by meaningless tasks."`
`"In short, nothing will change from the way things have been.`
` ......Do you understand, Genji?"`
`".........Yes.`
` ...The furniture of the One-Winged Eagle will continue to serve the Master."`
`"Kumasawa.`
` And you, Doctor Nanjo.`
` Do you understand what I'm saying?"`
`"...Oh, ...uh, ...ummm..."`
`"...I-Is that truly all right, Natsuhi-san...?"`
`"It may be true that Father passed away today,`
` but if everyone right here, right now believes, we can revive Father with magic."`
`"I-It's impossible, Madam...`
` That's just too much...!"`
`"The time of death will be made clear during the autopsy.`
` We can't stop it from looking suspicious...!"`
`"Father will not pass away, so there will be no reason for there to be an autopsy."`
`Of course, she wasn't planning to make it seem like Kinzo would live forever.`
`The fake life given to Kinzo would only last until Krauss could repay his debts.`
`After that, Kinzo's soul would finally be able to rest in peace.`
`Nanjo repeatedly said that the time of death would be discovered during the autopsy, but Natsuhi kept saying that this wouldn't be a problem.`
`"Father will not pass away by being reported dead."`
`"...A-Ah, I see.`
` ...He'll be reported missing...!!"`
`After clapping his hands together, Krauss stood up, shaking his fists.`
`"Yes.`
` Once we've managed to pay back the debt and finish our preparations for laying Father to rest, we will then announce that Father has disappeared."`
`Rokkenjima's vast, uncultivated forest was the perfect place to stage a disappearance.`
`One day, Kinzo would go out to the forest for a walk and never return.`
` ...They would search for him without success and then be forced to report his disappearance...`
`"If he disappears, we can file a report of his death even without a corpse.`
` In other words, we can hide him long enough to have him declared legally dead!`
` What do you think, Doctor Nanjo?!`
` There won't be any problems that way!"`
`"...Y-Yes, that might work..."`
`"...Is this really okay, Madam...?`
` If we stay silent, then I'm sure we could keep the Master's death a secret...!`
` However, if we were to slip up even once and let someone find out...!!"`
`"Kumasawa,`
` don't be so loud.`
` ...Father is sleeping right over there, correct?`
` Are you trying to wake him?"`
`It isn't a corpse.`
`...Kinzo...is sleeping.`
`As Natsuhi said that,`
` ...Kinzo lay quietly on the bed as though there was nothing at all odd about her words.`
`"Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have?`
` What sort of life did you enjoy?!"`
`Once again, a storm of gold butterflies started to swirl, covering Kinzo's cold body...`
`Then, after the butterflies exploded into fine gold powder and disappeared,`
` ......just like those fairy tales that have been told over and over since long ago, ...Kinzo slowly opened his eyes and sat up...`
`"......F-Father...!!"`
`"...Natsuhi,`
` let me first make one thing clear.`
` I did not coax you into doing this because of my attachment to life."`
`"You liar.`
` Don't tell me you didn't anticipate this at least a little.`
` How does it feel, Kinzo?`
` How is your body?"`
`"It isn't bad, but it feels somewhat like being in a dream.`
` I feel light."`
`"You're a being that wasn't permitted to remain in this world, yet you still remain here.`
` Don't start complaining about a little discomfort now."`
`"...Is your body truly all right?!`
` Is it really...okay...?!"`
`"Hmmm.`
` Actually, it feels quite pleasant.`
` ...If this is what the world after death feels like, playing the ghost might not be half bad."`
`"How is this, Natsuhi?`
` Kinzo has revived.`
` That means a funeral is unnecessary.`
` Your hardship has been resolved!"`
`"...B-Beatrice..."`
`As Natsuhi tried to find words of gratitude amidst her confusion,`
` Beatrice waggled her pointer finger and spoke.`
`"There is no need for thanks.`
` A ruler is allowed to be proud.`
` I will not pay heed to requests, but I will follow orders."`
`"Even so, I'll say it.`
` ...Thank you.`
` This way, ...you've bought some time for my husband...`
` ...We will handle the rest."`
`"Be warned, Natsuhi.`
` Kinzo may have revived, but that is not an eternal thing.`
` It will only continue as long as my magic does.`
` ...Be warned that the magic-resisting toxin might destroy the magic.`
` You must understand the laws of magic correctly and work hard to maintain it.`
` I can show you a miracle, but it is your role to grasp it and hold it."`
`"Of course.`
` We definitely won't neglect the miracle you have given us."`
`"Very well.`
` ...Yes, it would appear masters need to be changed out every once in a while, just like floor mats.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` I like it.`
` I shall serve you,`
` Ushiromiya Natsuhi!`
` I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, the Golden Witch Beatrice...!!`
` Call my name whenever you wish. I shall appear and grant you a miracle."`
`"Thank you.`
` I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi.`
` I will employ you and protect the honor of the Ushiromiya family...!!"`
`The rose garden was truly splendid this year.`
`The roses were blooming like crazy, as if competing with each other.`
`In that rose garden, Kinzo, Kanon, and Natsuhi could be seen...`
`"Once again, the flowers have grown wonderfully this year.`
` It must be the result of your care."`
`"......Thank you very much.`
` The weather just happened to be good this year."`
`"Thanks to your care, the garden is even more beautiful than usual.`
` Good work."`
`"Thank you very much..."`
`"If today weren't so special,`
` ...we might have been able to admire the roses while enjoying some black tea."`
`Kinzo shrugged.`
` Today was the family conference.`
`...When it came to the other siblings' businesses, none of the news had been good.`
`On the contrary, those siblings probably planned to turn the conversation to the topic of Kinzo's remaining life...`
`and hold a quiet feud over the inheritance.`
`"...Those people are quite unpleasant.`
` By the way, what about Krauss?`
` Is that debt repayment plan of his proceeding well?"`
`"It does seem to be a realistic plan.`
` ......However, it's a plan on quite a large scale, and it doesn't seem to be bearing fruit quite as well as he expected."`
`"If possible, I would have hoped to have that resolved before today's family conference."`
`"...Yes.`
` My apologies."`
`"Are you sure you're okay, Kinzo?`
` Casually walking around in a place like that?"`
`How had she gotten up there?`
`...Well, it's fairly pointless to wonder about that sort of thing when you're dealing with a witch.`
`Beatrice was casually sitting on the roof of the arbor,`
` almost as though she had been basking in the sun.`
`"Those relatives are like a massive lump of the magic-resisting toxin, and they'll be intruding in on us.`
` If you bump into them, your soul will evaporate in a instant."`
`"Hmph.`
` I am already dead.`
` Evaporating would be no detriment."`
`"...We can't have that happen.`
` Please, for the sake of the Ushiromiya family, lend us your strength just a little longer."`
`"Natsuhi,`
` it seems the boat carrying the relatives has left the harbor.`
` Perhaps it's about time to bring an end to this walk of yours."`
`"...Is that so?`
` Thank you.`
` ...Please return to the study, Father."`
`"My, my...`
` How tiresome, to go back inside when the weather is this perfect."`
`"Don't grumble, Kinzo.`
` Right now, you're nothing more than a ghost I gave life to.`
` It'll be troublesome for both me and Natsuhi if you're scattered away by the toxin.`
` Just be a good boy, shut yourself away in the study, and wrap a blanket around yourself or something.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Hmph.`
` ...Merely receiving the chance to enjoy these roses after death makes me an extremely fortunate man.`
` I understand.`
` I shall return to the study."`
`"But I would like some black tea.`
` Kanon, tell Genji to bring me some.`
` Perhaps some Marco Polo would do well today."`
`"...Certainly."`
`"Then let us go our separate ways.`
` Natsuhi,`
` ...you must conduct the family conference splendidly in my absence."`
`"Of course, Father.`
` He can't say it in front of them, but my husband is already the Ushiromiya Family Head.`
` And, I will do all I can to ensure that I don't embarrass him as his wife."`
`"...Compared to Krauss, who's had a stomachache since this morning, you are so very composed, Natsuhi.`
` ...My son is quite hopeless."`
`"My husband is talented in his own way.`
` Supporting him where he's weak is my duty as his wife."`
`"Indeed.`
` Carry out your task with precision.`
` I will make sure to stay shut away, so that I don't get in the way of this farce."`
`"Kanon,`
` go with Father to the study.`
` And then have Genji prepare some black tea."`
`"I'm not so senile that I need your help to stand up.`
` Here I go..."`
`Refusing Kanon's attempt to lend him a hand, Kinzo rose from the flower bed he had been sitting on.`
`The retired Head left everything in Natsuhi's hands and returned to the study at a gentle pace...`
`"...You're looking well.`
` You possess a sense of dignity reminiscent of Kinzo's deceased wife."`
`"On the off-chance that the magic-resisting toxin does reach Father,`
` ...will the magic dissolve in an instant?"`
`"Indeed.`
` In the blink of an eye.`
` ...I can vanish whenever I please,`
` but if someone already dead such as Kinzo loses his form, he'll be instantly tossed away like dust by the winds of the sun.`
` You must take care."`
`"Yes.`
` I understand."`
`"......You may have talent as a witch.`
` The magic-resisting toxin has been building up in your system over the years,`
` and yet you are still able to understand magic.`
` ...If you and I had met during your youth, you might have become a powerful witch by now."`
`"I am the wife of Ushiromiya Krauss, the Family Head.`
` I would become even a witch or a demon to protect his honor.`
` ...I am deeply grateful for the power of your magic.`
` I wouldn't have been able to protect the honor of the Ushiromiya family without you."`
`"Let's discuss that at another time.`
` I'd like to enjoy it with just the two of us women drinking tea."`
`"A friend of mine who went to Sri Lanka sent me some black tea with a wonderful rose fragrance."`
`"Hoh, you mean Dimbula.`
` That isn't bad.`
` Then you should also have some patis on the side.`
` ...You must serve me some as a reward if I manage to trick everyone for this entire family conference.`
` It's a promise."`
`"Understood.`
` I promise.`
` Then, I'll see you later."`
`"Yes, later."`
`The witch made her body crumble into the rustling winds, became gold flower petals, and scattered into thin air.`
`Natsuhi watched her go, then turned on her heels and headed for the mansion.`
`And then there were none left in the rose garden...`
`"Oookay then.`
` It's <break time>.`
` Got any complaints so far?"`
`"......None at all.`
` If you have to pee, why not just go and do it...?"`
`"What a rude thing to say.`
` #ff0000Kinzo is already dead#ffffff, right?`
` But he's walking around and talking, isn't he?`
` Doesn't that mean this is magic?!"`
`"Of course, I doubt this move would work on you after all this time, Bern.`
` ...But what about you, Battler?`
` Isn't this weird?`
` Don't you have to accept the existence of the magic that revived Kinzo?`
` Hahhihhyahhahaaaah!"`
`"...If you're trying to imitate Beato,`
` it's pissing me off, so stop it right now."`
`"*giggle*!`
` Figured it out?!`
` Then come on, how are you gonna answer, Battler?`
` Kinzo was just out for a stroll.`
` Why not act like you always do and start holding your head, crying 'THIS MAKES NO SENSE!!'...?`
` C'mon, use that old 'IT'S ALL USELESS' catch phrase, and then gimme one of your classic nonsensical counterarguments."`
`"There's no way a human who's supposed to be dead could be walking around, right?`
` Is this all because of some unknown virus called the Rokkenjima Syndrome that causes mass delusions?`
` Or do the scales of a mysterious form of butterfly that only lives on Rokkenjima happen to be hallucinogenic?!`
` Or is it all because a mysterious secret organization called the Mountain Dogs made an as-of-yet undiscovered drug called Purupuru Pikopuyo which causes mass delusions?!!`
` Let me hear tons of this wonderful crap, `
`kyaaahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"......Just shut up.`
` This isn't even a problem."`
`#ff0000Grandfather is dead at this point in time.#ffffff`
` There's no way he exists.`
`"The only reason he's able to act like he's alive like this...`
`is because of Aunt Natsuhi's lie, her attempt to make it through the family conference while hiding Grandfather's death."`
`"Oh?`
` It's Natsuhi's lie?!`
` You can revive the dead by lying?`
` Wouldn't that make it Natsuhi's magic?"`
`"This world is like a Braun tube before you've looked in it.`
` ...It's the world of the cat box before you open it.`
` As long as Aunt Natsuhi says she took a walk with Grandfather, and as long as no one can confirm that it's a lie,`
` it's possible to display 'Aunt Natsuhi taking a walk in the rose garden with Grandfather' as Natsuhi's reality.`
` That means it's possible for Grandfather to appear."`
`*clap*, *clap*, *clap*...`
`That extremely unflattering applause was coming from Bernkastel.`
`"...Bravo.`
` .........You're much calmer without Beato around."`
`"Quiet.`
` You shut up too."`
`"Wait a second, Battler.`
` According to your theory, sure, it might really be possible for Kinzo to appear if Natsuhi's the only person there.`
` If Natsuhi claims to have observed Kinzo in a world with no one except Natsuhi in it, then no one can deny it, right?"`
`"But Kanon was in the same place, and he was also looking at Kinzo, right?`
` How would you explain that?"`
`"...That's no problem at all.`
` Kanon-kun is a servant who works for the Ushiromiya family.`
` ...Aunt Natsuhi probably ordered him to keep to her story, so that she could hide Grandfather's death.`
` ...Because of that, Kanon can see Grandfather even though he shouldn't exist, just like Aunt Natsuhi can."`
`".........Too bad, Lambda.`
` Battler isn't gonna fall for that kind of child's play anymore."`
`"Seems so.`
` ...Well, this is nothing more than an opening, before the game's really started.`
` Like an aperitif before a meal."`
`"......An appetizer at a bar.`
` Green tea at a sushi restaurant."`
`"Shut up.`
` So, we aren't gonna get anywhere unless I say it again in blue text, huh?"`
`"Looks like it.`
` Would you mind?"`
`".........`
`......`
`#5DECFFThe reason Grandfather's strolling around like nothing happened even though he's already dead...`
`is that people who want to make it seem as though he's alive created an illusion of him.`
` People who think the same way can share in that illusion.`
` Then, they'll talk as though Grandfather actually exists and was with them until a second ago.`
` That's why he's strolling around like it's perfectly natural.#ffffff"`
`"#5DECFFBecause of this, the illusion of Grandfather is unable to appear in front of people who aren't in on this with Aunt Natsuhi.#ffffff`
`#5DECFFThat's why they made up the story of him shutting himself away in his study and refusing to come out.#ffffff"`
`In the games before now, Grandfather has always locked himself up in his study.`
`We never met him directly.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`However, some people said things that made us think he was locked up in his study in a bad mood,`
` such as claiming to have met him only a short while ago.`
` We blindly accepted their statements and believed that Grandfather was in the study.`
` ~ib~That's why it was possible for an illusion of Grandfather to exist in the study~ib~.`
`That's right, in the games before now, `
`the only people who met Grandfather were Uncle Krauss, Aunt Natsuhi,`
` and the servants.`
`#5DECFFBecause they all stuck to the same story, `
`an illusion of Grandfather was able to exist on this island, making it seem like he was alive.#ffffff`
`"...You even showed us a scene at the beginning of this game,`
` where Aunt Natsuhi convinced Doctor Nanjo and the rest to cover up Grandfather's death.`
` ...I'm not gonna fall for a cheap trick like that after all this time."`
`"......Well, not bad.`
` But I was hoping for the unknown drug Purupuru Pikopuyo."`
`"There's no way he'd say something so ridiculous, right...?`
` After all, supposing that such a thing exists would be just as bad as surrendering to the fantasy genre.`
` ...Whether it's a virus or a drug or an illness, anything that hasn't been discovered yet is in violation of Knox's 4th commandment."`
`"...What do you mean, 4th commandment?"`
`"Knox's 4th.`
` It is forbidden for unknown drugs or difficult to understand scientific devices to be used.`
` ......The rule states that such things can't be used during a murder."`
`"What the hell...`
` Unknown drug X and unknown scientific device X should be the best kinds of weapons to use when fighting against a witch..."`
`"......That's what I'm talking about.`
` All of those violate the rules of a proper mystery.`
` Supposing an unknown virus,`
` an unknown drug,`
` ...an unknown sickness, or an unknown XXX was used puts it totally in the fantasy genre.`
` My condolences.`
` If that was your theory, then it's 'game over' for you.`
` *giggle*giggle*."`
`"......H-Hey...`
` What are you talking about...?"`
`"You think you've been fighting in direct opposition to Beato.`
` But that's not actually true.`
` You haven't been in direct opposition.`
` You've been fighting along with her from a slightly different angle."`
`"All this playing detective you've done hasn't been fantasy vs mystery.`
` It's only been fantasy vs anti-fantasy."`
`"...I don't have a clue what you're talking about.`
` ...But there's one thing I do get.`
` ......It sounds like you're saying there's something wrong with my fighting style."`
`"......We're fighting to kill the fantasy known as the Illusion of the Witch.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` That means interpreting this tale as a`
` ~ib~proper mystery~ib~`
`.`
` In other words, from the very start, we have to ignore any and all elements that violate the taboos of the mystery genre."`
`"I-Ignore, you say......?"`
`"For example, several closed room murders have occurred in the games before now, right?"`
`"...Y-Yeah."`
`At every single crime scene, `
`you enthusiastically check with Beato to make sure there are no hidden doors, right?`
`Then that leads to a flashy bunch of red truths weaving together all over the place,`
` almost as though that itself is the battle.`
`I call that a waste of time.`
`After all, it's clearly specified in Knox's 3rd.`
`'It is forbidden for hidden passages to exist.'`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`In the mystery genre, hidden passages ~ib~mustn't exist~ib~`
`.`
`So, if you wanna interpret everything as a proper mystery,`
` entering this whole debate over whether there are hidden doors or not means you've lost from the beginning, see...?`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`After all, `
`~ib~there aren't any~ib~`
`.`
`As soon as you suspect that they might exist, it's already 'game over' for you.`
`In other words, you assume you can't start theory-building, just because no one's yet proven that hidden doors don't exist at the crime scene.`
` That's why I call you naive and a failure at the mystery genre.`
` You've already lost once you start thinking that.`
`You thought you were waging a fight to interpret everything like a mystery novel, right...?`
`Then you've got to follow the conventions of the mystery genre.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*, hihihihihihihihihihihihyahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
`"*cough*`
` ......Well, that's it in a nutshell.`
` Hidden doors must not exist at any of the crime scenes.`
` That means any time spent asking whether they exist or not is wasted."`
`"...I think I know what you're talking about.`
` I've heard about it somewhere.`
` Is this like the ten basic rules for mystery novels or something?"`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` They're the ten wedges for drilling witches brandished by Knox, the peerless archbishop of witch hunting.`
` Those are the true weapons with which to fight and defeat the fantasy known as the Illusion of the Witch head on.`
` ...It's just like you, Bern,`
` to bring in such a troublesome weapon.`
` That's the fantasy genre's archenemy."`
`"............`
`So, you'll deny the existence of hidden doors right from the start, without even investigating the crime scene...`
` That sounds more like fantasy to me..."`
`"Lambda, who's in charge of the witch's side, is fantasy.`
` I'm the one who's fighting her, mystery.`
` What are you?`
` You're just barely anti-fantasy, doing nothing but dodging over and over and denying fantasy.`
` You're opposed to absolutely everything, but you can't make any counter-proposals.`
` You're like a politician from some country.`
` *giggle*giggle*."`
`"Shut up.`
` I didn't come here to speak gibberish with you two.`
` Continue the story right now...!!"`
`"...Be quiet.`
` That sleeping princess behind you looks like she's in pain, doesn't she?"`
`When he turned around, he saw Beato's living corpse resting in a chair...`
`However, sweat glistened all over her body, and it felt like she was breathing a little harder than normal.`
`...She looked as though she was suffering from a high fever.`
`"Beato,`
` ...what's wrong, ...are you okay...?"`
`"What do you mean, is she okay?`
` You sure do say some weird things.`
` ...Aren't you fighting to kill this girl?"`
`"..............."`
`"We've rewound this 5th game for your benefit, `
`but right now, Bern has done a good job cornering her opponent and is about to break through the Illusion of the Witch.`
` ...Her existence has been almost completely denied.`
` It's only natural that she's suffering."`
`"......Just now,`
` even you smashed the Illusion of the Witch by saying there's no way Kinzo exists.`
` ......Here's the proof that your attack reached Beato.`
` This agony of hers."`
`"..............."`
`...I tried to at least wipe away the sweat on Beato's forehead with a handkerchief.`
`It's true I promised Beato that I'd let her die.`
`But it was supposed to happen...peacefully.`
`I wasn't planning to make her suffer first.`
`...My goal isn't to make the sleeping Beato suffer like this before killing her...`
`As if they had seen right through to my mixed feelings,`
` the two witches grinned...`
`"Dad only overheard because you kept yelling about the inheritance, right, Aneki?"`
`"It isn't my fault, it was just an unlucky coincidence, okay?!`
` He just happened to be in the corridor and heard... It was an accident, I tell you, an accident...!"`
`"Could you two give it a rest...?`
` Just call it our bad luck this time and give it up.`
` If you leave a man alone, his mood'll pop right back to normal."`
`"Hopefully Father's feelings weren't hurt so much that he writes up some strange will."`
`The relatives took a deep breath and fell silent...`
`"Hey! You can't jump around either, Maria!`
` What'll you do if Ange-chan falls?!"`
`"......Sorry to keep you waiting.`
` The boat is ready."`
`"Okay, let's go.`
` Won't get anywhere by complainin' now."`
`"We eagerly await your return to this island."`
`Natsuhi was sitting on a bench in the rose garden, looking completely worn out.`
`However, when she noticed that Kanon and Kumasawa were coming back, she immediately sat up straight, regaining the dignity of the Head's wife.`
`"...Did the boat leave?"`
`"Yes.`
` It departed just a minute ago."`
`"I see.`
` Good job seeing them off.`
` ...What is my husband doing?"`
`"He returned to his room a short while ago.`
` He is resting."`
`Since the previous day, Krauss had been almost overwhelmed by anxiety over the thought that Kinzo's death might be discovered.`
`When the family conference ended, his weariness must have suddenly gotten ahold of him.`
`...However, the way he had refused to let even a sliver of his true intentions slip out...`
`and the manner in which he had managed to act as though everything was normal...`
`showed that Krauss's nerve was nothing to sneeze at.`
`"......How was it?`
` Did they seem to notice anything suspicious about Father...?"`
`"Not at all.`
` Eva-sama and the rest were having a big ruckus over how the Master overheard them talking about the inheritance. Right?`
` Wasn't their panicking just priceless?"`
`"Yes.`
` They were quite shaken up."`
`"But Kumasawa, you really are quite an actress.`
` The way you acted all panicked in the corridor made it seem like Father really was there."`
`"......Kumasawa-san is quite talented at that sort of thing."`
`"Oooh, come now, I don't deserve such praise.`
` Hohohohoh."`
`"*giggle*`
` I always have to give Genji strict orders not to easily swallow your stories when you call in sick."`
`"Now that's just too harsh, Madam.`
` Ohohohohoh..."`
`"You really did a good job.`
` Both of you, as well as Genji and Shannon,`
` will get your pay for a month's worth of past vacation time, as well as five extra days, just as promised.`
` Consider this is a confidential benefit.`
` Talk with Genji when you collect your pay so that the other servants don't find out."`
`"Sure, we understand.`
` Right?"`
`"......Kumasawa-san,`
` your voice is too loud."`
`"Ooh, not good, not good, ...hohohoh."`
`"Good point.`
` Let's leave it at that for the time being.`
` We should all return to our regular duties.`
` That's right, I've had Gohda prepare some special tea.`
` Tell him to serve it."`
`Natsuhi let them know she wanted to be left alone for a while, so she could drink some black tea in the rose garden.`
`The black tea that had been carried all the way to the bench...`
`was the Sri Lankan tea 'Dimbula' that she had promised Beato, along with some patis...`
`Sitting on either side of this snack, staring at it curiously, the wife of the Head and her witch could be seen.`
`"...So this is patis...`
` I just assumed it would be some kind of baked sweet..."`
`Apparently Natsuhi, not realizing that it had a curry-like spicy flavor, had started choking after putting it in her mouth.`
`To describe it in Japanese terms, it was like fried dumplings stuffed with mashed, curry-flavored potatoes.`
`As a household dish, it would probably be pretty popular with the kids.`
`However, it was something of a shock to Natsuhi, who expected that a treat to go with tea would be sweet.`
`"Didn't you know?`
` Dimbula always goes with this.`
` Black tea always goes with cookies.`
` Oh, but chocolate is good too.`
` You must have sweet bean jelly with Japanese tea, although salted konbu also works.`
` Chinese tea goes with Chinese dumplings.`
` Though I like moon cakes too."`
`"...I'm surprised.`
` You know a lot about various cultures, don't you?"`
`"Well, I haven't been living a thousand years for nothing.`
` I've tried refined teas from all over the world.`
` Perhaps you could call it a journey through the world of tea."`
`"That does seem like it would be a wonderful way to travel the world.`
` Before today, I never knew that one could enjoy tea like this.`
` I will treasure this experience."`
`"I cannot leave Rokkenjima.`
` This is the only way I can travel.`
` What about you?`
` I'm sure you've elegantly traveled the world like any wealthy wife might."`
`".........Before Jessica was born, my husband took me to many countries.`
` Before marrying, I never once traveled overseas, so each time was a fresh and new experience."`
`"...Hmph.`
` Sounds like you were also born into a very rigid family."`
`"............`
`...It was strict, but they gave me a wonderful upbringing.`
` It would be rude to my father and mother to call that rigid."`
`"That's a pretty eloquent way to call it rigid. *cackle*."`
`Krauss might have pitied Natsuhi.`
`Or, he might have wanted to take her away from the rigid Ushiromiya family for a little bit and let her rest.`
`...Or, he might simply have wanted to take his wife around countries he knew well, to show off everything he knew.`
`"Unlike Father, my husband is fond of Asian nations.`
` Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Thailand.`
` I think we also went to Malaysia."`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` That Krauss... Was he trying to rebel against Kinzo's Western tastes?`
` But Asia is good too.`
` After all, the Japanese are strongly influenced by the West.`
` When they think of foreign countries, only Western ones come to mind.`
` But you mustn't forget the East."`
`"I myself knew a few things about the West, but I knew very little about the East...`
` I seem to recall my husband making fun of me now and then during our travels."`
`Beato subtly peered into Natsuhi's heart, as the latter grumbled that the trips had all been very tiring.`
`"Are you listening?`
` This is called an areca nut.`
` It's a popular luxury food item around here."`
`It looked like a small, round, gourd-like nut that had been smashed, with cucumber wedged in it.`
`At a glance, it looked as though it would probably taste like pickles.`
`"I-I see.`
` So I just bite it here...?"`
`As she tried to bite the one her husband was holding, he suddenly moved it away.`
`...It felt kind of embarrassing, like she was a fish after some bait.`
`"Whoa, wait up.`
` You have to eat it a certain way.`
` Yes, you are supposed to bite it.`
` Bite it.`
` Chew it.`
` But don't swallow it."`
`"Huh?`
` Even though you bite and chew it, you can't swallow it?"`
`"Yes.`
` Bite and chew.`
` Don't swallow.`
` And don't drink the juice.`
` It'll make your stomach hurt."`
`"I-I don't understand...`
` Why would you eat something like that??"`
`"Think of it as something like gum.`
` Chew it and enjoy the flavor.`
` Then take the scraps you've bitten and the juice and spit it out into a paper cup like this."`
`"...D-Dear,`
` the inside of your mouth is bright red...!`
` Wipe it off, wipe it off.`
` ...Eeek!"`
`Even her favorite handkerchief, which she had wiped Krauss's mouth with, had bright red marks on it.`
`Something that's poisonous if eaten or drunk, and it makes the inside of your mouth so bright red,`
` and having to spit something out after you've put it in your mouth, ...how indecent!`
` ...Thinking this, Natsuhi adamantly refused Krauss's invitation.`
`"No way, no way, I don't need any, I don't need any...!"`
`"This is a cross-cultural experience.`
` What's the point of traveling if we don't do things that can only be done here?"`
`Krauss kept chewing, ignoring the fact that even his lips were being colored bright red.`
`"Father likes these too.`
` He must have ordered them long ago, because he used to chew away at them on the mansion's terrace.`
` Although it seems he stopped ever since you arrived."`
`"Look here, Father, the person you respect even more than me, enjoyed these all the time.`
` Look, look, don't be shy, take some."`
`"No, no, stop it, stop it, deeeear!"`
`...During travel, Krauss had the innocence of a child.`
`He didn't even conceal his jealousy of the respect Natsuhi normally gave Kinzo.`
`Just being able to see that side of her husband made traveling all the way to another country worthwhile...`
`Krauss urged her even harder to bite it,`
` but Natsuhi, undaunted, ran from place to place and finally yelled that he was being too pushy.`
`Krauss was miffed the whole bus ride.`
`What a child, to let a little thing like this get him down,`
` Natsuhi thought exasperatedly.`
`Then, a native tour guide in the bus took out one of those areca nuts and started explaining about it.`
`It had apparently been a beloved luxury item in these parts since ancient times, similar to tobacco.`
`Just like in Natsuhi's case, it was starting to be disliked by young people and was becoming obsolete.`
`...Furthermore, it was treated as a good luck charm in this area...`
`and was known as a symbol for couples.`
`She looked at her husband's face.`
` ......He turned away abruptly, but it looked like his cheeks had gotten a little red...`
`"So,`
` you then leaned on your husband and held his hand, did you?!`
` What the heck, you and your husband share a pretty pure love, don't you?!`
` Did you get all fired up?`
` You know, like, that night♪`
` Kiiihihihihihihi!!"`
`Red-faced and avoiding Beato's eye, Natsuhi tried to hide her embarrassment by swallowing the patis whole, chewing with her cheeks puffed out like a blowfish.`
`Beato said 'Yep, this is the best snack anyone could have with tea'`
` and nodded several times, a broad smile on her face...`
`"However, that's only how it was when we were newlyweds.`
` Right now, I cannot even leave Rokkenjima.`
` I'm a bird in a cage."`
`"Well, it's the same for me.`
` I can keep dying, but I just can't escape Rokkenjima.`
` I'm also a bird in a cage."`
`"I don't know much about you, and I won't pry.`
` ...However, I do see that you face circumstances not to be taken lightly."`
`"I have no desire to act like the chief prisoner here.`
` Let's be friendly as fellow birds in this cage.`
` I've taken a liking to you."`
`"Really?`
` Thank you."`
`"The instructions and orders you gave the servants for this family conference were superb.`
` You took everything from where Kinzo would be and when, what he did, and what he left behind,`
` and put it all together splendidly without any contradictions.`
` That detailed written plan of yours had the same beauty as a high-level magic circle."`
`To make it look like Kinzo actually existed and was living life his own way,`
` she had written his schedule for the day down to the finest detail and made the servants follow it to the letter.`
`When did he meet whom and where, and what did he leave them?`
`When did he do what and where, and what changed?`
`As a result, even though the relatives never saw Kinzo even once,`
` they hadn't suspected in the slightest that he hadn't been there.`
`Eva and the rest truly believed that Kinzo had just happened to be walking through the hall when he heard them talking about the inheritance and went into a rage.`
`Everything had gone just as Natsuhi's plan had predicted, down to the finest detail.`
`And the cooperation by the servants had also worked smoothly, down to the finest detail...`
`"We had to stop this secret from getting out no matter the cost.`
` That's why I double-checked the plan thoroughly."`
`"Your willpower and attention to detail summoned success with certainty.`
` ...As a witch, it seems that you're in Lady Lambdadelta's camp.`
` At your current level, as soon as you become self-aware of that as magic, you will be worthy of calling yourself a witch apprentice."`
`"If you call something like that magic, then that would make Kumasawa the witch of feigned illnesses.`
` It's only on busy days that she calls us to say she's taking the day off because of her bad back.`
` Like every year's family conference, for example."`
`"Oh, no, you've got Kumasawa completely wrong there.`
` She's a witch of a much, much higher level.`
` If you knew what she really was, it'd shock you!`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`Watching these two have their pleasant chat...`
`was another pair with steam rising from their black tea.`
`However, this second pair was in a world that the first couldn't see, where golden roses bloomed.`
`"...Ronove was kind enough to make us some of that Dimbula tea too."`
`"..................Nn..."`
`It felt as though Beato muttered something.`
`For the first time, it felt as though something had gotten through to her.`
`Surely, she had taken an interest in the black tea and felt like drinking it...`
`Thinking this, Battler took Beato's cup and her hand, making her hold the cup...`
`"............Nng, ........."`
`Beato's eyes trembled sadly, and her fingers shook.`
`Almost as though she couldn't even move her fingers as she wanted to...`
`...and was mourning the fact that she could no longer enjoy the tea she had once loved by her own power...`
` That's how she looked...`
`So Battler put his hand on Beato's, grabbed hold of the tea cup, and lifted it to her lips...`
`......Then, ...though it was only a single mouthful, ...Beato sipped.`
`The days they'd had been locked in a killing-fest with red swords and blue wedges...`
`already seemed like the distant past.`
`Now, not only was Beato unable to do that, ...it was even difficult for her to make her body do as she pleased.`
`Even just drinking a mouthful of black tea like this was hard...`
`"...How is it?`
` That rose aroma makes for a great black tea.`
` Do you like it...?"`
`"..............."`
`Of course, `
`......Beato didn't respond.`
`"...What happened to you...?`
` ...Is this...another strategy?`
` Are you pretending to be in a slump so you can shock me later?"`
`".................."`
`"...If that's what you're after, the same trick won't work again, so give it a rest.`
` ...I can't get fired up with you like this."`
`".................."`
`"Hey.`
` ...Isn't it about time for you to start laughing loudly, saying 'Caught you, dumbass!' or something?`
` Any kind of joke stops being funny if you drag it out too much.`
` Especially if it's a rehash."`
`"..............."`
`"Laugh.`
` Just like you're cackling over there as you drink with Aunt Natsuhi."`
`"..............."`
`"........."`
`"..............................................................."`
`".........Can't you at least grin...?"`
`"Never again.`
` This child will never laugh again."`
`Those sudden words...were exceedingly cruel.`
`"How can you say that for sure?!`
` Don't you try to take Beato's right to laugh away from her."`
`"...Oh, should I say it in red then...?"`
`I shook my head furiously.`
`Then, with an expression that didn't reveal her thoughts in the slightest, Bernkastel spoke while looking at Beato's face.`
` ...And the word she used was completely incomprehensible to me.`
`"Congratulations."`
`"......For what?"`
`"Beato is like this as a result of your victory."`
`"......What are you talking about...?"`
`"You said something interesting in a previous game.`
` You said this would be torture where you both torment each other.`
` That was right.`
` It's torture for Beato as well.`
` And, you won that torture game.`
` ...That's why Beato's soul was killed, why she became a doll-like corpse."`
`"Are you saying...I did this to Beato?"`
`"The battle ends when one of you loses the will to try and win.`
` ...As far as the battle between you and Beato goes, that was already concluded in the previous game.`
` Well, it probably happened without you noticing though."`
`"......In that case, why hasn't the game ended, if I've already won?`
` ...Why is this game still continuing?"`
`"The shackle attached to that girl's ankle.`
` ...That's a rule Lambda made."`
`Even if Beatrice tries to yield or gets discouraged or gives up, she isn't capable of stepping down from the game.`
`...That's the rule.`
` Or maybe it's a curse.`
`"In the past, `
`I supported you when it looked like you were gonna give in.`
` Though you probably couldn't perceive it, `
`I assisted you by giving you hints and making things go your way.`
` That's why you're able to be here now.`
` ......Remember? Remember how I saved you?"`
`Bernkastel stared at me...`
`...It's true I wasn't aware of it,`
` ...but just maybe,`
` ...I was saved by her.`
`"In the same way, Lambda is supporting Beato.`
` And this time, Beato is on the verge of giving in.`
` That's why Lambda's been giving her support this round, to keep her from giving in.`
` That's what the shackle is.`
` By refusing to let her resign, she's rescued Beato within the game."`
`"...Rescued her from what?"`
`"Normally, there are only two ways for this game to end.`
` Either one side will accept defeat and resign, `
`or one side will win the game with a checkmate.`
` Beato was about to collide with the first way.`
` That's why Lambda crushed that chance and managed to just barely avoid losing.`
` By the rules of this game, that's an impressive bit of support."`
`So, the only way this game can end now...is if I win.`
`At the very least, until I do win, `
`this witch called Lambdadelta can probably try to buy time for Beato to make a comeback.`
`But, ...that'll just prolong Beato's suffering even more...`
`Neither of us want that.`
`Both Beato and I fought with all we had, trying to win.`
`The game repeated several times because we were both giving it everything we could muster.`
`Then, that one time,`
` we confronted each other head on with all of our strength.`
`And......Beato acknowledged her loss.`
`She said she wanted me to end this game...and entrusted everything to me.`
`So, Bernkastel's words are the truth.`
`She said it's my fault Beato's become a living corpse.`
` ...That's true.`
`But it's something both of us wanted.`
`"Our match has already been resolved.`
` ...Even so, the game won't end.`
` That's why Beato put her trust in me.`
` She told me to win quickly and end this game."`
`"............"`
`Now that the game's been resolved, letting it continue any further means endless torture for Beato.`
` ......Nothing more than a nightmare.`
`I've gotta give her a perfect checkmate, end this game in the truest sense,`
` ...and let her rest in peace...`
`For that reason, I'll keep fighting.`
`But by continuing the game, Beato's eternal torture will continue.`
`It felt as though I could only let her sleep peacefully by slowly strangling her to death...`
`"......I'm starting to feel like truth doesn't matter anymore.`
` ...As long as Beato's satisfied, who cares what happens in the game?`
` Beato resigned.`
` I'll abandon the truth of the Illusion of the Witch and return home with my family.`
` ......Is there anything wrong with that?"`
`If only Lambdadelta hadn't placed the curse of that shackle on her, this battle would be over already.`
`......That's why I found it detestable.`
`This game, which I can't finish without tormenting Beato more, `
`...is detestable.`
`"...Whaat's this?`
` Beato's starting to look like she's in pain every time you get closer to the truth, so you're suddenly going easy on her...?`
` Then go easy on her as much as you can.`
` And why don't you just let Beato win while you're at it?`
` Then your little sister can have a lonely, tragic future forced on her endlessly."`
`"That's not how it is......`
`........."`
`...That's right...`
` I have to return for Ange's sake as well.`
`I know this isn't the time to start feeling compassion for Beato.`
`"In that case, make sure you kill her.`
` Kill this witch without fail."`
`"....................."`
`Even though Beato was right there,`
` Bernkastel spoke without holding back...`
`"Your goal is to kill this woman.`
` ......In the last game, you said it at Beato's request.`
` You said 'I'll kill you'."`
`"......Yeah, that may be true,`
` but that doesn't mean you get to complain about it."`
`"Did you know?`
` When you tear one of your fingernails out, it's better to do it in one go.`
` ...Pulling it out like you do...`
`timidly, twisting and slow...hurts much, much more.`
` What you're doing sounds much more like torture to me."`
`"............"`
`"If you have any compassion, kill her all at once.`
` That's how killing works."`
`"That's none of your business.`
` I'm the one who gets to decide how to perform her last rites.`
` You and that Lambdadelta witch have nothing to do with this.`
` I'll kill her.`
` I won't let anyone else do it."`
`"......As long as you don't lose that willpower.`
` I'm betting on you.`
` Okay?`
` Make sure you don't forget.`
` #ff0000Unless this game is resolved, you will never be released.#ffffff`
` You won't be allowed to abandon this game either."`
`"...I get it."`
`"I know what Lambda's after.`
` She wants to make you lose your will to fight just like Beato,`
` to make you a pair of living dolls, to keep this world in perpetual equilibrium.`
` ...You don't want that, do you?`
` I wouldn't like it either."`
`"Why should I give a damn about what you want?`
` Still, I won't throw this game away.`
` I won't abandon my responsibility to fight against Beato."`
`"I'm glad our goals are the same.`
` So, you'll be able to kill this child without any hesitation, right?"`
`"....................."`
`".........That's right."`
`"....................."`
`I have no way of knowing whether those words eased her pain or hurt her.`
`...But I can tell by the dull tingling in my chest...`
`that I surely believe I've hurt her.`
`I have no way of knowing what the silent Beato feels.`
`...If I think I've hurt her,`
` ...does that mean she's actually been hurt?`
`And, if I didn't think I'd hurt her,`
` would that mean no one's gotten hurt because of me?`
`..................`
`"...So, `
`about that Beato who's drinking tea over there with Natsuhi.`
` You can handle that, right...?"`
`"Yeah...`
` ...No problem."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"It's the same as it was with Kinzo.`
` Beatrice doesn't exist.`
` This is a fake illusion of a witch that Natsuhi created, since she believes she was borrowing a witch's power when she thought up a brilliant plan to overcome hardship.`
` It only looks like they're drinking together `
`because Lambdadelta, who's the Game Master and ~ib~the one telling the story~ib~, interpreted it that way."`
`"If you could stare at this scene without a fragment of love for Natsuhi, you wouldn't see an illusion like that.`
` ...That's why with my eyes, all I can see is Natsuhi all alone, drinking her tea in silence."`
`Without love, it cannot be 'seen'.`
`Because love is lacking, it cannot be 'seen'.`
`"You're looking at a daydream Natsuhi's showing us.`
` ...Beatrice doesn't exist there."`
`"............Ugh......"`
`Beato mumbled softly.`
`...It was a small voice that made it sound like she was in pain.`
`The thorn of Bernkastel's truth had stabbed into her chest.`
`"...Yeah, that's probably true.`
` I think your theory's right.`
` But don't say that in front of Beato."`
`"It doesn't matter where I say it.`
` This is Beato's world we're in."`
`"...Also, it's not like I'm protecting Beato,`
` but it's still possible Aunt Natsuhi really is drinking tea with some unknown person X, who calls themselves Beatrice.`
` This scene takes place a year before everything.`
` The number of people on the island on this day has never been shown with the red truth."`
`".........Sure.`
` Even Lambda hasn't said anything in red about the number of people on Rokkenjima on this day."`
`"In that case,`
` it's possible for Aunt Natsuhi to claim that she really did drink tea with a woman calling herself Beatrice.`
` Just like I can't deny your theory, you can't deny mine.`
` That means you can't say for sure whether the Beato there is an illusion or not."`
`"......Oh, is this cat box theory?`
` That might've worked on Beato, but it won't work on me."`
`"Why not?"`
`"`
`#ff0000After all, Natsuhi is drinking tea all by herself right there.#ffffff"`
`There was a violent sound of glass breaking, `
`...and the Beato who laughed happily and cracked jokes about Natsuhi's newlywed years...`
`was erased.`
`...A lonely wind blew,`
` ...and the one person who remained on the bench drinking tea with a tired expression...`
`...was Aunt Natsuhi, all by herself......`
`".........Nng, ggh..............."`
`Beato...groaned.`
` I could see clearly that she was in anguish.`
`Another illusion of the witch had been smashed, ...drawing Beato towards death.`
`...In short, this is what the battle to let Beato rest in peace is all about...`
`A second ago, Bernkastel likened our fight to the torture of tearing fingernails out.`
`If I have to tear them out anyway,`
` ...then my last bit of compassion towards Beato should be to minimize that pain.`
`In other words, ...even if I want to minimize her pain, I still have to cause it.`
`I have to accept...that look of anguish on her face...`
`And at the same time,`
` ...I realized what a merciless thing the red truth was.`
`...Right now, in this rose garden, there's no one except Aunt Natsuhi.`
`In other words, there are no observers except for Aunt Natsuhi.`
`So, if that lone observer were to say that she'd had some tea with Beato,`
` ...no one should be able to refute that.`
`...If there's something no one can deny, ...doesn't that mean it's truth?`
`Aunt Natsuhi is enjoying the roses and drinking tea together with Beato.`
`...How could anyone have the right to mercilessly trample that pleasant moment...?`
`"......The red truth is like a blade."`
`"..............."`
`"In a battle with a witch, it's a blade that sometimes tears your theories apart, but sometimes becomes a weapon you can fight back with."`
`"...I know.`
` So what?"`
`"Don't use it without reason."`
`"........."`
`"A blade is a tool if you use it when you're supposed to,`
` ...but it's a weapon if you use it out of malice."`
`True enough, Aunt Natsuhi wasn't really drinking tea with a witch.`
`However, saying that with the red truth probably has nothing to do with our game.`
`Our game is the tale of October 1986.`
`The two days of the crime give us more than enough time to injure each other, with our red and blue blades glistening.`
`"This isn't about the Illusion of the Witch.`
` ...It's about Aunt Natsuhi's privacy.`
` How could anyone have the right to expose that?"`
`"............`
`...Do you want to acknowledge that a witch actually existed here and drank tea with Natsuhi?`
` Weren't you trying to deny the existence of witches?"`
`"...That's right, if we're talking about our game, the two-day period from October 4th to October 5th in 1986.`
` But I have no desire to question whether or not witches exist outside that game board."`
`"In the first place, the Devil's Proof argument makes it impossible to deny the existence of witches.`
` And, according to the rules of this game, saying something like what you did in red is a forbidden move that leads to a stalemate.`
` You can't deny the existence of witches, not even with the red truth."`
`".........True.`
` ...I never thought I'd hear you talk so glibly about witches existing.`
` .........Not bad, Lambda.`
` You've done a good job getting Battler stuck between his human culprit theory and the idea that witches existing wouldn't be so bad."`
`"She really excels at controlling Human hearts.`
` ...Looks like I'd better start helping you out even more."`
`"I really couldn't care less about you two.`
` Disappear.`
` This game is between Beato and me.`
` We're gonna keep this game to ourselves."`
`".........No way."`
`"What...?"`
`"After all,`
` I'm enjoying this game too.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle* Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha......"`
`Bernkastel disappeared, leaving only that unpleasant laugh behind.`
`"..............."`
`After that, all that remained was Natsuhi, sipping tea all alone,`
` ...Beato, her hand still on the tea cup as she stared blankly at the surface of the liquid,`
` ...and me.`
`"...Bernkastel and Lambdadelta...`
` ...Virgilia called them your friends, but...`
`...you really should choose your friends more carefully.`
` Or wait, maybe they actually make a good match with an ill-natured person like you..."`
`"..............."`
`"........."`
`Beato didn't answer.`
`Battler took Beato's hand, made her hold the cup again, and brought it to her lips.`
`......Beato made a quiet sound in her throat and drank another gulp...`
`Then, Natsuhi's lonely teatime ended.`
`...That truth, which was Natsuhi's alone and observed by no one else, had been defiled.`
`In Natsuhi's world, surely...`
`...that tea party, which had been peaceful despite her annoyance at Beato for making fun of her too much, came to an end, and the two of them parted ways.`
`However, in Natsuhi's exposed truth, ...she was all alone.`
`Natsuhi tottered away.`
`...On the bench, only a single person's cup remained...`
`After dashing to her bedroom, Jessica answered the phone call that had been transferred there.`
`"Ah, hello?!`
` Sorry to keep you waiting!`
` Battler!`
` What'd ya think you're doing, not contacting us for six years?!`
` How's it goiiiiiiiing?!`
` Oh, really?`
` How the hell'd I know?!`
` Heh, shut up! Ahhahahahahahaha!`
` So, that means you'll be coming to this year's family conference, right?`
` I mean, it's been six whole years!"`
`Five businessmen in expensive suits were visiting in the parlor,`
` giving Krauss and Natsuhi a progress report on their business.`
`Spread out on the table were the blueprints and designs for a building, as well as documents related to expenditures and the like,`
` ...so packed that even a tea cup would have gotten in the way.`
`Officially, they were here to give Krauss a progress report,`
` ...but in actuality, Krauss had called them all the way over to Rokkenjima so that Natsuhi could hear from them directly.`
`This was because Natsuhi needed to hear someone other than her husband explain what condition their business was in.`
`...In other words, even though another family conference without Kinzo was approaching, `
`their business had not yet earned them any money.`
`After telling the guests to wait for a short while, `
`Krauss took Natsuhi out into the hall and once again summarized the situation...`
`"...In short, they say the work is proceeding even better than we imagined.`
` This is where my personal connection to the governor really starts to pay off!`
` By now, it's absolutely impossible for this catch to get away from us.`
` To the contrary, it's growing so big that in one go, we'll be able to regain not just that power of attorney, but everything we've lost up to this point as well!"`
`Krauss spoke passionately.`
`...This made it seem all the more suspicious to Natsuhi,`
` but this time, at least, she had to admit that everything really did seem to be going well.`
`Certainly, this business Krauss boasted of had expanded in scope over the last year...`
`and was promising an even greater payoff than had been anticipated initially.`
`Whether it would prove to be a winner or not, investors had gathered around it, and they were rapidly gaining funds.`
`This must be what they mean when they say money summons money.`
`It was probably the greatest success of Krauss's life so far.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`...No, it probably `
`~ib~would be~ib~`
` his greatest success yet.`
`That point was where Natsuhi's misgivings lay.`
`True, it was certain, and as Krauss had said, they wouldn't lose this catch now.`
`However, ......the fish on the line had gotten too big.`
`"We'll definitely be able to reel this fish in.`
` There's no need to rush.`
` It's such a success that I wish I could show it to Father, if he were still alive...!"`
`"Yes, I know.`
` However, I believe you made me a promise last year.`
` You said you were sure you could manage something within a year...!"`
`A pained look rose to Krauss's face.`
`They certainly had hooked a fat fish that guaranteed great success.`
`However, it would require an appropriate amount of time to reel it in...`
`Natsuhi pressed Krauss, asking if there was any way for them to make money before this year's family conference,`
` but Krauss kept saying that he needed just one more year...`
`Krauss planned to use this unprecedented success to catapult them into further challenges in the future.`
`Because of this, he didn't want to do anything that would raise suspicions by making it seem like they were rushing to get money...`
`Certainly, fortune tends to turn against people who take it for granted even in the slightest.`
`Anxious beggars never prosper...`
`On many occasions before now, Krauss had gotten cold feet and sold off businesses that would surely have brought in a profit had he just waited, `
`and had, in effect, given away his winning picks.`
`Natsuhi also knew this.`
`She knew that guts were the thing her husband lacked most.`
`That's why she was unable to refuse when Krauss said he wanted to prudently wait just one more year...`
`"...Hahahahahahahaha.`
` How wonderful that things are going well.`
` It would appear I'll have to sit around here as a ghost for a little longer."`
`"You don't look too disappointed.`
` You're fated to be chewed to bits by demons the moment you leave this world."`
`"...My apologies, Father.`
` ...For one more year, ...you might not be granted peace."`
`"It is fine. Fear not, Natsuhi.`
` I am no longer the Ushiromiya Family Head.`
` The ghost of the study should obediently follow the current Head's commands.`
` ...I've taken a look at Krauss's charts, and they aren't bad at all."`
`"Even from your perspective, Father?"`
`"...Hmmm. They're pretty good even from my perspective.`
` Everyone is confident in victory, gathering together a significant quantity of magical power.`
` As a result, that victory is growing ever deeper, involving more and more people and magic, beginning to create gold.`
` A perfect embodiment of classic alchemy."`
`"Hoh.`
` If you've earned even the Golden Witch's approval, that is very reassuring.`
` Rejoice, Natsuhi.`
` This business of Krauss's will save the Ushiromiya family from its crisis without fail."`
`"Th-Thank you very much.`
` ...And, if you would once again..."`
`"Indeed.`
` We'll have to overcome one more family conference, won't we..."`
`"Yes.`
` I think things went well last year, but I imagine some of the relatives will find it suspicious.`
` ......I think this year's conference will be a critical time."`
`"During last year's family conference,`
` you were correct to predict that the same thing might have to happen again."`
`"...Even for those who aren't witches, preparing for the worst-case scenario is one of the basics for getting on in this world.`
` ...So, what will you do this year?"`
`"Just like last year, I will see to it that a high concentration of the servants who know Father's secret are there on the day of the conference.`
` ...Some of the relatives may already have noticed that Father isn't around.`
` A careless show might actually put us in more danger of exposure."`
`"Indeed.`
` It is said that too much is as bad as too little.`
` ...Then what will you do?"`
`"Unlike last year, I think we'll go with a plan that has you staying inside your study until the end."`
`"That would be suitable.`
` Barricades are straightforward and simple, a final trump card."`
`"No matter how strongly the toxin fills this mansion,`
` as long as the closed room barrier remains around this room, it will be impossible to deny Kinzo's existence.`
` I guarantee that myself.`
` ...However, when forming a barricade, it is inevitable that you will be surrounded."`
`"I know.`
` ...Even so, I beg that both of you lend us your power just one more time..."`
`"I cannot disobey the orders of the new Head.`
` Furthermore, a ghost cannot disobey the orders of the living.`
` If you tell me not to leave this room, I will obey."`
`"Thank you very much..."`
`"I'm not satisfied.`
` If you want me to lend you my power, I won't listen to a mere request."`
`"Yes.`
` You are the family alchemist.`
` So, I won't ask you to help.`
` I order you to help.`
` ...Your magic is the one thing we can rely on.`
` Use that power to create an illusion of Father just one more time."`
`"Very well.`
` I hear and obey.`
` I find your confidence quite pleasing."`
`From the shadows of the study, Battler watched the exchange between these three...`
`"...I see.`
` So we've made it to this year's family conference.`
` ...Grandfather was in a bad mood, so he shut himself in his study and didn't appear in front of anyone."`
`"....................."`
`Natsuhi spoke boldly about how she would somehow overcome this year's crisis and protect the Ushiromiya family's honor until the end,`
` while Kinzo praised her, saying that her plan looked promising.`
`Beato also praised her, saying that Natsuhi's dignified confidence was even more well-suited for the Headship than Krauss's.`
`......However, `
`......right now, `
`the true number of people in this room was...`
`The moment I thought that...no, just because I thought it, Beato grabbed at her chest and moaned.`
`"...Don't worry.`
` This is still outside the game board.`
` So, I won't deny you or Grandfather over there."`
`"..............."`
`I put my hand on Beato's as she tried to hold back the pain deep inside her chest...`
`I've already told Bernkastel.`
`The two-day period of the 1986 family conference is all I need to deny the Illusion of the Witch.`
`"#5DECFFIn the last game, you said in red that Grandfather's dead at the start time for all games.`
` However, you never mentioned whether Grandfather was alive or dead before the start time for the games.`
` ...In short, even if Grandfather exists in this place right now, that doesn't create any contradictions.#ffffff"`
`My hand touching her let off a faint blue light,`
` ...which seeped into her chest.`
`That light tenderly wrapped itself around the splinters in Beato's chest...`
`"......`
`#5DECFFAnd, I also can't deny the existence of the Beatrice in this place.`
` The number of people on this island outside the game board...in other words, before October 4th, 1986, has not been proclaimed in red.`
` Therefore, there's nothing strange about Beatrice existing here.#ffffff"`
`"..................Nnn."`
`Beato's expression softened slightly.`
`My blue light...slowly began to melt the red splinters that denied the Illusion of the Witch...`
`"..............."`
`Beato still wore the same sad expression, but she lifted her face...`
`and looked me straight in the eye.`
`Though she was silent, her eyes told me that her pain had subsided.`
`The feelings that showed in her eyes were gratitude for taking the pain away...`
`...and appreciation...or was it surprise? ...For leaving even a tiny bit of leeway for witches to exist.`
`Unable to look directly at those pure eyes of hers, I reflexively averted my gaze.`
`"...Don't get the wrong idea.`
` I don't plan on accepting the existence of witches or surrendering.`
` I just want to let that part slide and fight stoically...so that I can win this game against you.`
` I have no desire to bully you outside the game board as well."`
`"..............."`
`"........."`
`Beato hung her head.`
` ...I was still facing away from her.`
`However, we waited wordlessly for a while, my hand still on hers...`
`......By now, no one would believe that this sad-eyed woman...`
`was the same person as that prideful Beato.`
`So, ...I asked once more.`
`Even though I said it aloud, it wasn't a question to her.`
` I was asking myself.`
`"...Just what in the world...`
`were you thinking?"`
`"..............."`
`"That's right.`
` Even though this is Lambda's game, ...I have to find you here.`
` I have to find what you thought...and what you were trying to do."`
`Very soon, this game will also reach October 4th, 1986.`
`...The 5th game will finally begin.`
`And this time, I'll reach the end.`
` The end of that journey.`
`"...I'm not worried about the surface-level stuff, like murders and tricks.`
` ...What did you, ...the Golden Witch Beatrice, think, and why did you do what you did?`
` What were you hoping for?`
` ......That's what I'm gonna find out."`
`That's right.`
` I already know how I can reach the end of that journey.`
` It's been made clear to me since the very beginning.`
`"...This time, I'll spin the chessboard around.`
` I'll read this tale not from my side,`
` ...but from yours."`
`"..............."`
`"And this time, ...I'll understand you.`
` I'll pick my way to your heart.`
` ...I won't let you feel pain.`
` Don't worry.`
` ...I won't let those witches use you as a toy anymore."`
`"............Nn..."`
`Beato looked up at me again...and gave a small nod.`
`...That's right.`
`The position of Game Master might have been snatched up by Lambdadelta.`
`However, ...as long as I continue this contest with the intent of fighting against Beato,`
` ...our fight will continue no matter who controls the game board.`
`...Very soon, the curtain will rise on our game...`
`"At this year's family conference, we must conceal the Master's secret once again."`
`"Y-Yes.`
` ...I understand."`
`"......I'm a little doubtful that the same trick will work twice."`
`"Madam shares your concerns.`
` Because of that, it was decided that this year, he will not leave the study even once."`
`"In other words, we'll make it seem like he's been shut away in his study the whole time...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` And the only ones allowed to enter the study...`
`are the three of us, the servants permitted to wear the One-Winged Eagle."`
`"......Which means the three of us will have to perpetuate the lie about the Master..."`
`"Correct.`
` ...The relatives will probably question you about the Master's health and mood.`
` Make sure you answer without hesitation, and see to it that nothing is seen as suspicious."`
`"...Y-Yes.`
` I understand."`
`"I'm sure you'll screw up right away, Nee-san.`
` Maybe it's better to say you have a cold or something so you can skip that day."`
`"Th-That's mean..."`
`Kanon wasn't just making fun of her.`
`...He only wanted to release Shannon from the burden of working on this most serious of days.`
`"Genji-sama,`
` is it really necessary for Shannon to be on duty?`
` We can manage things well enough without her."`
`"That I cannot do.`
` Madam gave strict orders that the three of us be scheduled to work on that day."`
`"Yes...`
` I am prepared to perform my duties successfully."`
`"Don't screw up."`
`"I won't."`
`Shannon grew sullen, and Kanon shrugged.`
`Then Genji told them that they weren't taking this seriously enough.`
`Shannon indignated herself, and Kanon shrugged.`
`"...Shannon. Kanon.`
` ...The Master we serve has already passed away.`
` However, until he has truly passed on, we will continue to serve.`
` ...That study is not empty.`
` The Master is still there, hard at work on his usual research.`
` Make sure you take that to heart."`
`""Yes, Genji-sama.""`
`"Father has already passed away...?!`
` That's insane...!"`
`"Settle down...`
` It's only a possibility.`
` It's well known that Takeda Shingen said in his will that his death was to be kept secret for three years.`
` Know about that?"`
`"...Is that how it went?`
` My Japanese history isn't so great."`
`"At the time, Takeda was in the middle of a war with Oda and Tokugawa.`
` If people learned about his death at a time like that, it'd probably have had a bad impact on the war.`
` 'Cause of that, he left a will sayin' that his death should be kept hidden for three years.`
` ...Hideyoshi did the same thing, right?`
` He totally suppressed information about the death of his master, Oda Nobunaga, so that the enemy wouldn't find out,`
` quickly made peace with Mouri, and defeated Akechi in the Battle of Yamazaki."`
`"On the other hand, Shibata Katsuie failed at this.`
` The enemy, Uesugi, learned of Nobuyuki's death, so Shibata had to deal with an unexpected counterattack and got slowed down.`
` That's why, later on, he suffered a great loss against Hideyoshi in the fight for the succession."`
`Hideyoshi, who had a strong fascination with the commanders of the Sengoku period, would always show off his knowledge when he got the chance.`
`Wincing slightly, Eva made him get back to his point.`
`"...So basically, ...the whole time since last year's family conference,`
` I've felt as though somethin' was strange."`
`"You mean the time when Rudolf and I were talking about the inheritance and Father overheard us from the hall-"`
`"That's just it.`
` ...Natsuhi-san and the servants kept saying Father was here or there and that he seemed to be in a bad mood, `
`but not a single one of us relatives saw Father, right?"`
`"If what you're thinking is right, `
`...what does that mean?!`
` Does it mean Nii-san's trying to keep all of the inheritance for himself?!"`
`"Of course, hidin' someone's death is a very dangerous thing to do,`
` and all things considered, I'm not sure Krauss-san would be willin' to do it just to have the inheritance to himself.`
` But it is possible."`
`"...W-Well, it's true that Nii-san has always been greedy.`
` He always used to take things that were meant for all of the siblings, keeping them all for himself..."`
`"Krauss-san is supposed to be the richest of the siblings.`
` Krauss-san schemin' to keep the inheritance all to himself to the point of acceptin' the risk of hidin' Father's death...`
`sounds a tad unbelievable to me.`
` Even so, last year's family conference was so strange, I can't help but wonder."`
`".................."`
`Eva and the others were painfully aware of how reckless it would be to try and see Kinzo when he was in a bad mood.`
`So, during last year's family conference, once they heard about Kinzo getting into a terrible mood,`
` they never made an attempt to contact him.`
`That was why, to this very day, they hadn't found it suspicious that Kinzo had never appeared...`
`"...It certainly is worth suspecting, `
`but I wonder if Nii-san really would do something as appalling as hiding Father's death...`
` ...For all his pride, that man has a coward's side to him.`
` Would he really make such a once-in-a-lifetime bet...?"`
`"Either way, it'd probably be a good idea to make sure we get a chance to meet with Father durin' this year's conference."`
`"...The rumors are really bad.`
` Sounds like Aniki's business is failing even worse than we'd imagined.`
` Like he's taken massive losses, and he's giving it all he's got just to try and cover it up."`
`"That'll make it very difficult to borrow money from him."`
`"Yeah, I could cry."`
`"......Wouldn't being in financial stress also weaken Krauss-san's position in certain ways?"`
`"Weaken his position?`
` ...Well, investors tend to have a keen eye.`
` If they hear that he's actually low on funds, they won't wanna have anything to do with him."`
`"I guess trust is the most important part of that business.`
`............"`
` Kyrie smiled thinly.`
` Rudolf was taken aback by that smile...`
`He'd figured that his plan, which involved raising money to get him out of his current mess by borrowing from the affluent Krauss,`
` would all come to nothing now that they knew Krauss himself was in financial trouble...`
`"...Confidence in Krauss-san's abilities might be a requirement for his own businesses in the future,`
` but it isn't necessary for our future."`
`"Are you suggesting that I blackmail him?"`
`"I wouldn't want to, if it were me.`
` For one blood sibling to take another one down is no laughing matter.`
` *giggle*giggle*."`
`Rudolf felt a shiver go up his spine at Kyrie's cold smile...`
`At times, Kyrie was able to throw away all compassion and think in an extremely ruthless manner.`
`Whenever he saw that, Rudolf knew he'd never like to have her as his enemy...`
`"I'd rather not threaten Onii-san, if we had any other way to get money."`
`"...If there were another way, we wouldn't be worrying."`
`"Don't you think it's a bit pathetic to waste time worrying about a problem...when you have no other options?"`
`".................."`
`Rudolf stopped talking, folded his arms, and lowered his gaze.`
`He still felt some of the terror he'd experienced thanks to Krauss's violence when they were young.`
`...And now, that same Krauss was the one he needed to threaten.`
`Rudolf would also be fighting against his childhood trauma.`
`So to give her husband a little push, Kyrie smiled reassuringly,`
` ...and perhaps coldly.`
`"I've never been a fan of doing work based on trust.`
` It takes hard work to build up trust, but only an instant to lose it. There's no less profitable investment."`
`"Y-You're right.`
` ...All the trust in the world isn't worth a good banknote."`
`"Even though Krauss-san has been taking on massive losses,`
` he ought to be capable of gathering enough money to buy us some time.`
` Of course, he'd probably be forced to cash in all the trust he's built up so far."`
`"......This...is gonna get ugly..."`
`"We'll have to prepare sufficiently.`
` We haven't been given any time or room for failure.`
` Isn't that right?"`
`"Among my Kyoto friends, I know a few who are talented at this sort of investigation.`
` I'd rather not be indebted to people like that, ...but do you want to try meeting them?`
` You can't expect people like that to offer you receipts, but I'm sure they'll dig up something that makes them worth the investment."`
`"Yes.`
` Maria is doing well too.`
` ......That's none of your business.`
` Thank you.`
` ......Huh?`
` Well, I'll have to look at my schedule..."`
`Rosa was talking to Rudolf over the phone.`
`Rosa rarely received calls from her older siblings, so she braced herself for something serious.`
`"Well, truth is...`
`I want to have a little talk about the next family conference, without Aniki."`
`"......Between you, me, and Eva nee-san?`
` ...Sounds like a headache."`
`"I can't go into details over the phone,`
` but I think you'll find it's worth listening to."`
`"Something good?"`
`"Of course.`
` Aneki's all for it."`
`"Nee-san is...?"`
`"All we want is your approval. We aren't gonna ask you for money or anything like that.`
` The most important thing is that the three of us stick together.`
` Got it?"`
`Rosa let out a sigh.`
`...She did so because, in the past, when Rudolf and Eva got into a fight with Krauss, they always used to talk to her like this right before dragging her into it...`
`"First, tell me.`
` I stand to gain something too, yes?"`
`"Yep.`
` The three of us'll each grab 200 million out of this.`
` If all goes well, we might be able to squeeze out more.`
` That should be enough to handle your debt, right?"`
`".........`
`And when can we expect to grab this by?"`
`"Of course, it'll be within a year.`
` I need it.`
` Aneki needs it.`
` And you need it too, Rosa.`
` All three of our problems will be settled."`
`"So, the chances of success are good enough that Nee-san's agreed to it?"`
`"Now do you wanna hear?`
` I know it's a bit sudden, but let's meet next Sunday, 19:00, at that coffee shop you like in Ginza.`
` That's the only time Aneki's schedule and mine match.`
` Any problems?"`
`"If we're talking 200 million, I'll have no choice but to listen.`
` ...Then let's meet at 7:00 PM next Sunday at Leopold's."`
`"And Maria-chan.`
` You can bring her too if you want."`
`"Don't talk about money in front of that child!"`
`She set the receiver down with a *clunk*, a little violently.`
`Apparently, either Eva or Rudolf had gotten ahold of one of Krauss's weak points.`
`They would probably threaten him with that at the next family conference and force him to pay up.`
`Even before hearing the details, she knew full well that it would be nothing good.`
`But even so, ...this might be her once-in-a-lifetime chance to pay back her large debts.`
`Rosa took a notebook out of her handbag...`
`and started to mark the day she'd be meeting with Rudolf and Eva.`
` ...Then, she frowned and smacked herself hard in the forehead.`
`Because written there was 'DZL with Maria', ...something she had planned to do with her daughter.`
`Maria was in her room, playing around excitedly with Sakutarou and the others.`
`That was because she was going to go to that recently-built amusement park, Delzney Land,`
` the following Sunday...`
`Looking at the clock, Rosa saw that it was just past 9:00 at night.`
` Maria was breaking the lights out rule.`
`After covering her face and agonizing for a while,`
` ...Rosa stood up and stomped over to Maria's room.`
`The room would probably be a mess as well.`
` ...At least tonight, that was convenient.`
`As she stood outside the door to Maria's room, listening to the happy laughter seeping through,`
` Rosa's face twisted in anguish once again, and she looked at the floor.`
`Then, when she raised her head again,`
` her brow was furrowed, and her face had become an ugly expression of anger...`
`The weather wasn't that great.`
`According to the weekend forecast, a certain tropical cyclone would likely grow into a large typhoon.`
`If unhappy premonitions tend to be right...`
`...This year's family conference will probably take place in absolutely horrible weather.`
`No, I wish a typhoon large enough to stop all boat travel would seal Rokkenjima away forever.`
`If that happened, I'd be able to hide Kinzo's death as long as I wanted...`
`"If only...the typhoon would keep them at bay forever."`
`Natsuhi let out a deep sigh.`
` ...Just doing that made her headache throb...`
`As the day of the family conference approached, the intensity of her headache just kept on increasing.`
`At that time, the phone rang.`
`Natsuhi turned the TV off and picked up the receiver...`
`"...Hello?"`
`"I apologize for calling during your rest.`
` It is Genji."`
`"Is something the matter...?"`
`"There is a phone call for you from the external line.`
` ...However, they will not state their name."`
`"They aren't saying their name...?"`
`"Yes.`
` The person in question said you would know when you spoke with them...`
` What should be done?`
` It might be a prank."`
`"What did they sound like?"`
`"I believe it was a young man.`
` Any idea who it might be...?"`
`"A young...man?"`
`Natsuhi didn't have a clue who that might be.`
`In the first place, there was no one amongst her acquaintances who would do something as rude as refusing to state their name.`
`And on top of that, ...a young...man...?`
`As a wife, she must avoid any contact that might be considered suspicious with anyone other than her husband, much less a young man.`
`As soon as she thought this, the phone call suddenly seemed like something dirty.`
`But despite that, she also wanted to know what they wanted to tell her.`
`...Could it be some kind of trouble related to Krauss's business?`
`What if there was some particular reason they needed to talk to Krauss's wife instead of Krauss directly...?`
`".................."`
`No matter what it is, it's my duty as a wife to listen and report to Krauss.`
`...If it's some bizarre threat, I just have to firmly refuse and inform Krauss that I received such a phone call.`
`If it's something offensive, I just have to tell Genji to never send me anonymous calls again.`
`As Natsuhi thought this, just as Genji was suggesting that he hang up on the man as though that's what she'd naturally choose, she told him to connect her to this person.`
` She then set the receiver down.`
`After a short while, the phone rang again...`
`".........Hello?"`
`This wasn't the internal line.`
` It was the external phone line, which Genji had redirected to her.`
`So it should already have been connected directly with the mysterious man.`
`However, the person on the other end didn't respond.`
`...Not liking this at all, Natsuhi spoke one more time, sounding displeased.`
`"Hello?`
` Who is this?`
` Tell me your name...!"`
`".................."`
`She heard something that sounded like a sigh.`
`She gulped reflexively.`
`After remaining silent for a little longer, the man finally answered...`
`"......It's been a long time, huh?"`
`That was the first time the man had spoken.`
`"......Just how long has it been?`
` ...How many years?"`
`"What are you talking about?`
` Who are you...?!"`
`The voice certainly did sound like a young man's.`
`But it's hard to learn much about someone just by their voice over the phone...`
`It sounded like a young man, but it might actually be a middle school-aged boy,`
` ...or a man in his prime who still had a youngish voice.`
`No, wait, it might be too soon to be sure this is even a male.`
`However, one thing was certain...`
` Natsuhi could think of no one who would speak to her in an overly familiar manner like this...`
`"...It'd be easy for me to tell you my name.`
` ...But that would make me very sad."`
`"I don't know what you're talking about.`
` Who are you?`
` And what business do you have with me?!`
` If you can't tell me that, I'm not interested!`
` I'm hanging up...!"`
`"What I want...is for you to remember."`
`"And what is it that you're telling me to remember?`
` I don't know you, so I have nothing to remember!"`
`"......Please do not say that.`
` I ~ib~am~ib~ your child, am I not?"`
`"What did you say...?!`
` Wh-What are you talking about?!"`
`"Do not say things that will make me so sad,`
` ...Mother."`
`That unsettling word thrust itself mercilessly into the depths of Natsuhi's heart and started churning it about...`
`In her entire life, Natsuhi had never been told something so unsettling.`
`In her bewilderment, Natsuhi felt her heart beat so loudly that it felt like it would explode.`
`"I...I-I have no idea what you're talking about!`
` I don't know what you're planning, but I'm hanging up...!!"`
`"...I came back for revenge.`
` ...Revenge for your crime of 19 years ago."`
`Natsuhi's mind went blank...`
`And from beyond the wind howling outside the window, she most certainly heard the roar of the sea from that day...`
`"......So, `
`you actually do remember, do you not...?"`
`"I-I told you I don't know what you're talking about!!`
` N-N-Never call here again!"`
`"I have not forgotten how you treated me 19 years ago...`
` ...To curse you, I still call you Mother despite that...`
`no, because of that.`
` ...The family conference will be here very soon, right?`
` ...I am your son, Mother.`
` I will come on the day of the conference.`
` ...After 19 years.`
` ...So that I can have my revenge on you."`
`*click*!!`
`Breathing so hard her shoulders heaved, Natsuhi slammed the receiver down and hung up...`
`Then she hit the phone violently, knocking the receiver off.`
`...So that no more calls would come through it...`
`I can hear the roar of the sea...`
`That voice I hear from beyond the howling wind is certainly...`
`aaah, `
`even if I cover my ears, even if I cover my ears, ......`
`...the headache won't......`
`Completely pale, ...Natsuhi kept shivering as though cold...`
`"......Lambda, are you there?"`
`"Yes, I'm here.`
` I'm anywhere you want me to be, Bern."`
`"...Then crawl into the cupboard under the kitchen floor.`
` Or in a jar of rice-bran paste, if you like."`
`"Ooh, you're gonna dip me in bean paste and bite into me?`
` But then I'd rather you'd dip me in honey.`
` In return, I'll cook you in sugar water."`
`"...At least make it sweet soy sauce with sweet sake."`
`"So what's up?`
` You gonna make me repeat something?"`
`"......That's right.`
` Is Natsuhi's phone conversation here real?"`
`Lambdadelta grinned unpleasantly, as though sizing Bernkastel up.`
`She was probably trying to tease Bern for making that demand.`
`"......You refuse to repeat it?"`
`"Well now...`
` Should I refuse, or should I respond...`
` As the Game Master, that's up to me to decide, and I get to make that decision any time I want."`
`"......Unless I state it in blue, you aren't obligated to respond."`
`"That's it!`
` *giggle*giggle*`
` For now, you're stuck wondering about Natsuhi's secret of 19 years ago, okay?!`
` Make sure you're sitting on the edge of your seat!`
` *giggle*giggle*."`
`Of course, this fishy telephone call happened before October 4th, 1986.`
`This is still before the start time of the game.`
`So, there's basically no need to question whether it's true or false.`
`"......Since you, the Game Master, went out of your way to show me this, I'll take it as a preparatory move for something else.`
` ...It might be a trick, but I'll at least keep this move of yours in my memory."`
`"Ehheheheheheheheheheheheheheh......`
` So, you'll leave without turning the card over.`
` Ouch, wh-what?!"`
`".........<Direct Attack>."`
`After suddenly being conked on the head, Lambdadelta was bewildered.`
`But perhaps this incomprehensible exchange was funny to her, ...because she quickly went back to giggling.`
`"...Are you done preparing the game board now?"`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` Now I'll finally move on to the game.`
` On to October 4th, 1986...!"`
`"......I wonder what number October 4th, 1986 this is.`
` ...The Endless Witch, huh?`
` ...Beatrice.`
` ...She truly is a frightening child."`
`"Any moves from your side yet, Bern?"`
`"......No.`
` If you've refused to repeat what I asked, then I'm done."`
`"<Turn end>, right?`
` <Untap, upkeep, draw>!!`
` Come!!`
` October 4th, 1986!!!"`
`"This rose garden really is a masterpiece.`
` It's gotten even more awesome than it was six years ago.`
` You're so lucky to have this as your yard!"`
`"Are you kidding?`
` For me, it just makes it a longer walk to the harbor, and that's a real pain."`
`"Hahaha.`
` That's a pretty luxurious worry."`
`"Uu-!`
` Getting to say hi to the roses every morning must be awesome!`
` You must get late after saying hi to so many roses...!"`
`"Shame about Ange though.`
` I hear her stomach gets upset easily, right?"`
`"Apparently.`
` It's probably her intestines that are weak.`
` She's almost always got the runs."`
`"Uu-.`
` You shouldn't say something like that about a lady..."`
`"Ihihihihi, sorry about that.`
` Yeah, I forgot, nothing comes out a girl's butt but marshmallows, right?`
` So, Ange got sick, and the marshmallows turned into syrup."`
`"Okay, that's really-"`
`"-way over the line."`
`George and Jessica slammed a knee and a fist right into either side of Battler's gut.`
`*whack*, `
`*smack*thud*.`
`......The *smack*thud* was probably the sound made when his knees hit the ground as he fell over.`
`Normally, Battler possessed the good sense you'd expect of an 18 year-old man.`
`However, it seemed that this reunion had brought him back to the mental age he'd been six years ago.`
`And bit by bit, `
`Jessica and George realized they were also returning to the way they'd been back then...`
`Natsuhi gazed at this (charming?) chat through an open window in the hall.`
`"......Madam,`
` Krauss-sama is searching for you."`
`"I'll go in just a bit.`
` ...It isn't even lunchtime yet, ...and I'm already tired."`
`Just a few moments ago, the sparks had already started flying between them and Eva's group.`
`The others had pounded on Krauss and Natsuhi over and over to get Kinzo out of his study...`
`Apparently, they hadn't been fully tricked at last year's family conference after all...`
`"......There are...no problems with Father, right...?"`
`"Correct.`
` ...Leave it to me.`
` Shannon and Kanon are also fully prepared to handle today's arrangements."`
`"...Kumasawa is a good liar, so I'm not worried about her, ...but I am a little concerned about Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...I get the feeling he's bad at hiding things."`
`"......Leave that to me.`
` I intend to support Doctor Nanjo from nearby as much as possible."`
`"It's so reassuring to have you there.`
` ......It truly does help a lot.`
` ...Without your strength, we wouldn't be able to succeed."`
`"...I am honored by your words."`
`"Don't worry.`
` The closed room barrier on the study is perfect.`
` As long as the barrier remains unbroken, no one will be able to expose Kinzo's secret."`
`"......Yes, I understand.`
` Still, you heard that conversation in the parlor just now, didn't you?"`
`"...Indeed.`
` It seems that some considerable suspicions were aroused last year.`
` The terrible toxin has accumulated and is being spread all around."`
`"...It seems this year's conference really will be crucial."`
`"We might be able to overcome this year somehow, ...but there is such a thing as pushing our luck.`
` It's probably best to assume that next year won't be manageable."`
`"......With this much of the magic-resisting toxin filling up the place,`
` it will probably be difficult to preserve Lord Goldsmith's magic for yet another family conference."`
`"...W-Who are you?"`
`"Oh,`
` no need to be surprised.`
` This man serves as my head furniture."`
`"Greetings, Madam Natsuhi.`
` My name is Ronove.`
` It is a pleasure to meet you..."`
`"This man's reliable.`
` He's also helping to protect the closed room barrier."`
`"...Is that so?`
` I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi.`
` I thank you for your cooperation."`
`"Of course, Madam.`
` ...I will be aiding you from the magic world.`
` Please rely on me."`
`"......In that case, I guess I'll introduce myself next.`
` <Hi>, Riiche.`
` Long time no see..."`
`"Ah, Gaap!!`
` I'm glad to see you're here as well!"`
`"...Well, I only came to have some fun.`
` ...If you need an extra hand, let me know.`
` Nice to meet you, Madam.`
` ...This is the first time I've said hello, but I'm always right by anyone's side."`
`"Pu ku ku.`
` Gaap here is quite the prankster...`
` Remember that headache medicine you dropped on the floor of your room and lost as you were getting dressed?`
` Gaap was the one behind that."`
`"Whenever you set something small down somewhere but can't find it later, it's always a good idea to suspect that it's one of her pranks.`
` ...Long ago, she used to tease me all the time!"`
`"I-Is that so?`
` ...In any event, this is the Ushiromiya mansion.`
` As long as you are here, you will obey us.`
` You understand, correct?"`
`"Of course.`
` We understand.`
` ...Think of me as a Genji of the magic world, and give me orders whenever you wish."`
`"......And even I know how a guest is supposed to act.`
` ...I won't let the landlord lose face."`
`"You can count on Ronove and Gaap.`
` However, the magic world and the Human world are two different sides of the same coin."`
`"I understand.`
` ...Of course, I will do all I can in the Human world.`
` Let's work together and protect Father's secret."`
`"Indeed."`
`"...This happens every time.`
` Looks like we won't get anywhere until the next day."`
`"Hmm?`
` Well, sure. October 4th is like a prep turn for me.`
` If you don't feel like doing anything, why don't you just sit around until October 5th?`
` I'll call you after the first six die.`
` *giggle*giggle*...!"`
`...Of course, that was an incredibly irritating way to put it.`
`The fight won't start until the crime occurs.`
`However, waiting for the crimes to start would mean turning a blind eye towards the murders of the first twilight.`
`In other words, it would be the same as being content with the fact that six people would die...`
`".........Did you know?`
` They say that in chess, the player who moves first is twice as likely to win."`
`"Although that can change as the tactics of the match progress.`
` Don't they say the second player has a much better chance at a draw?"`
`"...Even I know the phrase 'the first to strike wins'.`
` ......So, what are you trying to say?"`
`"Pff, *giggle*giggle*!`
` This is why you're so incompetent."`
`"...Seriously.`
` ...Are you listening, Battler?`
` There do exist puzzles that can be solved even on October 4th.`
` ...Know which one I mean?"`
`"You don't mean...`
` ......No, but..."`
`"Heheheheheheh!`
` ...Well, watch and see, Battler the incompetent!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*..."`
`I have a general idea what these witches are talking about.`
`...I've tried solving it several times myself in the past, but I still haven't found anything resembling an answer.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`On the contrary, I still can't even understand ~ib~why that puzzle exists~ib~.`
`......That's right.`
` ...The reason it exists.`
`Why did Beato...`
`...prepare a puzzle like this in the first place...?`
`We all discussed it together from time to time in past games.`
`However, I've started to avoid thinking about it...`
`under the assumption that there's no point in trying to solve a riddle that can't be solved.`
`...This time, I should change my viewpoint.`
`I shouldn't just focus on the surface-level stuff...`
`like the truth of the riddle and how to solve it.`
`...What's more important is why that riddle was set up in the first place and displayed for us to see.`
`That's what I should be thinking about.`
`And the one proposing that riddle...is Beatrice.`
`Even if I can't solve it, I should be able to try and figure out what Beato was thinking when she showed it to us.`
`......Okay, ...this time, I'm spinning the chessboard around...`
`The witches keep calling me incompetent.`
`Let them laugh.`
` ...They aren't my enemies.`
`...I'm continuing our match,`
` Beato...`
`"...Oh.`
` Looks like it's finally started rainin'."`
`"Dang...`
` Wish the only downpour was the one inside my heart."`
`The people in the parlor noticed the raindrops that were starting to drip down the window.`
`"Now we have nowhere to run until the family conference ends."`
`"...The same thing goes for Nii-san.`
` ...I won't let them escape, you can be sure of that...`
` The cards we're holding aren't bad.`
` Nii-san's just bluffing.`
` ...I'll make certain he surrenders..."`
`"Well, there's more to a deal than making your opponent lose.`
` ...You've gotta get a pitfall ready, `
`praise them a bit, and convince 'em to stand on it of their own accord."`
`"...Hideyoshi-san's right.`
` We pressed them a bit too hard last time, Eva nee-san."`
`"Th-That was perfectly reasonable, considering it's Nii-san we're dealing with."`
`"Heh, looks like Rosa's fallen asleep."`
`"She was complainin' about how early she woke up this morning.`
` Well, guess there's nothin' wrong with taking a nap."`
`"There's a chance we might be forced to spend all night on this.`
` Getting a nap in now is probably a smart idea."`
`Out of consideration for Rosa, who'd fallen asleep on a sofa, the others quietly left the parlor.`
`Unaware of this, Rosa slept.`
`After telling Maria to just stay where she was after that tantrum over not being able to find her rose,`
` Rosa slept, unaware that the rain had started to fall...`
`The rain poured down as though it had been saving up for this moment.`
`Of course, Maria noticed that the rain had started falling and was soaking her to the bone.`
`However, that just made her even more stubborn.`
`Unable to find the poor, slightly unhealthy rose that she herself had marked,`
` ...she just couldn't stand having that search be interrupted by something like the rain.`
`So the more the rain fell on Maria, the more stubborn she grew...`
`as she wandered through the rose beds...`
`And as she did, ......from behind Maria's back......came a *patter*, *patter*.`
` ...The sound of approaching footsteps.`
`Then, the footsteps landed in a puddle, making a small splashing sound, and Maria finally heard.`
`However, even the slight distraction of that sound irritated her, and Maria ignored it.`
`".........Hello."`
`"......!"`
`Maria turned around, bewildered.`
`...After all, that voice...`
`was one she didn't recognize at all.`
`On this sealed-off Rokkenjima, ...that voice belonged to no person she knew...`
`"Krauss-sama, Madam.`
` ...I was looking for you.`
` Something important has come up."`
`Krauss and Natsuhi had been privately discussing what should be done next in a deserted corridor on the third floor.`
`Genji had searched everywhere for them.`
`"What is it?`
` It must be something more urgent than a few sheets getting soaked in the rain."`
`"What is it?`
` Has some sort of blunder been made?"`
`"...A short while ago, someone arrived at the mansion, ...claiming to have drifted here after an accident at sea."`
`Krauss and Natsuhi couldn't help but go wide-eyed and stare at each other.`
`This was the first time they'd ever heard of someone coming to this island uninvited.`
`"Someone drifted here...?`
` Is that true?`
` The poor thing.`
` ...Treat this person politely, like a guest.`
` What are they doing now?"`
`"Doctor Nanjo is performing an examination.`
` ...He hasn't finished yet, but from what I could tell by looking, the drifter seemed tired but uninjured."`
`"Thank goodness.`
` Natsuhi and I are having an important conversation right now.`
` When it's over, we will go to check on this person.`
` Please tell this drifter that we want them to feel at home."`
`"Certainly..."`
`When Genji bowed deeply and started to leave, Natsuhi called him to a stop.`
`Genji stopped walking, and Natsuhi jogged up to him...`
`"......Genji,`
` ...is this drifter......a man?"`
`"No.`
` ...She is a young woman, about the same age as Milady."`
`"...A woman...?`
` ......I see.`
` Very well. Back to your work."`
`The parlor of the mansion was bustling.`
`The adults gathered, worrying about the health of this sudden guest...`
`"Well, if she was able to walk all the way to the rose garden by herself, her life probably isn't in danger."`
`"...It always helps to be prepared.`
` It's probably all thanks to the life jacket.`
` Without that, she might've drowned."`
`"What kind of girl was she?`
` Older or younger than George? Or Jessica?"`
`"She was younger than Jessica.`
` She wore a life jacket and swimsuit.`
` It looked like she was all tired out...!"`
`"If she washed up somewhere near the harbor, that must've been a rare bit of luck amid disaster.`
` It would've been terrible if she'd landed on the opposite side of the island..."`
`"...Still, you have to feel sorry for her.`
` With this weather, the boats won't be coming.`
` I imagine she'll also be stuck on this island all day tomorrow."`
`At that moment, the door clunked open and everyone looked in that direction.`
`"Would anyone like some tea?"`
`It was Gohda and Kanon, `
`with the latter pushing a serving cart laden with a tea set.`
`Gohda understood well that doing a little extra at times like this would earn him points.`
`The relatives, hungry for information, crowded around Gohda...`
`He ordered Kanon to serve the tea and became the sole object of the relatives' attention.`
`"Gohda-san, how's that kid doing?`
` Does it look like she's okay...?"`
`"W-Well, I don't know about that.`
` But there is no need to worry...!`
` Doctor Nanjo is giving his full attention to taking care of her, and Kumasawa and Shannon are with him.`
` Please, have no fears.`
` Why not relax with some black tea for now...?`
` Come, Kanon-san.`
` Quickly, quickly, serve it, serve it."`
`"............*grumble*..."`
`Kanon knew this tea was just Gohda's way of earning points,`
` so he lined the cups up with a slightly sullen air.`
`"Uu-.`
` I'll help too."`
`"...I-It's okay.`
` You can just wait there, Maria-sama."`
`"Uu-!`
` I wanna serve tea too!"`
`"Didn't you talk with Doctor Nanjo?`
` Did he say anything?"`
`"Yes. When I met him a short while ago, he said that there weren't any serious external wounds...`
` From what I could tell at a glance..."`
`And, just as Gohda had successfully captured the gazes of all present and was about to start talking knowledgeably on the subject, Nanjo returned.`
`Of course, Nanjo instantly became the center of attention.`
`...Kanon turned his back on Gohda, who seemed downhearted.`
`"Doctor Nanjo...!`
` How is her condition...?!`
` Does it look like she'll be okay?"`
`"Not to worry, everyone...`
` She is fine.`
` She had no injuries at all.`
` She seems to be quite worn out, but there shouldn't be anything to worry about tonight, as long as she doesn't develop a fever."`
`"That's good to hear.`
` ...We're lucky enough to have a doctor, but this is no hospital."`
`Everyone was relieved to hear that the girl was in good health...`
`When Nanjo gave the more detailed results of his examination, concluding by saying that she was young and should therefore be fine,`
` everyone who no longer fell under this description nodded in assent.`
`"...Uu-.`
` Boats really are scary.`
` Faaall, faaall.`
` Battler was right..."`
`"Maria-chan, let's not tell Battler-kun about this."`
`"Oh, Madam! Krauss-sama!"`
`Gohda, who had lost his nerve and was handing out cups, called out in an excessively loud voice.`
`Apparently, he was that desperate to get everyone's attention.`
`"...How is the guest?"`
`"Yes sir!`
` Her condition is not serious."`
`"I see, that's great.`
` Where is she now...?"`
`"I believe Kumasawa-san and Shannon-san were guiding her to the bath.`
` They said they would get her some clothes afterwards."`
`"In that case, they'll probably arrive here soon.`
` ...Everyone,`
` this may be the day of the family conference, but we have a guest brought here by an unfortunate accident.`
` She wasn't invited, but I want you all to welcome her."`
`"Who could disagree with that?`
` I'm all for it."`
`"Same here.`
` Didn't Mom always tell us to be nice to girls?"`
`"Maybe, but you didn't need to make that your life's motto."`
`"...It's probably best if we call George and the rest over here too.`
` Let's all greet her together."`
`"But...`
`wouldn't that just make her more uncomfortable...?"`
`Eva stood up and made a phone call to the guesthouse.`
`At that moment, they heard the sound of a knock, followed by Genji's voice.`
`"...It is Genji.`
` The guest has arrived..."`
`At those words, everyone fell silent, and the people who had been sitting stood up straight.`
`Genji came in first, opening the door slowly, `
`...then moved off to the side, bowing deeply and urging the guest forwards.`
`The guest had Shannon and Kumasawa following by her side,`
` ...and even after seeing the large number of relatives waiting for her in the parlor, she didn't seem overawed in the slightest.`
`Just this single point...`
`showed that this girl possessed a dignity appropriate for a guest invited in by the Ushiromiya family...`
`"...Furudo-sama, allow me to introduce you.`
` This is the representative of the Ushiromiya Family Head, Ushiromiya Krauss."`
`"Welcome to Rokkenjima.`
` Though you arrived due to an accident, you are a guest of the family.`
` We welcome you.`
` Please, make yourself at home and relax however you please."`
`"......Thank you very much.`
` ...Allow me to introduce myself.`
` ...I am called Furudo Erika (坤戸ヱリカ).`
` My deepest apologies for disturbing you members of the Ushiromiya family like this.`
` ...I'm truly grateful for the warm welcome I've received despite my status as an uninvited guest."`
`...This was greeted by an impressed sigh arising equally from all corners of the room.`
`The clothes she had been lent were probably Jessica's formal wear from long ago,`
` ...but the composure of her introduction didn't shame those clothes in the slightest...`
`The girl's name was Furudo Erika.`
`She looked slightly younger than Battler and Jessica,`
` but her composure and mannerisms were beyond what anyone would have expected from a high-schooler, almost as though she was a well-to-do family's daughter...`
`"Wait a sec.`
` ...Who the heck is this?"`
`".........With an incompetent like you as the main character piece, the game wouldn't go anywhere.`
` That's why I've placed myself there as a piece..."`
`"Well, it's just a bit of a bonus.`
` Even in a closed circle, it'd get boring to see the same crew every single time, right?"`
`"Quit messing around.`
` This piece doesn't exist on Beato's game board.`
` Beato and I won't acknowledge it...!"`
`"This is Beato's game board, right?`
` If Beato refuses, then I'll consider it.`
` What do ya say, Beato?"`
`"....................."`
`Beato was unable to answer.`
`...Lambdadelta grinned triumphantly.`
`"...Wanna try complaining about the rules and stepping down from the game?`
` Isn't that a favorite move of you mystery people?`
` If there's even a tiny element that goes against your expectations, you throw a tantrum and totally stop thinking."`
`"......Ugh..."`
`"......Don't worry.`
` I'll make a detective proclamation regarding this piece."`
`"A detective proclamation...?"`
`"#ff0000I proclaim that Furudo Erika is the detective.#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000The detective isn't a culprit.#ffffff`
` #ff0000No proof is needed to show this.#ffffff`
` ...In short, there is absolutely no need to suspect this girl.`
` Even if she appears as a Human piece from now on, you can build theories the same as you always did, get it...?"`
`"...That's Knox's 7th, right?`
` 'It is forbidden for the detective to be the culprit'.`
` There was an exception clause in the original, but for this game '`
`#ff0000the detective isn't a culprit#ffffff' has been proclaimed in red, so you don't need to consider the exception.`
` I hate word games, so I'll say this in red too.`
` #ff0000Furudo Erika is not the culprit.#ffffff"`
`"Repeat it.`
` ...'Furudo Erika had no influence on any of Beato's games before now'."`
`"Sure, no prob.`
` #ff0000Furudo Erika had no influence on any of Beato's games before now.#ffffff`
` She's nothing more than an extra character who appears for the first time this round.`
` #ff0000She does not exist in the worlds before this one, nor does she influence them.#ffffff"`
`"So, what does that do to the number of people on this island right now?"`
`"Of course, it's plus 1 from the previous number.`
` But don't worry.`
` #ff0000Furudo Erika only increases it by one person.#ffffff`
` #ff0000Besides her, the number of people on this island is exactly the same as it was in the previous games.#ffffff"`
`At that time, the sound of people dashing down a corridor could be heard.`
`It was Battler, George, and Jessica, who had come from the guesthouse after being called here by Eva.`
`They immediately spotted a guest they didn't recognize, and their eyes went wide.`
`"...Whoa...`
` ...Wh-Who are you......?"`
`"Uu-.`
` A guest.`
` She came by faaall faaalling."`
`"Huh?`
` Fall, fall...??"`
`"...Genji-san,`
` who is this person...?"`
`"This is a guest, Furudo Erika-sama.`
` ...Furudo-sama,`
` this is the daughter of the family, Jessica-sama, along with her cousins George-sama and Battler-sama."`
`"Umm, oh, ...n-nice to meet you.`
` I'm Ushiromiya Jessica..."`
`"......Hello.`
` My name is Furudo Erika.`
` I am very pleased to meet you..."`
`Though Battler, George, and Jessica didn't have a clue what was going on and were utterly bewildered, they each introduced themselves...`
`"......Isn't that convenient.`
` This way, the number of people is clear.`
` The people in the guesthouse have joined up with the rest, and now, all of the pieces except for Kinzo--all of the Humans--have gathered in the parlor."`
`"Looks like it.`
` #ff0000In other words, the number of people in this parlor now is equal to the total number of people on this island.#ffffff"`
`"There were supposedly 18 people on the island, ...but since Grandfather's actually dead, that became 17.`
` ...And now one piece of Bernkastel's has been added..."`
`The number of humans on this island has returned to 18...`
`'I' glanced around at the humans in the parlor.`
`The guest, Furudo Erika.`
` And behind her, Kumasawa-san and Shannon-chan.`
` Off to the side was Genji-san.`
`Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi were welcoming the guest.`
`Gohda-san immediately started showing off,`
` and Kanon-kun was being unsociable, wearing his usual blank expression.`
`There was Dad and Kyrie-san.`
` Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi.`
` Aunt Rosa and Maria.`
` And, Doctor Nanjo.`
`Then, on either side of me...`
`were George-aniki `
`and Jessica...`
`This is everyone. The true number of people on the island at the moment...`
`"Well, all of us are Ushiromiyas.`
` Please don't feel obligated to call us by our family name.`
` I'm George."`
`"And I'm Battler.`
` Nice to meet you!"`
`"...Thank you very much, George-san, Battler-san.`
` ...I'd be pleased if you would call me Erika."`
`"Nice to meet you, Erika-san...!"`
`It was decided that Erika would be welcomed like a guest `
`and allowed to borrow the bedroom next to the cousin room on the second floor of the guesthouse.`
`In front of all the relatives, she had seemed dignified and a bit stiff.`
`However, as she talked with George and Jessica, her expression began to soften gradually...`
`And so,`
` the 'detective' Furudo Erika was placed on the game board...`
`"I'm surprised Jessica's old clothes suit her so well."`
`"...Kumasawa made the decision on her own to use Milady's old clothes.`
` Please forgive her."`
`The clothes Erika wore were Jessica's old formal attire.`
`Though the guest possessed a dignity that would put most adults to shame, her body was still physically similar to a middle-schooler's.`
` Jessica's old clothes fit her perfectly.`
`"Not to worry.`
` They match this guest perfectly.`
` If she likes them, we might even let her keep them as a sign of friendship."`
`"...Certainly.`
` Thank you very much."`
`"Have you contacted the police and her family?"`
`"Yes.`
` They seemed to have been quite distressed."`
`".........By the way,`
` ...our guest really was...involved in an accident, right?"`
`"...She herself said she fell from a boat as it was returning to port."`
`"Is there anything to back up that claim?"`
`"I checked with the Coast Guard.`
` It seems she fell from the rear of a pleasure boat, unnoticed by the others on board.`
` We don't know the exact location she fell from, but it was probably somewhere near this island..."`
`"......It was foolish to play on a boat with such a bad weather forecast.`
` However, ...is it really conceivable that she nearly drowned in the nearby waters and drifted to this island?"`
`"It is not impossible.`
` Tales of drifters washing ashore exist in several of the islands around this area."`
`".................."`
`"...I believe it likely that an accident occurred.`
` ...We're in the middle of a typhoon.`
` It would not be possible to land a boat anywhere on this island."`
`Genji had already considered what she now suspected.`
`Natsuhi probably suspected that this mysterious guest, who had arrived during the already high-stress family conference,`
` might be the agent of some conspiracy.`
`So, Genji had already checked to make sure that the accident was real, that Furudo Erika was her real name,`
` and that there was nothing suspicious going on...`
`"...I understand.`
` My husband has ordered that she be politely entertained.`
` Make sure that there are no blunders.`
` ...However, ......you do understand, don't you?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...I won't let her anywhere near the family conference.`
` After dinner, I will see that she retires to the guesthouse."`
`"Make sure they don't start trying to force us to let her meet Father, or anything like that."`
`"Of course.`
` I will keep that in mind."`
`"......Hoh.`
` ...Furudo Erika, was it?`
` It's rare for guests to come here to Rokkenjima.`
` Doesn't this look like it'll be interesting?"`
`"She's probably Lady Bernkastel's piece.`
` ...Though she will follow the rules of Humans, the player is a witch.`
` We mustn't underestimate her."`
`"Hmph, there is no problem.`
` Even if she were Lady Bernkastel herself, since she's a Human, she's no match for us.`
` ...After all, we have Gaap with us.`
` Humans certainly cannot win against Gaap!"`
`"......Thanks.`
` Still, it's not a good idea to overestimate yourself.`
` ......The definition of a witch doesn't only imply the ability to use magic."`
`"True.`
` ...A joker and the eye of a typhoon.`
` That is what a witch is..."`
`"Hmph.`
` I'm the only one who gets to call herself a witch on this Rokkenjima.`
` Only I, the Golden Witch and Endless Witch, Beatrice!`
` Let's see how good Lady Bernkastel's next piece after Ange is.`
` I intend to watch very closely...!"`
`Erika's seat was the lowest one in rank.`
` In other words, it was at the inferior end of the table.`
`Since Kinzo's seat at the high end of the table was empty, `
`if you spun the whole thing around, it sort of looked like Erika was the host of this dinner...`
`"Well then, everyone.`
` I would like to begin tonight's dinner, if I may."`
`After Gohda's announcement, dinner began with the applause that had become almost customary.`
`It was finally the beginning of the dinner orchestra conducted by Toshiro Gohda.`
`Except for Krauss's household, sitting at such a majestic dinner table was no everyday thing for these people by any means.`
`However, they were all used to this event and acted as though it was completely normal.`
`...Once again, if anyone was to be surprised, it should have been Erika.`
`And yet, she showed no signs of amazement at this dinner and acted with composure,`
` blending in with everyone else.`
`...There wasn't even a sliver of the fear one might expect from someone who had wandered here like a lost puppy.`
`"......What an odd child.`
` She doesn't seem the least bit flustered by the Ushiromiya family's grandest dinner of the year."`
`"Kids these days have nerves of steel.`
` ...Definitely not something I dislike."`
`"Is Furudo-san used to meals such as this one...?`
` She seems to be quite composed."`
`"No kiddin'.`
` She looks really experienced.`
` Heck, I still get confused about which fork I'm supposed to use next.`
` Hmm, ...was it this one, or this one...?`
` Wahahahahaha!"`
`Without showing any confusion over the line of utensils in front of her, Erika gracefully ate her hors d'oeuvres.`
`Hideyoshi had started joking around with her, gripping a fork in each hand.`
`Of course, the president of a company in the food service industry like Hideyoshi obviously knew his table manners.`
`However, thinking that Erika must be nervous over this dinner, he had intentionally spoken with a comic tone of voice.`
`"......You just have to start on the outside and work your way in.`
` ...If that's a pain, then just ask for some chopsticks.`
` ...If you're Japanese, you've got to love chopsticks."`
`"Chopsticks are so great.`
` Just one pair of those, and you can deal with any kind of food!"`
`As soon as she began talking about chopsticks, her eyes started glittering.`
`...The smile she now showed for the first time was far different from the dignity she'd displayed before, `
`more like something you'd expect from someone her age.`
`"*giggle*`
` But even you would use a spoon for curry and rice, wouldn't you?"`
`"Just make it a donburi bowl.`
` Is there anyone who eats beef bowls with a spoon?`
` Of course not.`
` For the Japanese, it's absolutely, positively, totally chopsticks!`
` So, Gohda-san.`
` Would you mind bringing me some chopsticks?`
` I want to show everyone how a true Japanese person should eat, without any shame!"`
`"...By the way, what are we eating next?"`
`"Unfortunately, that would be soup."`
`As she imitated a shrugging gesture, Erika winked at everyone.`
`"""Wahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!"""`
`Of course, no one was laughing at her.`
`She obviously knew that soup came after hors d'oeuvres in a full course meal.`
`Furthermore, Erika had noticed both that she'd been performing too perfectly and creating a sense of tension...`
`and that Hideyoshi had tried to break the ice because he thought she was nervous.`
`That's why she started acting a little childish and light-hearted,`
` acting out the part of a guest enjoying a harmonious dinner...`
`Pretty soon, not only Kyrie, but everyone else caught on.`
`Though she was an uninvited guest, she was apparently worthy of participating in an Ushiromiya family dinner.`
`"Smart kid.`
` ...Did she really just come here by coincidence?`
` Don't tell me you secretly called your illegitimate child to today's family conference, Nii-san?"`
`"It seems she even has the smarts to brighten the mood.`
` And her manners are simply wonderful.`
` It wouldn't be bad at all to have this girl as a daughter."`
`"Hihihihi.`
` That's pretty cruel.`
` Where does that leave Jessica-chan?"`
`"*giggle*`
` That's mean, Rudolf nii-san."`
`"What's wrong, Jessica-chan?`
` Headache?"`
`"Uuuu...`
` I get the feeling my reputation's taking a dive..."`
`"Well, if you're a daughter of the Head Family, you'd better not let her beat you.`
` Try using those table manners and dignity Aunt Natsuhi's always training you with, and fight back!"`
`"I wanna see, I wanna see!`
` I wanna see table manners!`
` Uu-!"`
`"Hey, jumping around is bad manners.`
` Come on, Jessica-chan.`
` Show us how it's done."`
`"...S-Sure, of course..."`
`Jessica straightened up so much it looked like someone had poked her back with a pole.`
`...She had good posture, but it somehow lacked elegance.`
`She looked...well...kind of like a triangle ruler.`
`She sat at attention with her gaze fixed straight ahead, tried to bring her food to her mouth despite this,`
` ...and failed miserably.`
`Dad, who was sitting next to her, suddenly realized that something was up.`
`"Hmm?`
` What's wrong, Jessica-chan?`
` Stomachache??"`
`Jessica turned bright red.`
` ...Ah, sorry, I can't help myself...`
`We laughed our heads off.`
`Jessica protested, still bright red.`
`Aunt Natsuhi scolded us for being too improper.`
`Well, no matter how much we try to smooth it over, we are who we are.`
` We couldn't pretend any longer.`
`Still, that laugh really did help us to relax.`
`We were so concerned about the guest getting nervous, we'd gotten even more nervous ourselves.`
`Our chatter from the center of this long table spread to both ends,`
` and ultimately, the dinner went even more smoothly than usual...`
`With some delicious cheese and coffee, our peaceful meal came to an end.`
`Gohda won unanimous acclaim and was praised for his skill by all present...`
`After a short period of harmony following the meal, it was decided that we would return to the guesthouse.`
`Normally, dinner tended to have a very dark atmosphere about it,`
` and the adults would often keep that mood as they moved straight on to the family conference.`
`However, perhaps because this year's dinner had been oddly peaceful, everyone decided to take a break, the adults included.`
`After eating, taking a bath, and relaxing while watching TV,`
` I wonder if they'll gather again in the mansion with all this rain and resume that high-tension family conference of theirs...`
` I'd rather not think about it.`
`Apparently, Aunt Eva was getting really worked up, trying to convince the rest to start the family conference right away, but it didn't look like many people agreed with her.`
` They would probably call it quits for the night.`
`Since they had guesthouse duty, Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san were chosen to guide us to the guesthouse.`
`It's gotta be tough for Gohda-san.`
`Even after making and cleaning up such an extravagant dinner, he also has the late night shift at the guesthouse.`
`I heard that Kumasawa-san, old as she was, would be going to sleep soon.`
`It seems she was assigned a spare room.`
`"Allow me to guide everyone to the guesthouse.`
` Erika-sama, a room has also been prepared for you."`
`"......Thank you very much."`
`"Why not rest a bit?`
` Are you sure you feel okay?"`
`"...That's right.`
` I'd totally forgotten, but you nearly drowned and floated here, didn't you, Erika-chan?`
` You'd probably be better off taking it easy and getting to bed early tonight."`
`"......I'm perfectly fine.`
` ...On the contrary, I'm so nervous and excited that I doubt I could get any sleep."`
`"Uu-uu-!!`
` Then let's play, let's all play together!`
` Let's play cards!"`
`Maria latched onto her, giggling.`
`This lack of restraint peculiar to youth was very much like Maria.`
` ...However, we really should be concerned for Erika's physical condition now.`
`"Maria, why don't you play cards with us?`
` Erika onee-chan is tired."`
`"...I like cards too.`
` Please let me join you after I've had a short break."`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!! All right!!"`
`".........Who is that?"`
`As she passed through the lobby of the entrance hall, Erika stopped walking...`
`When we saw what she was looking at, ...the rest of us also stopped.`
`"...Oh, that is the Golden Witch, Beatrice-sama."`
`"......The Golden...`
`...Witch."`
`"What're you doing, brats?`
` Go on and head back to the guesthouse."`
`Dad, Kyrie-san, Aunt Eva, Uncle Hideyoshi, and Aunt Rosa all came over.`
`The entire guesthouse party had gathered.`
`However, Erika's gaze was captured by the portrait of the witch, and she simply stared at it for a while...`
`"...Yeah.`
` Supposedly, Dad has a stash of hidden gold worth 20 billion yen,`
` and this epitaph shows you where that gold's hidden."`
`Perhaps it was too early for them all to disperse into their individual rooms, `
`because the relatives who had returned to the guesthouse all gathered on the first floor, continuing their chat.`
`The topic...was the witch's epitaph, which Erika had taken an interest in.`
`"......It really is a fascinating riddle.`
` ......He stuck it out in a place where anyone could see it, challenging our intelligence.`
` ......I love that kind of challenge."`
`"Whoa.`
` You seem surprisingly interested, Erika-chan.`
` Do you like solving riddles or something?"`
`"...Don't challenges like this seem interesting?`
` .........It seems pretty clear `
`that Kinzo-san wants to use that epitaph to choose his successor."`
`When she said that, the adults stopped moving...`
`and slowly turned to face Erika...`
`"Why......do you think that...?"`
`Aunt Eva spoke with a coaxing voice.`
`...Though, every now and then, there had been whisperings among the relatives that whoever solved the epitaph's riddle might be given the family inheritance,`
` ...this had been no more than wishful thinking, since such a thing had never been specifically stated.`
`And yet, though she had only read it once, ...this outsider had already reached that conclusion.`
`How had she come to it?`
`No, ......that's not the problem.`
`'If you solve the epitaph, you can become the next Head'.`
`She wasn't trying to make it sound like wishful thinking, ...but an outright fact.`
`So they closed in around Erika, asking why she was so sure.`
`"......It's fairly common for an extremely rich person to relinquish his or her wealth to the solver of some sort of riddle.`
` ...Furthermore, Kinzo-san didn't publish this epitaph in a newspaper,`
` but displayed it in his mansion.`
` That means the riddle is directed at the people in this mansion."`
`"You're right...`
` ......Since it's inside the mansion, there's no way for someone who can't enter the mansion to solve it.`
` ...So, that means Grandfather's been challenging the people here."`
`"......<Good>.`
` Well thought.`
` Just by the simple fact that the epitaph's inside the mansion, it's possible to figure out that much."`
`At first, this Furudo Erika girl seemed to be the fairly silent type,`
` ...but that apparently wasn't the case.`
`As she grew excited by a challenge to a game of wits, she became much more talkative than I'd imagined.`
`"I-I see...`
` Well, it does make sense that an epitaph inside a mansion would be there so the people in that mansion could read it..."`
`"But...can you really be so sure that the one who solves it will be given the Headship too?"`
`"......If the treasure gained by solving the riddle were something small,`
` I wouldn't even have considered that."`
`"That's right.`
` The hidden gold is worth 20 billion.`
` ...You might consider that gold itself to be the wealth of the Ushiromiya family."`
`".........Inheriting something like that would be almost the same as inheriting the Ushiromiya family itself.`
` ...In other words, this riddle of the gold's hiding place buried within the epitaph is nothing less than a way of selecting the de facto Successor of the Ushiromiya Family."`
`...The idea that the one who solved the epitaph would be chosen as the Successor...`
`had been passed around by some of the relatives for a while now.`
`However, since it had never been specifically announced, it was nothing more than an optimistic dream.`
`...Thinking this, they decided to abandon all consideration of this point until the details were made clear.`
`Erika had clearly declared that this uncertain point was, in fact, true.`
`If one of the relatives had said it, people would have thought it to be merely an optimistic dream.`
`However, when this was declared by a complete outsider,`
` those words seemed even more credible...`
`Everyone remained silent for a while, slowly considering what those words implied...`
`"......Simply by the existence of the epitaph in that place, `
`this level of reasoning is possible for Furudo Erika.`
` ...What do you think, everyone?"`
`"...S-Sorry to butt in,`
` but my dad's the Successor.`
` Finding the gold would be one thing, `
`but that doesn't mean you get to be the Head, right?"`
`Jessica thought the treasure-hunting part of the epitaph was really fun.`
`However, she couldn't help but let her expression grow bitter once they started talking about undermining her father's position...`
`"...By using deductive reasoning based upon my theory,`
` it seems likely that Kinzo-san doesn't want the Successor, Krauss-san, to inherit that position too smoothly."`
`"Wh-Why's that?!!"`
`"......Becoming the Head of the Ushiromiya family, with all of the vast wealth it entails, would mean gaining a great deal of influence in a political sense.`
` ...So, under normal circumstances, the succession should be overseen rigorously, without letting any element of chance creep into the equation."`
`"Th-That's right.`
` ...It happens a lot in those stories about Sengoku military commanders that my husband loves.`
` When there are multiple candidates for the successor, it usually results in an internal squabble..."`
`"...That's right...`
` That's why it's important to clearly specify a successor, so you can avoid any trouble.`
` Sometimes, there's even a purge of all the competing successors."`
`The Sengoku commander Hideyoshi admired, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, made his son-in-law Hidetsugu commit seppuku,`
` but it was rumored that he might have done this to make Hideyori, who was his real son and born after Hidetsugu, his true heir.`
`...In other words, naming a successor was a way to make it generally known that a single, unique person would be acknowledged by everyone,`
` and a way to remove any chance of another person becoming an opposing candidate.`
`"......<Good>.`
` That's exactly right.`
` The only purpose for an epitaph like that would be to cast doubt on Krauss-san's position as the Successor.`
` In other words, if Kinzo-san wanted Krauss-san to become the Head smoothly, he'd have no reason to go out of his way and display something so dangerous for all to see."`
`"That's right.`
` ......If you spin the chessboard around, you certainly could say that.`
` It would be odd if he handed over the position of the Head normally, but only handed over the 20 billion yen in gold to the person who solves the riddle."`
`Kinzo would pass on the title of Family Head, but he would only give up the 20 billion yen in gold to the person who solved the epitaph.`
`...You really couldn't call this passing on the Headship in the truest sense.`
`"......That's how it is.`
` By this theory, we are able to doubt whether Kinzo-san truly acknowledged Krauss-san as his successor.`
` ...Simply by the existence of the epitaph in that place, `
`this level of reasoning is possible for Furudo Erika."`
`"...What do you think, Jessica-san?"`
`"Wh-What the hell?!!`
` How do you call that reasoning?!`
` That's bullshit!! It's screwed up!!"`
`Jessica let her emotions lay bare and glared at Erika.`
`...Erika, on the other hand, `
`looked exceedingly calm with an expression that said 'Well, that's just the truth, right?'`
`......I see.`
` It looks like table manners aren't the only way this girl is fitting for the Ushiromiya family.`
`...It seems she really does match the family, ...even when it'd be better if she didn't...`
`"Okay, ...t-take it easy, Jessica...`
` ...And Erika, let's leave it at that for now."`
`"Well, umm, we can put all this successor stuff to the side for now.`
` Anyway, there's no doubt that it's Father's big question for us.`
` ...Wahahaha!`
` It's 20 billion yen!`
` Maria-chan, what'd you use it for if you found it?`
` Wahahahahahahaha!"`
`"...Uu-.`
` The Golden Land isn't just gold.`
` It's a sacred place!"`
`Uncle Hideyoshi kept trying to force himself to chuckle and improve the mood.`
`Everyone else tried to play along, but Jessica's mood didn't get any better.`
`"H-Hahahaha.`
` So, Erika-chan, would you like to have a go at the epitaph's riddle?"`
`"......Yes.`
` My little gray cells are itching to get started.`
` I'd like to start solving as soon as possible."`
`George-aniki smoothly turned the conversation around.`
`Just like the time she'd made everyone laugh in the dining hall, Erika looked about with gleeful eyes and jumped at the chance.`
`"*giggle*giggle*`
` I like it.`
` ......Well, since Erika seems so interested,`
` let's all try and solve it together, just like last year."`
`"I'll make some coffee.`
` Raise your hand if you want some.`
` Not for you, Maria!`
` You won't be able to sleep...!"`
`"Uu-uu-!!`
` I wanna drink black coffee!!"`
`"..............."`
`"...Don't they get you excited,`
` riddles like this?`
` ......I love them."`
`Erika said that and smiled...`
`Though she must've known that she'd ticked Jessica off and made the atmosphere sour,`
` ...she just smiled nonchalantly...`
`"...See? Without even waiting for the crime on October 5th, there's a riddle you can solve."`
`"............`
`...I've tried to solve it many times myself.`
` But-"`
`"......But you didn't have a clue, so you gave up and stopped thinking.`
` ...Right?"`
`It pissed me off, but I don't have a good counter for that.`
`After all, ...I don't get the epitaph at all.`
`I don't even know what the beloved hometown means, much less the parts about the sweetfish river and the key...`
`Thinking that a few more hints would show up if I waited,`
` ...I kept on waiting...and just stopped thinking...`
`"......Have you figured out an answer of your own?`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ...Because I'm about to ~ib~solve it~ib~."`
`"Wh-What...?"`
`"This is where Bern solved the riddle of the epitaph.`
` ...I'd expect no less from the Witch of Miracles.`
` 'If a riddle is solvable, she can solve it without fail, regardless of the difficulty'.`
` ...How many years did it take to solve this one?"`
`"......That's rude.`
` I only fished through a few hundred Fragments."`
`"Heheheheheheheheheheh...`
` You really are terrifying."`
`"You aren't going to cheat by suddenly saying the answer in red or something like that, right...?"`
`"......Don't worry.`
` Just like you, I follow the rules as a player.`
` ...Well, shall we begin?`
` ......It's cramped here.`
` Why don't we talk over the sea?"`
`"OK.`
` ...Don't get queasy, Battler."`
`"What do you mean, the sea...?`
` .........?!"`
`I thought the whole world had turned pitch black, and the next moment, `
`...I was struck by a strange floating sensation.`
`This must be what it feels like to suddenly have the floor drop from under you, sending you into a bottomless pit...`
`When I looked, `
`...I saw that the two witches and I...`
`had been thrown into a pitch-black universe.`
`In this space, every direction was covered in an endless darkness, and it felt like a limitless expanse filled with countless glittering objects.`
`...Some people might have likened it to the depths of an ocean where innumerable sparkling fragments drifted.`
`"Nng, ......wh-whoa........."`
`".........Didn't she tell you not to get queasy?"`
`"If you want the concept of gravity, just create it yourself, okay?`
` ...Come on, calm down and look at us.`
` ...Come on, don't we look like we're just fine?`
` ...Believe that your feet are on the ground and that you're being controlled by gravity.`
` ...If you do that, you'll find your equilibrium."`
`Y-Yes, the two witches are standing normally, as if their feet were planted on transparent pieces of glass.`
`I'm the only one floating about like someone in a rapidly plummeting elevator.`
`...When I saw that they were doing just fine, I started calming down, figuring that there was no need to be scared.`
`Then, just as Lambdadelta said,`
` I gritted my teeth and kept telling myself that there was a place to stand here...and that I had to stay calm...`
`"...Wh-Whoa..."`
`"Very good, very good.`
` ...What's your name?"`
`"Ushiromiya Battler.`
` ...Who else do I look like?"`
`"OK.`
` You mustn't lose your will, emotions, or form.`
` After all, this is the ocean.`
` If you lose your purpose, you'll fall into the depths of eternity and become a scrap of ocean seaweed.`
` Be careful."`
`I don't get what Lambdadelta's saying, but I should calm down for the time being.`
`It seems that I regain my equilibrium the more I calm down.`
`Gradually, that weird floating feeling, like I was falling forever, began to disappear.`
`...It still felt strange, like trying to stand up straight at the bottom of a deep pool, but it was much better than before.`
`"......Then let's begin.`
` ......I'll weave together some Fragments for solving the riddle of the epitaph..."`
`Bernkastel opened both of her hands.`
`Then, like a planetarium, `
`...all of the Fragments throughout this empty space began to spin, leaving tails behind them...`
`The expression 'planetarium' might've been surprisingly fitting...`
`...Multiple Fragments were tied together by gold lines,`
` and what looked like constellations zoomed by us rapidly, one after another.`
`It felt almost as though we were dashing through space at an incredible speed...`
`Then, with tails of light drifting behind them,`
` ...several brightly glowing Fragments swirled around Bernkastel.`
`It looked almost like she'd created her own solar system, with her as the sun.`
`That solar system surrounding Bernkastel grew to a radius large enough to swallow us up.`
`And every once in a while, one of those satellite Fragments zoomed right past me.`
`When those Fragments passed by me,`
` ...it felt as though some kind of memory welled up inside me.`
`So I sensed it.`
`...These Fragments are probably like a crystallization of memories.`
`"They aren't memories.`
` They're Fragments of worlds.`
` ...Well, I guess they might feel like memories to you."`
`"......Then let's begin.`
` ...Let's start with this Fragment."`
`One of the satellites in this solar system was slowly sucked into an inward trajectory with Bernkastel at the center.`
`After drawing a spiral and approaching her, it settled down on the palm of Bernkastel's outstretched hand...`
`Then, it glittered brightly, painting over the world with pure white...`
`"...The 'beloved hometown' definitely won't betray our expectations.`
` ...The only past Father held dear happened during his childhood years."`
`"......I remember that.`
` ...This is from the 3rd game, when Aunt Eva was just about to solve the riddle of the epitaph...and was thinking it over with this witch inside her or whatever."`
`".........That's right.`
` And, from these thoughts, she made her way to the correct answer.`
` In other words, this Fragment shows a vital hint for reaching the truth.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ......It means that ~ib~this theory is not mistaken~ib~."`
`"So, ...you're saying we should assume this beloved hometown isn't a metaphor or anything like that,`
` ...but the place Grandfather actually spent his youth?"`
`"......That's right.`
` And at the very least, it isn't Odawara."`
`"......Odawara is definitely where he was born, `
`but I don't think that's the hometown he loved. I imagine all of us siblings have the same place in mind."`
`"...Right.`
` This probably isn't Odawara.`
` From what I've heard, he had a very fun time as a youth."`
`"That's right...`
` ...Aunt Eva and her siblings said it wasn't Odawara.`
` ...And not only that, it looks like everyone guessed where Grandfather's hometown was."`
`"...Right.`
` And annoyingly, the actual location isn't spoken of in any of the Fragments."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"Well duh.`
` If I told you that, there'd be too many hints.`
` ...If it wasn't a hard riddle, ~ib~there'd be no point to it~ib~.`
` ...Uh-oh,`
` that's a hint too.`
` *giggle*..."`
`"............`
`...Just where is this hometown of Grandfather's?`
` ...We can't even start if we don't know that..."`
`"You mean you couldn't start, so you stopped thinking?`
` ...Since it had to be a place where he could've lived, the number of possibilities is limited.`
` ......Well, this is the toughest part."`
`"......You were the witch who could 'certainly solve any riddle that can be solved', weren't you?`
` ...So you took those limited possibilities...`
`in other words, everywhere on the earth, and considered every single piece of land that Grandfather might've lived on?"`
`".........That would work too, but that way, no amount of time would be enough.`
` So, I needed to take some more hints into consideration to wring out the answer."`
`"...Didn't you say it yourself?`
` You said it didn't have to be a river with water flowing down it.`
` ...If the word sweetfish is too complicated, why not forget it...?"`
`"Think of a river.`
` A river.`
` Linking it with a 'family tree' wasn't a bad idea.`
` Try thinking about how to link a river with something else along those lines..."`
`"......A sweetfish river running through the hometown.`
` However, this river isn't truly a river.`
` ...Eva thought of something else, something that could be linked with a river."`
`"Sure...`
` But if it isn't a river, then why the sweetfish...?`
` ............"`
`"......Think.`
` A river that runs through the hometown.`
` ...But it isn't a river with water running down it.`
` Something that can be likened to a river......"`
`"..............."`
`"......Behold the sweetfish river running through the beloved hometown.`
` ...Eva knew where the hometown was, so she could forget about the sweetfish hint.`
` ...However, since we don't know where it is, this could be a hint for us."`
`"......I worried too much about the sweetfish river.`
` The sweetfish part didn't really matter that much at all, did it?"`
`"That isn't true.`
` It was an excellent hint, wasn't it?`
` Well, of course, maybe there was no need for it to be sweetfish."`
`".........What are these 'sweetfish'...?`
` ...If the river isn't a literal river, then of course, 'sweetfish' probably doesn't mean the kind of fish that swims."`
`"Yeah.`
` And on top of that, Rosa tossed it aside, saying that sweetfish weren't that significant."`
`"......On the other hand, Eva said it wasn't important for them to be sweetfish, but that it was still an excellent hint.`
` ......In other words, the 'sweetfish' is a key to make you think of something else.`
` If that something is a different word, but a word that sweetfish makes you think of, then Eva's line about how it 'probably didn't have to be sweetfish' makes sense..."`
`".................."`
`From these thoughts, Aunt Eva formed some theory,`
` ...went to the library, looked through some books, and 'verified that she was right'.`
`In short, Aunt Eva formed some theory about the true nature of this sweetfish river running through a hometown.`
`Then, ...she opened a certain book to determine whether that theory was correct or not.`
`In other words, this theory was something that could be verified through some kind of book...`
`Also, after she figured out what the sweetfish river was, she figured out the rest of the riddle very quickly...`
`"......Good thinking.`
` ...The epitaph continues on, saying 'as you travel down the river, you will see a village'.`
` At that point in time, Eva hadn't yet solved the three lines starting with this one."`
`"...What is this village?`
` What does it mean?!`
` Do you find one if you go down the river...?!`
` .........Ah, ...aaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`Right before my eyes, `
`...the pieces that I hadn't been able to understand at all...`
`...began to *snap*...`
`*snap*...`
`into place, all by themselves...`
`I couldn't even remember to close my open mouth.`
`...My throat grew completely dry...`
`Is it...really okay for this to be the answer?`
`R-Really?`
` Really...?!`
`"...So...`
`if we figure out what the 'sweetfish river running through the hometown' is,`
` ...that leads us directly to understanding the 'as you travel down the river, you will see a village' stuff, ...and then we get the key to the Golden Land."`
`"......Correct.`
` And we know that because even Eva didn't know what the village meant until she checked the book."`
`"Dammit...`
` ...Just what is this book...?!"`
`"...But this isn't six characters at all.`
` ...I'm absolutely sure this is the answer, but this doesn't reach six characters at all...!"`
`Did you stop thinking again?`
` In that case, think of a way you could read it with six characters.`
`If you can't think of one, then research it.`
`...There has to be an answer.`
` You must not doubt that.`
`Oh, is believing in that too much for you? If only you'd just cry yourself to sleep, and then you can just give up and die...`
`".........1, `
`2, `
`3, `
`4, `
`5, `
`6...`
` ...Oooh, `
`...s`
`-`
`six characters...`
`...I-`
`I found it.`
` ...This...`
`......is...`
`th-`
`the key to the Golden Land......!!"`
`".........Then, Eva found the key to the Golden Land."`
`"Yeah.`
` And this key...`
`...was some kind of word, number, or string of characters, ...six characters long!"`
`"......That's it.`
` If we know the key's true identity has six characters, the meaning of the first twilight changes drastically."`
`"O-On the first twilight, offer the six chosen by the key as sacrifices...`
` ...The six...chosen by the key...`
` ......Six characters...!"`
`In other words, ...it means to sacrifice the six characters chosen by the key on the first twilight...!`
`"This key indicates a certain group of six people.`
` ...No, we should say it indicates a certain group of six things,`
` ...if this doesn't mean a literal command to offer sacrifices.`
` For example, it could be an anagram."`
`"An anagram?`
` Do you mean playing with letters...?"`
`Yes, Kyrie-san has been thinking that way ever since that moment...!`
`"...On the second twilight, there are 'those who remain'.`
` ...Which means that, at the very least, that 'something' has a limited number of characters.`
` You could read it like it's telling you to continue with the remaining characters after the first six characters are removed."`
`"In other words, on the first twilight, we take a list of characters that's longer than six,`
` 'kill' the six that are the key,`
` and then do something with the characters that remain...!"`
`".........That's right.`
` But, like Kyrie said,`
` what should we kill the characters from?`
` ...We don't know this longer string of characters that we're supposed to be killing from."`
`On the first twilight, kill the six characters that are the key.`
`............On the first twilight.`
`"...In other words, ...by the time we reach the first twilight, some string of characters already exists?`
` That might be a set of Japanese characters, `
`but knowing Grandfather's tastes, could it be something in English?`
` 'The first twilight' has more than six characters, `
`even though the Japanese phrase has just four (第一㝮晩).`
` ........."`
`"......<Good>.`
` That idea of yours isn't bad, Battler-san.`
` ...We can interpret the six sacrifices chosen by the key as a string of six characters.`
` I think it's a very clever concept.`
` That way, the key doesn't necessarily have to be key-shaped."`
`"I've also considered the possibility that it's an anagram."`
`"...Come to think of it, you did say something like that before.`
` But in that case, where do we take the six characters out from?"`
`"That's right.`
` ...Since we're taking six characters out, it must be at least six characters long.`
` We need to read 第一㝮晩 in some way that gives it more than six characters..."`
`"If we follow Father's sensibilities, ...I guess it probably is English after all..."`
`"......If it looks like we're getting stuck, why don't we move on to the second twilight and look for hints?`
` ...Those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close.`
` ...We can probably think of 'those who remain' as 'the remaining characters after the first six have been taken out'."`
`"In that case, ...what does it mean by two characters that are close...?"`
`"......I see.`
` ...I get it, so that's what this is about...!"`
`For example, let's take the following list of nine characters: 123456789.`
`And then, let's say that the six characters offered as sacrifices are 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9.`
`In this case, we erase the aforementioned six characters from 123456789...and get x2x45xxxx.`
`"So 2, 4, and 5 are left.`
` ...So what?"`
`"...Oh, ...4 and 5 are close..."`
`"Y-Yeah, I get it!!`
` So the two who are close are..."`
`x2x45xxxx.`
`"Yep.`
` There's a gap between 2 and 4, but 4 and 5 are right next to each other.`
` They're the two who are close...!"`
`"......<Good>.`
` Well done, Battler-san.`
` We can't tell whether 'tear apart' means to crush 4 and 5,`
` or to put a gap between them, but I think that's a good observation."`
`"Then what do you think about the third twilight, 'those who remain shall praise my noble name'?"`
`"......Since there's a good chance that we're playing with letters, this might be the same thing.`
` ...'The characters that remain shall praise my noble name'."`
`"Hmmmmm...`
` That's tough...`
` ...What could it mean...?"`
`"......Does anyone know?`
` ......I think I do."`
`"Huh?`
` What is it? Tell me...!"`
`"...Is this also...an anagram?"`
`"......Once again, <good>.`
` ...Battler-san, you're a pretty flexible thinker."`
`"By anagram, you mean playing with letters, right?`
` ...That means..."`
`"In other words, maybe you can make some kind of word by changing the order of the remaining letters."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...If so, .........`
` ...I might be getting ahead of myself with this theory,`
` ...but maybe the original list of characters that the first twilight's removed from is 11 characters long."`
`"......Well done again.`
` I reached the same conclusion."`
`"Wh-Why's that?`
` Why do you think there are 11 characters?!"`
`"......We think 'killing a single sacrifice' means 'crushing a single character'.`
` If we interpret the 'tear apart' of the second twilight to mean adding a gap between two characters, then there are 11 characters total.`
` If 'tear apart' means to crush those two characters, then we can assume that there are 13 characters."`
`"...After all, from the fourth twilight to the eighth twilight, the word 'kill' appears five times.`
` And then, on the ninth twilight, it's written that none will be left alive."`
`"If we ignore the part about the witch reviving for now, `
`I figured that after crushing the first six, separating the characters that are close, and then crushing five more of them, `
`...there should be no characters left."`
`So that makes 6+5, or 11 characters.`
`If tearing apart the two who are close in the second twilight means to kill both of them,`
` that makes 6+2+5, or 13 characters.`
`There's a chance the word symbolizing the first twilight has 11 or 13 characters.`
` ......Wait, ...it couldn't be that easy, could it?`
`"......Wonderfully done. That's the exact same theory I thought of.`
` ...It looks like you were gifted with excellent little gray cells just like me, Battler-san."`
`"Hey, quit it.`
` Just doing what comes naturally."`
`".........Hey, what the hell?`
` ...The piece me's pretty damn smart.`
` There's no room left for me to make theories."`
`"Oh, sorry about that.`
` ...You weren't around at this point, so I just controlled your piece for you.`
` ......Isn't it nice how smart I made you look...?"`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*...!`
` You look smarter when Bern's playing you.`
` ...Why not step down as the player and concentrate on being a piece instead?"`
`I joined in on this game partway through, well after the first murders occurred on October 5th.`
`That means the piece called 'me' was controlled by the player, Bernkastel.`
`So, I guess that means it's possible for Bernkastel's reasoning to be announced through 'my' mouth...`
`...The game I'm watching now is nothing more than a replay of a part that's already ended.`
`However, that's probably good enough for now.`
`...After all, this Bernkastel-sama's going out of her way to solve the epitaph for me.`
`...I'll watch closely for now.`
`......And, ...I'll try to find out what it means.`
`Lambdadelta let it slip herself just a second ago.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"Well duh.`
` If I told you that, there'd be too many hints.`
` ...If it wasn't a hard riddle, ~ib~there'd be no point to it~ib~.`
` ...Uh-oh, that's a hint too. *giggle*..."`
`...This theory about Grandfather creating the epitaph in order to choose a successor isn't bad at all.`
`Erika and Bernkastel's logic is extremely reasonable.`
`But that's only if we assume Grandfather was the one to create it.`
`He was probably alive at the time the epitaph was displayed,`
` but of course, ...Grandfather is already dead by 1986.`
`And, in the games up until now, `
`Beatrice threatened us repeatedly with letters, saying that the only way to survive was to solve the epitaph...`
`and trying to force us to solve the riddle.`
`In other words, ...it was Beatrice's intention--her hope--that we would try solving the riddle of the epitaph.`
`The epitaph's so confusing that, in most cases,`
` the relatives never seriously tried solving it until the threatening letters started to arrive.`
`That's why Beatrice fired the starting pistol that made us take a go at it.`
`............`
`......Why is Beatrice carrying out Grandfather's will after his death...?`
`Like the theory proposed in the first game, ...is Beatrice really Grandfather's confidant,`
` who's following his orders even after his death and trying to select the Successor with the riddle of the epitaph in Grandfather's stead...?`
`If she did that, it would mean Beatrice really was Kinzo's trusted underling, `
`...the family alchemist she claimed to be in that letter...`
`After Grandfather's death, Beatrice managed the 10 tons of gold and took the title of alchemist.`
`......She was entrusted with the epitaph's riddle, and without ever embezzling the gold,`
` she waited for a human fitting to be the Successor to appear and solve it...`
`And if that human didn't appear within a set time limit,`
` ...would that be 'game over'?`
`Certainly, Aunt Eva, who solved the riddle in the 3rd game,`
` became the only survivor and, automatically, the final Head of the Ushiromiya family, inheriting everything.`
`Up until now, no one has ever survived past October 5th except Aunt Eva, the one who solved the epitaph...`
`That was the only case where Beatrice let anyone survive...`
`...............`
`Is Beatrice's loyalty to Grandfather...the thing that drove her......?`
`Was she so loyal that she faithfully carried out some terrible order...`
`to kill everyone if the epitaph wasn't solved...?`
`.........`
`...I must not stop thinking.`
` ...Don't...stop thinking...`
`Don't just think of the riddle itself, ...think about why it's significant.`
`............`
`Why is Beatrice telling us to solve the epitaph...?`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`Why is she making us solve ~ib~such a confusing~ib~ epitaph...?`
`...If Beatrice makes us try and solve this epitaph we have no real chance of solving,`
` ......and by some lucky chance, a 'miracle' occurs and someone is able to solve it, `
`...what significance would that have to her......?`
`I don't know...what such a miracle would be worth to Beato.`
`"Anyway, ...until we figure out the first twilight, we'll have to give up on the rest."`
`We tried looking at it from several different angles, but in the end, we got stuck there and made no further advances.`
`"Mmph, ...fwaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh..."`
`Maria let out an extra-large yawn.`
`This caused several other people to yawn.`
`...We'd been using our heads so much that everyone had gotten a little sleepy.`
`Jessica, who'd been silent and irritated the whole time, quickly stood up.`
`"...I'm going upstairs with Maria.`
` We'll watch TV or something."`
`"Okay...`
` I'll go up too.`
` Hey, why don't we all play cards upstairs?"`
`When George proposed this, Maria completely forgot about that big yawn of hers and started jumping around, insisting that she wanted to play cards.`
`According to the clock, it was already 10:00 at night.`
`It was already about the time you'd normally take a bath and get ready for sleep.`
`Even the adults seemed pretty weary from traveling.`
`We decided to continue this later and went our separate ways...`
`"Will you play cards with us too, `
`Erika-chan?"`
`"......I appreciate the sentiment.`
` I overstepped my bounds a little, forgetting that I'm a simple guest.`
` I'd like to take it easy and rest for the night.`
` ......I almost forgot I was recently in an accident."`
`"Seriously.`
` You're in such high spirits, it's hard to believe you almost drowned."`
`"*giggle*`
` That's youth for you.`
` Still, I enjoyed it.`
` I think we've taken a big step in our reasoning thanks to you.`
` If I find the gold, I'll let you have about a million yen worth."`
`"Wahahaha!`
` Can't you at least offer the poor girl a hundred million!`
` Gahahaha!"`
`"No need to bother.`
` I'm only interested in solving the riddle.`
` ...Well then, if you'll excuse me.`
` ...Good night."`
`"Yeah, 'night."`
`"Oh, you aren't going upstairs, Battler-kun?"`
`"...I'm getting a bit interested.`
` I'll think things through here just a bit longer.`
` If I can just figure out the list of characters that marks the first twilight, I bet the road before me will open up all at once..."`
`Everyone went up to the second floor, one by one.`
`Only Aunt Rosa remained behind, cleaning up the coffee cups everyone had been drinking out of.`
`Kyrie-san and some others had offered to help,`
` but Rosa had refused and was washing them all alone.`
`Since I'd just been treated to such delicious coffee, I decided to help too.`
`...I wasn't just doing it because I felt obligated.`
`I wanted to keep discussing the epitaph with someone.`
`"......The first twilight, ...the first twilight.`
` ...Hmmmm.`
` Aunt Rosa, have you thought of some list of characters or a word?"`
`"No...`
` I don't have a clue.`
` ......But instead of the first twilight, it's the tenth twilight that bugs me."`
`"The tenth twilight...?`
` What about it?"`
`"Well,`
` ......at the end here, it says you'll receive the Golden Land's four treasures 'once and for the last time', right?"`
`"Yeah, it does."`
`"Why mention that you're reaching the Golden Land just once, and then say it's for the last time?`
` It's almost as though he's repeating the same thing twice.`
` I've just been wondering whether he had some reason for putting it like that."`
`".........You're right.`
` ...Like you said,`
` there's got to be a more straightforward way of saying that."`
`That line should've been a key part of the riddle, where you wouldn't expect the writer to waste words needlessly...`
`Could it have been done for some special purpose...?`
`...............`
`"Still, ...you and that Erika-chan girl are incredible.`
` Your minds really are flexible.`
` ...I'm already an old lady, and my brain just doesn't work that fast.`
` That theory about the six chosen by the key signifying six characters to be removed was very impressive."`
`"After hearing that, I can't see it as being any other way,`
` but before then, I didn't think it was like that at all...`
` I'm feeling let down by my own dull mind."`
`"That's not true.`
` You've got a flexible mind yourself, Aunt Rosa.`
` This 'last time' thing might be really important somewhere down the line."`
`"Not at all. My mind's very stiff.`
` ......Up until now, I've always thought that this 'first twilight' was nothing more than a place one-tenth of the way on a road to the Golden Land."`
`"...What's that?`
` Sounds interesting. Mind telling me about it?"`
`"*giggle*`
` ...After all, in the line before the first twilight, it says 'you must travel to the Golden Land', right?`
` The next part describes a journey that lasts ten days, so I thought the first twilight would be part of the way through that journey."`
`"...A journey...`
` ......I see.`
` ........."`
`"Then the journey begins, and when you set up camp at the first twilight, you offer the six as sacrifices.`
` ......So, where would that place be?`
` How many kilometers from the starting point...?`
` That's pretty much what I wondered...`
` Don't tell anyone, okay?`
` For some reason, I used to think the capital bit was about Kyoto.`
`"Then the journey begins, and when you set up camp at the first twilight, you offer 'the six' as sacrifices.`
` ......So, where would that place be?`
` How many kilometers from the starting point...?`
` *sigh*...`
` Please, don't tell anyone about your aunt's silly ideas, okay?`
` When I first saw that part about 'attaining to' the treasures of the Golden Land, I just assumed it was more of the same."`
`"...Typically, 'attaining' treasures would mean obtaining them, but I thought it meant reaching or arriving at some place.`
` Some place ten days away from Father's hometown where all these treasures might be found..."`
`......Look, when you say 'kyou', it sounds like Kyoto, right?`
` So I thought there might be some kind of secret hidden at the end of the first tenth of the road from Father's hometown to Kyoto..."`
`......After all, if the capital of the gold and the Golden Land are the same thing, you can also say them the same way, right?`
` 'Ougon Kyou' can mean Golden Capital.`
` and `
`, the ancient and modern capitals of Japan, are well known throughout the world.`
` The 京 part of those names means 'capital'.`
`But when `
` is all by itself, it can also mean Kyoto specifically.`
` I just thought the ten-day trip might be between Father's hometown and Kyoto..."`
`But when you write it that way, it can also mean Kyoto itself, the old capital of Japan.`
` I just thought the ten-day trip might be between Father's hometown and Kyoto..."`
`......After all, if the capital of the gold and the Golden Land are the same thing, you can also say them the same way, right?`
` 'Ougon Kyou'.`
` 'Kyou' means capital, like in Tokyo or Kyoto, if you write it 京 instead of 郷.`
` But when you write it that way, it can also mean Kyoto itself, the old capital of Japan.`
` I just thought the ten-day trip might be between Father's hometown and Kyoto..."`
`"Are you kidding? That's a brilliant idea.`
` ......And the first twilight is the first stop on that ten-day journey...`
` ...The name of that place might be the key to moving forward..."`
`"For my ten day theory to work, you'd have to know both the start point and the end point.`
` ...I know the start point.`
` I know the hometown Father loved.`
` The place Father spent his time when he was a boy really is far away."`
`"...But the problem is the goal, ...the Golden Land.`
` What does that really mean?`
` ...If we don't know that, my theory gets us nowhere.`
` I've been stuck at this spot for a long time,`
` but after listening to your reasoning today, I've realized what an embarrassing mistake I've been making."`
`"......No, ...I think that's still an interesting idea.`
` ...............`
`A start and a goal, a ten-day journey.`
` ...And the place reached at the very first twilight..."`
`"Believe it or not, I think you might solve this one easily, Battler-kun.`
` ...If you do solve it with your aunt's hint, share some with me. Even 5% would be great.`
` It's a promise♪"`
`Despite being my aunt, she gave me a smile and a wink which would've made a man's heart jump.`
`As I helped her wash the coffee cups,`
` ...I kept pondering the epitaph's riddle in silence......`
`...After I finished helping Aunt Rosa, I passed through the corridor on my way to the bathroom...`
`and saw Erika unlocking the door to a room on my path.`
`"...I thought your room was on the second floor?`
` Figured you'd gone upstairs and had fallen asleep by now."`
`".........I was just searching for something.`
` ...I thought it might be here."`
`"Searching for something...?"`
`Erika unlocked the door and opened it.`
`A dusty smell drifted out...`
`It was the library.`
`For a library, the gaps between bookshelves were extremely small.`
`This was obviously built for storing books, not reading them.`
`"...So, it's a book you're searching for."`
`"Not necessarily a book, ...but materials, I guess you could say.`
` There's something I've just got to look up."`
`".........You're looking for something to do with the epitaph's riddle...?`
` Pretty impressive that you haven't given up yet.`
` Is the 20 billion yen that enticing?"`
`I hadn't given up either.`
`Apparently, being stubborn is something we both share...`
`"Of course not.`
` ...I'm only interested in solving puzzles.`
` I search for the gold only to prove my reasoning correct.`
` Even if I found it, I wouldn't pocket it for myself, so have no fears on that score."`
`...She immediately cast my comment aside, saying that she just liked solving riddles and had no interest at all in the gold.`
`I've thought she was pretty weird from the start, and it looks like that impression was spot on.`
`Erika slowly circled the bookshelves, searching for the book she was after...`
`"I'm also trying to solve the epitaph right now.`
` ......Oh yeah, just a second ago, I heard something interesting from Aunt Rosa, which might give us a hint about the first twilight."`
`"......Let me hear it."`
`Erika asked this without stopping her search, or even turning to face me.`
`"In the line before the first twilight, it says that one who obtains the key must do so and so."`
`"......The one who obtains the key must then travel to the Golden Land in accordance with these rules."`
`"Whoa...`
` You've already got it memorized?`
` Guess I shouldn't be surprised..."`
`"And what about that?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` You've gotta travel to the Golden Land, right?`
` Apparently, this made Aunt Rosa think about the tenth twilight...`
`in other words, going on a ten-day journey from the beloved homeland to the Golden Land..."`
`"Actually, I'd already noticed that myself.`
` You start from the place reached on the first day of the ten-day journey.`
` ...That's where you take the sacrifices from."`
`"Y-Yeah, that's what Aunt Rosa thought of too.`
` I think the theory's pretty intriguing.`
` ...We're looking for the place you'd reach on the first day of a ten-day journey.`
` That bit of land--or else the name of that region--might be a key..."`
`"......I also guessed that the place's name might be a key.`
` That's why I'm looking for materials.`
` I want to turn my guess into certainty."`
`"Just what......are you looking for?"`
`Then, Erika's hand suddenly stopped, ...and she slowly pulled it out...`
`As she dusted it off, she finally looked at me and spoke.`
`"It's an atlas."`
`"...It seems we've managed to make it through the first day."`
`Natsuhi could be seen in the study.`
`When she muttered as though to herself, gold butterflies appeared and formed the shape of a person...`
`"We mustn't let our guards down.`
` ...I can't imagine we'll last through tomorrow if we simply sit around here."`
`"...So, as I suspected, simply saying Father's in a bad mood and refuses to come out won't be enough to deceive them completely."`
`"Indeed...`
` It seems last year left them quite suspicious.`
` Because of that, the toxin has expanded and is coiling itself around this study, growing ever tighter..."`
`"I imagine it goes beyond mere suspicions raised last year."`
`"......That's right.`
` The toxin has grown too thick to be explained away by that alone.`
` ...Someone must have suspected Kinzo-sama's death since last year...and is strongly intent on exposing that secret at this year's family conference."`
`"Does that mean...we didn't have them fully deceived even a full year ago?"`
`"...Unfortunately, it's probably best to assume that, given our current situation.`
` The typhoon will remain here tomorrow, and the boat will not come for them until the day after.`
` In short, we must endure for another 36 hours at the very least..."`
`"......It may not be visible to your eyes, Natsuhi, but the closed room barrier sealing this room was once very firm.`
` Tonight, however, it has been worn down almost to the point of crumbling, like dry leaves awaiting a windstorm."`
`"No, the storm is already here.`
` ......Natsuhi-sama,`
` I propose that we switch from the closed room barrier to something else."`
`"What do you mean by that...?`
` Are you suggesting we change our plan...?"`
`"That is correct.`
` ...Virgilia-sama and I will reconstruct a barrier similar to last year's."`
`"In other words, we'll take Kinzo out of the study and have him tightrope walk from shadow to shadow where the toxin can't reach, just like last year.`
` It may be dangerous, but I would like to second her proposal."`
`"Is this a joke...?`
` Do you truly intend to change the plan this far in...?!"`
`"When one realizes they cannot withstand a siege, they must consider the option of abandoning the castle..."`
`"...Right now, this room is like a castle surrounded by enemy troops, with its walls about to crumble.`
` If staying put means certain death, then you also have the option of riding out for one last stand and an honorable defeat.`
` ...After all, surrender doesn't seem to be an option in this fight."`
`"I'll protect Father's secret until the very end!`
` If it's discovered, we'll have no chance to talk our way out of it!`
` My husband's embezzlement will be exposed to the light of day, and the Ushiromiya family's honor will be destroyed!`
` We must remain firm and prevent that no matter what may happen...!"`
`"...Calm down, I understand you.`
` ...Krauss's alchemy will soon yield great results.`
` If we can just make it through this year, we'll manage.`
` So don't get flustered."`
`"But we used this strategy precisely because we wouldn't be able to pull off the same trick as last year, right?`
` Isn't it the height of stupidity to return to a plan you previously abandoned because it was impossible...?!`
` Just what sort of plan could we hope to make at this point...?!"`
`"Ronove and I will prepare one.`
` Leave it to us, for creating illusions is what witches do.`
` ...All you have to do is give us your permission, Natsuhi-sama."`
`"......Teacher and Ronove are quite reliable at times such as these...!`
` And the servants of the One-Winged Eagle are top-notch furniture.`
` Once Teacher and Ronove rebuild the magic we need, I imagine the servants will work hard to protect it.`
` ...It still isn't too late.`
` Let's take Kinzo out of the study and make that illusion walk around...!"`
`"Did you forget we chose our current strategy because we considered plans like that...and couldn't find anything that would work?!`
` It would be the height of foolishness to get flustered in an emergency and carelessly throw away our primary plan!"`
`"But Natsuhi-sama...!`
` As you stand there amidst the toxin, you must realize better than anyone else that we will no longer be able to outlast this siege...!"`
`"......I propose that we try and think of another plan without changing our objective of holding the fort.`
` ...In any event, as long as we can keep this room sealed, no one will be able to deny Father's existence.`
` After all, one cannot determine the contents of a cat box that no number of people could ever hope to open...!"`
`"...Well, that may be true, `
`...but Humans are capable of defying reason.`
` It's possible for them to eat into an airtight cat box and go inside, like black ants closing in on a box of cake.`
` ......Lady Bernkastel's piece also worries me."`
`"......It was fortunate that Erika-sama stole the show at tonight's dinner.`
` By doing that, she created an atmosphere in which it was possible to close down the family conference for the night.`
` ...If you all had returned directly to the family conference as usual, the barrier might have broken tonight."`
`"However, it also made the toxin grow even thicker.`
` ...After it thickens all night, it might manage to penetrate the closed room barrier with ease.`
` Whether we continue to hold down the fort or not, `
`we will not make it through tomorrow unless we prepare a new strategy and a new barrier."`
`"...Lady Bernkastel may have some plan for breaking the closed room barrier......`
` We can't take that piece called Erika lightly..."`
`"......Come to think of it, that man who mentioned taking revenge for the events of 19 years ago... might also be a piece of Lady Bernkastel's.`
` ...This board achieved equilibrium with 18 pieces, but now it has had two undesired pieces added to it.`
` ...There are too many irregularities this year."`
`"Lady Bernkastel is a fan of Eastern things.`
` ...In shogi, or Japanese chess, aren't you allowed to drop pieces in during a game?"`
`"Yes, that is possible.`
` ...Even the act of dropping a queen from the captured pile right in front of the enemy king...is an allowable trump card in shogi."`
`"...I wonder...what that man who claimed to have a connection from 19 years ago...is doing now.`
` ...Is he already hiding somewhere on this island...?"`
`"......That girl called Erika was able to appear by claiming to have drifted here.`
` ...That man might also have landed somewhere on this island despite the typhoon, ...and he may be hiding somewhere now..."`
`"...And it's going to be hard to fully deceive the relatives any longer...`
`...............`
` ...Why?!!`
` Why have so many irregular things happened at the same time?!!`
` How can you explain this nightmarish miracle of coincidence?!!"`
`Natsuhi slammed the desk hard, held her head, and cringed at the pain from her overwhelming headache...`
`"......Lady Bernkastel controls miracles.`
` ...There's no point being surprised at irregularities or miracles when she's around."`
`"While shogi is a game in which an enemy piece might suddenly appear in front of a king,`
` for that very reason, you build up a perfect formation that won't allow for such a weakness, artistically constructing a castle around your king."`
`"In that case, isn't holding the fort exactly what we should be doing now?!!"`
`"Perhaps, if we had a fort we could hold, but we cannot hope for such a thing now."`
`"It's difficult to corner a king with no wall to his back, and even more difficult to corner one with open spaces in all directions.`
` ...Think of a mouse.`
` You can catch a mouse that's shut in a cage.`
` However, catching a mouse in a field is like trying to catch a cloud."`
`"Natsuhi-sama,`
` ...please allow us to consider this option:`
` ...Kinzo-sama will leave his study and wander around the mansion on a whim, avoiding the gazes of the relatives.`
` ...We will think of a natural-seeming plan for this by morning."`
`"......Don't you see the danger...?`
` ...If we're willing to consider such a dangerous option, wouldn't it be better to continue acting as though Father's in his room in a bad mood...?"`
`"Tomorrow, the relatives will crowd around the study once again.`
` They'll be right on the other side of that single door.`
` When that happens, just how long do you intend to make it seem like they're having a yelling match with Kinzo-sama?!`
` It's impossible...!"`
`"And we must find some way to postpone that impossibility for 36 hours!!`
` If you tell me to do it, I will!!`
` I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi!`
` The wife of the Ushiromiya Family Head!!`
` If you tell me to do that, ...I will act out a shouting match with Father for as many days as it takes...!!`
` Aaaaaaagghhh!!"`
`...Even Natsuhi realized that she could never manage it.`
`But she no longer saw any chance of victory from a plan that involved an illusion of Kinzo walking around...`
`Banging on the desk several times, with tears of rage streaming down her face, `
`Natsuhi alternated between groaning from her headache and placing the blame on one thing or another.`
`It made one feel that there must be some curse that made anyone who sat in that chair act that way...`
`"......This is like a game of mating shogi, where you are on the defensive.`
` ...In mating shogi, the opponent has no king,`
` and you have no way of winning other than avoiding a checkmate for a predetermined number of moves."`
`"And to think...`
`...that I must escape for a whole day and a half's worth of moves...`
` ...It's just too many..."`
`"Don't stop thinking, ...don't give up...!`
` I'll listen to your complaints, so don't have a fit...!`
` Your unshaking will to overcome this trial will bring you success with certainty...!`
` That's the power of the Witch of Certainty for you."`
`"You must not lose that magical power.`
` ...Believe that you will overcome this no matter what...!`
` I'm sure you'll think of a brilliant plan.`
` Therefore, you mustn't give up, and you mustn't stop thinking...!"`
`"...You're right...`
` I understand...`
` Only I...can overcome this hardship..."`
`"That is correct.`
` Didn't Kinzo entrust you with the job of overcoming these challenges?`
` ...Kinzo acknowledged that you were worthy of that responsibility...!"`
`"......Father...`
`...Father, ...aaaaagggghhhh!!!"`
`"Teacher and Ronove will think of a move.`
` Of course, I will think as well!`
` However, even that we cannot do without permission from our master, ...from you!`
` So at the very least, don't abandon your will to fight...!`
` Don't give up...!!"`
`"I understand, ...I understand!!`
` But...I'm already...all tired out, ...and I can't stand this headache...`
` ...Why is it...that I'm crying here, ...all alone in this frigid study?!`
` Why...why isn't my husband here for me now?!"`
`Back when dinner ended, Krauss claimed to be dizzy and went to bed early.`
`Of course, he had done this to get enough rest to ready himself for the long day ahead, `
`but to Natsuhi right now, it felt as though he'd just gone straight to sleep and pushed the entire burden on her.`
`However, complaining about such a thing would mean her failure as a wife.`
`...Isn't it a good wife's duty to work hard and put family first, even when her husband is resting...?`
`Filled with regret even at her anger towards her husband,`
` ...unable to determine at whom she should be angry, Natsuhi continued to sob...`
`If only...Kinzo could just speak to her kindly at times like this.`
`Beato searched for him, but Kinzo had been nowhere to be seen in the study for some time now...`
`Perhaps Natsuhi had noticed this as well...`
`Though she bragged that fighting alone and supporting from behind was the responsibility of a good wife,`
` ...without anyone to tell her that this really was necessary, ......she was now so frail that she couldn't even stop her own tears.`
`Just as Beato was trying to think of words to console Natsuhi, Virgilia tapped her lightly on the shoulder.`
`...Sometimes, when words of consolation don't come from the mouth of the right person, they can do more harm than good.`
`So, Virgilia silently told Beato that remaining silent was the best course of action for now...`
`".........Hi, sorry to interrupt.`
` ...I know I'm an outsider, but I wonder if you'd let me speak."`
`"Gaap,`
` ...please restrain yourself for the time being."`
`"No, in this room, there's no distinction between outsiders, guests, and the rest of us.`
` ...You may speak."`
`"......Thank you.`
` ...Ronove said it himself a while ago.`
` This is mating shogi with you on the defensive.`
` ......How do you lose in mating shogi?`
` It's when your king is checkmated, right?"`
`"That goes without saying.`
` And the opponent has no king.`
` Therefore, all Natsuhi can do is have her king run away constantly."`
`"......I see.`
` ...So you're thinking of that move.`
` Has that time already come?"`
`"What do you mean?`
` ...Do you mean there's some sort of move remaining to us?"`
`"......It's what you proposed in the very beginning, about how to hide Goldsmith's death.`
` ...I'm trying to say the time's come for us to use that..."`
`"You mean...having him go missing...?!`
` You mean to make that move right now, during the family conference?!`
` That's too dangerous!"`
`Once they'd successfully resolved all of their problems, they would have to lay Kinzo to rest.`
`And the best way to do that...was to make him disappear.`
`One day, Kinzo would go out into the forest and never return.`
`They wouldn't be able to find him no matter how much they searched, so he would be declared 'missing'...`
`"......You said it yourself a second ago, Riiche.`
` You can't catch a mouse that's escaped into a field.`
` And you can't catch a Goldsmith who's disappeared into the forest."`
`"You plan for us to talk our way out of this like that?!`
` To use such a move now, when the suspicion against us is greatest, would be no better than committing suicide!!"`
`"Oh, they will probably suspect it.`
` Such a move would most certainly lead to mistrust.`
` ......However, even if they were to set foot in this study, they would find nothing to aid them.`
` ...It would never again be possible for them to keep Kinzo-sama pinned down, `
`and no matter how much they suspected his death, they would be unable to prove it..."`
`"Forget about a mere 36 hours, you'd be able to protect Kinzo's secret forever that way, right...?`
` ...Of course, we'll also have to bear an appropriate risk."`
`"...If you make that move, you may be able to overcome this particular challenge,`
` ...but we cannot even guess at how much prestige you might lose for it."`
`"Even so,`
` ......it's a move that will most certainly overcome our current challenge.`
` Of course, you'll then have to face an even greater suspicion.`
` But you won't die."`
`"...Y-`
`Yes, `
`...that may be true, but..."`
`"......During the Great Kanto Earthquake, the Ushiromiya family should have died.`
` However, the mad genius Goldsmith revived it so splendidly `
`that it's now something you desire to protect.`
` ...So this time, it is up to you and your husband, the new Head and his wife, to do the same."`
`"...Hoh...`
` ......Is that how you intend to stir her up?"`
`"I'm not stirring her up.`
` I'm just asking if she's prepared to be the wife of the Head...`
` ...Are you prepared to protect the Ushiromiya family, even if you end up getting dragged through the dirt to do it...?"`
`"...I-I am prepared..."`
`"Then now is the time.`
` ......If you can survive by being dragged through the dirt, then crawl with all your might.`
` You'll inch your way through this world of suffering, and eventually, you'll restore that glory.`
` ......I, Gaap, the 33rd in rank, promise you this."`
`"......Gaap..."`
`"......The fact that I came to play at a time like this must be a sign from the gods of happenstance...`
` ...I'll keep this promise, Ushiromiya Natsuhi.`
` I require nothing in return.`
` Riiche, the one who serves you, has already paid me plenty in advance."`
`Gaap may have seemed irresponsible, but she actually possessed a strong sense of duty.`
`She was the kind of person who just couldn't leave someone in trouble alone.`
`"Payment in advance?`
` Oh, when did I do that...?`
` I have no memory of such a thing..."`
`"*giggle*giggle*`
` ......Oh, I just mean those magical items you couldn't remember where you put.`
` I made off with quite a few of them."`
`"What?!!`
` So, that was your doing after all...!!`
` Give 'em back!!`
` Give back my Illusionary Silver Crystal and Moon Stick!`
` I still haven't played around by sticking them together yet!"`
`"......That's the sort of magic and strategy you can expect from me.`
` I can hide Goldsmith away in a world where no one will be able to find him.`
` ......Let me know the instant you need that magic.`
` Until then, feel free to think of another, safer plan."`
`"True, true.`
` ...Having alternatives is beneficial for your peace of mind.`
` ...And without that, you'll never think up a brilliant plan."`
`"Natsuhi-sama,`
` we have quite some time remaining us tonight.`
` ...Let's leave Gaap's strategy as a final trump card and iron out a plan of our own for now.`
` Please give us permission.`
` ...And...please give us the trust, magical power, and absolute conviction we'll need to succeed without fail."`
`"If you have faith, I will make your dreams come true.`
` If you succumb to doubt, then I will make those nightmares come true.`
` ...You must build your own future."`
`"..............."`
`Kinzo...would disappear.`
`And right in the middle of this family conference.`
`Such a move truly would be a last resort.`
`Burying this final trump card in her heart, ...Natsuhi decided that she would grope around for a different plan until the last second.`
`After all, this long, long night has only just begun...`
`...Bernkastel and her piece had just as long to prepare as Natsuhi did......`
`"...Gouge the foot...and kill.`
` ...And that completes it..."`
`"I see, ...so that really was what 'gouge' meant.`
` Once again, my reasoning was correct."`
`The feel of it this time was clearly different from the previous times,`
` as though some sort of device had activated.`
`However, as far as a quick glance could tell, there was no dramatic change, such as an entrance or some sort of opening.`
`Apparently, they would need to do just a little more before they could find it...`
`"You're incredible.`
` ......If we really do find the gold, we'll have to split it together."`
`"Enjoying the intellectual stimulation is enough for me.`
` .........The only thing I like is solving riddles.`
` The only reward I need is proof that I was right."`
`She shrugged it off, implying that just seeing the gold would be enough.`
`Then she crouched down, peering fixedly at the lock mechanism.`
`...It's definitely no mistake...to say this girl really loves solving riddles.`
`For her, treasure hunting is all about the delicious process of exposing secrets,`
` so she has no interest whatsoever in getting the treasure for herself and becoming a billionaire...`
`"...I see.`
` Pretty cocky of you, setting up a device like this...`
` ...The mistake 'you all' made was letting me on this island in the first place.`
` ......Simply by the existence of the epitaph in that place,`
` this level of reasoning is possible for Furudo Erika.`
` ...What do you think, everyone?"`
`As she said this to the now-exposed contraption, she grinned.`
`Her smile was triumphant, but it was more fully characterized by the small bit of unpleasant disdain contained within.`
`After solving the riddle, she was probably reveling in the pleasure of having won against the one who had proposed it, `
`and she enjoyed her ability to scoff at this person now...`
`"......If we find the gold now, the Successor won't be Krauss-san, but you."`
`"Heh.`
` ...Well, I wonder."`
`"...Isn't Krauss-san kind of arrogant?`
` You might even call him a braggart.`
` It'll be pretty amusing to see him lose both the gold and his position as the Successor to his nephew in the course of a single night, won't it?"`
`"..............."`
`Erika was still crouched down as she spoke, her back to Battler as she toyed around with the device...`
`"......Jessica-san...was her name, right?`
` The girl who talked back to me."`
`"Nng, ...yeah."`
`"......She really was acting big about her father being the Successor.`
` ...When she wakes up tomorrow and learns that you've inherited all the gold...`
`and that her father's no longer the Successor, I wonder what kind of expression she'll have on her face...?"`
`"......I've got no intention of keeping that 20 billion to myself.`
` ...Well, if I got even 10%, that'd be as much as I could handle.`
` We can split the rest fairly amongst the family.`
` I'm even less interested in being the Successor.`
` I'd be glad to let Uncle Krauss deal with that."`
`"......Will you really be able to settle things that easily in the end...?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*`
` Well, rather than trying to make guesses about that,`
` ...I imagine it'll be more fun to guess at the expression Jessica-san wears tomorrow...`
`and what kind of sad excuses she'll try to make."`
`"......You...really do have a nasty personality."`
`"Oh?`
` ......Couldn't you reason that out from the time you learned that I liked solving riddles...?`
` ......I'm an intellectual rapist, who enjoys exposing things people try to hide, get it?`
` ...The same thing goes for solving the epitaph's riddle."`
`"...I'll bet you wanted to expose the gold Grandfather worked so hard to hide."`
`"Yes, that was my goal at first,`
` ......but it changed partway through."`
`"Partway through?`
` ...Changed to what?"`
`"I mean Jessica-san.`
` ......She butted in on my reasoning, contaminating that pure and noble time.`
` ......Ever since then, I've been trying to solve the epitaph so I could teach that Jessica a lesson."`
`".........Are...you serious?"`
`"*giggle*`
` ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*`
` ...I'll make all opponents surrender, no matter who they are.`
` That is my sole pleasure.`
` ...Do you still need me to reason it out for you?"`
`"......Ushiromiya Jessica irritated me.`
` That's why I wanted to put her in her place and decided to solve the epitaph.`
` ......That's what led to the emotions I hold now.`
` ...Can you reason out what those emotions are?"`
`...This time, I turned my back on her in earnest.`
`Did I get a bit too excited by this riddle-solving game, letting her drive me on, `
`and do something terrible...?`
`That's right.`
`...It should have been possible to reason this out.`
`If the riddle is solved, the relatives will probably freak out about who the Successor should be.`
`Dad and some others will probably push for me, the discoverer, to be the Successor, and some relatives not thrilled with that prospect will probably oppose them.`
`Despite how adamantly Erika affirmed it, it isn't written anywhere that the one who solves the riddle of the epitaph becomes the Successor.`
`Because of this, it'll lead to a fight between those who acknowledge that theory and those who don't...`
`If I reason out what'll happen next, as Erika did...`
`...It'll probably lead to a messy fight between Uncle Krauss and the rest of the relatives.`
`Now that I've solved the riddle, ...will Jessica admire me, ...or curse me?`
`...I don't want to think about that now...`
`...Erika was still mumbling.`
`...Apparently, ...she had already started trying to reason it out...`
`As I began to feel very bad, ...I vaguely gazed out into the black night...`
`".........!"`
`At that time, ......I looked at a dim outdoor light...`
`...and saw the silhouette of a person in front of it.`
`I thought I must be seeing things.`
`After all, it was unthinkable that someone could've been standing there this whole time, pounded upon by the rain without even an umbrella.`
`However, `
`...the silhouette didn't move an inch, `
`......and maybe...`
`...no, it couldn't be...`
`......It was...looking at me.`
`And...it was......`
`"..............."`
`"..................G-"`
`...Grandfather............`
`At that moment, `
`...I understood.`
`Grandfather's probably...`
`...been watching us solve the riddle this whole time.`
`...And, `
`...he watched...`
`...as we spectacularly solved the whole thing...`
`"............`
`...............Hmph..."`
`Without a doubt, `
`......there was a faint smile on Grandfather's face.`
`Grandfather, who had never worn anything except moody and frightening expressions,`
` ...looked me in the eye...and smiled at me for the first time.`
`...Almost as though he was saying 'How impudent'.`
`Or else, 'I never thought it would be you'...`
`However, ...this is still the result...that Grandfather's epitaph chose.`
`So I'm sure...he accepted that result.`
`In the end, ...he grinned one more time.`
`Of course, he didn't use words.`
`His smile seemed to be wordlessly saying...`
`...well done...`
`...I didn't know how I should respond.`
`I couldn't do anything but stand there in shock, ignoring Erika as she crouched down, mumbling with her back towards me.`
`...Then, Grandfather stretched a hand out from the folds of his cloak and pointed at something.`
`When I looked in that direction, `
`...there was......`
`The thing he was pointing at...`
`...was probably...`
`...The signpost to the Golden Land.`
`...Go.`
`I'm sure Grandfather said that one word.`
`I...nodded to show that I understood.`
`After watching that, Grandfather nodded back, satisfied.`
`Then, with a spin of his cloak, `
`...he disappeared, seeming to melt into the darkness...`
`The expression on his face at the end...`
`...was a smile that was, for the first time, `
`...truly satisfied.`
`"Are you listening, Battler-san?`
` Did you hear my reasoning?"`
`".........I've found it.`
` That's the signpost to the Golden Land."`
`"...Huh?`
` Ah, ...it's facing a different direction than it used to.`
` ...I see.`
` So it means 'go that way'.`
` ...You've got some pretty good powers of observation."`
`"Grandfather told me about it."`
`"Huh? Kinzo-san...?`
` Where is he?"`
`"I'm going.`
` ......Let's have a look at what you're showing us.`
` ...Just what is this Golden Land..."`
`We started to walk.`
`The entrance to the Golden Land was right there......`
`"......So, my epitaph has finally been solved.`
` ...And...it was Battler who did it...`
` ......Pfft, ...hahahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` Wonderful, couldn't be better."`
`When I think about it, I was also a Head that no one saw coming.`
`How amusing that the one to succeed me is just as surprising.`
`"I have no more regrets in life!!`
` Beatrice, I am coming to join you.`
` Along with a present, the miracle chosen by my epitaph...!"`
`Battler, of all people.`
`...That...Battler...!!`
`"Wahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` Wahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` At the very, very end of my life, I have seen a true miracle!!"`
`"Beatriceeeeeeeee!`
` I've won this beeeeeeettt, waaahhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaaaahhh!!!"`
`"Ha, hahahahaha...!!`
` Yahoo!!`
` Hahahahahaaaahhh!!!"`
`"......Except for its non-corrosive properties, there's no practical way to turn gold into money.`
` I imagine it'd take a lot of work to exchange all of this for cash."`
`At the end of a crude underground tunnel, in a VIP room so beautiful it seemed improper,`
` ......was a pile of gold so large that there could be no doubting its 20 billion yen worth...`
`Erika was calm, but Battler couldn't suppress his excitement.`
`As for which of the two was the correct reaction to show after seeing a mountain of gold, `
`...only those who saw the scene with their own eyes could say for sure...`
`In this day and age, it's said that an average salaryman earns about 200 million yen in wages over his life.`
`...And this is 20 billion yen worth of gold.`
`With even one hundredth of this gold mountain, ...a single human could live their entire life without working.`
`What is labor?`
`Isn't it the very point of a human's life, since a person who doesn't work cannot eat...?`
`If so, then 200 million yen is enough to make a single person's life complete.`
`And this is 20 billion yen!`
`...This would account for the labors of a hundred humans, no, a single human life one hundred times over...!`
`Of course, if you still wanted to work, you could.`
`Any money you gained as a result could be used to play with.`
`After all, you would already have enough money to live for your entire life, no, for eternity...!!`
`No, wait, I mustn't keep it all to myself. I can split it up among 100 people.`
`If I could create a world where a full 100 humans wouldn't have to work for their whole lives, ...just what kind of world would that be...?`
`......Yeah, ...there's no doubt at all...`
`"This......is the Golden Land..."`
`"There you go.`
` Bern-Battler magnificently discovered the gold.`
` Congrats.`
` Heheheheheheheheh!!`
` I had her hide the more central parts of it, but what's wrong with being just a little mean, right?"`
`"...Sure, do that as much as you like.`
` I'm not interested in the micro details, about what kind of riddle it was or what kind of answer it had.`
` The important thing is that as a result, 10 tons of gold were discovered."`
`The gold was discovered in the 3rd game as well, by Aunt Eva.`
`Aunt Rosa also witnessed it.`
`However, the two of them hadn't spoken of the gold's discovery to anyone.`
`In other words, there was a chance that the gold's discovery was a cat-box truth kept between the two of them.`
`More specifically, it was possible the gold didn't exist and was just an illusion...!`
`"However, ...'I' have finally found it...`
` The cat box...has been opened...!"`
`"It'd be a waste of time to do that 'repeat it' game, so I'll give you a little bonus.`
` #ff0000This mountain of gold is real.`
` All of the ingots piled up here are real, pure gold!`
` There are absolutely no tricks such as replicas or fakes!!#ffffff"`
`"...Okay, got it.`
` I'll accept that this gold exists.`
` ...However, there are still some things I can't accept!"`
`"......Of course.`
` You met with him, didn't you?`
` ...With Kinzo."`
`"*giggle*giggle*!`
` Even though Kinzo's supposedly an illusion, you met with him just a second ago, right?`
` *giggle*giggle* I guess that really was magic, wasn't it?!"`
`"Ridiculous.`
` ...'I' didn't exchange any words with Grandfather.`
` ...I only felt as though Grandfather and I had exchanged words.`
` Give it a rest. The same move won't work again!"`
`"In that case, your blue truth, if you please!"`
`"#5DECFFI was probably in an excited state after solving the epitaph's riddle.`
` Then I mistook something for Grandfather.#ffffff"`
`"#5DECFFFor example, maybe there was some kind of sheet or cover that had gotten caught in a dark grove of trees,`
` which looked like Grandfather wearing a pitch-black cloak!`
` As a result, I mistakenly thought that I'd had some sort of conversation with Grandfather.#ffffff"`
`"......Blue truth, valid.`
` Well, I did say the exact same thing in blue."`
`"So? Did it work?`
` Where's your counter with the red truth...?!"`
`"I have none.`
` At least, not now, okay?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`The 'me' who'd let out a strange yell in front of the gold mountain was finally starting to regain his cool.`
`......Now that we've found it, there's no covering it up.`
`I vaguely considered keeping this discovery a secret.`
`...However, Erika wanted to prove that her own reasoning was correct by announcing this to everyone.`
`She really is an intellectual rapist, ...just as she says.`
`The puzzle-solving game is what's important to her,`
` and she doesn't intend to take any responsibility for what happens after the riddle is solved.`
`...A riddle is sort of like a lock.`
`Locks exist to be locked.`
`And they're only significant when they're locked.`
`Therefore, it ought to be essential to have some goal in mind when exposing such a thing.`
`However, ...to this girl, the act of exposing is itself her final goal,`
` ...and she has no intention of taking responsibility for anything that happens later.`
`...Maybe the true storm to hit Rokkenjima...`
`...isn't the typhoon, but her.`
`She won't keep this discovery secret.`
`She'll definitely announce it so she can brag about her success.`
`Then, ...she'll call a real storm down upon this island.`
`I won't be able to keep this covered up...`
`...In that case, ...there's nothing to do but announce this fact fairly to all.`
`I can't imagine what'll happen after that.`
`As she grinned, Erika muttered to herself.`
`...She must've been anticipating the uproar that the relatives would soon bring about.`
`To her,`
` ...merely imagining that was far sweeter than 20 billion yen in gold...`
`"...Simply by the existence of the epitaph in that place,`
` this level of reasoning is possible for Furudo Erika.`
` ...What do you think, everyone?"`
`*knock*knock*knock*knock*!!!`
`The sudden sound of someone banging fiercely on the door brought Natsuhi to her senses.`
`She had probably nodded off in the study while planning how they would overcome the next day.`
`But...what could it be...?`
`At a time like this...`
`More importantly, the knock itself was strange.`
`If someone wanted to contact her, they could've just used the internal phone line.`
`She'd told them that she'd be here.`
`Realizing that something strange was going on,`
` Natsuhi shook her head one more time, completely throwing off her drowsiness.`
`"Father, Father...!!`
` It's Eva.`
` I have an urgent, vital matter to discuss with you!"`
`It was Eva's voice.`
`...What is this?`
`I thought I told them to lock the doors and windows of the mansion tightly after everyone left for the guesthouse.`
`So why is Eva here...?!`
`Natsuhi ran up to the door, responded with a small knock, and spoke through the door in a quiet voice.`
`"......What is it? You're too noisy!"`
`"Natsuhi nee-san...?!`
` Why are you in Father's study at this hour?!"`
`"...I told you to be quiet!`
` Have you forgotten that the Head values peace and silence more than anything else...?!"`
`"Now's not the time to be saying that!!`
` Stop harping on that, and open up quickly!!`
` Bring Father out!!"`
`"The Head just went to sleep!`
` I don't know what business you have, but I will deal with it tomorrow!"`
`"I don't have any business with you!!`
` Just open up right now!!"`
`Sometimes, multiple schemes and assumptions can fall apart due to the most direct, simple, and emotional of strategies.`
`This is bad...`
`If I open the door, Eva will probably throw herself forwards and rush into the study.`
`Now, I can't even open this door...!`
`At that moment, the phone suddenly rang.`
`I-It's okay.`
`Both of the keys to the study are here.`
`No one can open this door...!`
`Natsuhi inched away from the door and grabbed the receiver...`
`"H-Hello!!`
` It's Natsuhi!"`
`"It's me...`
` Things are bad.`
` I want you to come down to the parlor, quickly."`
`It was from Krauss.`
`His tone was strained.`
`...What in the world happened...?!`
`"It would seem that Battler-kun and this guest called Erika...`
`...solved the witch's epitaph and found the gold."`
`"Huh? ............`
`...I-Is that true?!"`
`"Rudolf and the rest have forced their way in.`
` They're saying Battler-kun will show everyone the way to the hidden gold..."`
`"Right now, Eva-san is just outside the study door, yelling at me to open it...!`
` But if I do that now, she might push her way inside...!!"`
`"...I-I understand.`
` I will go there too.`
` Don't worry about Eva.`
` Just stay there and don't do anything...!`
` I'll give you a signal once I've gotten Eva away from the door, so leave as soon as you hear that.`
` Ready...?!"`
`Right after that, Krauss came up the staircase, accompanied by Genji.`
`A heated debate started between him and Eva. "Open up!" "No, calm down."`
`In the middle of that, there was a small knock as a signal.`
`...Krauss had cleverly pushed Eva away from the door and distracted her.`
`During that gap, Natsuhi slipped out of the study and quickly shut the door...`
`Eva noticed this, and her face twisted in disappointment, `
`but the heavy sound of the auto-lock had already rung out, and the door had been sealed.`
`"The gold of the epitaph has been found!`
` It's only natural that we should inform Father about this...!!`
` Or else what?`
` Is there some reason you can't tell Father about this?!"`
`"Father gave strict orders that he not be awakened--no matter what--after he went to bed.`
` Following those orders is the duty of the Head's representative.`
` Isn't that right, Genji-san?"`
`"......Yes.`
` The Master's sleep must not be disturbed, no matter what happens."`
`"Even a rule like that depends on time and circumstances, doesn't it...?!!`
` I mean, the epitaph was solved!!`
` Father has a right to know straight away!"`
`"Of course, the two of us will report on everything to the Head tomorrow.`
` That's our duty as the Head's representatives."`
`"I don't care about that!!`
` Come on, just open this door!!`
` Let me see Father!!`
` Father, Father, can you hear me?`
` It's Eva!!`
` Please open up!!"`
`"Owowow, let go of me...!!`
` Th-That hurts...!!"`
`"We're telling you to listen to us...!`
` Don't knock on the door so loudly...!!"`
`"Ouch, owowowowow...!!`
` Let go, let go of me!!"`
`"Krauss-sama, Eva-sama,`
` the Master is sleeping.`
` Please refrain from disturbing him any further...!"`
`When Genji spoke firmly, the two finally ceased their scuffle.`
`It seemed that Genji, the one who had spoken for Kinzo since they were very young, `
`still possessed an air of dignity strong enough to handle both Krauss and Eva...`
`Eva put her argument aside for the time being.`
`She could hold off worrying about that until after she saw the gold with her own eyes.`
`After all, not even Eva had seen it for herself yet.`
`Natsuhi and the others had managed to somehow deal with the momentary crisis.`
`...However, the move of the demons that would sneer upon their efforts...had already begun...`
`"Battler......solved the riddle of the epitaph, you say...?!"`
`"Yes.`
` ...Though he had a lot of help from that Erika girl, Battler was the one who reached the answer.`
` Erika has proclaimed that she will abandon her rights to the Golden Land.`
` ...Therefore, the one who reached the Golden Land...is Battler."`
`"......Fate can be truly amusing.`
` To think that Battler-sama...would make it there."`
`"What will you do, Beato?`
` ...You promised to stop the ceremony if anyone solved the epitaph's riddle."`
`"Yes.`
` ...That was the deal."`
`"............That was the deal.`
` Indeed..."`
`"Apparently, Battler-sama does not intend to become the master of the Golden Land.`
` ...It now seems that no one will become our master."`
`"That is also fate.`
` It has been several decades since we first manifested in the Human world through our bond with Lord Goldsmith.`
` ...The time since then has been so very fun."`
`"......Come on, Lia, you sound like an old lady.`
` ...So, what're we going to do?`
` If we go by Riiche and Goldsmith's rules, now that Battler's solved the epitaph and decided not to become our master,`
` we've been relieved from duty, right?"`
`"That's true.`
` ...I have no regrets at all.`
` I've been prepared to be kicked down into Cocytus all this time."`
`"Wait.`
` We can't let that happen.`
` ...You might not have any regrets, but I will keep on serving Natsuhi.`
` It would be quite irresponsible to let ourselves be relieved from duty just because Battler solved the epitaph.`
` ...Witches are forbidden from breaking contracts, but they also must not fail to show gratitude."`
`"...True.`
` We should serve her until the family conference ends."`
`"In that case, you won't be relieved from duty for a while either, Lord Goldsmith.`
` ...Perhaps you should wait until you've overcome this family conference safely, said goodbye to Natsuhi-sama at the very least,`
` ...and if possible, rewarded her for all her efforts."`
`".........Indeed.`
` ...She has done well supporting my foolish son."`
`"You're a fallen angel with one of its wings plucked off, aren't you?`
` Just leave the other wing as a parting gift and go."`
`"...Indeed.`
` ...Perhaps that would be fitting.`
` Natsuhi may be worthy of bearing my wing.`
` ...However, ......we are approaching the critical moment.`
` ...Your reward is waiting for you.`
` Try to make it through this test unscathed, ...Natsuhi..."`
`The mountain of gold left everyone speechless.`
`Regardless of how strongly they had believed in its existence, `
`...no one could look at this much real gold and not be shocked...`
`"......To think a place like this existed......"`
`"I can't believe it...`
` ...That Dad......"`
`Everyone was stunned by the gold.`
`The first one to break the silence and jump around in ecstasy was Hideyoshi.`
`Letting out an excited laugh, he clung to the wall of gold.`
`Then he felt the cold, hard touch of it all over his cheek.`
`"W-Wahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` Th-This is incredible!`
` It's the real thing!!"`
`"......H-Hahahahahahaha!!`
` That damn Dad of ours, sticking this much gold in such a ridiculous place!!"`
`"Now that we have this much, `
`...we no longer...`
`have anything to fear...`
` With this, `
`...we could overcome any kind of trial...!`
` Rosaaa...!!"`
`"Nee-san, ...Nee-san...`
` We'll be able to find happiness with this, right...?"`
`Eva and Rosa moved towards each other at the same time and hugged as they broke down crying...`
`Ecstasy and shock, ...wonder and sighs.`
`After stepping forward in front of the pile of gold that had caused these mixed emotions,`
` ...Erika spoke as though she were an announcer in some show.`
`"......If this world is money, then this gold is the embodiment of happiness.`
` ...Congratulations, everyone.`
` I pray that this discovery makes all of your lives richer."`
`"I take my hat off to you...`
` ...To think you'd solve the epitaph within a single day of coming to this island."`
`"......If you couldn't solve it in a single day, then you wouldn't be able to solve it no matter how many days you had.`
` After all, it doesn't take more than an instant for your little gray cells to give you a flash of intuition.`
` ...Also, I wouldn't have been able to solve this riddle myself.`
` I ask that you praise Battler-san's achievement as well, everyone."`
`"..............."`
`"...I abandon any rights to this discovery.`
` I'm already satisfied to have my reasoning proven correct.`
` So, I'd like give Battler-san full credit."`
`"...I may be here, but please continue your discussion as though I wasn't.`
` Battler-san called all of the adults here, making sure that none of the cousins would notice.`
` That can only mean one thing.`
` ...He must have wanted to begin the true family conference with all of you."`
`"...Erika,`
` quit deciding things on your own."`
`"My apologies.`
` .........In that case, I'll step down as the facilitator of these proceedings.`
` So, who will take my place?"`
`Shrugging, Erika looked around at everyone.`
`...After a short period of silence, Eva made the first move.`
`"None of us have forgotten the deal we made earlier today, right?"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"Yeah.`
` Divide it between the four of us, with 2.5 billion for each.`
` And then, ~ib~the Successor~ib~ gets another 10 billion."`
`"......W-Wait a second!`
` Who decided that the one who discovers the gold becomes the Successor?!"`
`"Hold up, you won't be able to get away with that, Natsuhi-san...!!`
` We've all been arguing based on that premise this whole time, haven't we?!`
` You really think you can pretend that never happened now?!"`
`"...That's right.`
` ...Weren't you the one worrying about how, if one of the servants solved the riddle, they might consider themselves the Successor...?"`
`"But nowhere is it explicitly written that that's the truth, right?!"`
`"You bastard!!!`
` We were all aware of it, weren't we?!!"`
`"That's right, Aniki!`
` Are you gonna change your position this late in the game?!"`
`"Though it was never stipulated, I believe it was common knowledge between us.`
` I don't see how you can suggest we ignore it completely."`
`"You can't just interpret the Head's epitaph however you like!!`
` Where is it written that the one who finds the gold becomes the Successor?!`
` The epitaph was decided upon by the Head.`
` You have no right to decide these things for yourselves!!"`
`"......Calm down, Natsuhi."`
`"How could I calm down?!`
` Yes, I do find it quite impressive that Battler-kun solved the epitaph!`
` I certainly believe he should be rewarded for it.`
` However, it's clearly a stretch to suggest that he deserves half of everything,`
` and you won't get away with the argument that the discoverer becomes the Successor...!!"`
`"Th-That's low, Natsuhi nee-san...!`
` This is completely different from what you were saying earlier today...!"`
`"I agree!`
` Though it was never stipulated, the fact that whoever solves the epitaph becomes the Successor has always been the greatest unwritten rule we've had...!`
` It's not fair if you start complaining about that at the last second, right?`
` Yeah, it isn't fair!!"`
`"Anyway!!`
` This gold is Father's!!`
` We can't decide how it will be split up without Father's permission!!"`
`"No way!!`
` That's low, Natsuhi-san!`
` We were talkin' about this on and on earlier, right?!`
` Are you sayin' that whole conversation today was a bunch of bull?!`
` It just ain't right!!"`
`"Why don't we just vote on it?!!`
` Battler-kun, the one who found the gold, is the Successor!`
` My husband and I have no objections!!`
` What about you, Rudolf and Kyrie-san?`
` Rosa?!"`
`"No objections here. Nice going, Battler!!"`
`"I have no objections either.`
` Battler-kun is the true Successor, chosen by the epitaph.`
` If you aren't satisfied, then why don't we just ask Father directly...?!"`
`"That's right.`
` Like you just said, Natsuhi nee-san, Father is the one who wrote the riddle of the epitaph.`
` And he's also the proper owner of this gold.`
` In that case, shouldn't we talk to Father about this directly?`
` How should Battler-kun, the person who discovered the gold, be treated?`
` I believe Father is the only one capable of making such a decision...!"`
`"B-But...!!"`
`"...Didn't I tell you to calm down? ........."`
`"Rosa and Kyrie-san are right.`
` Let's ask Father!!`
` Your turn is already over, Nii-san, Natsuhi nee-san!!"`
`"Yeah, yeah!!`
` Bring Father out to us!!`
` We won't get anywhere with just you two!`
` Let's begin the real family conference!!`
` Does this look like something you can put off just because he's tired?!`
` If we take this thing lightly, we'll have a massive problem on our hands...!`
` Hey, are you listening?!!`
` We won't get anywhere with just you!!`
` Bring Father out right noooooow!!!"`
`".........Are family conferences always like this?"`
`"...How the hell'd I know?"`
`"They're probably always like this on the inside.`
` ......Heheheheh.`
` Looks like they won't be able to get this figured out right now without Kinzo-san.`
` ...To think he's being called out to settle his children's fight, even though it's been announced that he has only a short while to live.`
` ...I wonder how he feels right about now.`
` *giggle*`
` Imagining that...no, reasoning that out will be a treat."`
`The parents ignored Battler and Erika...and kept yelling at each other, on and on...`
`Even though Battler had more or less imagined that this sort of thing happened behind the scenes, this was the first time he'd seen it.`
`He'd suspected it since six years ago,`
` and he'd been able to get a pretty good idea of what this was like `
`by the darkening expressions on his parents' faces when this time of year drew near...`
`However, this argument his relatives were having before his very eyes...`
`...was much more...`
`...ugly than he'd imagined...`
`That's why he was very glad that he'd called the adults out here without letting the cousins catch wind of anything...`
`Perhaps because everyone was tired out from this seemingly endless argument, they took a short break.`
`It was decided that this family conference inside the Golden Land should be moved over to the mansion...`
`This place may have been gorgeous, like a VIP room, `
`but there was no heating, and it was a little cold.`
`It wasn't well suited for a long conversation.`
`They thought of the possibility that someone might snatch the gold away while their backs were turned,`
` but of course, no one could manage much with just human hands and a small amount of time when it's 10 tons of gold they're dealing with.`
`In fact, it might be said that having this mountain of gold in the background was actually robbing them of the ability to make sound decisions.`
`So they agreed to return to the mansion, in part so that they could regain their composure and continue the conference more cold-bloodedly...`
`"...Then, if you would excuse me for the night.`
` ...I imagine I'd just get in the way if I remained any longer."`
`"Sure, sorry.`
` Did we bother you too much?"`
`"Let us show our gratitude again tomorrow.`
` Sorry for letting you see such an embarrassing side of us."`
`"You said that you refused, `
`but allow us to prepare a fitting portion, out of gratitude, for you as one of the first to discover the gold.`
` Right, Nii-san?"`
`"...Yes.`
` We know what you're capable of.`
` I think you can grasp our current circumstances."`
`20 billion yen in gold isn't something they wanted out in the open.`
`They didn't want an outsider like Erika telling people about it.`
`Of course, Erika had already 'reasoned out' that much.`
`She wore an unpleasant smile on her face, as though she understood all too well...`
`"...You don't need to worry about me.`
` Of course, I have no desire to tell anyone else about this.`
` ...And if I did, no one would believe me without proof."`
`"......I got to see something interesting tonight.`
` It was quite a spectacle, so I'm more than satisfied."`
`"Heheh, I see.`
` I guess it's not every day you see 10 tons of gold."`
`...Seeing the gold was the spectacle?`
` Of course not.`
`Judging by Erika's dark nature, it's obvious what she's so happy about.`
`I thought about telling her to just go away, but even I wanted to get out of this place...`
`I tried to head back to the guesthouse along with Erika.`
`However, Kyrie-san grabbed my shoulder.`
`"You can't go, Battler-kun.`
` Please come with us."`
`"Yes, yes.`
` You're now a real Successor!`
` You've gotta have an audience with Father and have him acknowledge you right away...!"`
`"That's something only the Family Head may decide!!`
` Don't make things up on your own!"`
`"...Battler,`
` I realize it'll be a pain, but stick around with us for a bit longer.`
` Don't say anything.`
` Just stay quiet and keep your head down.`
` Got it?"`
`".........Just do whatever you want."`
`It would have been easy to say that I had no interest in being the Successor.`
`...But I was sure that would only add more oil to the fire.`
`Even if I hadn't been ordered to keep quiet, staying shut up like a clam was clearly a good idea...`
`In that case, would it really be so bad if they just let me go back to the guesthouse...?`
`Dad put his arm firmly around my shoulder, and I told him it was uncomfortable and to let go.`
`However, he didn't pay attention to a word I said...`
`"......I've solved the epitaph.`
` Just like you wanted."`
`"..............."`
`"When you were the Game Master, we'd always get those letters.`
` ...'Try and solve the epitaph'.`
` 'If you don't, I'll kill you all'."`
`"..............."`
`......Why did she want to make us solve the riddle of the epitaph?`
`By solving it, we found a mountain of gold.`
`Yippee for us.`
`And what about Beato?`
`...Does she gain anything...by having us find the gold?`
`Or does she lose something...?`
`"...As far as chessboard thinking tells us, ...people don't ever make moves that cause them to lose something.`
` That means you must have something to gain by having us solve the epitaph..."`
`"No.`
` #ff0000This child has nothing to gain from having someone solve the epitaph.#ffffff"`
`"......Are you sure that's okay?`
` ...Using red like that without her permission."`
`"...This child most likely wishes for it."`
`Virgilia, who had suddenly appeared there, quickly gave an answer to my question with the red truth...`
`"In the past, I sometimes guessed that Beato tried to make us solve the epitaph...`
`because she wanted to make us find the gold's hiding place for her, so she could snatch it away.`
` ......Is that wrong too?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...In the first place, `
`#ff0000the gold of the Golden Land belongs to this child.#ffffff`
` #ff0000She had absolutely no need to make someone find it for her or to snatch it away herself.#ffffff"`
`Of course.`
`...Beato is Beatrice the Golden.`
`Isn't she the master of the Golden Land and the Ushiromiya family alchemist?`
`...That totally makes sense.`
`However, that makes me even more confused.`
`...Even if someone exposed the answer to the epitaph's riddle, Beato has nothing to gain.`
`No, to the contrary, her own gold might be stolen away.`
`"In that case, I'm understanding this less and less.`
` ......I understand the epitaph murders.`
` It might be revenge against the Ushiromiya family, or else a ceremony to revive her powers as a witch.`
` ...After all, she's probably doing it because of some reason or goal of her own."`
`"..............."`
`"But what's the point of her telling us to solve the epitaph?`
` Whether we solve it or not, she has nothing to gain at all.`
` ...In other words, the whole issue of whether the epitaph is solved or not...is immaterial in Beato's eyes."`
`"...You're right.`
` #ff0000Whether the epitaph's riddle is solved or not, this child stands nothing to gain at all.#ffffff"`
`"It doesn't matter whether it's solved or not.`
` ...In other words, could we say that the epitaph's riddle itself is immaterial to Beato...?"`
`"............`
`...You're right.`
` The epitaph's riddle doesn't have any meaning for this child.`
` So even if you take it to an extreme and call the epitaph's riddle immaterial, it may not be possible to argue against your claim..."`
`"..............."`
`Beato...`
`...Why are you making us solve the epitaph's riddle...?`
`If we liken the witch you are to a pair of scales, the epitaph murders lie on one plate...`
`And the riddle of the epitaph lies on the other plate.`
`After all, she's saying she'll stop the epitaph murders if the epitaph is solved.`
`...In other words, the epitaph murders and the epitaph's riddle are worth the same to Beato.`
`Like two sides on a balanced scale.`
`That means that both the epitaph's riddle and massacring all the relatives...`
`are equally significant from Beato's point of view......`
`But Virgilia responded with the red truth.`
`#ff0000Regardless of whether the epitaph is solved or not, Beato has nothing to gain.#ffffff`
`If she has nothing to gain, then this epitaph's riddle...is meaningless and immaterial to Beato.`
`In that case, how much are the epitaph murders, which lie on the other side of the scales and are equal to the epitaph's riddle in value, `
`...worth to her...?`
`...Think, don't stop thinking...`
`The epitaph murders and solving the riddle of the epitaph have equal worth.`
`As long as the epitaph murders, which are Beato's goal each time, have this single way that they can be stopped,`
` a way that she decided on herself,`
` both are worth the same thing to her.`
`X=Y.`
`And whether the epitaph's riddle is solved or not, Beato has nothing to gain.`
`Y=0.`
`So, in this case, ...what is X...?`
`"..............."`
`"...Wait a sec.`
` ...That means the epitaph murders are also meaningless and immaterial."`
`"...Every time she performs these bizarre serial murders,`
` she's willing to spend an incredible amount of effort to politely send advance notice...`
`and then kills us one by one in accordance with the epitaph, never getting exposed.`
` So all of that is meaningless to her...?"`
`I spun the chessboard around and searched through Beato's moves over and over.`
`This is always the first place I stumble.`
`The significance of the epitaph murders.`
`Why did she have to commit serial murders in a way that reproduced the witch's epitaph?`
`If she wanted to kill the whole Ushiromiya family for revenge, it'd be much simpler, safer, and more reliable if she just put poison into their dinner...`
`or else went around killing people one by one in the middle of the night while they were sleeping.`
`However, on the first evening, Beato sent us a letter that sounded like an advance notice...`
`and then carried out a three-part serial murder with large gaps in between:`
` the six people of the first twilight, the two people of the second twilight, and the five people of the fourth and later twilights.`
`We aren't fools.`
`Once the first murders occur, we barricade ourselves in somewhere to stave off any further murders.`
`Furthermore, we quickly suspect a culprit among us and start analyzing each other's alibis.`
`As the victims increase, the number of suspects decreases automatically,`
` and Beato's chances of success in this serial murder drop closer and closer to zero...`
`All the epitaph murders...are like she's strangling her own neck, making it harder to succeed in this serial murder she's attempting.`
` ...All for a useless embellishment, ...all just for show.`
`"......She's raising the difficulty of completing her own objective."`
`"That does follow.`
` ...She really is a strange child."`
`"Did you know?`
` In mystery novels, they call things like these epitaph murders 'plotline murders'.`
` ...I think you can split the possible motives for plotline murders like this into three groups."`
`"...And what are those?"`
`"Well, first off, maybe following the epitaph gives rise to misconceptions about evidence and alibis, which might benefit the culprit.`
` ...Pretending to be dead and mixing yourself in with the victims would fit this pattern,`
` as would committing murders that don't actually follow the epitaph, giving yourself an alibi by getting people to incorrectly guess the order of events."`
`"I see.`
` So perhaps she only made it look as though she was killing them in a ceremonial fashion, following the epitaph, ...when she was actually guiding their thinking in a manner that benefited her.`
` I do find that intriguing."`
`"......However, in our games, the dead are truly down for the count thanks to the red.`
` ...While she might've confused people in the world of the game board, she can't confuse us up here like that.`
` ...In other words, the most obvious possible goal for her...isn't the real one."`
`"In that case, what are the other two possible reasons for carrying out plotline murders?"`
`"Another one is coincidence.`
` ...A crime just happens to resemble the epitaph, without anyone in particular trying to make it do so,`
` and the witnesses mistakenly think it's a plotline murder.`
` Humans try to find cause and effect in everything they see.`
` ...If we think we know what something is, then that's how it looks to us."`
`"...I see.`
` That's intriguing too.`
` ...But would that really work?`
` In this child's games, advance notice of the crime is always given before the murders of the first twilight.`
` Also, I believe you've repeatedly found letters and circumstantial evidence that clearly show that the culprit is carrying out epitaph murders."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` ......It isn't coincidence.`
` From the very beginning, Beato's been advancing with the goal of making this look like a series of epitaph murders.`
` We weren't mistaken about that.`
` These are clear 'plotline murders'.`
` So, this motive--or lack of motive--doesn't work either."`
`"In that case, ...there's only one motive left, right?"`
`"The last one......is because they want to show someone something.`
` More specifically, fear.`
` ...By following the epitaph, she gives the others clear notice in advance that the murders will continue.`
` The survivors are in constant fear of the murders, which they're certain will continue."`
`"..............."`
`"In other words, `
`...this child performed these epitaph murders to make someone feel the fear of death?"`
`"Or at least, ...that'd explain things pretty well.`
` ...The grotesque mutilation of corpses and the dark decorations were all a show to terrify us..."`
`"To terrify whom...?"`
`"Huh?`
` ...Well, like I said, us.`
` ............"`
`After hearing that one line Virgilia spoke so casually, ...my thoughts clouded over once again...`
`Is it really sufficient to use the vague word 'us'...?`
`There are many humans in the Ushiromiya family.`
`There's the Head and the one who holds the rank of his Successor, ...Grandfather and Uncle Krauss.`
`There's the relatives, who have some pull in the business world.`
`...On the other side, you have the young cousins, who usually visit at most once a year,`
` and the unfortunate servants, who just happened to be on duty that day.`
`...Even if the culprit hates all of us,`
` ...there should be clear differences in how much they hate some of us compared to others.`
`So, it should be possible to pick out people among us that the culprit especially wanted to terrorize or have revenge against.`
`If we liken this to a kid eating dessert...`
`Isn't the strawberry on top of a shortcake the part you should eat last?`
`No one tells you that you shouldn't eat it first, but our mentality encourages us to save it for later.`
`"......In that case, ...the culprit would want to leave the person they hated most until the end.`
` ...Yeah, like that line by my favorite character in this novel I like.`
` Something about how the worst way to kill someone is to 'murder those close to them first, `
`make them as miserable as possible, and only kill the person then'."`
`"Oh my, that must have been quite a terrifying novel.`
` How frightening..."`
`"...In that case, you could argue that the people who stay alive until the end are the ones Beato hates the most.`
` ...However, every single time, the order people get killed changes around completely.`
` ...If we try counting up the people who live until the last twilight every single time, `
`even though they do die in the end,`
` .........`
`............"`
`"..............."`
`...I'm the only one.`
`"......Let me first speak with the red.`
` #ff0000Battler-kun isn't the culprit.#ffffff`
` #ff0000Battler-kun didn't kill anyone.#ffffff`
` #ff0000This can be said of all games.#ffffff"`
`"Then that......just makes it even more likely that it's me.`
` ...It means the sole reason she had for bringing about the epitaph murders...was to show them to me."`
`Every time, Beato brags that she'll choose whom to kill next with a roulette.`
`However, I'm the only one she never kills.`
`...Though she does kill me in the end, she leaves me be until the very last moment.`
`In all of these supposedly random games, there's only this one unchanging constant...`
`"She wants......revenge? Against me?`
` So, is she performing the epitaph murders to make me feel fear...?"`
`"That's wrong.`
` ...#ff0000Her goal is not to make someone experience fear.#ffffff`
` #ff0000And it isn't to have revenge on someone either.#ffffff"`
`"In that case,`
` the epitaph murders really don't mean anything to her!`
` The epitaph's riddle is meaningless, and the corresponding epitaph murders are also meaningless.`
` X=Y=0!`
` But even so, she's clearly trying to show these meaningless things to me!"`
`"What could she want from me...that'd be worth the same to her as something meaningless?!`
` ...I don't get it!!`
` The more I think about it, the less I understand what she's thinking!"`
`"..............."`
`Beatrice,`
` the fickle witch who committed a meaningless, worthless string of serial murders.`
`Even the epitaph's riddle, which that witch used as the trigger that could suspend the serial murders, `
`...is meaningless, immaterial.`
`And yet...she's thrusting this meaningless, immaterial thing in front of my face.`
`...What is it...that you want from me...?`
`...Or else, what is it that you're giving me...?`
`My idea that Beato has clearly been taking revenge on me...has already been denied by Virgilia's red truth.`
`Both X and Y.`
`Both the epitaph murders and the epitaph's riddle hold no meaning for Beatrice.`
`X=Y=0.`
`However, since she's thrusting those things in front of me, `
`...they must...`
`...have some meaning.`
`She showed us the scales representing 'if you don't solve the epitaph, I'll carry out the epitaph murders'.`
`In other words, neither the epitaph murders nor the epitaph's riddle have any significance by themselves.`
`However, it becomes meaningful when she puts both halves on the scales and puts them on display before us......no, before me.`
`...In other words, it should be like this:`
`X=0.`
`Y=0.`
`X+Y>0.`
`A scale with meaningless, weightless things on both sides.`
`However, it has weight itself...and gives the rest meaning.`
`"...It's almost like...playing.`
` Like kids playing rock, paper, scissors."`
`Rock, paper, scissors is an extremely familiar method of randomly determining a winner and loser.`
`You sometimes wager some sort of reward on the outcome,`
` ...but kids often do rock, paper, scissors just to play, without betting anything in particular.`
`Unless you bet something, you have nothing to gain or lose except happiness and frustration.`
`In other words, the two sides of the scale, both winning and losing, are immaterial.`
`However, the very act of seeing which way it will tip...`
`is the reason kids play rock, paper, scissors.`
`After all, the kids are enjoying the communication that surrounds the game,`
` ...and they aren't purely interested in the value of winning or losing.`
`They aren't overly concerned about who wins and who loses...`
`"That would mean it doesn't matter to Beato...whether the epitaph murders succeed or not.`
` ...It almost feels like she's just enjoying the process."`
`"............"`
`"...In the past, ...I cursed her, deciding that she was a heartless witch who kept murdering people for no reason.`
` ...But right now, I can't imagine that's true."`
`"......Thank you.`
` In that case, I'll give you one more line of red.`
` ...#ff0000Beato never committed murder for the sake of pleasure.#ffffff"`
`She didn't do it for pleasure, and she didn't do it to make anyone feel fear.`
`Since she has nothing to gain, `
`she doesn't care whether the epitaph murders succeed or fail.`
`It's almost like...a random game kids would play...`
`"That's not right.`
` ...It does have meaning.`
` It has meaning for her."`
`"......And what is...this meaning...?"`
`"I don't get it.`
` Even though both sides of the scale are immaterial, ...the scale itself has some weight to it in her eyes."`
`...Of course it isn't meaningless.`
` Some meaning definitely exists.`
`In the previous game, she urged me to remember my sin of six years ago.`
`...Am I supposed to believe that was meaningless too?`
`No.`
` That definitely isn't the case.`
`I clearly remember the serious gaze Beato had back then.`
`Unfortunately, I didn't have a clue what she meant.`
`...When she saw that, she was horribly dejected.`
`That's right.`
`At that time, I'm sure she even went so far as to say that the crime wouldn't have occurred if I hadn't come.`
`"It does have meaning.`
` ......It means something to her.`
` And it's connected to something she wants from me."`
`"....................."`
`I laughed softly and poked Beato lightly on the head,`
` ...then patted her head.`
`"...Next time you want to send a love letter, I suggest you just write 'I love you'.`
` ...If you make it too roundabout and confusing, no one's gonna be able to figure it out."`
`"......*giggle*."`
`"I still don't have a clue what she's thinking.`
` ...Even so, `
`I won't stop thinking.`
` ...I've only just started spinning the chessboard around.`
` ...I definitely won't give up...on this journey in search of your thoughts."`
`...Battler did nothing but gaze blankly out the window.`
`The fighting between the relatives went on without end...`
`At first, the relatives had crowded around the study.`
`However, no matter how much they knocked, the master of the study did not answer even once.`
`Eva and several others said they should open the door with the second key, the one Genji held.`
`However, in a flash of brilliance, Natsuhi said that Kinzo had been in a particularly bad mood and had taken back the key he'd previously given Genji, `
`which meant that he now had both keys himself.`
` She claimed that this was the reason they couldn't open the door.`
`After she promised to let them meet Kinzo tomorrow morning no matter what, they finally returned to the dining hall.`
`But, of course, the argument continued on even there.`
`Eva's group needed a lot of cash very soon, and they were trying to threaten Krauss somehow and make him pay up.`
`...Apparently, Battler solving the epitaph threatened Krauss's position as the Successor,`
` which gave the others a powerful tailwind.`
`On the other side, Krauss and Natsuhi based their argument on the claim...`
`that it had never been specified that ownership of the gold would be handed over to the person who solved the epitaph.`
`It hadn't been 'hidden gold', but simply Kinzo's stockpile,`
` and it was still Kinzo's property, which meant it would naturally be distributed after Kinzo's death with the rest of the inheritance.`
`Once they made that claim, Eva's group once again started demanding to be allowed to see Kinzo.`
`...It had probably been obvious to them from the beginning.`
`This sibling fight could only be settled by Kinzo...`
`This was obviously a confrontation between Eva's group, which wanted cash fast,`
` and Krauss, who was hiding his lack of funds but still didn't need money right away.`
`As he listened vaguely to this exchange,`
` ...Battler marveled at how, despite their usual affluent airs, they were surprisingly deep in debt...`
`"Didn't you say the same thing a short while ago?`
` Enough, let's take a break.`
` We're all repeating the same things over and over again."`
`According to the clock, it was almost 24:00.`
`It certainly was a perfect time for a break.`
`The atmosphere relaxed just a bit...`
`"I agree.`
` It'll be good for both sides to take a breather.`
` ...Hey, why don't we start keepin' a record when we start up again?`
` I'm tired of fightin' over what was or wasn't said."`
`"Seriously.`
` We really can't do without a record of proceedings, not when Nii-san can so easily deny something he's said before the words stop reverberating off the walls."`
`"A mere written record would be a pain, and it'd be an easy target for forgery."`
`"Good point.`
` ...Aniki, wanna fire this up?"`
`"A tape set, is it?`
` ...I see.`
` This way, we can keep a record without bothering to write it down, and forgery will be impossible.`
` It's fair for both sides."`
`"Make sure you don't mess anything up...!`
` Those are Father's precious music tapes!"`
`The dignified tape set had a sense of weight to it that matched this majestic dining hall perfectly.`
`On pleasant Sunday mornings, it would sometimes be used to play famous tapes or records.`
`However, right now, it was the most neutral and impartial conference record keeper around...`
`Rudolf fished randomly around the cassette rack, searching for a blank tape.`
`And every time he found some tape with 'sophisticated' music on it, he'd complain about how pompous it was.`
`"Pardon me.`
` ...You called?"`
`"We're taking a break.`
` Sorry, but could you make us something to drink?`
` And maybe some biscuits would be nice too."`
`"Certainly.`
` I will see to it right away..."`
`"Also, ...sorry,`
` but do you have any cold medicine?`
` I've been feeling a bit feverish."`
`"Then don't overstrain yourself.`
` Get some sleep."`
`"If you really feel like it, why not get some sleep, Rosa?`
` Of course, I wouldn't step out of such an important conference because of a simple cold."`
`"Really?`
` Allow me to take a rest as well.`
` Natsuhi, why don't we take a short rest too."`
`".........Yes, dear."`
`Sensing that he meant to have a strategy meeting, Natsuhi stood up.`
`...Even if that hadn't been the case, she was so desperate to get out of the room even for a moment that she'd have taken any excuse.`
`Krauss and Natsuhi left the dining hall, ...and the tension in the room truly relaxed.`
`".........*sigh*."`
`"You've been doing great, Battler-kun.`
` ...I imagine you feel just horrible.`
` Think of this as part of growing up and just accept it."`
`"Just how long am I gonna have to sit around here doing nothing?"`
`"...Who knows.`
` After all, you're like our own portable shrine.`
` ...Sleepy?"`
`"About as much in as your average school class."`
`"I'm pretty sure Father isn't going to show up tonight anyway.`
` When Krauss nii-san and the rest come back, I'll propose that we might as well let you go."`
`"...I'll be counting on you."`
`*knock*knock*.`
`A light knock and the faint sound of china clinking together could be heard.`
`"Excuse us..."`
`"We brought tea."`
`Shannon and Kanon had come by with a serving cart.`
`The pleasant smell of black tea had the effect of relieving a bit of the tension.`
`"...Hey,`
` did you hear?"`
`"Hear about what...?"`
`".........We haven't heard anything."`
`"Stop it, Rudolf.`
` There's no reason to tell them."`
`"...We are furniture,`
` so we have no interest in matters concerning the family conference."`
`"I see.`
` That's a wise answer."`
`"...You have the midnight shift?`
` That must be rough."`
`"That is our job.`
` ...We would be happy to receive your orders."`
`"Makes sense to me.`
` At least that'd be better than sittin' around awake doing nothin'.`
` When I was still down in the bottom rungs, I once worked as a warehouse keeper.`
` Even if you're just stayin' awake, it's still pretty tough...!`
` Right after the war, you had robbers all over the place.`
` Plus, you couldn't rely on the police back then, so it was a pretty dangerous time...!"`
`Hideyoshi was particularly proud of how he'd started with nothing and built up assets by illegally diverting goods from the American army.`
`Once the subject came up, Hideyoshi tended to get pretty talkative.`
`The relatives who knew this were greatly relieved to see that a perfect sacrifice had come up.`
`"If you got found out, you were in for it big time!`
` Those Americandy people are scary!`
` Their strength's in another league 'cause of all that beef they eat.`
` If you got caught, it'd end with them shooting you or <death by hanging>!`
` Get it? <Death by hanging>!`
` Oh yeah, and then, I figured it out.`
` It's all about the meat!`
` Japanese people gotta eat more meat!`
` And that's when I got the revelation...that I needed to start up a business to win over people's stomachs!"`
`"I-I see...`
` That m-must have been quite a difficult task......"`
`"Stop it, dear.`
` No matter how much you tell people born after the war, they'll never understand how we suffered back then."`
`"Oops, looks like my bad habit's jumped out again...!`
` Sorry, sorry!`
` Wahahahahaha!"`
`"You two should have some tea as well.`
` Every now and then, I think it might be helpful for you to use your own tongues to learn more about the tea you're always brewing."`
`"......No, we'll be fine.`
` There's no need to be concerned for our sakes..."`
`"Hang out with us for a bit.`
` Being surrounded by adults makes me feel like I'm gonna suffocate."`
`"Hear that? That's an order from Battler-sama, the Successor!`
` Sit over there and have some tea with us.`
` Then you can talk about recent events, your hobbies, TV shows you're watching, and whatever it is that's popular with the kids these days.`
` There's a lot we could learn."`
`"*giggle*`
` That's a brilliant idea.`
` Come on, you two sit down too.`
` And why don't you become sacrifices for us now that we crave something to talk about."`
`"Wahahahahahaha.`
` That's right.`
` I thought it'd be nice to talk to some young kids, but that'll be pretty hard when I'm too old even to go to a cabaret club."`
`"...How long are you planning on standing around there?`
` Rudolf told you to sit.`
` Sit down.`
` ...I give you permission as well."`
`After getting Eva's permission, Shannon and Kanon looked at each other and finally obeyed, nervously.`
`For a while, the two were pounded by questions and became the relatives' playthings...`
`Then, `
`...a reserved knocking sound could be heard.`
`All of the servants tended to knock in a similar manner,`
` so no one found it strange.`
`However, Shannon and Kanon turned around with surprised looks on their faces.`
`...The servants here today included the two of them, Genji, Kumasawa, and Gohda.`
`Gohda had the midnight shift at the guesthouse.`
`Kumasawa had gone to bed in a spare room in the guesthouse.`
`The two of them were right here, ...so Genji was the only person left,`
` ...but they knew very well that Genji wouldn't knock like that...`
`"...Who is it?`
` It's not locked. Just come in."`
`Rudolf didn't recognize the knock either.`
`When he asked 'Who is it?', it became apparent that no one knew whose knock it was...`
`After that, the same *knock*knock* repeated just once more.`
`...Could it be that someone had their hands full...and was asking that the door be opened for them...?`
`As a slightly odd feeling began to encompass the room, the sound of the large clock in the hall could be heard.`
`It was a sign that October 4th had ended...and October 5th had begun...`
`Let's step back in time a bit.`
`At this time, Krauss and Natsuhi were a ways off, in a deserted corridor on the second floor...`
`"......So, we no longer have any other options."`
`"Yes...`
` ...The same move probably won't last us all day tomorrow.`
` ...If we hesitate any longer, there's a chance Eva-san and the others will call the police, claiming that we have Father locked up somewhere.`
` This is...as far as we can go."`
`"..............."`
`"...Battler-kun finding the gold...was completely unexpected.`
` If that hadn't happened, I'd thought of a plan which might have managed to get us through this somehow..."`
`"...Hmph.`
` This always happens when I bet on something.`
` ...Something unexpected always happens, and something that should've been an absolute certainty goes wrong."`
`"......Let's arrange for Father's room to be 'empty' starting tomorrow morning.`
` Let's plan it out with Genji and have him say he saw Father heading out into the forest early in the morning."`
`"I doubt Eva and the others will simply accept such a disappearance..."`
`"I'm fully aware of that.`
` However, we have no other options...!"`
`"If we do such a thing, ...Eva and the others will doubtless make a fuss that our actions were suspicious.`
` They aren't worried about appearances as long as they can squeeze some money out of us.`
` ...It might end up in some odd magazine and cause serious damage to the confidence placed in me."`
`"Damage is something we can live with, right...?!`
` If by any chance Father's secret is discovered, we'll face a lot worse than mere damage...!!"`
`"There's nothing wrong with persisting until the last possible second tomorrow.`
` If we're able to make it through safely, we won't have to lose anything.`
` There's no need to get impatient and use that trump card...!"`
`"You want to wait until after they start clambering about how we've locked Father up, and then say he's gone missing?`
` That way would invite much more suspicion...!!"`
`"............Nnnn..."`
`"...Let's just...`
`put Father to rest now...`
` To go any further...`
`...would be impossible..."`
`"Calm yourself.`
` Being exposed to Eva and the others' venom too much has made you lose your composure, that's all.`
` ...Only two keys exist that can let anyone into that study!`
` And you have both of them right here.`
` That means no one can go inside.`
` That door is of a very special make.`
` No matter what kind of tools they bring out of the storage room, it won't even budge."`
`"It isn't a physical problem like that...!"`
`"Please, don't be hasty, and calm down.`
` In any event, you can pretend to have gotten a fever and stay in bed.`
` In the meantime, I will overcome all of this for you."`
`"...I can't leave everything to you...!`
` I'll fight until the end too...!"`
`When Natsuhi could no longer hold back the tears brought on by her fierce emotions, ...Krauss held her gently.`
`...Just how long had it been since the last time she'd felt the warmth of her husband's compassion...`
`"Your headache......must be awful, yes?`
` It's always that way when you wrinkle your forehead like that."`
`".........Dear..."`
`She had come to think that her husband could never guess the way she felt.`
`But, ...at times like this......`
`"...Let's wait for the very last moment before using our disappearance trump card.`
` It's like a last-resort treasured sword.`
` It's best when it remains in its sheath.`
` The important thing is that you're ready to pull it out at any time, right...?"`
`"I...understand that..."`
`"Would you let me handle that trump card?`
` ......Of course, at the final moment, I will take all of the responsibility.`
` ...I won't get you and Jessica involved."`
`"What...do you mean by that...?!"`
`"When the Ushiromiya family is destroyed, it is enough that I alone am crushed in the rubble.`
` ......When the typhoon passes, let's make sure we're ready to file for divorce.`
` I will sign the papers and let you hold onto them.`
` ...I've secretly left some of my assets in your name.`
` If you add on some compensation money, that should be enough for you and Jessica to live on without any hindrances."`
`"No!!`
` Ushiromiya Natsuhi is the name that should be engraved on my tombstone...!`
` Please let me be with you until the last moment...!`
` Even if it turns out that you're the last Head of the Ushiromiya family, `
`...please let Natsuhi...`
`be the name of the wife of the final Head, `
`...your wife..."`
`...Krauss's existence was founded solely upon the trust and power of his assets as a financial fixer.`
`If either of those weakened, nothing would remain.`
`If they used the trump card of Kinzo's disappearance, they would lose one of these two essential supports.`
`......It was like offering your right arm in exchange for your neck being cut.`
`It was probably better than losing your head, but you still might die from the blood loss,`
` and even on the off-chance that you did survive, you'd have to bear a heavy wound that wouldn't heal for the rest of your life...`
`Krauss was prepared even for death...`
`Understanding this, `
`...Natsuhi buried her face in Krauss's chest...`
`and cried...`
`"......My apologies for interrupting."`
`The sudden appearance of Genji's voice made Natsuhi jump back and hurriedly wipe the tears from her eyes.`
`Krauss stood in front of Natsuhi, shielding her.`
`"Ah, Genji-san.`
` Please don't sneak up on us.`
` ...Do you have some business?"`
`"......Yes.`
` My apologies, but I have something to report to Madam."`
`"To...me...?`
` Dear..."`
`"I don't mind."`
`Krauss left Natsuhi's side, went to a window a short ways off,`
` and gazed at the windy and rainy rose garden...`
`Natsuhi went with Genji to a place a short distance away.`
`"...What is it?"`
`"......Well...`
` The truth is, another phone call has come for you, Madam."`
`At that moment, a sudden, eerie sound surprised her.`
`It was the large clock in the hall announcing 24:00...`
`"You don't mean......that man...again...?"`
`"......Yes.`
` ...What is to be done?"`
`"...D-Did he say what business he had with me?"`
`"......I can give you no answer on that matter.`
` He kept insisting that he wanted to speak to you directly."`
`"..............."`
`Again, ...a phone call...from the man who claimed to be taking revenge for something that happened 19 years ago.`
`19 years ago.`
`...That was just one year before Jessica and Battler were born.`
`In Natsuhi's eyes, the gap between 19 years ago and 18 years ago was immense.`
`...For a long time, she had been unable to fulfill her role of creating a successor for the Ushiromiya family...and had been treated very coldly.`
`But then, she finally gave birth to Jessica...`
`and became able to call herself the Ushiromiya Successor's wife with her head held high.`
`...So in her eyes, 'Ushiromiya Natsuhi' began 18 years ago.`
`...That's why everything before that, including the events of 19 years ago, ...contained nothing but hateful memories.`
`And...something from the last year of that hateful period......is whispering vengeful words...from the other end of the phone...`
`......I can still...hear the roar of the sea...`
`...............`
`"......What is to be done?"`
`"Transfer it...to my room.`
` ...Don't let my husband know."`
`"...As you wish."`
`From the very beginning, Genji had guessed that she wouldn't want Krauss hearing about this phone call.`
`That's why he had told Natsuhi covertly...`
`Natsuhi ordered that he transfer the call, told Krauss that she would turn in for the night, and left at a quick pace...`
`She returned to her room and locked the door.`
`...There was nothing peculiar about that.`
`...In the Ushiromiya family, hallways are like public roads.`
`There's no special meaning in locking the door when you enter your own room...`
`...This is what she told herself.`
`Then, as though it had been waiting for her, the telephone rang.`
`...Genji had probably transferred the call.`
`She took a deep breath, readied herself, .........and picked up the receiver.`
`"......Hello......"`
`"..............."`
`Again, ...it started with silence.`
`She realized that the person at the other end was trying to irritate her and make her feel uncomfortable, and she got angry...`
`"Why are you silent...?!`
` I'm hanging up...!"`
`"...Hahahahahahaha...`
` ...Do not hang up, Mother.`
` I want to hear your voice a little longer..."`
`Again, ...that unpleasant voice...`
`"Are you trying to mock me...?!`
` Tell me what you want...!"`
`"I want to play with you, Mother."`
`"...Wh-What?`
` What are you talking about?!`
` I have no desire to play with you...!!"`
`"...You are tired from the family conference, right?`
` Is that chronic headache of yours getting to be a pain...?"`
`"Th-That's none of your business...!"`
`Just the fact that he knew her headache was troubling her made a shiver run up her spine...`
`"You get headaches because your head is all stiff.`
` If you go straight to bed like that, you cannot expect to have good dreams."`
`"Haven't I told you that's none of your business?!!`
` I'm hanging up!!"`
`Natsuhi forcefully yelled that she was hanging up, but in actuality, she couldn't...`
`After all, being at the receiving end of a phone call was much better than the alternative.`
`...If she hung up violently,`
` ...this person might then call someone else...`
`"Let us play a game to help you relax.`
` I will not take up much of your time."`
`"I-I have no intention of playing with you...!"`
`"...Your name is Natsuhi, Mother.`
` It has the kanji for a season in it.`
` Pretty nice name.`
` ......However, just because your name is Natsuhi, that does not necessarily mean you like summer.`
` ...Which season do you really like, Mother...?"`
`"You think I'll tell you?"`
`"If you do not, ...I will hang up.`
` ......Is that all right?"`
`"...Nngg, ........."`
`It was clearly a threat.`
`...It meant that if she forced him to hang up the phone, `
`anything might happen...`
`Humiliated that she was forced to give into a threat made by a man whose name she didn't even know, she gave him the answer he wanted...`
`".........I-It's autumn."`
`"Why...?"`
`"B-Because it's an easy season to pass the time in...!`
` There's no other reason in particular.`
` Are you satisfied now?!"`
`"Yeah, I am satisfied.`
` ...So, it looks like your favorite season really is the same as mine.`
` ......I like autumn too.`
` ......Heheheheheheheheheheheheh..."`
`"...Liar!`
` You just made that up...!"`
`Surely, this man would've done the same thing no matter which season I said I liked.`
`...What is he after?!`
`What's so fun about making me uncomfortable like this...?!`
`"It is not nice to call someone a liar.`
` ......I am not making it up.`
` I already knew you liked autumn, Mother.`
` ......There is even proof."`
`"Proof......?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...Is there a clock in your room, Mother...?"`
`"...A clock...?`
` ...Y-Yes, there is, but what's your point...?"`
`In Natsuhi's room, there was a beautiful antique clock with an intricate design.`
`...Krauss had bought it for her as a birthday present long ago.`
`"......It's 0:07 right now.`
` I'm tired, so please get this farce over with quickly...!"`
`"Try lifting the clock up."`
`"Wh-Why?"`
`"......You really do not know when to shut up.`
` Stop resisting every single time I say something.`
` Just shut up and do what I say."`
`The tone of the man's voice suddenly went low, turning into a threat.`
`It made his displeasure clear.`
`At first, this man seemed to have a calm way of speaking, but on the inside, that wasn't the case at all.`
`If she enraged this man even a little more, he would surely show his true nature right away...`
`"...Are you really that eager to make me hang up?`
` Things are best when I talk on the phone with you...`
` ...I could tell your husband and daughter about what happened 19 years ago any time I want to..."`
`"I-I don't know what you're talking about, but please don't get my husband and daughter involved...!`
` I'm listening to everything you say...!"`
`"Then just do what you are told..."`
`Once again, the man threatened her in a low voice, as though warning her not to interrupt again...`
`My head was filled with the pain from my headache, the sound of my beating heart, ...and the roar of the sea...`
`...I can't disobey him anymore.`
`......As the man had ordered, I lifted up the antique clock...`
`"..................?"`
`There lay what appeared to be a single playing card.`
`.........?`
`Is it the warranty for the clock......?`
`Thinking this, she took it and turned it over.........`
`"Are you......wide awake now?"`
`"Eek, ah, `
`...aaaaaaaahhhhh...`
` Wh-`
`Wh-Wh-`
`Why...`
`...why is...`
`...this here...?!?!"`
`"Well, it would please me if your headache's gone down a bit.`
` ...Tell me that you are happy, Mother."`
`"How did you...?!`
` Why?!`
` How?!"`
`"I want to hear you say you are happy, murderer.`
` How dare you act like a normal, neat-freak mother. You make me want to vomit.`
` Do you want that to land on your husband and daughter as well?`
` You don't, right?`
` You want me to keep quiet, don't you?`
` Okay, I'll keep quiet. Come on, aren't you happy?`
` Aren't you?!"`
`"Ah, ...gaaaah, I'm happy...I'm happy...!!`
` So please, ...stop...`
` Don't bring my husband and daughter into this...!`
` What is it you want?`
` Money?`
` How much?!"`
`"I do not want money.`
` ......My wounds could not be healed with any amount of money.`
` But there is a medicine.`
` ...That is right.`
` It is like a kind of ointment.`
` ...Thick, syrupy and dribbling.`
` ......And that is...`
`my hatred...`
`...my resentment towards you.`
` ...Slathering myself with that...`
`is the only way to hold back the pain..."`
`Natsuhi had never had anything so hateful said to her in her entire life.`
`So she suspected many times that she must be having some sort of bad dream.`
`However, ...this definitely wasn't a dream...`
`"...Y-`
`You couldn't possibly be...`
`...on this island right now, are you...?"`
`"I am.`
` Did I not promise you?`
` I said I would be at the family conference."`
`"That's impossible...!`
` There's no way you could have come during this typhoon...!!"`
`"That would be no problem if I came before the typhoon reached here.`
` ...And I am pretty sure this guest called Erika or whatever arrived even during the typhoon."`
`Her blood froze...`
`Furudo Erika had supposedly been brought here by coincidence...`
`If he knew that name, he would have to be very close by...`
`"Wh-`
`Where...`
`...a-`
`are you......?"`
`"...I will not appear in front of anyone until you introduce me.`
` Do not worry.`
` .........Oh yes, it is useless to try and search for me.`
` Your mansion is huge,`
` and you have no shortage of phones I could be calling from.`
` Besides, I am sure you do not want to meet me, right?`
` ...Or else, do you want to expose me and introduce me to everyone...?`
` Introduce me to Jessica too.`
` ...Tell her I am her older brother by one year.`
` Heheheheheheheheheheheheheheh!!"`
`"S-Stop it, ...stay away from Jessica..."`
`"I guess I have scared you a bit too much.`
` That is all from me...for tonight.`
` ...But do not forget.`
` You cannot disobey me.`
` Understand, `
`...Mother?"`
`"......Y-Yes......"`
`"I am going to hang up for the night, ...but I have an order that must be followed until tomorrow morning."`
`"...Wh-What is it......?!"`
`"You may no longer leave that room tonight, and you may not make a phone call to anywhere.`
` If a phone call comes for you, you are not allowed to take it.`
` You will turn the lights off right now, get in bed, and sleep.`
` Then you will wake up at your ordinary time.`
` .........Heheheheheh.`
` It sure is nice to live a healthy life.`
` I really am such a good son, working so hard for the sake of my Mother's body..."`
`"...I-I understand.`
` I'll go to sleep right now.`
` I won't leave my room, and I won't pick up the phone...!`
` So, don't involve my husband and daughter...!"`
`"As long as you follow my orders, I will keep your secret, Mother.`
` ...Do not disobey me.`
` ...I am already very close by to you.`
` I can easily tell whether you have turned your lights off, or whether you are on the phone.`
` ...If I wished to, I could even kiss your sleeping face."`
`"I'll keep it!`
` I'll keep my promise!!`
` So stop it, just stop it!`
` Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt!!"`
`...As she screamed, Natsuhi took the card she had found under the clock and crushed it up into a little ball.`
`It had a pattern on it like a tarot card, `
`...and also...`
`'秋', the kanji for autumn......`
`Let's step back in time once again.`
`Right now, it is the exact moment that the large clock in the hall announced 24:00.`
`Wondering who the person who knocked twice was,`
` ...the relatives in the dining hall stared at the door.`
`Rudolf told them to come in.`
`...But there was no answer.`
`Until the end of that long tone marking the arrival of 24:00, which had come from the large clock in the hall shortly after the knock,`
` they were unable to move in the slightest...`
`"...Maybe their hands are full and they can't open it..."`
`"Maybe.`
` ...But it's a bit creepy that they won't say their name."`
`"...Should I open it?"`
`"Do so."`
`Kanon nodded back, then slowly opened the door...`
`"Ah, ...what's that...?!"`
`"...It's...one of Father's envelopes?"`
`Right behind the opened door, on the floor of the hallway,`
` ...lay the envelope.`
`"There's no one in the hallway.`
` Perhaps they placed this here and left..."`
`The adults flew out into the corridor as well,`
` but they could find no trace of anyone who might have knocked on the door...`
`Just about an hour ago, Shannon and Kanon had come in to serve tea.`
`At that time, everyone had seen that nothing lay in that spot.`
`Someone came, knocked, left an envelope with the mark of the One-Winged Eagle on it, and left...`
`"...C-Could it have been...the Master...?!"`
`"...It's not unthinkable.`
` ...Father's pretty much the only person in this mansion who would refuse to answer when asked who he was."`
`"That's not possible.`
` If that were the case, why wouldn't Father come in here openly?"`
`"...That's right.`
` Father'd probably just barge in here without knockin'...`
` The doors and windows of this mansion are locked now, right...?`
` In that case, the only people who coulda conceivably left the letter there are Krauss-san, Natsuhi-san, and Genji-san."`
`By this point, the mansion had been completely locked up.`
`Therefore, the cousins in the guesthouse, Nanjo, Gohda, Kumasawa, and Erika could not have come here.`
`Furthermore, since Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji were the only three who weren't in this room,`
` one of those three had to have been the one who set that letter down in the corridor.`
`So, it was very likely that Krauss and the others had placed the letter there, to make it seem like a message from Kinzo...`
`"I see...`
` It'll have something written on it that's supposedly in Father's name, saying that he won't accept Battler as the Successor, or something of the sort.`
` Ridiculous.`
` I can't believe you'd try to pull such a childish trick, Nii-san...!"`
`"Well, it's not like I give a damn about being the Successor..."`
`"Give it up.`
` That's just your fate.`
` ...Anyway, why don't we read what's inside?"`
`Rudolf set the letter on the dining hall table and let everyone see the front and back, to show that there were no tricks or hidden mechanisms, `
`almost like a magician does before performing his act.`
`"...Can we be sure this envelope is one of Father's?"`
`"Y-Yeah, no doubt about it.`
` Father liked to use this kind of envelope for handwritten letters...`
` What do you think, Shannon-chan?"`
`"Y-Yes...`
` ...To my eyes as well, ...it looks like the type of envelope that the Master uses..."`
`"That doesn't mean Father was the one who wrote it.`
` It would be pitifully easy for Nii-san to snatch one of these from a drawer in Father's study...!"`
`"Even Krauss-sama would not be able to enter the study easily...`
` It might be hard for him to steal an envelope..."`
`"Let's try opening it.`
` We can worry about all that later.`
` ...Feels like there's something in it.`
` I wonder what."`
`Rudolf opened the envelope a bit roughly.`
`Then, a folded letter...`
`...and a glittering object fell out.`
`...It was a ring.`
`"Huh?`
` ......Wait a second, ...isn't that ring...?!"`
`Eva noticed it immediately and grabbed at it...`
`"Th-`
`This is...`
`...Father's ring, isn't it...?!`
` I-It's the Head's Ring!!"`
`"...Wh-What in the...!!`
` Seriously?!"`
`"Are you sure it's Father's...?`
` Could it be a replica...?"`
`"No, this is the real thing!`
` I've always dreamed about wearing this ring on my finger someday.`
` Even though Father wore this on his finger, I know more about it than anyone else.`
` ...This is Father's ring, no doubt about it!`
` Why is it here?!"`
`"Does that mean it really was Father who wrote this letter...?!"`
`"...H-Heheheheh.`
` The sender isn't Father.`
` ...It's much more interesting than that."`
`"Then, ...who is the letter from?"`
`"The Ushiromiya family alchemist!`
` ......It's from the Golden Witch, Beatrice-sama...!!"`
`Rudolf showed everyone the part of the letter where that was written.`
`It really did say that...`
`"...I-It's from Beatrice...?!"`
`"What's it say...?"`
`"I'll read it.`
` ......<Congratulations>...`
` I acknowledge that Battler-sama spectacularly solved the epitaph's riddle and reached the Golden Land.`
` ......All of the gold belongs to Battler-sama.`
` Furthermore, Battler-sama is the new Head of the Ushiromiya family.`
` ...As proof, .........I send the Head's Ring, ...which Kinzo-sama left in my charge...`
` ...Battler-sama, I beg that you take the ring, become the new master of the gold, and guide the Ushiromiya family.`
` ...I sincerely pray that you flourish as the new Head........."`
`"...Hah, ...hahah!`
` What the hell...!`
` I see, Dad just won't come out of his study, so Beatrice, the witch of the forest, has acknowledged Battler directly...!`
` Hahaha, hahahahahahahahaha!"`
`"...Battler-kun,`
` you take that ring.`
` ...This is a special ring to be worn by the Family Head.`
` ......I don't know who this Beatrice is, `
`but she's watched the whole thing and sent you this ring after acknowledging you as the true Successor."`
`"I-Is that okay...?`
` It's such an important ring..."`
`"Yeah, it's fine.`
` You should wear it proudly on your finger.`
` ...Got it? Even if Aniki and Natsuhi nee-san tell you to take it off, you'd better not do it...!"`
`All of the relatives, with creepy smiles on their faces, urged Battler to put the ring on his finger...`
`It looked like things would get pretty nasty if he refused, so Battler reluctantly decided to put it on the middle finger of his left hand...`
`The ring was heavy and stiff...`
`At that moment, Krauss returned.`
`......Genji came back as well shortly behind him.`
`"My apologies.`
` It seems my wife is not at her best, so she's gone to bed early.`
` ......Did something happen?`
` You all seem incredibly flustered."`
`".........Battler-sama, ...isn't that......"`
`Immediately, Genji keenly spotted that which Battler had just put on his finger...`
`"Your eyesight's pretty good, Genji-san!`
` ...Looks like you know whose ring this is."`
`"What...?`
` What are you talking about......?"`
`Judging by Krauss's dubious expression, it seemed unlikely that he was the one who placed the letter there...`
`Furthermore, that expression quickly changed into one of shock.`
`"Heheheheh!!`
` That's right, it's the Ushiromiya Family Head's Ring!!`
`The family conference took up this new topic,`
` ...and the storm came once again......`
`The rain was still pouring down as hard as ever.`
`...This weather was supposed to continue all day tomorrow as well, which made me feel a bit depressed.`
`......Oh wait... Given the time, I should say today, not tomorrow...`
`But that doesn't really matter now.`
`......I'm sleepy...`
`With half-asleep eyes, I opened my umbrella.`
`The large drops of rain pounded mercilessly against it......`
`Technically, the end of the family conference had been declared at 1:00 AM, `
`but external scuffles kept continuing sluggishly.`
`I'm really jealous of Aunt Rosa, who managed to slip out of there at that time.`
`She cleverly got away by saying that she'd check on Maria, who might have been staying up too late.`
`Dad caught me, ruining my chance to escape, `
`...and they made me stick around until now, 3:00 AM...`
`So, what have they decided on after all this time...?`
`Nothing at all.`
`...They just kept on arguing about who said what, like elementary school kids.`
`...I'm sure they're tired too.`
`That's probably why they keep dragging on with the same pointless questions.`
`I no longer felt any shock or anger towards them.`
`I guess drowsiness is the best painkiller...`
`...I left them behind and finally returned to the guesthouse.`
`When I got back to the guesthouse, the first floor lounge was lit.`
`I could even hear people chatting inside...`
`Apparently, some people were still awake even this late.`
`Despite the late hour, Gohda-san and Doctor Nanjo were still up and chatting.`
`Plates and cups were lined up on the counter,`
` and it looked almost like a bar with Gohda-san as the bartender.`
`When they noticed I had returned, they seemed to finally realize how late it was.`
`When Gohda-san made to top off Doctor Nanjo's glass, the latter declined with an exaggerated gesture.`
`"That's enough, that's enough.`
` ...It's already too late to be up."`
`"Look how late it's gotten...`
` You were such a good person to chat with, I hardly noticed."`
`"If so, it's all thanks to your liquor.`
` We'll have to do this again sometime."`
`"Yes, gladly!`
` Battler-sama, welcome back.`
` Is the discussion with Krauss-sama and the others still continuing?"`
`"...From the way things were going, it looks like they might plod on until dawn.`
` None of my business..."`
`I spoke carelessly, with a big yawn.`
`"......They have quite a lot of stamina.`
` I'm surprised."`
`"Oh, ...so you're here too..."`
`"...With one thing and another, they ended up having a small night party here,`
` and they let me join in.`
` ......Don't worry, I haven't said a word about *that*."`
`".................."`
`Erika could be seen on the sofa.`
`She had taken her shoes off and was lounging around as though she owned the place.`
`"Erika-sama is very knowledgeable on a variety of subjects.`
` I enjoyed listening to her immensely."`
`"Your knowledge truly is extensive.`
` Very impressive for one so young..."`
`"......You're very welcome.`
` I, Furudo Erika, know quite a bit about trifles such as this."`
`Erika grabbed the corners of her skirt and posed.`
`This was somewhat less than graceful considering that she was lounging on the sofa with her feet up.`
`"...Where's Aunt Rosa?"`
`"She returned at 1:00 AM, but she went straight upstairs to sleep."`
`That's probably true...`
`After taking part in that conference for so long...`
`I feel like flopping down in bed right away myself.`
`...I've had it.`
`I'm tired enough that I might flop over right here...`
`"......Well then, let's call it a night.`
` Don't you have to get up early tomorrow morning to make breakfast, Gohda-san?"`
`"Preparations for breakfast have already been made.`
` I would be most pleased if you look forward to it."`
`In Gohda-san's eyes, the family conference is an open stage on which to display his culinary skills.`
`Maybe this invigorates him so much that he doesn't even get sleepy.`
`Erika stood up, laughing at how youthful Gohda was.`
`This became a sign that it was time to disperse.`
`"I will clean up here.`
` Please, go and sleep, everyone."`
`Leaving the clean-up to Gohda-san, I went to the bathroom and then climbed the stairs to the second floor.`
`"Goodnight, everyone.`
` These old bones have stayed up a little too late."`
`"......Good night, Doctor Nanjo.`
` Good night, Battler-san."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......G'night..."`
`Then, in the second floor hallway, we split up.`
`Doctor Nanjo went to his own room.`
`Erika went to her room.`
`And I...returned to the cousin room.`
`I couldn't hear any sounds of playing coming from our room.`
`...Could they have fallen asleep already?`
`No surprise, at this time of night.`
` If they were still playing, they would've been staying up way too late...`
`When I opened the door quietly, `
`as expected, the room was already pitch black except for a small nightlight.`
`Everyone was already sleeping in their beds.`
`I'm sure they all had a great time and played a ton.`
`...Then they probably talked about youthful things and enjoyed staying up late.`
`...If only I hadn't found the gold, I could've enjoyed my time with them...`
`I'm already...`
`tired, `
`...so tired.`
`Forgetting even to change my clothes or brush my teeth, `
`I crawled into bed...`
`...and immediately began to descend into the marshes of sleep......`
`Aaah, ...today's been so insane...`
`I wonder if that old bastard is still in that family conference now...`
`...How does he not get tired.........?`
`Come to think of it,`
` ...what was it that old bastard said when we parted company...?`
`'Tomorrow, there's something important I want to talk about, as a family.`
` It's about you.'`
`...I'm sure it's more stuff about being the Successor.`
`...I don't even want to hear about it...`
`'If I tell you about this, `
`...I'll probably be killed.'`
`I'll kill you whenever you want, you old bastard...`
`And then, ...what was it he said next...?`
`'It's about your birth.'`
`My...`
`...birth...?`
`...Probably just something about the noble Ushiromiya lineage...`
`Not interested...`
`......Just let me...`
`...sleep......`
`...The sound of crashing waves.`
`The sound of the tide surging.`
`The noise of the sea breeze.`
`Whenever my headache torments me, these are the sounds that fill my head...`
`Unable to bear a successor, I was in a very difficult position with regards to the Ushiromiya family...`
`Whenever I heard of a drug or incense that could make you achieve pregnancy, I tried it, `
`...but nothing had any effect.`
`Until I was blessed with Jessica 18 years ago,`
` ...I was ashamed to even call myself a wife.`
`"...Children are created by the efforts of two people and the whims of heaven.`
` It's not fair to place all the blame on yourself."`
`"I still don't know what caused my inability to become pregnant.`
` I even went to see noted physicians.`
` I underwent humiliating examinations.`
` ...But I was always just told that they didn't understand the reason..."`
`"Even though quite some time had passed since your marriage, you still couldn't bear a child.`
` ...I see.`
` It's only natural that Eva, who secretly aspired to become the Successor, would start getting ideas..."`
`Eva tried to convince Father that I was a failure as the Successor's wife.`
`It was a time when Kinzo was also very disappointed by my husband's repeated business failures.`
`On the other hand, Eva's husband Hideyoshi's business was growing well, completely the opposite of my husband's.`
`...He was the only person who could bring Father good news.`
`So, perhaps Father couldn't be blamed if he decided to lend an ear to Eva's words, `
`...or even accept them completely.`
`It was all my fault, ...because I couldn't bear a child...`
`"You are sinless.`
` Aren't babies of this country carried here by storks?`
` If anyone is to be judged, blame the stork."`
`".........Thank you.`
` However, ...even though he was still in good health then, the Head was already well past his prime,`
` and it's not hard to imagine that he wanted to see his grandchildren's faces as soon as possible..."`
`"Who cares.`
` If he wanted a grandchild, he could've just done what he wanted with that appalling amount of money he had.`
` ...This is Kinzo, the man who always bragged about how money could create anything.`
` If he wanted a grandchild, why couldn't he just manage something with that money he was so proud of...?!"`
`"............Yes, ...that's right.`
` ...The Head...gave up on me when I couldn't bear a child...`
`and did just that."`
`...The Head gave to many charities, thinking it the duty of anyone in possession of so much money.`
`One among these, an orphanage known as the 'Fukuin House', `
`had been given especially large donations, possibly because he had old ties with that place.`
`"Ah, the Fukuin House.`
` ...Furniture came from that place quite often."`
`"To provide on-the-job training and preparation for life as a working adult,`
` the Head employed Fukuin House children with exceptional grades as servants.`
` ...All of the servants in the mansion with "音" (On) in their names, `
`such as Shannon, Kanon, Lunon, Manon and Leion, came from there."`
`"...There were quite a lot of them, weren't there...?`
` Though most quit after just a few years."`
`"That's probably because a few years of wages from working here would earn them more than enough to live on their own.`
` ...Experience as a servant for the Ushiromiya family would be a wonderful thing to add to their resume.`
` I'm sure it was the Head's ambition that they would gain this for themselves and then spread their wings in society."`
`".........I see.`
` ...So, an adopted child......"`
`"..............."`
`"F-Father,`
` ...what...did you just say...?"`
`"Accept this baby as my grandchild."`
`"Ohhh, ...there, there.`
` There, there..."`
`Apparently, the baby that Kumasawa was trying to soothe didn't like the study air at all.`
`...It kept on crying, upset...`
`"M-My apologies, Father...`
` ...What is it you just..."`
`"Accept this baby as my grandchild.`
` And raise it to be the one who succeeds Krauss."`
`"...In other words, ...you want me to raise this baby...as me and my husband's own child...?"`
`"That's right.`
` It's clear now that you cannot bear children.`
` ...There must be some sort of defect in your body."`
`"Ooh, ...there, there.`
` Ooh, there, there..."`
`As though she couldn't hear our discussion in the slightest, Kumasawa kept on trying to cuddle the baby.`
`This made it cry even louder...`
`"......What nonsense.`
` If all responsibility of giving birth to children rested with the woman, there'd be no need for men in this world."`
`"I've never forgotten the bitter pain I felt that day...`
` ...It's not as though I didn't want a child...`
` ...However, no matter how much I prayed, I couldn't get pregnant...`
` Thinking that something to do with my body might be the cause, I went to see several famous doctors.`
` But even so, no matter how hard I tried, ...I couldn't become pregnant..."`
`"And in the end, ...this was the result.`
` .........I see."`
`The baby had been picked up by the Fukuin House just recently.`
`Of course, you couldn't help but feel compassion for this child,`
` who was so young and who had already lost its parents' affection.`
`However, ......it brought me nothing but pain and sadness.`
`It would have been another story if I had suffered to bear this child, `
`...but why should I be forced to hold this baby,`
` ...who not only shared none of my blood, `
`but who was not related to my husband in the slightest either...?`
`"I don't hate Father.`
` ...If anything, ...I hated my own body...!`
` I detested it!`
` I truly detested my own body for being unable to bear a child...!!`
` So I prayed.`
` I prayed to both angels and demons!!`
` And my wishes were granted by both...!"`
`"...For what did you pray to angels?"`
`"I prayed for a miracle in my body...!`
` If there was something wrong with my body, I could accept that.`
` In that case, I wanted to overcome that defect and somehow be granted the miracle of being given my husband's child...!"`
`"...That wish was granted.`
` ...The next year, you gave birth to Jessica."`
`"And, ...for what did you pray to demons?"`
`"I couldn't stand it, `
`...I couldn't stand it...`
` I hated my body...!`
` So, I hated this baby, `
`...because it made my failure so apparent...!!"`
`"......What...did you wish for?"`
`"For the first time, I prayed and made wishes to demons...!!`
` I wished that this baby would just disappear!!"`
`...Of course, that wish was also granted...by demons.`
`On that day, I left the baby with an older servant and went to think about the future in the rose garden.`
`No, that's a lie.`
`...I didn't want to think about anything.`
`The baby's cries were annoying, `
`so I ordered the servant to take the baby to a place where I couldn't hear.`
`...By a place where I couldn't hear, I meant somewhere far away.`
`Yes, I wished for it.`
`...I wished for the servant to take the baby far away and never return...!!`
`"I see...`
` ...So, a passing demon heard your wish, Natsuhi-sama."`
`"And then, ...what happened next?"`
`"After that, ...there was a bizarre accident that could only have been granted me by a demon..."`
`The woodland path from the rose garden to the harbor is probably well-suited for a comfortable walk.`
`...It must surely feel good to occasionally leave the path and walk through a grove of trees, depending on your mood.`
`However, ......wouldn't that path be fairly hard to travel on when taking a walk with a baby in your arms...?`
`"There was a cliff on the other side.`
` It was...about ten meters tall, I think.`
` It was rocky below.`
` ...There was also a fence there!`
` Does it seem at all likely that the servant went to the trouble of walking there holding a baby...`
`and then leaned against the fence...?`
` The only conceivable explanation is that she was lured there by the beckoning of a demon!!"`
`".........She ~ib~was~ib~ lured there, wasn't she?`
` ...By a demon who heard your wish..."`
`"And then, ...the servant and the baby..."`
`"They died...!!`
` They fell from the cliff, down to the rocks below...!`
` No, they died because I wished it!`
` That means this is-"`
`"It isn't your fault!`
` There's no need to think about it any further."`
`"But it happened because I wished it...!!"`
`"No, that's wrong!`
` Even if you wish for something, whether it comes true or not is decided by the whims of gods, demons, and witches!`
` You are sinless.`
` Humans are sinless.`
` You can even say that I killed them.`
` No, I did kill them!`
` I saw your mourning and felt pity, so I lured the servant with the baby to the cliff and guided them down it!"`
`"Wasn't it just an unfortunate accident?`
` If you can't accept it as an accident, blame it on us.`
` That's why demons exist."`
`"......That's right.`
` We're here for your sake.`
` ...It's not like you killed them.`
` We killed them.`
` So you are sinless.`
` ...So please, don't blame yourself, Natsuhi."`
`"Is that true...?`
` Am I truly sinless...?!"`
`"Yeah, you are.`
` Fuhhahahahaha!!`
` Young one who claims revenge for the events of 19 years ago,`
` if you're going to curse someone, curse me.`
` However, witches have a patent on curses...!`
` Let me take on this fight you're trying to pick with Natsuhi!!"`
`"I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, Beatrice the Golden!`
` If anyone picks a fight with the master I serve, I will fight in my master's stead!`
` Revenge for 19 years ago, you say?`
` I'll show you that such is hardly a blink of an eye for a witch who's lived a thousand years!!`
`Gahahahahahaahahahahahahahaha!!`
`So, you hate Natsuhi for wishing your death 19 years ago?!`
`Let me make you remember just who it was that lured you off that cliff...!!`
`...As the middle-aged female servant cuddled the sobbing baby, she walked on a small path through the trees...`
`Natsuhi had told her that the baby was too loud, so she had tried to get as far from the rose garden as she could.`
`...She was completely unaware as to why she'd gone out of her way to head in this direction.`
`However, the sobbing baby...`
`...suddenly stopped crying.`
`Something was reflected in its eyes, but the servant couldn't tell what.`
`However, thinking that the baby had stopped because it had taken an interest in something,`
` ...she headed in the direction of the baby's gaze...`
`The baby had seen...a cloud of gold butterflies disappearing off into the trees.`
`And, ......on the other side of the trees, ...the servant could see a woman.`
`......Who?`
`She didn't recognize this person, but it didn't look like anyone who was supposed to be here.`
`The baby stopped crying and stared in that direction.`
`...Then, the servant's legs started to automatically carry her that way...`
`"Come this way, woman.`
` ......Bring that cursed baby with you."`
`"............Ah..."`
`The woman couldn't disobey.`
`...She was completely overwhelmed by Beato's gold-glowing eyes...`
`She walked lightly, as though through a dream world.`
`...At some point, the scenery surrounding her had changed,`
` ...but she did not notice.`
` She could not notice...`
`Though this should have been Rokkenjima,`
` ...at some point, it had become the garden of a mansion she had never seen before.`
`It was a garden she had never set eyes on, even grander than the great rose garden of the Ushiromiya family, ...a garden of gold roses.`
`There stood an arbor,`
` ...and a woman wearing an elegant dress beckoning to her......`
`...There was a man who looked like a butler, and the tea he poured with a beautiful gesture had a very nice and enticing smell.`
`It was as though they were telling her to join their tea party...`
`She couldn't disobey.`
`......She had to go to the master of this golden rose garden...`
`...and give this child as an offering...`
`"Forgive me, woman.`
` Curse your bad luck for being entranced by a witch.`
` ...And, surrounded by these gold roses, which you would never be able to enjoy in this world, sleep.`
` ......Gaap."`
`"......Yes, understood."`
`When Gaap snapped her fingers,`
` ...a pitch-black hole opened at the woman's feet, and she was swallowed up along with the baby.`
`The scene of the moment that followed must've burned itself into the eyes of the woman and the baby.`
`The two floated in the air...and looked down at the gold rose garden spread out below them.`
`Below their feet was not the earth, but a golden rose garden that stretched as far as the eye could see, without any gaps.`
`If one could have this scene imprinted in their minds as their last memory, that would be such a merciful way to die...`
`Then, the woman and the baby were swallowed up by the golden sea.`
`The *thunk* was remarkably plain, and remarkably quiet for a sound that stole away two lives.`
`...However, it made for a perfectly suitable show at a tea party of witches.`
`With the woman and the baby at the center, ...the rose garden was slowly swallowed up by darkness...`
`The sound of the wind grew stronger bit by bit.`
`...Is that TV static?`
`What is that noise...?`
`...It was the roar of the sea.`
`The two who had fallen into the thicket of golden roses from that great height and died...`
`...were gradually wrapped up in the roar of the sea, wrapped up in the scenery of the beach below the cliff...`
`"I guarantee it.`
` You are completely sinless!!`
` I'll accept this revenge from 19 years ago!!`
` Wahhahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"...Ee, ...eeeeeeeeeeeeekkk......!"`
`When I spotted the two of them on the rocks below, ...I went pale.`
`Then, I dashed back to the mansion, ...and there was a huge uproar.`
`They took them to a hospital in a boat as soon as possible, ......but from that height, it was a miracle that they had even avoided an instant death.`
`Both the servant...`
`...and the baby...`
`......died.`
`In less than three days from the time Father had entrusted me with the baby, ......I had killed it...!`
`My husband had been on a business trip.`
`Rosa-san, who had still lived on the island at the time, had been traveling with her friends.`
`......Father and I were the only ones on Rokkenjima!!`
`And before anyone except Father and I really knew anything, `
`......a baby had appeared out of nowhere...and then disappeared again!!`
`That's right, it was a dream...a nightmare!!`
`I was sure that Father would blame me.`
`...However, he seemed somehow strange...!`
`"Heh, ......heheheheheheheh, fwahahahahahahahahahahahhahhahaha!!`
` I saw this coming, I knew this would happen!`
` How long will you struggle?`
` How long will it be before you're mine?!!`
` Wahahahahaahahahahahaha!!`
` I have no interest in an empty cage!`
` Throw it away!!"`
`When Father learned of the accidental death,`
` he kept on laughing and laughing, as though there could be no greater pleasure,`
` enough that just listening to it gave me a creepy feeling.`
`Perhaps something had come loose in his mind......`
`From that day onwards...`
`Father shut himself up inside the world of the occult even more than he ever had before......`
`When my husband came back, he was surprised to see that Father was even more bizarre than he had been before.`
`However, ......he had already accepted that this would happen sooner or later.`
`Of course, my husband had heard about the baby.`
`However, he told me that it was surely just some whim of Father's, and to forget it.`
`So I forgot it!`
`It was an unfortunate accident.`
`No, there wasn't an accident at all!`
`I forgot everything, even that the baby had existed in the first place...!!`
`After all, it was a twisted nightmare that lasted not even three days!`
`That's right, it was all a nightmare...!!`
`I don't want to remember!!`
`The cliff, the broken fence, the roar of the sea,`
` and...the cry of the baby......!!!`
`"So, this baby......is the baby from 19 years ago?"`
`"Of course not!`
` I killed that baby!`
` It no longer exists in this world!"`
`"...However, there is no red truth in the Human world.`
` Nothing can be trusted there."`
`"......That's right.`
` Beato definitely killed that baby.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` However, you might find out that it's alive in the world of Humans.`
` ...Whether ~ib~it's really alive or not~ib~, right?"`
`"Do you mean to say......that it actually survived?!`
` After falling to the rocks from that height...?!"`
`"I don't know.`
` But calm down.`
` ...No matter how much this person hates you, it was an accident, and that's the truth.`
` If he does hate you, his hatred is completely unjustified...!"`
`"But, but...!`
` Even if I didn't lay a finger on him, ...inside my heart, I...!!"`
`"Calm down.`
` ...No matter who the man from 19 years ago hates or what he yells at you, there's no way the sin he's after actually occurred.`
` So calm down.`
` Why don't I welcome the man from 19 years ago as my guest?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Just when the riddle was solved and I thought my job was finished...`
` I've got to entertain this final guest of mine!!`
` Kuhhyahyayhahyahya!!"`
`"This begins to grow more interesting.`
` ...Not only are you protecting Lord Goldsmith's secret, but you also have a 19th guest, as well as a man from 19 years ago."`
`"......True, since we claim that Kinzo is alive, Erika is the 19th person.`
` And besides that 19th person, we also have a man from 19 years ago?`
` How interesting. I'm getting all fired up."`
`"We have no lack of opponents!!`
` And I was just lamenting the fact that I had but one guest at my tea party!!`
` Come, you fools!!`
` Kuhhahahahaahahahahahahaahahah!!"`
`Furudo Erika is Lady Bernkastel's piece.`
`In that case, whose piece is the man from 19 years ago...?`
`The voice faintly seeping from the other end of the line...was Natsuhi's.`
`"...I-I understand.`
` I'll go to sleep right now.`
` I won't leave my room, and I won't pick up the phone...!`
` So, don't involve my husband and daughter...!"`
`Even this begging scream, which would shake the heart of any listener, `
`...could be listened to with a cold ruthlessness through the end of the receiver...`
`"As long as you follow my orders, I will keep your secret, Mother.`
` ...Do not disobey me.`
` ...I am already very close by to you.`
` I can easily tell whether you have turned your lights off, or whether you are on the phone.`
` ...If I wished to, I could even kiss your sleeping face."`
`"I'll keep it!`
` I'll keep my promise!!`
` So stop it, just stop it!`
` Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt!!"`
`The receiver was slammed down.`
`...'He' knew very well that the way you hang up a phone can leave a nasty aftertaste for the other side...`
`"Okay, goodnight, Mother.`
` .........And there you have it.`
` Now Natsuhi won't come out of her room tonight."`
`"......That's pretty handy.`
` You can change your voice?"`
`"*giggle*!`
` Anyone can change their voice.`
` A sweet voice when coaxing Papa♪`
` A sick-sounding voice when taking the day off school.`
` An apologetic voice when turning down a friend that you actually hate!`
` If you want♪,`
` I can dooo`
` any kind of voice at all☆`
` Got it?!"`
`"......You should stop being a witch and become a voice actress."`
`"Heheheheheheheh!`
` So, are all the pieces set up on both sides now?`
` ......'Furudo Erika'.`
` What a wonderful piece.`
` She's a much more suitable piece for you than Ange was, Bern."`
`"......Your praise honors me, Lady Lambdadelta."`
`"The pleasure is mine.`
` ...She really is wonderful.`
` Truly cute.`
` I'd like to make her surrender to the Illusion of the Witch and see her face twist in humiliation."`
`"...Hear that?`
` ...Don't embarrass me, okay?`
` Prove yourself to be a much more useful piece than Ange was."`
`"Yes, leave it to me,`
` Lady Bernkastel, my master.`
` ...I'm nothing like that gloomy, dull-witted, totally uncute piece."`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*!`
` She's right.`
` That Ange didn't do anything useful except get turned into meat chunks to egg Battler on!`
` I have absolutely no interest in family love or sibling love!`
` The game we wanna see is more gruesome and sticky!`
` A <grotesque>, <pop>, and <cute> murder case!!"`
`"......If Natsuhi is the king, then I wonder if that makes Beato the queen.`
` *giggle*`
` The pack of witches and furniture guarding Natsuhi is less like a set of chess pieces and more like-"`
`"Bowling pins, right?!`
` Kyahhahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Natsuhi and Beato,`
` Kinzo and illusions of the worthless furniture!`
` Entertain us a bit, will ya?!"`
`"Especially you, Beato!`
` We're already bored of you!`
` This 'Legend of the Witch Murders' game of yours is over already!`
` Your time is over and done with!!`
` This game board already belongs to Bern and me.`
` It'll suit you to be reduced to one of our pieces and toyed with for all eternity!!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*`
` Both Natsuhi and Beato are like the guts of a filthy truth wrapped up in a bit of thin skin.`
` ...Tearing that to bits and dragging the insides out is one of my...`
`no, one of our few pleasures."`
`"Yep, you can have tons of fun with it.`
` Hey, are you watching, `
`Beatrice?`
` Look at how much fun can be had playing with your game board.`
` Lemme show you.`
` This 5th game's really gonna be fun!!"`
`"......It's a bit sad if we're the only ones having a pleasant chat.`
` Why don't you let Beato talk too?"`
`"Hear that?`
` I'll give you special permission to talk.`
` What do you hope to gain from this latest game?!"`
`"..............."`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` She said nothing!`
` That's right, that's right!`
` You're the loser who surrendered to Battler!`
` Leave it to me, 'kay?`
` I'll put the witch side on top right away!`
` But that means I'll have to sacrifice your piece!!"`
`"The epitaph has been easily solved before the first twilight, and Beatrice, the keeper of the gold, has lost face.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"...Isn't it great that you remain as a piece, as part of Natsuhi's illusion?`
` ...Well, we're treating you as a pin now instead of a piece, okay?"`
`"The Golden Witch Beatrice is out of the picture now!`
` You and your furniture have only a miniscule role in my game! A loser's role!!`
` Resign yourself to getting blasted away and becoming Bern's and my toy!!"`
`"......If you don't like that, why not just tell us to stop?`
` If you do, we'll stop."`
`"..............."`
`"She's saying she doesn't mind!`
` *giggle*giggle*!!`
` You're totally a pin!!"`
`"Ahhahaha, ahhahahahahaha "`
`kyahhhahahhah, hahahahahahhhahahahgwahyahhahaaah!!!""`
`There's no need for a Golden Witch anymore.`
`All that's needed is a sacrificial doll, so the two witches can enjoy some time playing.`
`Die, die, disappear.`
`Confess to your filthy past and your crimes,`
` speak out your sob story of regret and repentance as you throw yourself off a cliff and die!!`
`The Golden Witch will never again have her turn...!!`
`Ahhahhahahahahaahhahhaahahahahahaahahahahahahaha...!!`
`"..............."`
`".........Beato..."`
`This will probably...turn out to be a nasty game.`
`On the surface, it looks very similar to the usual tales.`
`However, ...there's no respect given to the true main character of this story.`
`This tale...was supposed to be one that the Golden Witch Beatrice invited Ushiromiya Battler to see.`
`However, the host has been lost, and there are no longer any guests.`
`...The one who did the inviting and the one who was invited...are no longer around in this horrible tale.`
`Welcome to the 5th game, `
` End of the`
`    Golden Witch.`
`Welcome to the banquet without the guest of honor, hijacked by the evil witches...`
`"......Ready, Battler?`
` The second day is finally about to start.`
` Heheheheh! Just like Beato, I hate slow story progression!"`
`"Just do what you want.`
` ...No matter how much you mess things up, I'll definitely reach the truth of this game."`
`"*giggle*`
` ......It has to be that way.`
` You've got to fight for your little sister's sake as well."`
`"............"`
`"Don't worry.`
` ...Lady Lambdadelta is a far more terrifying opponent than that fool Beatrice,`
` but I'll be giving you plenty of support, so there won't be any problems.`
` ...Together with me, why don't you finally expose the Illusion of the Witch this time?"`
`"......I don't give a damn about you.`
` I won't acknowledge anything that didn't exist in Beato's games, so I don't need you."`
`"Is now really the time to act tough?`
` ......Oh well, let's both give it our all, okay?`
` Together, let's tear this Illusion of the Witch apart.`
` *giggle*giggle*!"`
`Erika offered me her hand to shake.`
`...Instead of just passively ignoring this,`
` I gave her proactive and clear answer by knocking her hand aside.`
`"......*giggle*`
` Looks like he hates shaking hands.`
` Just like Ange."`
`"Don't worry.`
` I'm a far more useful piece than Ange.`
` ...I'm nothing at all like shredded meat that couldn't do anything but restore your fighting spirit."`
`"..............."`
`"*giggle*...!`
` Isn't it great that you've been blessed with such a helpful-looking ally?!`
` In the past, it was Virgilia and Ronove.`
` Then Ange came as well.`
` And now you have Bern and Erika!`
` There are so many pieces supporting you!`
` So, how does it feel knowing that you still can't catch on to the truth despite that? How does it feel?!"`
`"......It doesn't matter.`
` This battle is between me and Beato.`
` Everyone else besides us...doesn't matter."`
`"Oh, is that true?`
` Are you finally standing on your own?!`
` You've always had someone helping you, someone sympathetic to you, so I wonder just how far you'll get on your own!`
` Entertain me!"`
`"...I'll grab it and take it back.`
` ......This is our game.`
` ...You two aren't wanted here!!"`
`"*giggle*`
` Yes, that's true.`
` ......This is your game.`
` So try taking it back.`
` ...Let's see how far someone like you, who couldn't even win Beato's games when she went easy on you all over the place,`
` can get in Lambda's completely ruthless game without any help!"`
`"Well then, wake up!! Ushiromiya Battler!! Welcome to the morning of October 5th!!"`
`...Was it someone's alarm clock?`
`*beep*beep*`
`An electronic tone repeatedly rang out through the room...`
`Battler, who had gone to bed late and not managed to get enough sleep,`
` covered his head in his blanket and waited for someone to turn off the alarm.`
`...But no matter how much time passed, the electronic tone didn't stop.`
`......I see.`
`The point of an alarm clock isn't just to be loud enough to wake you, `
`but to be annoying enough to keep you from wanting to fall back asleep.`
`Heeey, ...the alarm's going off.`
`Make it stop please...`
`Why do waking-up voices always get this annoyed?`
`...Well, it does makes sense.`
`After all, people are still sleepy and in a bad mood.`
`However, there was absolutely no sign that my annoyed voice had caused anyone to turn over in their sleep...`
`or crawl out of bed to stop the alarm.`
`Letting out a deep sigh, I stumbled to my feet.`
`With the shutters down on the windows, there was almost no light getting in, and the room was as dim as it had been earlier.`
`Though, even without the shutters, `
`there's no way this dull weather would let in enough sun to make this a pleasant morning.`
`The cousins were still wrapped up in their beds, sound asleep and taking no notice whatsoever of that beeping.`
`Normally, once any one person gets up, the others tend to automatically follow...`
`...Annoyed that this 'law of serial summer camp awakenings' that I'd made up had been broken, I searched for the source of the sound.`
`I could hear it coming from a wristwatch set on a table.`
`Judging by the style of the watch, it was probably George-aniki's.`
`Anyway, when I randomly pushed a small button on the side of it, the sound stopped.`
`Apparently, it had been set for 7:00 in the morning.`
`......Is it already 7:00?`
`Sorry, but I really don't feel like I slept at all...`
`Playing cards were left on the table as though they had stopped mid-game.`
`...The game had probably been sevens.`
`"..............."`
`Dammit, ...I've got this piercing headache.`
`What the hell happened last night?`
`...That mountain of gold and the subsequent argument between the relatives...all feel like a bad dream...`
`"......So stupid..."`
`Breakfast normally came at 8:00.`
`......Now wasn't a bad time to start getting up and getting dressed.`
`Even those adults probably won't argue in front of the cousins.`
`......In that case, I'll stay with my cousins all day long.`
`I'm sure they'll be able to separate me from all this annoying talk about the gold and being the Successor and all......`
`In fact, I should have done this from the beginning...`
`I felt disgusting, having slept with my clothes on last night, which caused me to get all sweaty.`
`...I guess I'll take a shower.`
`I'm sure the others want to as well.`
`At this age, it's embarrassing to wake them by shaking their shoulders.`
`If I turn the TV on, everyone will probably wake up.`
`Well, let's at least turn the lights on for now.`
`...In this dim light, with the quiet sound of the never-ending wind and rain, it really doesn't feel like morning has come yet.`
`I flipped the light switch.`
`And then, that dimly lit morning ended.`
`"......George, ......Geeeooooooooorge!!!"`
`"This is just too horrible...`
` How...could anyone get away with somethin' like this...?!!"`
`As they clung to Aniki's corpse, which would never wake up again,`
` ...Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi cried.`
`"...That's enough.`
` Do you think George-kun would like the two of you to see him this way...?`
` Of course not...!"`
`"......Aneki,`
` I know how you feel, but let's have Doctor Nanjo handle this..."`
`"You don't understand!!`
` George was killed!`
` George!!`
` Geoooooooooorge, ugghaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!"`
`"Doctor Nanjo's right.`
` We mustn't keep staring at George in such a state...`
` ...This is for George's sake!`
` We have to restrain ourselves for now...!"`
`When Aunt Eva tried even harder to cling to that corpse,`
` Dad and Uncle Hideyoshi dragged her away and had a heated debate with her beside the wall...`
`"No, nooooooooooooo, Geooooooooorge!!`
` Doctor Nanjo! Help him!!`
` If he's lost too much blood, do a blood transfusion!!`
` George and I are the same blood type!!`
` I beg you!`
` Doctor Nanjo!!"`
`".........Eva-san,`
` ...it pains me to say this, `
`...but your blood can't do George-kun any good now..."`
`Doctor Nanjo shook his head slightly, then nodded across to where I stood, giving me a signal.`
`I softly pulled the blanket up, ...covering George-aniki's corpse.`
`His neck...was split wide open.`
`...It was probably...larger and deeper than his mouth.`
`Would covering that part up make the corpse look neat and clean...?`
`Of course not...`
`...The large amount of lost blood stained the bed a horrible red and black,`
` ...and even covering him with the blanket couldn't hide the traces.`
`After all, even the blanket had large, red-black stains,`
` and covering him with it made his corpse look even more gruesome...`
`So I stripped the blanket off of my bed and placed it on top of the first one.`
`...But there were only two extra blankets.`
`So if we covered one more of the corpses, ...we wouldn't be able to cover any more.`
`I feel bad about the ones we can't cover, `
`...but for some reason, ...times like these make me feel like muttering 'don't complain about it being unfair' inside my head......`
`"...Kyrie,`
` put blankets over all of them.`
` ...Wouldn't want them to catch cold."`
`".........Sure."`
`Kyrie-san and I started covering the other corpses up to their heads with their blankets, just like George-aniki's...`
`...So that they wouldn't have to undergo any more shame, ...with their terrible wounds exposed like this...`
`In one bed...rested Jessica.`
`...Jessica was exactly the same as George-aniki.`
`Though she appeared to be resting quietly in the bed, `
`...her neck had been sliced deep and the wound lay open in a brutal way...`
`Maria was the same.`
`...And not only Maria.`
`There was one more victim.`
`Lying on the same bed, as though they'd been sleeping alongside each other, `
`...was Aunt Rosa.`
`George-aniki, Jessica, Maria, ...and Aunt Rosa.`
`...In this room were four humans who had been killed, their necks sliced open.`
`They'd probably been like that since last night.`
`...I'd returned without noticing anything, gotten in bed, and fallen asleep...`
`......All of them had a horizontal cut across their throats.`
`I had been...forced to see all the way...into the depths of those gashes in everyone's throats...`
`At worst, the wounds might've been deep enough to stretch halfway through their necks.`
`...If you tried to open it up, you'd probably be able to see that the gash reached all the way to the bone.`
`The only wounds were the single gashes on each neck.`
`...So if you just covered their necks with your hand,`
` ...you might be able to persuade yourself that they were merely sleeping.`
`But even so, `
`...this frighteningly deep wound...`
`...was incredibly...`
`gruesome......`
`There's no such thing as 'clean' or 'dirty' ways of killing.`
`...All methods of killing are equally brutal.`
`But even so, `
`......the brutality here...`
`...was just horrible.........`
`And...there was one more thing that adorned these brutal murders, making them even more unsettling.`
`Drawn very large on the wall...`
`...was something like an eerie magic circle.`
`It was drawn in a bright-red paint that looked like blood...`
`and made it look as though some creepy ceremony had taken place in this room,`
` with the four of them offered as human sacrifices...`
`However, that wasn't what we were concerned about.`
`...No one has a heart so cold that they could witness the deaths of those close to them...`
`...and still worry about some scribbles on the wall...`
`"......Good morning, everyone.`
` ......Oh, ...what a wonderful magic circle."`
`The girl who bragged that she drew more pleasure from the process of exposing the truth than the truth itself...`
`...and who went so far as to call herself an intellectual rapist, ...appeared in the hall.`
`When she saw the extraordinarily creepy magic circle in this gruesome room,`
` I heard what was unmistakably a sigh of admiration escape her lips...`
`"You...... ...Don't come in here......"`
`"......I just heard about it in the corridor.`
` It's four people who've passed away, correct?`
` ...Allow me to express my sincere regrets."`
`On Erika's face...`
`...no, that's not it.`
`It was in her eyes.`
`...In Erika's eyes, I could see...`
`......an indiscreet smile......`
`...that was hard to describe.`
`She...found this interesting.`
`...She found the outbreak of a crime...`
`...interesting...`
`It was like the smile of a kid off to the side of the stage just before her turn to appear in a school play...`
`"...Sorry, Erika-chan.`
` We're busy at the moment.`
` ...Could you wait in your room?"`
`"......Well, we can't have that.`
` It's the detective's right to investigate the scene."`
`"We're saying that we have no business with you...!`
` Now's the time for outsiders like you to stand back!!"`
`"......In my personal opinion, `
`only third-rate mysteries have a suspect who tries to interfere with the investigation, and then turns out to be the culprit."`
`"Who gives a damn about what you want?!!`
` Get out!!`
` You aren't wanted here!!"`
`"Erika-chan...!`
` I'm really sorry, but could you go back to your room?!`
` We're busy right now!"`
`"Geooooooooooorge, `
`Geooooooooooorge, `
`waaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!"`
`"...Stand back.`
` I can't investigate the scene like this."`
`"If it's necessary, we'll do it ourselves! The police will do it!`
` Like hell you have the right to bring more shame to everyone's remains than they've already endured!!"`
`"#ff0000Detective's authority.`
` ...The detective has the right to inspect all crime scenes.`
` Stand back, Ushiromiya Battler.`
` This is an official privilege of this game, which the Human side has accepted.#ffffff"`
`Those words, which seemed to be utterly ridiculous at first, `
`...were words of power that had come from a world on a much higher plane than the one they were in.`
`Battler was thrown back by an unseen power and landed on his butt.`
`Struck silent by this quiet intensity, ...nobody was able to prevent Erika from entering the room, suffocated by this bizarre atmosphere...`
`"......Don't worry.`
` My goal is not to profane the dignity of the deceased.`
` It's not like I want to peek into something as disgusting as a slit through someone's neck.`
` ...I want to know something completely different."`
`"In other words, who committed these murders.`
` ...I ask Doctor Nanjo, and everyone else too.`
` ......In particular, the first one to discover them, Battler-san.`
` ......There are many things I want to question you about, so I request your cooperation."`
`"...L-Like I said, by what authority are you doing this...?!"`
`"#ff0000Because I am the detective.#ffffff"`
`Battler couldn't argue against this incomprehensible nonsense.`
`...No, ...he wasn't permitted to argue.`
`It was a restriction...placed on pieces.`
`Erika summoned Doctor Nanjo and heard the details of his preliminary examination of the corpses.`
`...Normally, he wouldn't have spoken of that to an outsider so casually.`
`...However, for some reason, the atmosphere about the place had become one in which hiding things from Erika was forbidden...`
`"......Okay, let's enjoy this first twilight of Lambda's.`
` Four corpses?`
` That's two corpses short.`
` ...Well, she doesn't necessarily need to have six people killed, but that's how we've been playing.`
` That girl isn't completely clueless, so she must've killed two more people somewhere."`
`On the wall was a magic circle representing the first twilight, similar to the ones in Beato's games.`
`*giggle* That girl talks tough, but I wonder just how closely she'll be able to imitate Beato.`
`*giggle*giggle*, ahhahahahahaha...!`
`That Hebrew sure is crappy.`
`It isn't written exactly right.`
`"...What the heck...`
` What's going on?`
` Why's there a magic circle?"`
`"I'll bet they wanted to copy Beatrice-sama.`
` Aha, what a crappy magic circle...!"`
`"This isn't just a copycat!`
` Some Human went out of their way to draw that...so they could make it look like Beatrice-sama did this...!`
` Anyway, let's report to Beatrice-sama about this!"`
`"Even though we're already up to our eyeballs just protecting Goldsmith's secret... What a pain."`
`"But these murders have no beauty to them at all.`
` ...It isn't really a closed room, and there's nothing impossible about it.`
` Such pitiful murders aren't worthy of Beatrice-sama at all."`
`"...Furudo Erika...`
` ...An unexpected crime and an unexpected woman.`
` ...And the unexpected man from 19 years ago.`
` ......And if you add in the fact that Battler's already solved the epitaph, this game is completely different from normal.`
` ...What the heck's going on...?!`
` Let's go!!"`
`""Yes, Onee-sama!!""`
`In the kitchen, Gohda was preparing a wonderful breakfast at a brisk pace.`
`The main dish would be herb omelets.`
`Even simple foods could become an invigorating feast under Gohda's skillful hands.`
`He would precook everything beforehand and prepare the food in the dining hall right before everyone's eyes.`
`"Hmm hmm hmm hmm♪ Pan pan pan pan♪"`
`Gohda hummed as he continued his work in high spirits.`
`When Shannon, who was helping out, saw Gohda like this, her mood also brightened.`
`She arranged the salad in a neat little pattern and showed it to Gohda.`
`"How is this?`
` I think it makes the tomato look a bit cute."`
`"Hmmmm, very nice!`
` You really know what you're doing, Shannon-san!`
` Hmm hmm hmm hmm♪"`
`""Hmm hmm hmm hmm♪""`
`The two happy people gave each other a high five.`
`Shannon didn't like Gohda when he was sneaky, but she had no problems at all with him when he was cooking happily.`
`She sometimes even thought it'd be nice if his contract hadn't included any jobs besides cooking.`
`If that had been the case, he wouldn't have had to get in a bad mood doing unnecessary jobs.`
`"The dining hall is ready.`
` You can carry it in whenever you want."`
`"We're almost good to go, so please get the serving cart ready.`
` Hmm hmm hmmmmm!"`
`Without thinking, even Kumasawa caught Gohda's high spirits.`
`The kitchen had a very nice smell and atmosphere about it, truly refreshing for so early in the morning.`
`Then, Kanon came back, grumpy even this early in the morning, just like he always was.`
`Kanon and Genji were in charge of getting many things ready for the morning, such as opening the curtains.`
`...However, Kanon was alone today, so it had taken much longer than usual.`
`"I'm done.`
` ...Where's Genji-sama?"`
`"He still isn't here.`
` ......That's odd.`
` I can't imagine he'd sleep in."`
`"Hohoho.`
` I guess even Genji-san sleeps in sometimes."`
`"That's rather careless of him, considering that this is the middle of the family conference.`
` Kanon-san,`
` could you wake him for us?"`
`".........Yes."`
`"I wonder what Genji-san's face looks like when he's half asleep...`
` Hohohoho. Let me go with you."`
`Even though Gohda had asked her to get the serving cart ready,`
` Kumasawa plodded off after Kanon, slyly skipping work.`
`As Kanon muttered about how Gohda was the one who slept in all the time,`
` he headed for the servant waiting room.`
`"So, you didn't wake him up this morning, Kanon-san?"`
`"...Last night, I fell asleep while still in the servant room, so I didn't return to the waiting room."`
`Last night, Kanon had dozed off while in the middle of his late night shift, `
`falling asleep in the servant room.`
`Shannon had been kind enough to put a blanket on him,`
` but that had just made it so warm that he fell into an even deeper sleep...`
`So he hadn't returned to his bed in the servant waiting room the previous night.`
`Because of that, he hadn't met Genji even once this morning.`
`There was a knock on the door.`
`"...Genji-sama,`
` it's Kanon.`
` Good morning."`
`"......Oh my.`
` I wonder if he's still sleeping."`
`"...Pardon me."`
`When he tried to open the door,`
` ...Kanon noticed something strange on the upper part of it.`
`...What's that? ...Packing tape??`
`A small strip of packing tape was stuck along the frame of the door,`
` almost as though it was sealing the door shut.`
`Furthermore, there were notches made with scissors along the center of the packing tape,`
` so that if you opened the door only a slight amount, it would be torn apart.`
`Also, written sloppily across the packing tape with a thin pen was what appeared to be someone's signature.`
`...It was written in a very intricate and decorative manner,`
` so even if it was a signature, there was no way of telling whose it was.`
`"It's probably some sort of prank..."`
`"I don't get it, but it's no use worrying about it now.`
` ...Genji-sama,`
` pardon me."`
`The packing tape tore apart, and he opened the door.`
`It wasn't as though anything happened when it split, so the two quickly forgot about that strange tape.`
`...The room was dimly lit.`
`The lower bed of the two-level bunk bed still had a lump under the blanket.`
`Apparently, Genji was still sleeping...`
`"Good morning, Genji-sama."`
`"This isn't like you. Ho ho ho.`
` It's morning!"`
`".........!`
` G-Genji-sama...!"`
`"Eek, ...wh-what is this, what is this...?!"`
`There was a large, red-black stain on the blanket.`
`...Even the servants' blankets were always kept clean.`
`A stain like that definitely shouldn't have been there.`
`Kanon hesitantly peeled back Genji's blanket, `
`......saw what was left of him, `
`...and was shocked into silence.`
`"Wh-What the heck?`
` His neck's been cut open!"`
`"......It's thin.`
` ...You wouldn't be able to leave a cut this deep without a fairly long blade."`
`"Wh-What's going on?`
` Battler solved the riddle of the epitaph, right?`
` Why are there murders happening?!"`
`"I don't know.`
` ...In any event, this isn't good.`
` We should report this to Beatrice-sama and Natsuhi-sama."`
`"Belpha, hurry and report to Luci-nee...!!"`
`"Understood...!"`
`After dashing out, Kumasawa called Gohda and Shannon over.`
`...Then, this new pair let out screams identical to the first two.`
`"Nooooo!`
` Don't stop making breakfast, Gohda!"`
`"Is now really the time to be saying that?!!`
` ...There's no chance they'll have a quiet and peaceful breakfast on the second day.`
` ...I have a bad feeling about this.`
` Genji might not be the only one.`
` ...Let's check the entire mansion. Something else might've happened...!"`
`"Yes, Onee-sama!!"`
`Natsuhi sprang awake at the sudden sound of the phone.`
`Even Natsuhi was surprised that she'd woken up.`
`...She'd thought she'd spent the whole night unable to sleep out of fear that the mysterious man might come in at any moment,`
` but she'd dozed off before she knew it...`
`Of course, Natsuhi still didn't feel rested at all.`
`Though she groaned from the dull pain in her head, which hadn't gone away once since last night, `
`she managed to get out of bed...`
`"Morning, Natsuhi-sama."`
`"......Morning.`
` ...And what a horrible morning it is..."`
`"Don't worry.`
` No one tried to enter this room."`
`"...I see.`
` ...Thanks for keeping watch all night..."`
`Even so, that didn't mean she'd been able to sleep peacefully.`
`......The continued ringing of the phone made her headache throb even more strongly...`
`"I think you should probably answer the phone.`
` ...And then, I've got some bad news to report from my sisters."`
`"...Let's leave the bad news for later.`
` ...I'll answer the phone first."`
`Natsuhi shook her head to wake herself and picked up the receiver.`
`...Then, she regretted not listening to Lucifer's bad news first.`
`...Because she wanted the first thing she heard on this horrible morning to be something better than this...`
`"......Morning, Mother.`
` ...Did you sleep well?"`
`That voice...told her that this horrible morning--this nightmare--would not stop...`
`"...I-I kept my promise.`
` I've been holed up in this room the whole time.`
` Of course, I haven't been on the phone either...!"`
`"But you did pick up the phone just now, did you not...?"`
`"...W-Well, ...ah-"`
`"Ahahahahahahahaha.`
` ...Just kidding.`
` This is just a morning call I am giving my beloved Mother.`
` Morning, Mother.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*...!"`
`"......How far do you intend to mock me...?"`
`Natsuhi gripped the receiver so hard it creaked...`
`"I wanted you to leave your seat so that I could set up for the party.`
` ...Thanks to that, everything is ready now.`
` Of course, you are the main guest, Mother."`
`"...Wh-What are you planning to do...?"`
`"That is for you to look forward to.`
` ...Do not worry, I will not keep you waiting.`
` It has already begun.`
` ...Oh, right, wait a sec.`
` There is someone I want you to hear."`
`"...Huh?"`
`There was the sound of the receiver being jolted around.`
`...The phone was apparently being passed to someone else, but there was a clunking, clattering noise,`
` as though it was taking a lot of effort to hand the receiver over...`
`Who in the world could he be giving the phone to?`
`...No matter who...this man gives the phone to...that can't be good news for me...`
`"...Gwah!`
` Untie me...!`
` Coward...!!"`
`"Huh?!`
` ...D-Dear?!`
` Is that you?!"`
`"Gghgghghghghgh, mwoooohh...!!`
` Untie it, untie iiiit!!"`
`It was, without a doubt, the voice of her husband.`
`However, he didn't respond to Natsuhi's voice.`
`...Perhaps he was bound somewhere in the darkness.`
`Krauss, not realizing that Natsuhi was on the other end of the phone, repeatedly demanded that he be untied...`
`"...Your husband is here.`
` His eyes and ears are covered, so you won't be able to talk,`
` but I think you can tell that he is in perfect health."`
`"Wh-What are you after...?!!`
` Let my husband go!"`
`"I will let him go tomorrow.`
` If you keep two promises, that is."`
`"What are they...?!"`
`"One is that you keep it a secret that I have your husband in my care.`
` ...There will probably be a fuss when they are unable to find Krauss anywhere in the mansion,`
` but you know nothing, so you will say nothing.`
` ...Understand?"`
`"I-I understand...!`
` What's your other condition?!"`
`"...Oh, just a little game.`
` At 1:00 today,`
` you will go into the foremost guest room on the first floor of the mansion and hide in the closet."`
`"A guest room...?`
` Why should I go into a closet...?!"`
`"Just a little hide-and-seek.`
` If you can hide there for an hour without anyone finding you, you win.`
` ...If someone does find you, you lose."`
`"And if I lose, `
`...what happens...?!"`
`"Nothing in particular.`
` ...Is that not what playing is all about?`
` If you play along with this hide-and-seek, I will release your husband tomorrow."`
`"W-`
`Will you really...`
`keep that promise, I wonder...?"`
`"Of course.`
` Make sure you do too, Mother.`
` ...If you break our promise, I will know right away."`
`At that time, there was suddenly a loud knock on the door to Natsuhi's room.`
`Her heart leapt automatically.`
`"...Madam, are you there?`
` Good morning...!"`
`"It's Gohda and Kanon!`
` Madam, please wake up...!"`
`The voices coming from across the door were Kanon's and Gohda's.`
`...The knock had been wild, and the voices a little shrill.`
`...It seemed that something strange had happened...and that they were agitated.`
`"......What is it?`
` Did something happen?"`
`"I-It's nothing.`
` It looks like the servants have arrived.`
` I'm hanging up."`
`"Sure.`
` I have said everything I wanted to.`
` ......So, do not break our promise."`
`"...I understand.`
` A-And you don't break our promise either...!"`
`"You have it wrong.`
` That is for you to decide, Mother.`
` ......Do not make me break my promise,`
` Mother."`
`"......Ack..."`
`"I will be watching you all day today, Mother.`
` *giggle*giggle*, ahahahaha, ohohohohoho!"`
`*clank*!`
`Lambdadelta slammed the receiver down on the antique phone.`
`Then, the phone exploded into bits and became a golden splash, then a cloud of gold butterflies, and then disappeared.`
`"*giggle* Dance for me, Natsuhi!`
` Dance in fear of your sin 19 years ago!!`
` My turn's going pretty well.`
` Okay, your turn now, Bern!!"`
`"......I'm sure this is a waste of time, but let me confirm whether correspondence with the outside world, including reporting this to the police, is possible or not."`
`"It's impossible to make use of the external line!`
` Looks like you can use the internal line!`
` It's impossible to use a boat inside the typhoon!`
` I guess the closed circle is complete now!`
` Congrats, you're a full detective now, Bern!"`
`When the police intervene, they sometimes steal some of the detective's authority.`
`However, with the construction of the closed circle, the existence of police had been denied for all eternity.`
`From now on, the authority of the detective piece will be totally guaranteed.`
`"Yeah, yeah, thanks a bunch.`
` Then I guess it's time to get this game started."`
`Erika, you're the main character.`
`Now, begin...!`
`"...E-Even Genji-san?!`
` F-Five people have been killed?!"`
`"Y-Yes.`
` ...And it was so...horrible...!"`
`"It was exactly the same as the four in the guesthouse...`
` ...The neck...was sliced open...with a terribly sharp blade..."`
`"...T-To think that even though I had the midnight shift, ...I didn't notice anyone suspicious..."`
`"Don't blame yourself.`
` ...If you'd bumped into the culprit, you might be the one dead right now."`
`"On top of that, the phones aren't even connectin'...!`
` I doubt any boats'll come in this weather.`
` This is serious...!"`
`"...And that makes it very likely the culprit's still nearby."`
`"E-Eeeeeeeeeeeeekkkk...!`
` Then what?`
` Does that mean we'll be trapped here with a murderer until the typhoon passes and the boat comes...?!"`
`"...I-It'll be okay.`
` If we all stay together like this, even the culprit won't be able to lay a finger on us...!"`
`"...E-Even Jessica...`
` ...I can't believe it......"`
`"W-We won't let ourselves be killed...!!`
` I'll avenge George!!`
` I won't let them get away!`
` No matter who the culprit is or what their reason was, I won't let the one who killed George get away!!`
` I'll kill them, I'll kill them!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh...!!"`
`"......Okay, everyone, are you done crying yet? Silence, please.`
` ...Has anyone seen Krauss-san yet?"`
`"...We've been calling him for a while, but he hasn't answered..."`
`"Could the receiver be off the hook...?"`
`"No, we could hear it ringing.`
` There's no way he didn't hear it..."`
`"............"`
`"Wh-What does it mean...?`
` You don't think...Uncle Krauss too...?!"`
`".........Figures.`
` ......I hate to say it at a time like this, ...but there were four in the guesthouse, plus Genji to make five.`
` ...I figured there would be one more."`
`"Why?!`
` How could you know that?!`
` Are you the culprit?!`
` Did you kill George?!"`
`"St-Stop it, Eva-san...!`
` Now is not the time...!"`
`Eva got agitated and grabbed at Kyrie.`
`Nanjo stepped in between them, and it grew into a bit of a scuffle...`
`Watching this, Erika smiled condescendingly and shrugged.`
`"Of course.`
` It's natural you'd guess there were six victims after seeing the crime scene in the guesthouse.`
` There were only four corpses, so it'd make you wonder who the other two were."`
`"How could you know such a thing?!!`
` You killed them?!`
` You killed Geoooooorge!!"`
`"Qu-Quit it, Eva!`
` ......Erika-chan, Kyrie-san...!`
` How can you know that?!`
` Can't you think before you talk...?!"`
`"......It's a simple connection to make.`
` The scribble drawn at the scene of the crime in the guesthouse was a magic circle.`
` I just tried to think of things connected to both magic and murders."`
`"Ah, ......so it's the epitaph, huh?"`
`"...I see...`
` ......It's......the first twilight."`
`"Huh? ...Huh?`
` What's going on...?!"`
`"W-Well, I don't have a clue either...!!"`
`"......Is that how it is...?`
` ...That damn witch..."`
`"So is this really......Beatrice-sama's doing...?"`
`"Why do you all keep talking as if you know something?!!`
` I don't have a clue!!`
` Someone, explain!!"`
`"I told you, Eva...! Calm down a bit...!!"`
`"..............."`
`"...That's how it is.`
` Ever since I saw the magic circle at that crime scene, `
`I imagined this might be a plotline murder following the epitaph's first twilight, which would mean there are six victims."`
`"...Simply by the existence of the magic circle in that place, `
`this level of reasoning is possible for Furudo Erika.`
` What do you think, everyone?"`
`"......So, Uncle Krauss was also...killed...?"`
`"We can't be sure of that.`
` ...Krauss-san isn't the only person who hasn't come here, right?`
` There's one more."`
`".........!"`
`For just an instant, Natsuhi's brow furrowed......`
`So, ...she hadn't been able to avoid the topic of the study after all...`
`"You don't mean...Dad?!`
` Hey, someone must've contacted the study, right?!"`
`"O-Of course we called...and even knocked on the door...`
` But, umm, there was no answer..."`
`"...F-Father is immersing himself in his research...`
` H-He sometimes leaves the receiver off the hook because he doesn't want to be called and even ignores any knocking...!"`
`"...B-But the phone was ringing..."`
`"A-Anyway...!`
` Let's first check to see that my husband's safe!!`
` Let's go to his room!!"`
`Natsuhi stood up in a flurry and dashed out into the corridor.`
`Rudolf and the others immediately chased after her, telling her to wait.`
`".........Come on, let's all go together.`
` In both third-rate mysteries and third-rate horrors, people who act alone tend to die first.`
` ...Yeah, this game is just the same.`
` ...Beato really is third-rate.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*...!"`
`Oh, but in third-rate disaster movies and third-rate action movies, people who act alone do survive, right?`
`Weird.`
`*giggle*giggle*!`
`"...Even though the epitaph has already been solved...`
` ...Who's behind this farce...?"`
`"It might be the work of this man from 19 years ago, ...who is thought to be Lady Lambdadelta's piece.`
` ...Ah yes, that can't be true."`
`"...In the games up until now, Beato has already stated that Kinzo has vanished,`
` meaning that no more than 17 people exist and no 18th person exists.`
` Now that Erika has been added, it's been stated that no 19th person exists.`
` There's no room for this man from 19 years ago to appear on the island."`
`"So, the man from 19 years ago is disguised as one of the existing Humans,`
` ...or else..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Even if a 19th person isn't permitted by the red, `
`slipping in a 19th person is no trouble for me, no trouble for witches...!`
` Now it's getting interesting. Why don't we watch this a little longer?"`
`"Still, those two witches...`
`have finally started to do whatever they please with my game board, haven't they...?!"`
`"......Didn't you know that would happen when you invited them?"`
`"Hmph.`
` ...As a witch, I have the same dislike for boredom as they do.`
` Even the unexpected brings the kind of joy a witch expects.`
` Very well, bring it on...!"`
`"It's great that you're so eager, ...but things have taken a nasty turn.`
` Get it?"`
`".........Indeed.`
` Perhaps this isn't the best time to wait and see what happens next."`
`"I know that.`
` At this rate, Kinzo's existence will become an issue once again.`
` ...And the barrier around the study won't last long."`
`"That isn't all.`
` Things are going to get even worse.`
` ......See?`
` Move one, `
`move two, `
`move three.`
` ...And then you're cornered,`
` ...Natsuhi."`
`Gaap whispered something into Beato's ear.`
`Beato's mouth...slowly widened into a grin.`
`"...Erika bringing everyone together is actually convenient for us.`
` All darkness outside the range of observers belongs to us demons.`
` ...This may be the only time to make that move."`
`"Natsuhi is the king.`
` She can't move far, but we cannot allow her to be taken!`
` ...Let's take the initiative.`
` If we slip up here, Natsuhi will be cornered...!`
` Gaap, can I count on you?!"`
`"Of course!`
` ...I'll blow a hole through closed room tricks, alibis, and mysteries alike.`
` ......Leave it to me. I'll handle it."`
`Gaap was swallowed up, along with the chair she sat in, into a pitch-black hole that opened on the floor and then disappeared.`
`After that, a hole opened on the ceiling and spat just the chair back out, returning the place to the way it had been...`
`"...This is becoming troublesome."`
`"Heh, ...heheheheheheheh.`
` ...I see.`
` Against Lady Lambdadelta, even I am nothing more than a mere piece.`
` So, in the early game, I must worry more about expansion than losing or taking pieces.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*!`
` I'm just no match for that person!`
` I won't let her do that. Natsuhi is the final master I will serve!`
` Know that this is a piece you'll never be allowed to take, so long as she has a contract with me, Beatrice!!"`
`"Krauss's room was empty.`
` The bed was too,`
` but massive bloodstains similar to the other crime scenes remained."`
`"But there was no corpse."`
`"Nope."`
`"Then he isn't dead."`
`"Maybe not. Heheheheheheheh...!!"`
`"...What's going on?!`
` Where's Nii-san?!"`
`"Judging by this bloodstained bed...`
` I don't like to think about it, but we should probably assume that he was killed and had his neck cut open, just like the people in the guesthouse..."`
`"......Probably...`
` Judging by the amount of blood lost, ...it's hard to imagine that he's okay..."`
`"B-But...`
`where did Krauss-sama go...?"`
`Large amounts of blood stained the top of the bed, but there were no similar marks on the floor of the room.`
`Whether Krauss had been seriously wounded and wandered off somewhere...or killed and carried somewhere,`
` ...they had no clue where this 'somewhere' might be.`
`"..............."`
`...Natsuhi knew.`
`Though Krauss had been sounding far from his best over the phone, `
`at least he hadn't sounded like he was on the brink of death.`
`In other words, these blood stains had to be a setup.`
`That might not even be blood...`
`......However, ...just what was that man thinking?`
`...What's this supposed to be...?!`
`"What the heck......`
` ...So, on the first twilight, ...there were six sacrifices...?"`
`"......Was Krauss nii-san in the habit of locking his door?`
` We just came in without unlocking it."`
`"...Yes, Krauss-sama also has a habit of locking up."`
`"A-At this house, `
`Madam has ordered that all non-public areas be locked."`
`"How many keys can unlock Uncle Krauss's room?"`
`"In addition to the one key Krauss-sama held, there's the master keys..."`
`"Oh, all that stuff about keys is a pointless argument.`
` ...Did you forget that Genji-san is already a victim?`
` His master key is missing.`
` That means all the locks in this mansion are meaningless."`
`"......How boring.`
` In other words, no closed room murders have existed or will exist in this mansion.`
` ...Sheesh.`
` This is getting to be a pretty boring mystery."`
`Erika laughed off this murder in disappointment, as though it was something she was watching on TV.`
`...I can't understand it.`
`...Why is 'her world' so different from ours?`
`It's almost like she's in a separate dimension from us...`
`"...W-Was Jessica also...`
`like this, ...in a bed?"`
`"............"`
`"...Yes, that's right.`
` ...Just like George, her neck......was cut..."`
`"...Jessica...`
` ...Let me be with Jessica...`
` I haven't even seen Jessica's face yet...!`
` ......Jessica, ...Jessicaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"W-Wait up, Natsuhi-san...!!"`
`"The culprit might still be hiding nearby!`
` It would be dangerous to let her be alone..."`
`Natsuhi flew out of the room and dashed towards the guesthouse this time.`
`...It was only natural.`
`Natsuhi still hadn't even seen Jessica's dying face.`
`Everyone probably thought that.`
`......Of course, even Natsuhi was half thinking that.`
`The other half...`
`...was her desire to shift everyone else's attention away from the study.`
`Strange crimes had occurred, the gold had been discovered, and some relatives had even recommended Battler to be the Successor.`
`Even in these twisted circumstances,`
` ......she had to protect Kinzo's secret.`
`......Aahh, ...if my head...is going to be wracked by this suffering anyway...`
`...Please, just let my head explode right now.`
`That way, I won't have to suffer any longer......`
`"So, everyone,`
` for Natsuhi-san's sake, let's return to the guesthouse for the time being.`
` ...Though it's not as though seeing their dead faces is going to lead to any new developments."`
`"......Do you even have a heart?"`
`"A heart?`
` What's that?"`
`Just seeing her daughter's dead face wouldn't bring Jessica back to life, nor would it heal Natsuhi's anguish.`
`On the contrary, she would probably wail, wasting a considerable amount of time before being able to think properly again.`
`...This probably sums up Erika's screwed up argument...`
`...............`
`Just seeing their dying faces won't lead to any new developments...?`
`"Like hell it won't!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` Beato's pieces have brought about a really interesting change. *giggle*giggle*!"`
`"Wh-What in the........."`
`Natsuhi flew into the cousin room on the second floor of the guesthouse...`
`...and was struck dumb by the bloodstained beds and the eerie magic circle, which looked like it might've been drawn with the victims' blood...`
`"...Where is Jessica...?`
` Where is she...?! Jessicaaa!!"`
`"In that...`
`...bed......"`
`"A bed?`
` Where?!"`
`"Huh?`
` ...George...?`
` ...Wh-Where is he...?!"`
`"Wait a sec, `
`...what the hell...`
`...is going on here...?"`
`"......We made sure to lock this room when we left, right?`
` We can now be certain the culprit has a master key.`
` Once again, my reasoning was correct."`
`"Who cares about that...?!`
` Where did they go...?`
` Wh-Where did everyone's corpses go...?!"`
`".........Heheh.`
` Nice trick."`
`"Hey, look, look, it's magic, right?`
` That Gaap who's with Beato hid the corpses somewhere with magic...!"`
`"...All of us moved together.`
` So you're trying to say that everyone had alibis?"`
`"Your reasoning goes like this, right?`
` The four of them weren't actually dead, they were just playing dead.`
` Then, when no one else was around, they hid somewhere.`
` Am I right?"`
`"You don't intend to proclaim any of their deaths in red now, do you?"`
`"Of course I won't.`
` Unlike that dolt Beato, I don't give red out for free!"`
`"In that case, I'll be glad to use the blue truth.`
` I can think of many ways to work around something of this level."`
`"*giggle*`
` Sure, go ahead!`
` Blue truth time!"`
`"Here's the first one I can think of.`
`#5decff The victims aren't actually dead.`
` They pretended to be dead, then secretly hid themselves somewhere.`
` After all, you haven't proclaimed anyone's deaths with the red truth.#ffffff"`
`"Ahhaha!`
` Even through you've been shown their gaping wounds, you're still trying that one on principle, as long as there's no red, right?!`
` But don't get your hopes up.`
` I'm not giving you a freebie red truth!`
` After all, I just have to deny it all at once at the end of the game, at 24:00 on October 5th!"`
`"Ah, the witch's side has such a big advantage!`
` It'd all be over now if that stupid Battler was my opponent, but you aren't like that, right, Bern?!"`
`"Of course.`
` Anyone could've thought of that silly move.`
` I have more.`
` Second one.`
` #5decffKrauss carried the corpses off and hid them.`
` You've acted it out so that it looks like you've kidnapped Krauss and locked him up somewhere, but he might actually be free.`
` Krauss has no alibi.`
` Krauss hid their corpses.#ffffff"`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` It's not like I proclaimed that Krauss was being confined with the red truth. *giggle*giggle*!`
` You know how they say you've gotta confuse your friends before you can confuse your enemies!`
` So he lied to Natsuhi, making it seem like he'd been captured?!`
` Heheheheheheh!!`
` Any others?!"`
`"Third one.`
` #5decffThe corpses were different people in the first place.`
` They were substitute corpses that closely resembled the victims.`
` George and the others were hiding from the beginning, and later cleared up those substitute corpses.`
` These corpses were dead from the very beginning, so they don't count towards the number of people on the island.#ffffff"`
`"Ahhahhahhahahahahahahahaha!!`
` That's messed up!!`
` So even though all those people gathered around and saw their dead faces, none of them realized they were substitute corpses?"`
`"Since you haven't used the red truth, there's a possibility that everyone misidentified all of the corpses.`
` Though if you feel like repeating 'no one would misidentify a person', I'll withdraw that claim immediately, okay...?"`
`"No way♪ I'm not falling for that!`
` The red truth's only useful if you use it with flash, right?`
` I'll take a single truth out of a large pile of blue and smash it with the red!`
` Then, the rest of the blue truths will be swallowed up by darkness before you can find out whether they were right or wrong!"`
`"That darkness is the world of witches!`
` You won't be given any truth at all!`
` Ehheheheheheheheheheheheheh!!"`
`......Heheh.`
`...This girl acts like she's stupid, but she's not bad at all.`
`She'll never rise to provocation.`
`Looks like she understands the darkness of magic even better than the true Game Master, Beato.`
`And apparently, Gaap also understood that well.`
`...That move of hiding the corpses.`
`It was pretty effective for both Lambda and Beato.`
`In any event, I've thought up a full three theories about the disappearing corpses.`
`Three blue wedges for a single riddle.`
`That doesn't mean she can just deny one of those three.`
`Unless she eliminates all three wedges, this riddle has been defeated.`
`That's the ironclad rule of witch hunting.`
`A single wedge isn't nearly enough.`
`Only vampires die from a single stake.`
`Compared to witches, vampires are weak.`
`...True witches won't die unless you stab them all over with stakes, right?`
`It's the same with assassins, isn't it?`
`It's only in Japanese manga that you see assassins kill their targets with a single perfect shot.`
`Real assassins will empty out an entire magazine's worth of bullets.`
`......That's how you do things, right?`
` Of course, it's the same for me.`
`But it's this girl we're talking about, so she might slice it all in two with a single swipe of the red.`
`By simply letting off a few quick lines confirming their deaths and Krauss's innocence with the red,`
` she can remove all three of my wedges.`
`Well, that's okay.`
`When the red truth does come out, I just need to follow along with it and stab her full of blue wedges again.`
`......*giggle*giggle*`
` This is how a game of witches plays out.`
`*giggle* Ah, it's so fun...!`
`Battler's sluggish battles always pissed me off, so I'm loving this...!!`
`Yeah, I understand, Lambda.`
`This first twilight is just the beginning of the beginning.`
`It's just a skirmish, right...?`
`*giggle* ......Wouldn't have it any other way...`
` ......I'll make you lose pathetically and cry out in regret as you crawl and scratch at the floor!`
`I've almost forgotten the pleasure of grabbing that cute hair of yours and wiping the floor with it as I roll around laughing...!!`
`The servant waiting room in the mansion had once again gone silent...`
`There lay Genji's corpse, which had been covered completely with a blanket...`
`In the ceiling of this cramped room, a pitch-black hole appeared, `
`...captivating legs sprouted out, `
`...and Gaap floated downwards.`
`"......Sorry, Genji.`
` You probably want to enjoy your eternal sleep right there, but that's not going to be possible.`
` Please disappear from this place so that you may serve Natsuhi, the final Head of the Ushiromiya family, even after death."`
`Gaap stripped off the blanket as she said this to Genji, who was sleeping peacefully...`
`Then she stared at the deep wound in his neck...`
`"......That's a nice cut.`
` ...It must've been made with a single slice.`
` ......Has anyone who's capable of this manifested yet...?`
` Not good.`
` ...I can't think of anyone decent who might be capable of this."`
`It goes without saying, but witches are capable of summoning beings with a strength proportional to their own ability.`
`The Great Lady Lambdadelta called that being here as a trump card 19th person.`
`......Even optimistically speaking, this is on par with Ronove and me...`
`A pitch-black hole opened on the bed, and Genji disappeared as though the bed had swallowed him up.`
`Just like the four in the guesthouse, Genji's corpse was also hidden in some unknown place...`
`It was a place that no one could find, located neither within this world nor the next...`
`No longer would anyone be able to find their corpses.`
`No longer would anyone be able to confirm their deaths.`
`She carried Genji's corpse to this place of endless silence, `
`where it would never be disturbed...`
`"When there's no corpse, a person goes missing.`
` ...When a person's missing, people both suspect that they might be the culprit and suspect that they might be victims, truly like the inside of a cat box.`
` ...The darkness inside of cat boxes that'll never be opened...is where we demons and witches reside...!`
` You were a bit too slow, Miss Great Detective. ......Heheheheh..."`
`Gaap licked her lips and gulped...`
`"...I wonder why Gaap-sama is going around hiding corpses."`
`"I don't know.`
` But Gaap-sama is pretty cool.`
` She's just so...awesome."`
`"Don't be stupid, what happened to standing guard?!`
` The Humans are returning from the guesthouse!!`
` Gaap-sama...!"`
`"Yes, let's disperse.`
` ......This should be enough to give Natsuhi a way out..."`
`Gaap jumped into a pitch-black hole that had opened near her feet.`
`Mammon said 'I'm going in too!' and jumped in, `
`followed by Asmo, who said 'Me too, me too!' and hopped in, giggling.`
`As Satan hesitated over what to do, the hole closed.`
`"A-And you call yourselves members of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory... H-How childish.`
` So stupid...!"`
`Satan went bright red and got angry all by herself, then turned into gold butterflies and disappeared...`
`"......It seems Gaap has succeeded in moving the five corpses."`
`"Well done.`
` ...However, the next part is tricky."`
`"They will probably be somewhat surprised at the disappearance of Genji's corpse,`
` but their interest will most likely swing back to Kinzo's study after that."`
`"...There are two keys to the study.`
` ...It's fortunate that Natsuhi is in possession of both.`
` If she had left one with Genji, it would probably have fallen into Lady Lambdadelta's hands by now."`
`"It seems that Lady Lambdadelta has no intention of hiding Kinzo's death.`
` ...Apparently, she plans to fight while ignoring the moat, towers, and ramparts that you have created."`
`"Heh, ...heheheh.`
` This has become a strange triangular confrontation.`
` We are all each other's enemies, but we will sometimes join forces without notice.`
` ...In a three-way fight, just when you think it's two against one, it suddenly becomes one against two.`
` ...That's what it's like.`
` That Chinese battle royale!`
` Don't you think it's like that 'Records of the Three Kingdoms' thing?"`
`"Oh, the Longzhong Plan.`
` That's quite a sophisticated analogy to hear coming from you, pu ku ku...!"`
`"There were three empires in Records of the Three Kingdoms, weren't there?`
` Wei, Wu, and Shu, right?`
` That sounds just like us.`
` ...So, which empire won out in the end?"`
`"...The power that gained control in the end was the Jin dynasty.`
` The three empires you mentioned were all destroyed."`
`"Hoh.`
` .........I didn't know that.`
` I thought one of the three empires won.`
` Didn't the Wei have an overwhelming advantage...?"`
`"They had the position of emperor stolen from them, and their empire was subjugated and destroyed."`
`...The Sima clan, a noble family that Cao Cao invited in as advisors,`
` eventually gained central control in a power struggle and took over the country.`
`"......So, they were invited in as advisors, `
`...and they seized control.`
`......*cackle* ...Very interesting.`
` ...That Lady Lambdadelta...!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"Pardon me.`
` ...The Humans have confirmed the disappearance of Genji's corpse in the servant waiting room.`
` ...They have started moving towards Lord Goldsmith's study."`
`"Riiche,`
` ...they're coming."`
`"Hmph, ...let them come.`
` The Humans...and the Witches of Certainty and Miracles..."`
`If this is a three way fight, then we've got Humans, witches, and...`
`...what should we be called...?`
`If the thing we're protecting for the time being...is Kinzo's phantom...`
`"...So, ......are we...phantoms then......?`
` ...Heheh, ...heheheheheheheh..."`
`"...Father, ...it's Natsuhi.`
` Good morning..."`
`"There's no way he'll wake up if you do it like that!`
` Father, it's Eva!`
` Please wake up!`
` It's an emergency!!"`
`Eva pushed Natsuhi aside and knocked repeatedly with all her strength.`
`"Q-Quiet down...!!`
` You're being too boisterous...!"`
`"Is now really the time to be saying something like that?!?!"`
`".........So he isn't picking up the phone, and he isn't responding to knocking either?`
` That's troublesome."`
`"...H-He might be in a bad mood again...`
` Kinzo-san sometimes considers even the slightest change to be an omen...`
`and gets into a bad mood for reasons only he can understand..."`
`"Hoh, ...hohoho...`
` Yes, that's true...`
` This isn't something that's started today..."`
`"Is that how badly Grandfather wants to shut himself away in the study?"`
`"...Yes.`
` ...It's not uncommon for him to stay in his study for more than a month at a time..."`
`"...Don't tell anyone, ...but even though I work here,`
` I sometimes forget that the Master even lives here..."`
`"Gohda,`
` that's not the sort of thing a servant should be saying!!"`
`"M-My apologies, Madam, ...I am truly sorry..."`
`"Anyway, ...isn't it bad that we can't get in contact with him?`
` In the worst case, Father might not even know there's been a crime! Right?!"`
`"...W-Well, I wonder......"`
`Keenly noticing that people were starting to doubt Kinzo's existence, Kanon mumbled those words...`
`".........Who was the last person to meet Father...?`
` ...And when?"`
`"I-It was me.`
` Last night, `
`...up until the time of the uproar from when Battler found the gold, I was in Father's study, giving the daily report."`
`"......So at around 23:00 last night."`
`"...No way around it.`
` Let's open it up."`
`"Wh-What did you say...?!`
` This is the Family Head's precious study and research room!`
` No one is permitted to trespass without permission, okay?!"`
`"Who here holds the highest rank?`
` Me, right?!`
` I am the third in rank of the Ushiromiya family!`
` If we open it and get scolded by Father, that's also the responsibility of the highest ranked.`
` Because of the urgent circumstances, we'll open this door.`
` You have a key, right? Open it."`
`"...I-I believe you know this, but the study door cannot be opened with the master key."`
`"Umm, ...the Master has recently taken away Genji-sama's key as well,`
` so he has both keys on his person.`
` ...Therefore, umm..."`
`"......So, both of the keys that can open this door are inside the study."`
`"A closed room.`
` ......<Good>.`
` It's finally starting to get a little interesting.`
` ...It'd be pretty neat if Kinzo-san was `
`lying on the bed in there with his throat cut."`
`"You're being far too indiscreet, Erika-san!!`
` ...A-Anyway, as you know, this door can only be opened by the keys that Father has."`
`"...That means anyone, even a murderer, would find it impossible to even touch Father from outside the room!`
` So Father must be okay...!!"`
`"Still, that doesn't mean we shouldn't worry about confirming his safety.`
` Are you really so unconcerned for the safety of the Father you respect so much...?"`
`"......Th-That isn't..."`
`The atmosphere, which had been so agitated a second ago, suddenly went cold, ...and an eerie feeling filled the room as everyone stared at Natsuhi.`
`...They could understand why Natsuhi would protect the study under normal circumstances.`
`People knew that she probably didn't want to disturb the research of Kinzo, a man she certainly respected,`
` and she was therefore trying to keep the unpleasant relatives away.`
`However, ...this was an extraordinary situation.`
`A murder had occurred.`
`Natsuhi's persistence in keeping things quiet for Kinzo even in a situation like this...`
`was hard to understand using common sense.`
`"......There's a good chance that the crime occurring on this island will turn out to be plotline murders mimicking the epitaph.`
` ...It's probably a good idea to assume that the crimes will continue."`
`"If we view these as plotline murders, then it will keep going until a total of 13 lives are taken.`
` ......Do you have any concept of how many victims that would be?"`
`"...Wait a sec.`
` How many people do you think there are on this island?`
` ...Wouldn't that be almost everyone...?"`
`"Non non. You've got it all wrong.`
` ......As far as I know, the mystery novel with the most dead people in a serial murder...`
`was 'And Then There Were None' by Agatha Christie, which had 10 deaths.`
` In the realm of Japanese mysteries, it's probably 'The Tokyo Zodiac Murders' by Shimada Souji.`
` Though there were less than 10 deaths in that one."`
`"...Did you know?`
` If 13 people die, as it seems they will, it'll lead to the most infamous and famous development in the history of the mystery genre,`
` the completion of a 13-person serial murder case, right?`
` And if everyone on this island is killed...`
`...that'd make it a historical achievement in the world of serial murder mysteries,`
` with even more deaths than the longest murder mystery in the world and the longest one in Japan put together, don't you see?!`
` ...Hey, didn't you know? Everyone?"`
`"The culprit in this crime...`
`...is giving us an incredible challenge, one that might even surpass all the mysteries throughout the world and throughout history.`
` ...Of course, everyone realized that long ago, right...?`
` If you like mystery, Christie's a must-read.`
` If you're Japanese, then it's only natural that you've read Shimada Souji's works all the way through.`
` ...Are you sure you've been reading enough, everyone?`
` *giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*......"`
`".........It's useless."`
`"Huh......?"`
`"Looks like you haven't read enough yourself."`
`"Did I say something wrong...?"`
`Erika, who had been chatting away happily all by herself up until a second ago,`
` changed her expression into a displeased glare in an instant...`
`"What you were saying about the Japanese mystery genre.`
` ......Sakaguchi Ango's 'Non-serial Murders' beats 'The Zodiac Murders'."`
`".........!`
`............Th-`
`The number of people was the same in both, right?"`
`"They tie for the record, but 'Non-serial Murders' was first published in 1947.`
` 'The Zodiac Murders' was 1981.`
` ...If you know so much about it, shouldn't you have mentioned 'Non-serial Murders' first?"`
`"......Nng, `
`............nnngg."`
`Erika glared at Battler with an expression that couldn't be fully described with the word 'shock',`
` and her arms shook as she stood there, lost for words...`
`"Ahahahahahahaha, kyaahhahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` That's so totally laaame!!"`
`"Well, that's understandable.`
` The crimes in 'Zodiac' took place in 1936, right?`
` That must've gotten her confused, right?`
` Aaahhihihihihihihihhyahahahaahh!!"`
`Lambdadelta kept on hitting the table, overcome with laughter.`
`Even Bernkastel, who had been struck with humiliation, `
`snorted and started pounding the table and laughing in the same way.`
`"Pfft, `
`......hihihihihhahahahahahaah!!`
` This is just too good!!`
` Giihihihihihihihihihihiii!!`
` ......Not bad, piece Battler.`
` Gahihihihihyahahhaahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"......I'm impressed.`
` ...You must read a lot, ...don't you, Battler-san?"`
`"Books?`
` I hardly read those at all."`
`"......You liar.`
` ...You know...`
`quite a lot, don't you?"`
`"I'd never say something as arrogant as 'I'm a book-reader'.`
` ...'I'm a book-reader' isn't something a person who doesn't even read a hundred per year should say so lightly, `
`don't you think...?"`
`"...Y-You mere...piece......"`
`"Ah, ...*cough*.`
` ...A-Anyway, we can't let such a massive crime take place...!!"`
`"That's right.`
` At any rate, checking Dad's safety is our first priority right now.`
` But what should we do?`
` He's ignoring the phone and our knocks. The keys are inside.`
` There's nothing we can do.`
` Are we supposed to knock this thick door down?`
` ...That won't be easy."`
`"Father might've been attacked by someone and severely injured, and maybe he's waiting for someone to help him.`
` ...This is an extraordinary circumstance.`
` Even Father will understand.`
` And if he has any rebukes, I'll be happy to take responsibility myself."`
`"......B-But...`
`breaking down a door would be...`
`qu-quite rude..."`
`"What about the window......?"`
`"...Th-That's right.`
` The window.`
` ...Is there a ladder somewhere that can reach as high as the third floor?`
` We should be able to get inside by smashing the window...!"`
`Erika finally came back to her senses, and her tone regained its decisive edge.`
`"The third story window... Th-That would be dangerous..."`
`"We won't know unless we try.`
` Is there a ladder around here that can reach up three floors?"`
`"I don't think the ladder in the gardening shed is long enough..."`
`"...Oh, then what about the ladder in the boiler room?`
` I remember using it earlier when a bird made a nest on top of the rain gutter...!`
` Yes, that would be able to reach without a doubt."`
`He must've been extremely happy about thinking of something Kanon hadn't.`
`Looking pleased with himself as though he had won something, he glanced around at everyone.`
`He was probably hoping that Natsuhi would praise him, but she quickly avoided his gaze...`
`Of course, Kanon had known about that ladder too.`
`...However, in order to protect Kinzo's secret, he had intentionally pretended to have forgotten...`
`"But with this weather and the strong winds,`
` isn't this just too dangerous...?"`
`"I agree.`
` If someone gets seriously injured, we can't go to a hospital until tomorrow, right...?!"`
`"...The wind might not be as strong in the courtyard.`
` I think it's at least worth it to take a look."`
`"But truly, going up to the third floor will be quite a challenge...!`
` Back when we had to clean up the bird's nest, most of the servants shrank away from the danger, `
`and that's when I, your humble servant, took on a major role in spectacularly handling the situation.`
` Hehahahahahahahaha...!"`
`"Right, then there's no problem!`
` Let's just get a ladder that'll reach-"`
`"And it looks like someone here already has experience with this sort of thing."`
`"......Hahahahahaha, `
`......huh?"`
`The courtyard was surrounded on all four sides, so while the rain was still fierce, the winds had almost no effect.`
`Fortunately, the ceiling jutted out a bit, so even the rain wasn't so bad.`
`"Okay.`
` Let's try standing the ladder up.`
` ...Be careful.`
` Don't hurt yourself."`
`"Sure..."`
`Rudolf and Battler carried the special ladder, which was designed for work on high places.`
`Two umbrellas followed the pair.`
`Shannon and Kanon were holding umbrellas and sheltering them from the rain.`
`"It doesn't matter if we get wet.`
` Go back under the eaves.`
` ...Gohda-san!`
` Even if there's something wrong with your knees, you can at least hold a ladder down, right?!"`
`"Y-Yes yes yes yes...!`
` If only I had enough Hyaluronan, going up a ladder would be no problem at all... I am truly sorry..."`
`Gohda clambered forward to replace Shannon and Kanon.`
`As she watched this, Kyrie giggled.`
`"Dad, hammer."`
`"Cool.`
` ...Battler, you love athletics, don't you?"`
`"Not as much as I love my cool handyman Dad♪"`
`"You little brat.`
` ......Sheesh, I guess I've gotta show this son of mine my good side every once in a while.`
` Battler, Gohda-san.`
` Hold that ladder down tight.`
` And make sure you're looking up, okay?`
` My hand might slip and you'll have this hammer tumbling down on you."`
`"Don't worry.`
` I'll catch it and smash your head in."`
`After putting the hammer they'd gotten to smash the window in his pocket and cracking his knuckles,`
` Rudolf started climbing...`
`"Will Rudolf-sama...be okay...?"`
`"He'll be fine.`
` That guy could totally be in an action movie.`
` Plus, sports are one of his strong points."`
`"...I wish you'd tell me how my skating prowess is supposed to help me climb ladders...`
`...♪I am Ina Bauer, always in a big pinch...or whatever."`
`"He'll manage to avoid dying, so there's nothing to worry about.`
` ...More importantly, we're really lucky the shutters aren't down.`
` Isn't it a common practice to lower the shutters to Father's study for the night?"`
`"Y-Yes.`
` When we're permitted to enter and exit, we open and close them in the morning and at night."`
`"...However, I think it was decided that such a thing was unnecessary for the time being, so it was left open."`
`"I see.`
` .........Father will be pretty mad, won't he?`
` ...If his son smashes his window and comes in while he's sleeping."`
`"...That's...probably..."`
`"It'd be wonderful if we didn't have to smash the window, don't you think?"`
`"............"`
`Both Shannon and Kanon...knew that Kinzo no longer existed in this world.`
`Natsuhi had ordered them to interfere as much as possible,`
` ...but now that it had come to this, there was nothing the two of them could do.`
`...They had tried to interfere by pretending they didn't know about a ladder that could reach up to the third floor window, but...`
`Because of Gohda's showing off, that ladder had been found...`
`Rudolf carefully climbed the ladder.`
`...He would reach the third floor window very soon.`
`As he did this, `
`...Shannon and Kanon stared at him, looking uneasy...`
`After this, ...what will happen next?`
`To the two of them.`
`To Madam.`
`...To the Master.`
`...Very soon, Rudolf will reach the window.`
`"...So, it's already the end for this room's barrier."`
`"Hahah.`
` The soldiers are scaling the ramparts, trying to reach the other side.`
` The moment of surrender is truly right before our eyes.`
` ......I am prepared to be erased at any moment."`
`"We can't let that happen.`
` You have to remain alive, even if it means crawling through the dirt.`
` ......I'll think about what to do next.`
` For now, escape from this place."`
`"You may say that, but what can I do?`
` ...Eva and the rest are still camped out in the hallway, and Rudolf is approaching the window.`
` There's no way of retreat through the door or the window."`
`"In that case, perhaps you could hide under the bed."`
`"...Hmph.`
` So I am not even permitted the chance to wait for the enemies' arrival in my throne?"`
`"You might've done that while you were still alive,`
` but now you're a ghost that Natsuhi and I brought to life.`
` Ghosts should do what ghosts do best and hide under the bed or in a closet."`
`"Will something like that really deceive their eyes...?`
` My, my."`
`"......Don't worry.`
` I'll be with you.`
` I'll let you escape at the last moment."`
`"It'll be dangerous for you.`
` Even though you're a demon, you won't get away unscathed if you're burned by the magic-resisting toxin."`
`"Don't worry about that.`
` ......Anyway, I need things to get at least that bad before my heart starts pumping."`
`"How comforting.`
` ...I understand.`
` I'll hide under the bed."`
`"......Milady,`
` Rudolf will reach the window very soon."`
`"Gaap,`
` I've changed my mind. I'll guard this place.`
` Hide yourself along with Ronove."`
`"What did you say...?`
` You've got it backwards.`
` Didn't we plan to leave this place to Gaap and have you retreat, Milady?"`
`Though Ronove should've been used to her fickleness, this surprised him for the first time in a long while.`
`...Beato may have been a powerful queen, but she was also an important piece that mustn't be exposed to danger.`
`Though she was strong, running to the front lines without any plan would not be a praiseworthy move.`
`"What kind of whim is this...?`
` ............"`
`"It's just a whim.`
` I'm not so fond of boredom that I could simply sip tea while leaving everything to you...!`
` I've just gotten the urge to jump into the struggle right away...!"`
`"............`
`...I understand.`
` It is your game, after all.`
` You can do as you wish.`
` I'll carefully watch over the corpses of the first twilight that I erased, making sure nothing happens to them."`
`"Sorry for stealing your time to shine."`
`"......Is this really acceptable, Milady?"`
`"You should know I like showing off even more than my three meals a day.`
` I've done nothing but gobble up Gaap's turn.`
` Don't worry about it...!"`
`...Ronove and Gaap both fell silent.`
`The two of them had already noticed.`
`Lady Bernkastel, who used Furudo Erika as a piece, was a terrifying opponent.`
`...This fight would probably be terrifying as well.`
`Beato couldn't expose Gaap, her friend, to this danger...`
`Beato bluffed and said that wasn't the case,`
` but Ronove and Gaap had already figured it out.`
`Therefore, after confirming Beato's resolve one last time and seeing that she was completely firm in her decision,`
` ...they nodded in silence and accepted it.`
`"I understand.`
` ...I'll leave this place to you. I'm rooting for you.`
` ......Take care."`
`"Yeah.`
` Please watch over my efforts to your heart's content...!"`
`"...Lady Bernkastel will probably start trying to expose Kinzo's absence with a closed room argument.`
` ...Fights in a closed room are normally Gaap's area of expertise.`
` ...Queens are commanders because they're best at fighting in wide open areas.`
` ...This won't be an easy fight."`
`"I'm fully aware of that.`
` I currently serve Natsuhi.`
` Watching Natsuhi's danger from above and letting Gaap take care of it doesn't make sense to me."`
`"......Understood.`
` ...I wish you luck in battle."`
`"Be careful...`
` ...If it becomes a complete closed room, we won't be able to come in and help you."`
`"I'll laugh at them a bit, and if things get bad, I'll just grab Kinzo and run for it.`
` It's easy.`
` With the door and the window, the past and the future to choose from, there are plenty of places to run to.`
` Of course I won't let this become a closed room."`
`"...Though you won't see us, we'll be cheering you on from very close by.`
` ...Good luck."`
`"Sure."`
`Gaap and Ronove became a swarm of gold butterflies and disappeared,`
` and Kinzo melted into the darkness beneath the bed.`
`Then, Beato also became a swarm of gold butterflies and melted away inside the study...`
`After that, all figures and signs of life had disappeared from the study, and it once more regained a silence as though no one had been there from the beginning...`
`Then, ...Rudolf's outline slipped into view from beyond the window's curtain.`
`"Dad...!!`
` If you're there, answer!`
` Daaad!"`
`As he yelled, he hit the window.`
`His foothold was so uncertain that just hitting the window felt life-threatening.`
`But of course, this was Rudolf, the show-off.`
`Deciding that he couldn't do anything stupid with so many people watching from below, he suppressed the fear from being so high up...`
`and boldly knocked on the window.`
`"......Come on, Grandfather... Can't he hear...?"`
`"I-I wonder...`
` I hope he doesn't drop the hammer..."`
`"How many seconds have passed?"`
`"...It's been 30 seconds since he knocked on the window."`
`"So, `
`...he'll really...`
`...sm-`
`smash it?`
` Umm, the Master...will be very mad..."`
`"Well, someone was kind enough to brag about how accepting that anger is her duty, so there's no need to worry.`
` ...Rudolf-san!`
` That's enough. Do it...!"`
`"Sure...!`
` ......Dammit Dad, you better not complain after I smash it."`
`He hit it several times, and eventually, a fist-sized hole opened up in the glass.`
`Because of his unstable footing, this took a lot of effort...`
`Using the end of the hammer skillfully, he brushed aside the now fractured bits of glass and opened the hole further,`
` stuck his hand through it, and unlocked the window.`
`Then, after a hard struggle, Rudolf somehow managed to open the window, and his body slipped through into the study.`
`After that, he flopped onto the floor, using his entire body to enjoy the relief of having a ground under him.`
`"......Dad! It's Rudolf.`
` Answer me!"`
`It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that Kinzo's study was a small villa he had created inside the mansion.`
`A study.`
` A library.`
` A place to sleep.`
` And a bathroom and washroom.`
`It was divided into multiple rooms.`
`...That's right, with all this at your fingertips, it wouldn't be hard to spend your days in this study without leaving at all.`
`The bed was empty.`
`There were marks on it that made it seem as though someone had slipped out, but there was no one in sight.`
`"...This happens a lot in ninja movies.`
` Someone finds that the bed is still warm, so the occupant couldn't have gone far."`
`Rudolf tried placing his hand on the bed, but he couldn't feel any heat at all.`
`Not only was there no heat, ...it felt completely ice cold.`
`And the bed wasn't the only thing that was ice cold.`
`...The air inside the room...and even the presence about it, if that's the right word for it, `
`...even that felt ice cold.`
`To Rudolf, it felt as though Kinzo had slipped out of this room a long time ago...`
`"...However, it's been well cleaned.`
` It has signs of having been lived in.`
` ............"`
`Wrinkles in the bed.`
`The slight angle of the chair.`
`Here and there, there were many marks that would doubtlessly have been cleaned or fixed up if someone had come in to make the beds.`
`"As far as I can tell off the top of my head, Dad must've slipped out of bed several hours ago at the latest..."`
`That would be the same general time period as the brutal murder case.`
`...Guess we can't be sure Kinzo's absence and the crime are completely unrelated.`
`For the time being, he leaned out the window...`
`and told Kyrie and the others in the courtyard to come back up, since he was going to unlock the door.`
`Then, he pushed the button on the study desk and released the door's auto-lock.`
`There was a heavy clunking sound, and Natsuhi and the rest dashed in immediately...`
`"...F-Father... Good morning..."`
`"Sorry, but it isn't Dad.`
` ...I'm the one who opened it."`
`"......Was Kinzo-san there?"`
`"Nope.`
` ...It looks like someone slipped out of the bed, but you can't tell when that happened."`
`"And Natsuhi nee-san was the last person to meet him, right...?`
` At around 11:00 last night.`
` I wonder if that means he slipped out of the study sometime after that and went somewhere else..."`
`"...Th-That's...`
` W-Well, we must consider Father's fickle nature...`
` It wasn't at all uncommon for him to suddenly wake in the middle of the night, claiming to have had a revelation in a dream,`
` and walk around the mansion.`
` Isn't that right, Doctor Nanjo...?"`
`"Nn... T-True, this has happened before...`
` ...Anyway, ...umm, he is a fickle person.`
` R-Right, Kumasawa-san...?"`
`"...Hoh, ...hohoho.`
` That's true...`
` Perhaps he had a strange dream and slipped out of bed...`
` That isn't uncommon at all, yes..."`
`"Then where did he slip off to...?!`
` Does this mean...there's a good chance Father's been caught up in this crime?!"`
`"......See?`
` We should have checked to make sure Father was safe from the beginning, right?"`
`"...Nn........."`
`"We can't be sure he isn't in this room.`
` Maybe the culprit tied him up and locked him in the closet or something like that."`
`"......Good point.`
` Let's search."`
`"...Th-This is the Head's precious study...`
` You mustn't touch things without reason...!"`
`"Ah yeah, that's right, `
`there's something I need to tell you, culprit-san."`
`When Natsuhi heard this said right in front of her, her heart froze.`
`...But Erika had only just happened to be standing right in front of Natsuhi when she said it.`
` She had directed her words to the room at large.`
`...She hadn't been speaking to Natsuhi in particular......`
`Natsuhi turned her back on Erika, trying to prevent her faltering expression from being noticed...`
`"...I have a photographic memory.`
` If you try to alter the crime scene by hiding some evidence, I'll know right away.`
` ...Please don't slip up here and disappoint me.`
` Any mystery where the 'who dunnit' is solved by a culprit's slip-up or misspeak is only third-rate, don't you think?"`
`"......I-I don't understand what you're saying, but try to refrain from incautious remarks.`
` ...Father, are you there...?!`
` Please answer me...!"`
`Natsuhi started walking around and calling out in a loud voice, refusing to let Erika say any more.`
`There was a knock.`
`Kyrie and the others who had gone down to the courtyard had returned.`
`"So Father isn't here after all?"`
`"He might be tied up and shut away somewhere around here.`
` We were just searching for him."`
`"......I'm surprised he managed to shut himself away in a place like this for all that time."`
`"..............."`
`"...Give it up, Nee-san.`
` ...We can't change anything now."`
`"I wonder...what Madam plans to do..."`
`"...Get paid back for all the lies she's told up until now."`
`"......Shh.`
` ...Let's leave fate in God's hands."`
`"Y-Yes..."`
`"........."`
`Many people clambered around Kinzo's vast study, looking here and there.`
`Inside the closet and in the bathtub.`
`Even in the refrigerator and under the study desk.`
`...They looked everywhere, almost as though they were 'it' in a game of hide-and-seek.`
`...However, not only were they unable to spot Kinzo, `
`they couldn't even find a single suspicious mark...`
`"I-It seems clear that Father isn't here.`
` ...That's enough.`
` Please don't disturb Father's precious study any further."`
`"That's right, that's right...`
` There's nothing the Master hates more than having things moved around without his permission..."`
`"Father's nowhere to be found.`
` ......Maybe he really was caught up in the crime...?"`
`"......Th-Though we can't be sure of that..."`
`Natsuhi averted her gaze once more.`
`"...It's okay, Natsuhi."`
`"...We truly do have our backs against the wall...`
` On the off-chance that someone entered the study, I had planned to trick them by saying he'd probably gone for a walk somewhere.`
` ...However..."`
`"Hmph.`
` No one would believe that I'd get dressed up for a casual midnight stroll in a mansion where a murder has occurred and many people have been killed.`
` Though I wouldn't put it past myself to do such a thing."`
`"Come now, Kinzo.`
` Be a good boy and hide under the bed.`
` ...It's okay, Natsuhi.`
` You may remain calm.`
` ......It's possible to prove that someone exists, but you can't prove that someone doesn't exist."`
`"In other words, the Human world is one in which, regardless of whether something exists or not, you can make it so that they 'exist'.`
` ...And the shadows that can make such things 'exist' are themselves the world of us witches, the world of demons."`
`"...You mean...a Devil's Proof."`
`"Yes.`
` ......So don't worry.`
` The power of demons will most certainly protect you."`
`"......If it could protect the honor of Father and my husband, ...I wouldn't mind sacrificing this body of mine to demons."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"Your resolve is good.`
` ...Don't be anxious.`
` I most certainly will not ~ib~let Kinzo be killed~ib~."`
`At that time, a dry sound suddenly rang out twice.`
`Erika had clapped her hands, seeking everyone's attention.`
`Though such an action should have been above a guest's place,`
` for some reason, it already felt like a natural right of hers.`
`...After all, she was the 'detective'.`
`"......I think that's enough.`
` Ushiromiya Kinzo-san is nowhere to be found in this study."`
`"Yeah, we've searched everywhere he could've been hiding.`
` Dad's nowhere to be seen."`
`"Furthermore, we've found nothing that looks suspicious."`
`"Yes, we didn't find anything at all."`
`Erika said it again.`
`They hadn't been able to discover anything...`
`"In that case, we mustn't loiter around this room.`
` Do you understand how angry Father would be if he learned that so many people were looking through his study...?!`
` Eva-san, `
`you said you were prepared to take responsibility, didn't you?`
` Are you prepared for him to break off relations with you for the rest of your life...?!"`
`"Th-That's for Father to decide...!!`
` Not you!!"`
`"Silence, please.`
` ......I'd like to lay out the situation.`
` At 23:00 last night, the last person to meet Kinzo-san in this room was Natsuhi-san, right?`
` Can anyone confirm that?"`
`"...Confirm...?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` After all, the only one who claims that Natsuhi-san really did stop by here at 23:00 last night is Natsuhi-san herself.`
` There wouldn't be a problem if Kinzo-san confirmed that Natsuhi-san really did come here last night,`
` but that vital witness isn't here."`
`"......So you're saying alibis are the foundation of a mystery?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` Alibis are important.`
` Of course, they're almost useless when it comes to the actual theory-making,`
` but it's common courtesy to poke around those boxes."`
`"Heh.`
` ...Even though you didn't ask for alibis regarding last night's murder, you ~ib~are~ib~ doing it for Grandfather's disappearance.`
` ...You really are a fickle person."`
`"Oh, don't worry.`
` Have no fear that I will fully examine everyone's alibis `
`regarding the murders of the first twilight later."`
`"......So, can anyone confirm that Natsuhi-san visited here at 23:00?`
` If no one can, we'll be forced to doubt whether Natsuhi-san really was the last person to spot him."`
`"...A-Are you saying that I can't be trusted?"`
`"No, no, it's actually the opposite.`
` I hope that you aren't the culprit.`
` After all, that'd make this reeeally boring.`
` Only the worst third-rate mysteries have the most suspicious person as the culprit."`
`"...Natsuhi-san...is suspicious?`
` W-Wait a second.`
` How can you say that...?!"`
`"He's right...!`
` Calling Madam suspicious is the height of discourtesy...!!"`
`"Be quiet!!`
` Doctor Nanjo, Gohda, `
`thank you.`
` ...Erika-san,`
` ...do you have some sort of proof to justify such a rude outburst...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` Though it's so simple that it annoys me.`
` Sorry to bother you with this TV drama-quality evidence, but if you don't mind..."`
`"......Why don't you just let us hear it?"`
`When Battler glared at her, ...a cold expression rose to Erika's face for an instant.`
`But it was only for an instant.`
`After smiling peacefully and gazing around at everyone, she started to talk.`
`She looked like the main character in a play,`
` who had come out onto the stage, bathed in a spotlight...`
`"It's about this morning.`
` Please remember the time after the murders occurred, during the big uproar that followed.`
` ...We wanted to tell Kinzo-san about the crime, but he wouldn't come out, no matter how many times we called him on the telephone.`
` Remember that time."`
`"Anyway, ...isn't it bad that we can't get in contact with him?`
` In the worst case, Father might not even know there's been a crime! Right?!"`
`"...W-Well, I wonder......"`
`Keenly noticing that people were starting to doubt Kinzo's existence, Kanon mumbled those words...`
`".........Who was the last person to meet Father...?`
` ...And when?"`
`"I-It was me.`
` Last night, ...up until the time of the uproar from when Battler found the gold, I was in Father's study, giving the daily report."`
`"......So at around 23:00 last night.`
` ............Heheh."`
`Erika chuckled significantly.`
`"A-And what's your point?`
` Ridiculous."`
`"I think Kyrie-san probably did that intentionally.`
` ...Am I right?"`
`"............"`
`"Wh-`
`What do you mean...`
`by that...?"`
`"...I hoped someone might fall for it."`
`"I see.`
` Thanks, Kyrie-san.`
` Actually, I was planning to say the same thing if you didn't."`
`"...I-Is who saw the Master last `
`really that important...?"`
`"Yes.`
` If we take the circumstances into account, then in response to the question 'Who met him last?',`
` it was very odd for Natsuhi-san to instantly answer 'me'."`
`"...Wh-Why?!`
` Madam told the truth without hiding anything...!"`
`"Be quiet!!`
` Why do you think it was odd...?"`
`"Why are you so sure that no one else met Kinzo-san after 23:00?"`
`"...W-Well, ...that's because I watched as he went to bed.`
` It's only natural to assume that he would then sleep until morning `
`and not meet with anyone..."`
`"Considering the circumstances, it was easy to suspect the last person to spot him of having some kind of involvement with this case.`
` ...A normal person in Natsuhi-san's position wouldn't say 'I was the last person to meet him.`
` I met him at 23:00'.`
` Right, Kyrie-san...?"`
`".........`
`...Yes, that's correct.`
` ...A normal person would say `
`'I met him at 23:00.`
` However, I'm not sure I was the last person to meet him'.`
` ...Something like that."`
`"<Good>.`
` ......Claiming to be the last witness is usually quite difficult.`
` ...That is, unless you know something that makes you sure there were no other witnesses after you."`
`"...In third-rate mysteries, the last one to spot the victim is often the culprit.`
` They killed the victim themselves, so they knew that no one else could've met the culprit later on...is how the argument goes."`
`"Hohoh, ...hohohoho...`
` Couldn't that be nothing more than a minor misspeak...?`
` It's not important enough to be picked up out of the blue and focused on..."`
`"Yes, yes, that's nothing more than nitpicking...`
` Isn't it a little too early to suspect Natsuhi-san because of a little slip of the tongue like that...?"`
`"Furthermore, you said she'd need a reason to be sure no one else spotted the Master, `
`but of course, she had such a reason...!`
` She left the room after seeing the Master go to bed!`
` Following common sense, it's perfectly natural to assume that he probably wouldn't meet anyone else until the next morning...!"`
`"...No.`
` That isn't natural at all.`
` After all, Natsuhi-san, Doctor Nanjo, and Kumasawa-san all made this claim a short while ago.`
` Please, try to remember."`
`"And Natsuhi nee-san was the last person to meet him, right...?`
` At around 11:00 last night.`
` I wonder if that means he slipped out of the study sometime after that and went somewhere else..."`
`"...Th-That's...`
` W-Well, we must consider Father's fickle nature...`
` It wasn't at all uncommon for him to suddenly wake in the middle of the night, claiming to have had a revelation in a dream, and walk around the mansion.`
` Isn't that right, Doctor Nanjo...?"`
`"Nn... T-True, this has happened before...`
` ...Anyway, ...umm, he is a fickle person.`
` R-Right, Kumasawa-san...?"`
`"...Hoh, ...hohoho.`
` That's true...`
` Perhaps he had a strange dream and slipped out of bed...`
` That isn't uncommon at all, yes..."`
`"......Yeah.`
` ...We definitely do have testimony...`
`that it wasn't at all uncommon for Grandfather to suddenly slip out of bed late at night..."`
`"<Good>.`
` Your memory's not bad, Battler-san.`
` ......In other words, it's common knowledge to those in the Ushiromiya Head House, Natsuhi-san included,`
` that Kinzo-san might wake up in the middle of any given night on a whim and wander around.`
` On top of that, they are aware that this happens quite often."`
`"...Isn't that odd?`
` ...If you knew Father often wanders around at night,`
` there's no way you could be certain that he'd stay in his bed until morning.`
` Right?"`
`"It really is...like a third-rate mystery.`
` You know, that thing they do in the last 5 minutes, `
`where the culprit asks 'When did you first realize it was me?' and the detective answers..."`
`"Seriously...`
` That's why I feel let down.`
` If it turns out Natsuhi-san really is the culprit, this'll be worse than a TV mystery.`
` ...That's why I want to clear away the suspicion surrounding Natsuhi-san as soon as I can.`
` I want to make sure this mystery isn't third-rate before I do anything else."`
`"......Uu, ...nngg..."`
`"...There's no need to get anxious, Natsuhi.`
` This is a classic word game used by detective wannabes.`
` ...What exactly is her point?`
` How could she possibly corner you with this accusation alone?`
` In the court of hell, all of the demon jurors will declare you innocent.`
` So calm down and don't get flustered..."`
`"......It may be true that Aunt Natsuhi looks suspicious when you say it like that.`
` ...Still, it sounds like you're just nitpicking to me."`
`"But it is suspicious.`
` ...Isn't this more than enough reason to suspect that Natsuhi nee-san's hiding something...?"`
`"O-Of all the unfair accusations...!`
` And how cowardly of you, Eva-san...!!`
` You're the sole person who can confirm that I really was here at 23:00, aren't you...?!"`
`"......Is this true, Eva-san?"`
`".........`
`......Oh, did that happen?`
` ...Heheheh, I'm sorry.`
` At the time, I was losing my head because of the recently-discovered gold,`
` so I forgot all about bumping into Natsuhi nee-san until just a second ago."`
`"So, Eva-san, you can confirm that Natsuhi-san was a witness at 23:00?"`
`"Yes, unfortunately.`
` I'm able to acknowledge that one part of Natsuhi nee-san's story.`
` ...But only that she came out of this room."`
`"......Wh-What are you implying?"`
`"Oh, I'll tell you.`
` ...In fact, I've wanted to say this for a long time now.`
` ...I do realize it's improper to bring this up in the middle of such a tragic murder case,`
` but the timing now is just too perfect.`
` ......You know what I'm talking about, don't you?`
` ...Natsuhi nee-san......?"`
`The servants gulped and held their breaths...`
`It seemed that they hadn't been able to hide it...after all......`
`In the middle of this heavy silence, ...Eva fingered her trump card, and Natsuhi tried to act calm.`
`Both space and time grew heavy as lead...and swallowed up everything...`
`"Just when did Kinzo-san disappear, I wonder...?"`
`Erika's words, spoken almost casually,`
` tore that atmosphere to pieces like shattering glass...`
`"...Simply put, we haven't met him once at the family conferences this year or last."`
`"That's right...`
` We've suspected it since last year.`
` ...Seein' as how my son and the others have just been killed, this may not be the time or place to press you on this.`
` ...But there's a chance that this has somethin' to do with the crime, so pressin' you is just what we'll do..."`
`"It's possible that you have a motive for hiding Father's death.`
` ...We have reason to suspect that you're embezzling his assets."`
`"If Father were to die, an investigation would be conducted for the distribution of the assets and your embezzlement would be exposed.`
` That's why you hid the fact that Father's already dead!!"`
`"......I see.`
` That's more than enough for the 'why dunnit'.`
` This keeps getting more and more third-rate.`
` Aaah, ...boring."`
`"...I-I don't know what you're talking about...!!`
` You say I'm hiding the Head's death?!`
` I most certainly won't forgive...such a reckless accusation!!"`
`"That's right...!!`
` In addition to Madam, the other servants take care of the Master on a daily basis, and they see him all the time...!!`
` Genji-san, Shannon-san, and Kanon-kun...!`
` Even Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa-san meet with him often...!"`
`"...P-Perhaps because he doesn't trust me, I haven't seen him even once since last year, but..."`
`"Be quiet, Gohda!!!"`
`"Eek!!`
` M-My apologies...!"`
`"Aren't all of the witnesses, besides Natsuhi-san, servants employed by her?`
` ...So you used money to make them follow your story...ah man, this is really third-rate. Pitiful, pitiful.`
` ......I'm disappointed, Natsuhi-san.`
` So I guess I'll have to finish this now."`
`"...F-Finish what...?!"`
`"Ushiromiya...Kinzo-san."`
`"......What is it, ...uninvited guest?"`
`"You don't exist, do you?`
` ...You're a ghost whose death was concealed by those humans who didn't want it known because of the inheritance problem."`
`"...Hmph.`
` ...Heheheheheheheh."`
`"Ghosts are supposed to quickly pass on to the next world.`
` ...Even though this is the first time we've met, I've yet to give you a proper greeting. My apologies."`
`"...Good day, pleased to meet you.`
` And goodbye!!!"`
`So close to Erika's face that you could barely have wedged a sheet of paper between them,`
` ...Beato's pipe came to a sudden stop.`
`"And a good day to you too.`
` ...I'm the Ushiromiya family alchemist, Beatrice the Golden.`
` I'll be your opponent in this fight from here on out."`
`"Glad to meet you. I'm the detective of this game, Furudo Erika.`
` It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.`
` And now, goodbye."`
`"So, you're Lady Bernkastel's next piece after Ange.`
` ...I'm afraid I didn't get to fight with her to my satisfaction in the end.`
` I'm glad I'll be able to lock horns with you this time,`
` Lady Bernkastel's piece...!"`
`".........My master is almighty, omnipotent.`
` A fool like you couldn't even begin to compare with her.`
` I accept your challenge."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` You really are calm.`
` ...Even though a witch has appeared before you and is about to fight with magic and fantasy.`
` ......If you were Battler, you'd be lying on the ground, screaming that this can't possibly be a mystery anymore."`
`"Yeah, even in the mystery genre, parallel universes like this have gotten popular lately.`
` You know about Pure Reasoning Space and all that?"`
`"Ayatsuji Yukito doesn't make his debut until next year."`
`"You sure are picky for a witch."`
`"Hahha!!`
` You think you're on the same level as a witch?`
` Don't be so full of yourself, you mere Human!!"`
`When Beato snapped her fingers, something bounced around the room at terrifying speeds...!!`
`It was a Stake of the Witch.`
`A witch's wedge that contained the power of the blue truth within it...!`
`Of course, a mere Human like Erika couldn't follow that terrible speed with her eyes.`
`Erika understood this, so she didn't attempt to look every which-way, stupidly trying to spot it.`
`"Eat this, `
`fool!!"`
`With a terrible sound, Lucifer's blue stake buried itself into Erika's right collarbone.`
`It pierced all the way through her back.`
`Lucifer spun and rebounded, landed in front of Beato,`
` and vanished with a shrill laugh.`
`Erika wasn't blown back.`
`...But she had been run through by the blue wedge.`
`"......So, this is that so-called blue truth.`
` Well then, let me hear your views."`
`"#5decffYou can't deny the possibility that Natsuhi met with Kinzo at 23:00.`
` During the six hours or more before you pushed your way into the study, Kinzo had many chances to escape from it!`
` Because of this, you can't state decisively that Kinzo doesn't exist.#ffffff"`
`Beato announced that with an expression worthy of her title as witch.`
`Erika was silent.`
`...Was she too shocked to speak?`
`There was no anguish in her expression.`
`She was just quietly listening to Beato's blue truth.`
`No, ...judging by her disdainful expression,`
` it's probably more appropriate to say that Beato's words went in one ear and out the other.`
`"......<Good>.`
` Let's start with the classic moves.`
` ......By the way, this thing really is stuck good.`
` I can't take it out."`
`She tried pulling from the front and the back of the blue wedge that pierced her, but it didn't budge an inch.`
`However, her indifferent, relaxed expression didn't budge an inch either.`
`"You can't take it out!`
` ...The blue truth can only be defeated by the red truth.`
` ...For one such as yourself, a guest who came to this island at most a day ago, there is no truth that can possibly be known!`
` That means there exists no red that you can use...!`
` In other words, this is checkmate!!"`
`"...I see.`
` So that's what kind of space this is.`
` ...In that case, I'll need a piece suitable for fighting a witch.`
` ...I'm the detective.`
` My role is to take on the Human culprit.`
` You are a witch.`
` ...And there does exist a fitting piece to use against witches and demons."`
`"Let me introduce you.`
` ......Miss Dlanor,`
` it looks like it's your turn."`
`"......D-Dlanor...!!!"`
`"Ahhahahahahahaha!!`
` I thought so, I was certain you'd bring that piece in sooner or later...!!`
` The ten wedges with which to hunt witches, the archbishop of witch hunting, Dlanor!!"`
`"There's no more fitting piece in a battle against demons.`
` I have my double, Erika, and the greatest natural enemy of witches, Dlanor.`
` I've now taken control of the seventh rank with my two rooks.`
` ...Let me show you, Lambdadelta. And you too, Beatrice.`
` Now you'll see how useless your struggling is.`
` ...*giggle*, ahahahahahaahahaahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`The air shone brightly, and the piece Erika had guided there showed its form...`
`That form resembled a clergy member perfectly suited for confronting an evil witch...`
`"It is a pleasure to meet YOU.`
` Dlanor A. Knox is my NAME."`
`Even though this space was like a bomb just waiting to go off,`
` she introduced herself in a neat and frank manner.`
`...Her out-of-place appearance, completely different from those of the demons and witches, `
`felt blatantly odd and had a kind of severity to it.`
`"...This is the first time I've met you, but I've heard all the rumors.`
` So, this doesn't truly feel like a first meeting."`
`"The same goes for ME, <Miss> Beatrice.`
` The detailed materials Eiserne Jungfrau has on you are summarized in 600 PAGES.`
` I always read such reports, so this doesn't feel like a first meeting to me EITHER."`
`"The secretary of hell could summarize those 600 pages into 6 letters."`
`"Allow me to ASK."`
`"'Danger'."`
`"A fitting SUMMARY.`
` When I return, I will summarize the materials on you using only 2 letters more, out of RESPECT."`
`"<Ｅｘｅｃｕｔｅｄ>."`
`"......So I'm <ｃｕｔｅ> now, *cackle*!`
` You're too polite, my guest...!"`
`"Then let us CONTINUE.`
` <Miss> Beatrice.`
` I, Dlanor, the Head Inquisitor of Heresy, do humbly accept my role as your OPPONENT."`
`"My first move is over.`
` If you can't remove the blue wedge from that Furudo Erika over there, `
`then you might as well totter back up to heaven and get back to your usual boring job of stamping forms!"`
`"...Please do something about this wedge thing.`
` It looks like Beatrice-san thinks she's already achieved checkmate with this alone."`
`After making a show of tapping her finger on the blue wedge that pierced her,`
` Erika shrugged as though taunting Beatrice.`
`"...B-Beatrice..."`
`"It's okay. I'm just toying with her a bit.`
` .........After all, if things get bad, I can grab Kinzo and run out of here whenever I want.`
` I can leave this room at any time and go anywhere."`
`"That is USELESS."`
`"...Hoh?"`
`"Now that you've met up with me, this is your DEMISE.`
` Escape will not be PERMITTED. None can ESCAPE."`
`"True, we can't deny that it'd be possible for Father to suddenly wake up and go somewhere.`
` ......But you know what? I can say for sure that such a thing couldn't have happened.`
` Heheheh, you know why?"`
`"H-How could I know...?!`
` Are you trying to say you stood outside this door all night, watching to make sure the Head didn't take a step outside...?!"`
`"Yes, someone was watching.`
` This kid right here!!"`
`"Please, allow me to speak.`
` Let it be known that entering or exiting through this door is impossible.`
` The palace guards are ordered to blockade the study door."`
`The doors to heaven opened with a strong, unrelenting radiance like the sun's,`
` announcing the arrival of Dlanor's underlings.`
`Those words were clad in the red truth and cut off the witch's method of escape.`
`"Chiester 410, right here!"`
`"Chiester 45, right here!`
` It has been some time, Great Lady Beatrice!`
` We were dispatched in accordance with Alliance Agreement #1516 and a request from the Great Court of Heaven.`
` We apologize for the rudeness that is to follow...!"`
`"We've formed a precision blockade on the study door nyeh.`
` I think it's best if you stay away from it, nyeh?`
` Kihihi!"`
`"Allow me to speak.`
` I say again, #ff0000from last night at 23:00 until the present time, the study door was not opened even once#ffffff."`
`"...Wh-What is that scrap of paper?"`
`"It's a completely ordinary receipt.`
` But even so, this mere scrap of paper proves that you lied."`
`"Last night, when you came out of the study,`
` Eva saw her chance and wedged a receipt into the crack of the study door...!`
` And it fell down just now when Rudolf-kun opened the door for us...!!"`
`"Know what that means?`
` In other words, from 23:00 last night until now, `
`Father couldn't possibly have opened this door!!"`
`"......Wh-What'd you say...?"`
`"Rudolf,`
` the window was locked, right?"`
`"...Yeah. That's why I smashed the glass."`
`"The other windows are all locked as well.`
` They're built so that you can't lock them from the outside...!"`
`"Allow me to speak!`
` Know that #ff0000the windows were all locked#ffffff!`
` Palace guards, blockade all of the windows."`
`"By the name of Eiserne Jungfrau, I give the palace guards permission to make use of forbidden weapons."`
`"Understood.`
` Entire force, Permission Granted for Use of Forbidden Weapon: Red Warhead.`
` Begin Transmitting Activation Code!"`
`"Unya?`
` The password doesn't work nyeh."`
`"410, turn caps lock off and try again...!"`
`"Chiester Squad, Precision Blockade for Study Door and All Windows Complete.`
` We warn the Great Lady Beatrice that if anything is caught passing through these physically, conceptually, or by any other method,`
` we will shoot without warning...!"`
`"Data Link from Archangel Satellite 4.`
` Homing Format, Verdict-Model Conceptual Guidance...!"`
`"And on top of that, we've got Red Warheads nyeh.`
` Impossible to shoot down, impossible to avoid, impossible to survive when hit.`
` ...It'd smash even Lady Beatrice into little bits nyeh♪"`
`The Chiester Squad had laid down a pinpoint blockade over the door and all the windows.`
`Escape would no longer be permitted through any of these...!`
`"......My, my.`
` ...I should be doing the welcoming, but it seems I am the one being welcomed.`
` I'm grateful for the courtesy call, and you've even brought the Chiester Sisters...!"`
`"Allow me to inform you that your paths of retreat have been cut off!`
` Commander Dlanor, let us now remove the sin and purify...!!"`
`"You've done WELL.`
` ......<Miss> Beatrice,`
` I've had your paths of retreat TERMINATED.`
` You cannot leave through the door, nor can you leave through the WINDOWS.`
` Therefore, escape will now be PROHIBITED."`
`"......You think you've shut me in with this alone?`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`The Inquisitor of Heresy in Heaven and her subordinates surrounded the witch.`
`The subordinates used a powerful barrier to cut off Beato's methods of escape.`
`...Demons tend to resist capture, and as a result, they sometimes escape.`
`However, angels counter by blocking off passages of escape, allowing them to eradicate their targets without fail...!`
`"In other words, this study was a perfect closed room from the time Natsuhi nee-san claims she said goodnight...`
`to the time Rudolf opened the door...!"`
`"In that case, Father would have to be here.`
` But there's not even a trace of him...!!`
` Come on, what the hell's goin' on...?!!"`
`"Uh, ...gah........."`
`"I keep telling you to calm down...!`
` The thought that I, Beatrice, could be shut in just because the doors and windows are closed is simply laughable."`
`"...Kinzo, ...I was just playing around, but it seems our guest has no such intentions.`
` Let's withdraw before we lose our chance."`
`"Yes.`
` I would not regret losing this life of mine, but for Natsuhi's sake, I cannot die yet."`
`Beato waved her pipe and the air was split vertically.`
`Then, a pitch-black gate appeared there and slowly opened.`
`...It was a warp portal, the same as the pitch-black holes that Gaap used.`
`"I believe this was written on my files.`
` An elusive phantom.`
` Can appear from anywhere and disappear to anywhere...!`
` As long as Kinzo has me, it will be impossible to capture him...!"`
`The pitch-black gate opened.`
`That gate led from everywhere and to nowhere.`
`Both Beato and Kinzo would be sent to a place where no one could catch them,`
` a place where no one could set foot in, much less chase after them...!`
`"Th-This is the study of the Ushiromiya Family Head.`
` And it is also a room that Father helped to design personally.`
` ...Would it really be so strange if he had some way to get outside without using the door...?"`
`"...Y-Yes, that's correct...!`
` There would be nothing strange about the Master having a hidden door...!"`
`"A hidden door?!`
` Heh, and where would that be...?!"`
`"It's a hidden door, so I don't know.`
` ...There are several devices and hidden doors in this mansion that only Father knows of.`
` ...No one has seen them directly, but everyone in this mansion knows about them vaguely. Correct...?"`
`"Uh, ...ah, ...yes...!"`
`"...It's true that there have been always been rumors about hidden passages only the Master knows of..."`
`"I-It's true that Kinzo-san would probably like devices such as that..."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"Hohohoho...`
` And they are hidden doors, after all...`
` No matter how much people such as ourselves might search, ~ib~it's only natural that we won't find them~ib~`
`."`
`"......I see. So it's a Devil's Proof.`
` You're saying we can't deny the possibility that a hidden door exists in this room."`
`"That's nonsense, a farce...!!`
` Even considering that your lie about concealing Father's death is about to be revealed, how dare you...!!"`
`"That's right!! Just where in this study is there a hidden door...?!!`
` Try and prove that it exists!!"`
`"#5decffProof is unnecessary!!`
` It's a Devil's Proof. It's impossible to find a hidden door and therefore impossible to disprove that it exists!!`
` Therefore, no one can deny the possibility that Kinzo escaped from this study through a hidden door!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000I will not allow a hidden door to exist in this ROOM.#ffffff"`
`Beato's blue wedge, which had been fired off as a farewell gift,`
` was crushed with a flash of Dlanor's longsword, ...and the pitch-black gate was crushed as well...!`
`And it wasn't just crushed visibly and physically.`
`The warp portal conceptualizing hidden doors would remain destroyed from that point onward.`
`"Wh-Why can someone like you, who is neither the owner of the study nor the Game Master,`
` ...use the red truth...?!`
` And what was that?! What to you mean you 'will not allow' hidden doors to exist?!"`
`"It's because this is the mystery genre.`
` #ff0000Knox's 3rd. It is forbidden for hidden passages to exist.`
` #ffffffHidden doors mustn't exist in the mystery genre. Sorry about that."`
`"In this world, there are no other gods except our god, and no hidden doors EXIST.`
` They must not EXIST, and we won't let them EXIST.`
` They are blasphemy against our GOD."`
`"...Enough pride in you to shock a witch...`
` Hah, it's so painful to watch that it's actually pleasurable...!"`
`"Ahahahahahahaahahahahahahaha...!!`
` Here it is, the ten wedges to pierce witches...!!`
` Just like usual, it's the kind of irrational argument I just love to hear...!"`
`"What a fool.`
` The Devil's Proof might've been vague enough to let you escape from everything until now, `
`but now that you're up against Dlanor, that move won't work anymore, Beatrice!"`
`"...As I thought, you're no different from any witch after ALL.`
` I'm DISAPPOINTED."`
`"...Beato,`
` ...it seems this isn't an opponent we'll be able to escape from easily after all."`
`"Please do entertain me, Beatrice-san.`
` ...You should at least serve some tea for your guests.`
` It doesn't even matter if it's third-rate!"`
`"Come on, please use the blue truth,`
` and tell me how Kinzo-san escaped from the closed room study...!!"`
`"...Very well.`
` Make sure you don't cry!!"`
`"#5decffIt's possible that, after slipping out the door, Kinzo noticed the trick with the receipt and correctly returned it to its original place.#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000Denial of that with the red has already been FINISHED.`
` After 23:00, the door to the study was not opened even ONCE.#ffffff"`
`"#5decffKinzo might have been a marvelous magician and an inventor, right?!`
` He might have invented a drug that turns his body to mist and slipped out through the keyhole!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000No such drug EXISTS.`
` It must not EXIST.#ffffff"`
`"#5decffOr maybe he invented a teleport device, right?!`
` That possibility is undeniable because of the Devil's Proof!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000Such a machine does not EXIST.`
` I will not allow it to EXIST.#ffffff"`
`"#5decffOh, so you can examine every drug in the world?`
` You can deny the existence of unknown scientific devices?!`
` There's no way you can; it's a Devil's Proof!`
` You cannot deny that they might exist!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000I will REPEAT.`
` By the name of God, I will not let such a drug or machine EXIST.`
` I will not allow them to exist for all ETERNITY.#ffffff"`
`"Not even in the future?!`
` Oho, so you think you can even deny possibilities in the future of the human race?!"`
`"It's Knox's 4th.`
` It is forbidden for unknown drugs or hard-to-understand scientific devices to be used."`
`"The progression of humanity, as well as techniques and knowledge that might be obtainable in the future, are decided upon by our GOD.`
` And the denial of their existence has been proclaimed for ETERNITY.`
` Therefore, I will not allow for such a technique to exist for all ETERNITY. It is not PERMITTED."`
`Beato and Dlanor had supposedly just gone through a massive exchange of red and blue.`
`...However, not only did Dlanor not take any damage, she also showed no signs of fatigue.`
`Beato might have been a fearsome witch, but blood flowed through her veins and she did breathe.`
`She felt both pain and fatigue.`
`But Dlanor...was like a doll made of marble.`
`She felt no fatigue, no pain, no hesitation.`
`Even if Beato's sharp wedges had aimed right for Dlanor's eyes, she wouldn't have shut them.`
`...In fact, it's doubtful that she ever blinks in the first place...`
`"...B-Beatrice, ...hang in there..."`
`"...Well, I'd already heard the rumors, but our compatibility really is awful.`
` ...To think that dreams, hopes and even future possibilities would be forbidden. The pride of the gods is overwhelming.`
` ...I'd expect no less from a witch hunt executioner.`
` It seems we'll never be able to enjoy a drink together."`
`Even the strikes that had made Battler surrender over and over had absolutely no effect on Dlanor.`
`...Well, I more or less knew that was coming, but to think that I'd be repelled so easily...`
`"Quite a formidable opponent..."`
`"Oh my, so even the great Goldsmith has gotten old and decrepit.`
` Hearing those words come out of your mouth is rarer than seeing two comets in the night sky...!"`
`"Hmph. I'm not decrepit, I'm already dead."`
`"Hah, that's true.`
` Sorry, but I'm not letting you die for just a bit longer."`
`Beato experienced something she'd only rarely felt during her entire life.`
`...It was probably what we'd call 'hardship'.`
`Beato quietly brushed aside Natsuhi's hand that tried to comfort her,`
` and she regained her posture again, showing off her witch's pride and her continued readiness to fight.`
`"Is that ALL?`
` There was no need for me to come HERE.`
` I'm DISAPPOINTED."`
`"I'm not done yet. I was just testing a few moves just now.`
` I merely wished to measure your abilities."`
`"How foolish.`
` Know your place, Golden Witch."`
`"......Lady Beatrice..."`
`Beato's expression became tense once again.`
`No longer was there any trace of mischief.`
`...The mood changed.`
`"The time for playing is over.`
` Here I go.`
` In that case, I shall acknowledge that Kinzo did not enter or leave the study.`
` Why don't I accept your closed room?"`
`"......HMM."`
`"Let it be known that Beatrice has changed her pattern of attack."`
`Beatrice, who had until then thoroughly resisted the idea that a closed room existed, did an about face.`
`She proclaimed that she accepted their proposition.`
`Of course, this didn't mean she'd surrendered.`
`This was a new attack of Beato's.`
`Dlanor noticed this and readied herself.`
`"What's going on?`
` Why did Lady Beatrice acknowledge the closed room when she's trying to destroy it nyeh?"`
`"...Sh-She's probably trying to claim that Kinzo existed outside of this room.`
` ...Confirmation that the Great Lady Beatrice's warp portal has reactivated!"`
`"#5decffNatsuhi claims to have 'talked with Kinzo in the study', but she never said that she spoke with him face to face.`
` Therefore, if Kinzo was in a location other than the study, there is no contradiction as long as they held a conversation!#ffffff"`
`"......!"`
`After bouncing at an erratic angle, the witch's stake pierced the top of Dlanor's foot.`
`"You sure are slow.`
` ...Heheheheh, top of the foot, all mine!"`
`"#5decffNatsuhi used the internal phone line in this study to speak with Kinzo, who was in another place!`
` There'd be nothing strange if Kinzo, who hates the relatives, predicted that they'd enter his study and left to go elsewhere.`
` He might've gone to the hidden mansion, Kuwadorian!#ffffff"`
`Asmodeus's stake, which contained the power of Beato's blue truth and pierced Dlanor's foot, changed into a blue wedge.`
`"Not bad, that makes sense nyeh...!"`
`"...Blue truth, valid!"`
`A cyclone of gold butterflies swept up with Beato at its center.`
`...The magical power of the once-smashed black gate was once again refilled.`
`...If I can manage to hold Dlanor off here,`
` I'll be able to warp Kinzo out of the study this time, all the way to Kuwadorian...!`
`Dlanor moved clumsily, trying to pull the blue wedge out of her foot,`
` but it didn't even budge.`
`Of course, Beato didn't miss this chance.`
`No witch would!`
`"I've got more, so get ready.`
` #5decffThere's a chance the Kinzo Natsuhi mentioned does not refer to the person himself!`
` The Kinzo Natsuhi spoke of might have been another name for this room, right?`
` Kinzo had taken refuge in Kuwadorian and was impossible to contact.`
` Perhaps Natsuhi called this room 'Father',`
` and by contemplating inside it, she felt as though she had received some sort of revelation from Kinzo!!#ffffff"`
`"We've stopped your movement. You've already lost!"`
`Beelzebub's blue wedge pierced the base of Dlanor's neck!`
`Of course, even this didn't cause her to flinch, but her movements were restricted even further.`
`"...Interesting.`
` Is that ALL?"`
`"You don't call it a full course dinner if you stop at the soups and hors d'oeuvres!`
` I'll hit you with the main dish and the dessert at once, so watch your stomach explode as you die!!!"`
`"#5DECFFEven if, as you say, this is a closed room and impossible to escape from, you can't deny the possibility that he's still hiding in this room.`
` I'm not talking about a hidden door! He might be under the bed or above the ceiling!`
` He might be hiding in a truly unobtrusive blind spot that only demons could know of, right?!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffOr, it might be that Natsuhi, who was ordered to speak specially on Kinzo's behalf, `
`considered herself both his representative and another Kinzo!`
` In other words, it's possible that Natsuhi was also Kinzo!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffI've got plenty more!! At 23:00 last night, Kinzo escaped out the window!`
` Natsuhi watched him go, then locked the window!!`
` This doesn't lead to any problems. In fact, it might be the most beautiful blue truth yet!#ffffff`
` How's that?! Dlanor A. Knox?!`
` Hyahhahahahaaaaahhhh!! There are many ways to escape from this closed room!!"`
`"Know your foolishness in trying to oppose my master!"`
`"There's no need for you to argue back."`
`"Just lose and sleep for all eternity...!"`
`The Seven Sisters appeared from Beato's golden tornado one after another, piercing Dlanor with blue wedges.`
`Four blue wedges were buried into her neck, chest, gut, and thigh.`
`Including the one buried into the top of her foot, she was pincushioned by five stakes.`
`"Aaaah, Beatrice-samaaa,`
` when's my turn?!"`
`"I'll use you if I think of any more. Be quiet for now!!`
` *cackle*cackle* How do you like that, Dlanor the witch hunter?!!`
` After skewering and burning so many witches in the past, how does it feel to be skewered by a witch this time?!!`
` Hehhihhahhaaahhhahahahahahaha!!"`
`They were all ridiculous arguments, but they came fiercely one after another.`
`Though a total of five wedges pierced Dlanor, her expression didn't change in the slightest.`
`However, her movements had indeed been limited...`
`"Whew...`
` Witches sure are scary nyeh...`
` You can't beat twisted logic nyeh."`
`"They don't violate the Knox Decalogue...`
` It's valid...!"`
`"..............."`
`"...W-Well done, Beatrice...!`
` Even if there was no one in this study, and even if it was a closed room, that alone isn't enough to deny Father's existence...!"`
`"Against a normal opponent, I'd think the matter settled by now.`
` ...But this is Dlanor, Head Inquisitor of Heresy!`
` This ruthless woman killed even her father when he violated the Decalogue...!`
` Kinzo, now!"`
`"Right...!"`
`Now that Dlanor had been pinned down, this was their last chance to recover their magical power and escape.`
`Once again, a pitch-black gate began to rise slowly in front of Beato and Kinzo...`
`Though the gate had once been opened by simply drawing in the air,`
` it wasn't so easy in the study now, filled as it was with the power of denial.`
`"...Wh-What do you think, everyone?!`
` No matter how much you question the state of this study, you can't question whether or not Father is in good health...!!"`
`"...Oh, so you say.`
` Both you and I...`
`had better not forget that we are part of this battle, right?`
` I cannot fight against witches, but I can fight against you."`
`Erika grinned at Natsuhi with a smile more demonic than a real demon's.`
`"...Natsuhi-san,`
` let me ask again.`
` ...Last night, you're sure you spoke with Ushiromiya Kinzo-san, right?"`
`"Y-Yes.`
` I have said repeatedly that I came to deliver a report for the day and to say good night...!"`
`"This may be a strange thing to ask, but since it's needed to prove your innocence, `
`please answer me straightforwardly.`
` ...This Kinzo you speak of is the Ushiromiya Kinzo-san we all know of, right?`
` It isn't a different person or thing with the same name, is it?"`
`"I-I'm not really sure what you mean...!"`
`"...It's like this.`
` You didn't, for instance, start calling this room itself 'Father' after Father's death, right?`
` That's what she's asking.`
` You said you gave a daily report to Father before he went to sleep, right?`
` That doesn't mean you gave a daily report to the wall here all by yourself, inside the study called 'Father', right...?"`
`"H-How rude!!`
` Nothing of the sort happened...!`
` Father is Father!!`
` He is in good health!`
` And I most certainly gave him a report and said good night to him last night...!!`
` I'm not trying to trick you or talk my way out of anything!"`
`"I see.`
` In that case, can you repeat what I'm about to say?`
` If you aren't tricking or deceiving us in any way, you should be able to do it."`
`"F-Fine.`
` I'll repeat whatever you want...!"`
`"Repeat it.`
` 'Ushiromiya Natsuhi did, at 23:00 last night,`
` speak with Ushiromiya Kinzo while in the same room as him, this room'."`
`"I-I, 'Ushiromiya Natsuhi did, at 23:00 last night,`
` speak with Ushiromiya Kinzo while in the same room as him, this room'!!"`
`"<Good>!`
` Then I'll ask one last thing.`
` ...Seriously now, Natsuhi-san,`
` you didn't do anything like throwing Kinzo-san out the window after your conversation and locking the window behind him, right?`
` Because everything still makes sense if you did."`
`"Wh-Why would I want to chase Father out the window?!!`
` This is intolerable! This mockery is intolerable!!"`
`"Please, allow me to speak.`
` Let it be said that #ff0000when Natsuhi refers to 'Kinzo', she means Ushiromiya Kinzo and nothing else#ffffff."`
`"Please, allow me to speak!`
` #ff0000Natsuhi claims to have met face to face with Kinzo in the study at 23:00#ffffff!"`
`"Ah, ......aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!"`
`Natsuhi let out a cry, but it was too late...`
`She had been totally suckered in by their provocation...!`
`The blue wedge to the foot representing a telephone discussion...`
`The blue wedge to the neck representing the study itself being called Kinzo...`
`The blue wedge to the gut representing Natsuhi herself being called Kinzo...`
`The blue wedge to the thigh representing Natsuhi letting Kinzo escape out the window and locking it afterwards...`
`The four of them were smashed up with a thin sound...!`
`Because Natsuhi, 'the one who knew the truth', had denied them,`
` those denials had gained the power of the red truth...!`
`Despite Kinzo's absence in this closed room, Beato had introduced five ways that Kinzo could still exist.`
`Natsuhi had carelessly crushed the premises behind four of those herself...!!`
`Only one wedge remained.`
`In other words, this was the last blue truth that could bury the contradiction of Kinzo existing in the study at 23:00, but not existing there later, after it became a closed room.`
`There was only the theory that pierced Dlanor's chest, 'Kinzo is hiding somewhere in this room'.`
`With that theory, even if Kinzo wasn't present in this closed room study, he could still 'exist' there...!`
`If this wedge of Satan's were to be crushed, their chances of escaping this room would become hopelessly dim...!`
`"Gghhh, ......ack...!!`
` B-Beatrice-sama...!`
` Quickly, ...escape while you still can...!!`
` Ggh, gyah..."`
`Dlanor slowly grasped the final wedge, which still pierced her chest.`
`...Apparently, that vice-like grip was hurting Satan as though all the bones in her body were being broken.`
`"All that remains...is this one WEDGE.`
` It was about Kinzo hiding somewhere in this room, CORRECT?"`
`"As the detective, I've searched all of those places.`
` If I didn't find him, just where could he be hiding? *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`With the final wedge still sticking out of her chest, Dlanor slowly approached Beato...`
`If this wedge was taken out, ...then...!`
`"Allow me to ASK.`
` Just where in this study is Kinzo HIDING?"`
`"Heheh, well then...`
` #5decffMaybe he's under the bed?!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000A check of that place has been FINISHED.#ffffff"`
`"#5decffMaybe he's in the bathtub!!#ffffff"`

`      <The Great Equalizer is Death!!>#ffffff"`
`No locations would work against Dlanor by this point.`
`Dlanor took Beato's final desperate onslaught head on,`
` turning everything back with a far stronger power of denial!`
`Beat them up!`
`Knock them down with overwhelming force!!`
`No longer does any place exist in this study for Kinzo to escape to...!!`
`Beato was blown back like a leaf dancing in the wind, `
`knocked around over and over again like an empty can lying on a road.`
`By now, no matter how many times Beato used the blue truth, it wouldn't be able to defeat Dlanor's red...`
`"Hahahahaha, ahhahahahahahahaha...!!`
` ......Witches are so pathetic.`
` ...You just try to talk your way out of things endlessly, trying to confuse the truth.`
` Let me borrow Dlanor's words.`
` ...I'm disappointed, Beatrice-san.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"...Nggg...............ggghh..."`
`Erika coldly delivered these decisive words to Beato, ...who was crawling on the ground.`
`"Detective's authority.`
` The detective has the right to inspect all crime scenes.`
` I have exercised this right.`
` Therefore, I can say this."`
`"Kinzo-san is not inside this room.`
` Furthermore, this room is a perfect closed room.`
` From the above two points, I can state this fact:`
` this room was empty the whole time.`
` Natsuhi-san lied about having met Kinzo-san here last night!`
` That makes this checkmate, Beatrice-san...!"`
`"*giggle*giggle* ...Ahahahaha, ahhahhahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaha!`
` How's that?`
` Simply by the existence of this room,`
` this level of reasoning is possible for Furudo Erika!`
` What do you think, everyone?!`
` Ahhahahahahhahhahhaaaahh!!"`
`At these words, the final wedge shattered,`
` and at the same time, the pitch-black gate that was about to open shattered once again.`
`This time, the warp portal had been completely destroyed...`
`No longer would Kinzo be permitted to exist in this room...or escape from it...`
`Beato struggled to her feet, ...but that was the best she could do.`
`She no longer had the energy to fight.`
`She had taken all of the denying red head-on from close range.`
`It took all her strength just to withstand a pain so strong, it felt like she'd vomit up all her insides...`
`Even Beato, who had always aimed for the title of strongest and most evil witch, `
`...couldn't do a thing against a witch hunter.`
`No matter how sturdy a sandcastle you build on the beach, it can never win against the rising tide...`
`"......S-Sorry, Kinzo...`
` ...Looks like...this opponent really was tough after all..."`
`"Beatrice, I thank you.`
` ...You've done so much for me despite your remaining grudge."`
`"I guess it's true that your life flashes by when you see death coming.`
` ...I've remembered how you once looked when you were young.`
` ......You were annoyingly like Battler."`
`"I now pass on everything, my soul and the qualifications of the Head, to Battler.`
` I no longer have any regrets...!"`
`".........Battler.........`
` ...My apologies...`
` ...How pitiful...`
` ...Though I swore to fight with you once again, `
`...I must settle my accounts like this..."`
`"............"`
`To Beato, it seemed as though Battler had met her gaze.`
`...There was no way he could have.`
`This Battler was the piece Battler.`
`There was no way he could 'see' Beato in this higher-level world.`
`However, his eyes really did meet hers.`
`Even though they couldn't have, ......Beato was sure they did.`
`As Erika, Eva and the others closed in on Natsuhi, questioning her over and over,`
` ...only Battler stood apart from that tumult.`
`His expression held none of the enthusiasm and excitement that the other humans had.`
`It just piercingly and coldly surveyed the scene.`
`And the expression on his face...was a quiet displeasure. Anger.`
`He wasn't feeling compassion for Natsuhi because her lie was about to be exposed.`
`However, he couldn't excuse Erika, a self-proclaimed intellectual rapist,`
` who simply enjoyed cornering Natsuhi and those who sympathized with her.`
`Then, he whispered softly.`
`"......It's useless."`
`Beato and the others definitely heard that...`
`"You don't think...Battler might...turn things around from this weakened position...?"`
`"...I probably could have done it, back in the day.`
` ...And Battler can probably do it."`
`"......Battler..."`
`"Battler, `
`...if you are indeed the man who will inherit everything from me, ...now is the time to prove it...!`
` Don't let the Legend of the Golden Witch end here...!"`
`"It's true I met Father here last night!!`
` It's true!!`
` And he spoke to me of the Ushiromiya family's glorious history, as well as the burden of bearing it..."`
`"Your lie has already been exposed, Natsuhi-san.`
` We already know that you were alone in this room last night."`
`"Isn't it about time to give up and confess?`
` Culprits who are bad at giving up tend to go with bad mystery novels.`
` At least in the end, please prove that this is a slightly better third-rate mystery than that."`
`"......Aah, it's useless.`
` It's all useless."`
`Battler, who had been silent off by himself up until then, spoke.`
`At first, it sounded as though he was attacking Natsuhi.`
`...However, when Erika realized he was glaring directly at her, her expression visibly clouded with displeasure.`
`"And just what...are you calling useless?"`
`"If this is a third-rate mystery, then the detective's third-rate too.`
` ...Listen up.`
` I'm gonna become Grandfather."`
`"...B-Battler...?!"`
`"You'll become...Kinzo-san?`
` Are you saying you'll become Kinzo-san and reenact his disappearance from this room?"`
`"...Do you actually intend to deny my checkmate?`
` ...Fool!!!"`
`"...What is this man SAYING?"`
`"Hey, new girls.`
` ...This here's your first game, right?`
` Sorry, but it's totally useless to call checkmate after a little something like that.`
` Yeah, it's all useless...!!"`
`"Wh-What are you talking about, Battler?`
` You say you'll become Dad...?!"`
`"Yeah.`
` I'll reenact it.`
` I'll become Grandfather and disappear from this room."`
`"Y-You can't use the windows or the door, right?! How would you do it...?!"`
`"Did you find a hidden door?!"`
`"I don't have a clue either... Yes, not a clue...!!"`
`*rustle*.`
`......That sound wasn't just the noise of the onlookers fidgeting.`
`...It was a provocative chill that ran up Erika's spine.`
`"......Interesting.`
` I see, you're the Successor to Ushiromiya Family Headship, the one who bears the Head's Ring.`
` That should more than qualify you to stand in for Kinzo-san.`
` ......Why don't you let us have a look at your theory?!!"`
`Erika's expression was no longer a challenging smile.`
`...It was malicious.`
`Overwhelmingly displeased.`
`She couldn't conceal her anger at having this very pleasurable time of hers ruined.`
`"......H-How will he...get us out of here...?"`
`"Heh, ...heheheheh, `
`...I've got it.`
` I see, so that move is still open."`
`"So you finally figured it out, you damn geezer.`
` Hidden doors and hiding under the bed...all that stuff is so pitiful it brings tears to the eyes.`
` This is ~ib~the~ib~ Ushiromiya Kinzo we're talking about here.`
` ...There's gotta be a more thrilling and exciting answer."`
`"Exactly.`
` How pitiful that even I couldn't think of it, even though it was about me.`
` And how pitiful that the only one of my relatives to understand me is Battler, the kid who's returned after being gone six years.`
` ......Battler, take my place.`
` Do not shame me!"`
`"Sure, Gramps!!`
` I'll teach these guests what the dignity of the Ushiromiya Family Head is all about!!"`
`"What are you planning to do, ...Father...?!"`
`"Wahhahahahaha!!`
` Natsuhi, Beatrice, watch!`
` ...We'll show you what being the Ushiromiya Family Head truly entails!"`
`"...That Battler, what's he trying to prove...?"`
`"There's no way he can do anything.`
` ...This is a perfect closed room!"`
`"Aunt Natsuhi, come over here.`
` Now, move as I tell you to."`
`Battler called Natsuhi over to the window and whispered something to her with his back towards the others...`
`"...<Miss> Dlanor,`
` you're ready for everything, right?`
` It's not possible for Kinzo and the witch to slip out of this room, right?"`
`"Of COURSE.`
` ...Gertrude, Cornelia,`
` and the palace GUARDS.`
` Double check that the seal of this closed room is PERFECT."`
`"Please, allow me to speak.`
` Our barrier is perfect."`
`"Allow me to speak. There are no hidden doors, and escape will not be granted through either door or window!`
` Palace guards, when Battler engages the barrier, fire arrows without hesitation!"`
`"Ch-Chiester Corps, roger.`
` Battler-sama, prepare yourself...!"`
`"Escaping from this room...is impossible...!"`
`"......But he'll do it nyeh."`
`"H-How...?!"`
`"He's certain he can succeed even without any basis.`
` That's what it means to be the Ushiromiya Head nyeh...!"`
`"......True.`
` Let's watch."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...Let's see the majesty of Riiche's opponent...!"`
`"Then I'll begin."`
`Everyone nodded and watched Battler's every move...`
`"Grandfather was lying in bed like this,`
` grunting his understanding of Aunt Natsuhi's daily report or whatever."`
`Battler laid down on the bed himself.`
`As if it still mattered now, Erika grumbled about disturbing the crime scene, but no one listened to her.`
`"Then, I stop answering and sleep.`
` ......Well, realistically speaking, I probably get tired of all that talking and only pretend to be asleep."`
`"Ahahahaha! You really do get it...!"`
`"...I-I see that Father has gone to sleep,`
` ...bow silently, and leave."`
`Natsuhi lowered her head to Battler, who was still lying down in the bed, and turned around...`
`Then, she started wandering around, as though doing an inspection of the room.`
`"...After seeing that Grandfather was asleep, Aunt Natsuhi probably did an inspection of the room before leaving."`
`"Of course, she had Shannon-chan and the others clean it every day,`
` but she still checked it thoroughly herself.`
` ...Making sure there was no dust piling up.`
` Making sure he hadn't run out of any consumables."`
`"Y-Yes.`
` This is the room of the precious Family Head, so I check everything carefully myself instead of relying entirely on the servants.`
` I always do that."`
`"......Th-That's true.`
` Madam usually checks things very carefully."`
`"Her inspections are very detailed, and she even checks all of the consumables in the washroom one by one."`
`"In other words, we aren't just talking dust on the windowsill, like you see all the time on TV.`
` ......She checks to see that there's enough soap and toilet paper in the washroom.`
` Though she probably doesn't have to do it each day, she's very devoted."`
`"Th-That is my routine.`
` I mustn't slack off in my inspection of the Head's room for even a single day."`
`"......So what's your point?`
` Please keep any showing off to a minimum."`
`"*giggle*`
` Isn't getting to show off the biggest perk to being a detective?"`
`"Nng, gah, ...b-but...I'm...the...detective..."`
`"Since we're inside the study, you can probably tell, but even though we call it a study,`
` it wouldn't be wrong to call it a second house inside the mansion."`
`"It has a sleeping room, a study, a washroom, and even a toilet and bath.`
` In other words, it isn't a single room.`
` You could call it a full house."`
`"...Thank you for the explanation of the room's LAYOUT.`
` However, the move of having him hide somewhere in this room has already been DEFEATED."`
`"He isn't hiding.`
` However, there's gotta be several blind spots.`
` ...For example, if Aunt Natsuhi went into the bathroom to check the amount of toilet paper, `
`most of the study would be outside her range of vision."`
`"...In other words, for almost every location in the study, the sole observer would have disappeared."`
`"!!`
` ...O-Observer disappearance...!`
` We've lost track of Kinzo...!"`
`"Let it be said that the witch's darkness is filling the study."`
`"Excellent. ...Watch as it fills with the power of darkness.`
` Heheheheheheheh!"`
`"So? If the observer...if Natsuhi goes away, so what...?`
` ...What next?!"`
`"When Grandfather noticed that fussy Aunt Natsuhi leaving, he got up."`
`"Why?!"`
`"Wahhahhahhahhahha!!`
` On a twisted night such as this, what better way to enjoy a drink than bathed in twisted weather under the night sky!!"`
`"...Since Aunt Natsuhi's in the blind spot of the bathroom,`
` it becomes possible for Grandfather to walk about the study at will."`
`It was possible for him to move without Natsuhi's knowledge.`
`It was possible for him to move without contradicting what Natsuhi knew!`
`"Warning, Battler is approaching the study door."`
`"Allow me to speak.`
` A noise rings out when the lock on the study door is released.`
` Know that #ff0000you cannot leave through the door without Natsuhi thinking something was odd#ffffff."`
`Because Battler had acted as though he was heading for the door, Gertrude, who was sealing the door, immediately sent out a warning.`
`Maybe it was possible for him to leave the study while in Natsuhi's blind spot.`
`...However.`
`"That's right, ...there's the sound!!`
` We know there's a loud sound when the auto-lock is released!`
` Even if Natsuhi was in a blind spot inside the study, she wouldn't miss hearing that.`
` Of course she'd find it odd...!!"`
`"Allow me to speak.`
` Let it be said that #ff0000Natsuhi did not hear the sound of the door opening while in the room#ffffff."`
`The washroom and toilet are very close to the door.`
`Even if they hadn't been, that auto-lock always lets off such a massive sound.`
`She'd be able to hear that sound no matter what.`
`Natsuhi had already spoken with Erika and the others about the details of the previous night,`
` making it quite clear that nothing out of the ordinary had occurred.`
`Any argument that relied on Natsuhi failing to hear the lock wouldn't work...!`
`"Please, allow me to speak once more.`
` #ff0000Kinzo entering or exiting through the door will not be permitted.#ffffff"`
`"Let it be said that this is a useless struggle!`
` It is foolish...!!"`
`"......It's true I can't break through the red of that girl by the door.`
` ...But what about you over there by the window?"`
`"......!"`
`Turning his back to Gertrude, who claimed that leaving through the door was impossible,`
` Battler locked his gaze on Cornelia, who stood in front of the window.`
`"Make sure you hold that barrier of yours up tight.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ...'Cause you're gonna be......~ib~blasted away, okay?~ib~"`
`By now, Battler's target was clear.`
`......It was Cornelia.`
` It was...the window.`
`He was going...to smash this closed room from the window.`
`Not expecting to be chosen as the target herself,`
` Cornelia was overawed for just a second, but she quickly regained her composure.`
`On rare occasions, struggling, fleeing witches would directly challenge the barriers Cornelia set up.`
`Such witches were always fighting desperately, on the brink of death!`
`"Please, allow me to speak.`
` You are Battler's target, Cornelia.`
` I ask that you be on your guard."`
`"Fool!`
` God, have pity on this foolish lamb...!!"`
`"I'm no sheep.`
` ...The Head of the Ushiromiya family is an eagle.`
` With one wing.`
` ...Don't think you can keep me shut up in this study forever with just a flimsy window like that."`
`...Starting from a low posture, `
`...both silent and supple, `
`...Battler ran forward like a white leopard.`
`".........Th-`
`This guy...`
`...couldn't possibly mean to......!!"`
`".........!!`
` Th-This is.........agh.`
` A-Allow me to speak...!`
` There is no way to defeat my red!`
` Know that your wish will not be granted...!!"`
`Cornelia thrust out both her arms and made a sign.`
`When she did, a red barrier closed in front of Battler.`
`"Know that your course is a fruitless one, Ushiromiya Battler...!`
` Know that #ff0000this window is sealed from the inside, and Natsuhi did not help Kinzo escape...!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffI'm not saying that Aunt Natsuhi helped Grandfather escape.`
` ...But what if Grandfather snuck out, keeping it a secret from Aunt Natsuhi?!#ffffff"`
`"Wh-Why would Kinzo go out the window on his own?!!!"`
`"What better way to enjoy a drink on a twisted night...`
`than leaping through the rainswept skies!!!"`
`"But this is the third floor, right?! It's impossible!!!"`
`"Even you've jumped down a flight of stairs at least once in your life, right?`
` Three stories is nothing for Kinzo...!"`
`"I wouldn't put it past him."`
`"I certainly wouldn't."`
`"Th-That's...r-ridiculous...!!!"`
`Blue cracks appeared in Cornelia's red barrier, and it shattered with a crisp sound.`
`It was all far too quick.`
`It looked almost as though she'd gotten out of the way herself in fear of Battler.`
`"...E-Endless Nine...!!`
` Magic Resistance Power, Endless Nine!!"`
`"Cornelia-sama, you can't block it, retreat...!"`
`At the same time the barrier shattered, the window behind Cornelia's back was flung open.`
`The curtains fluttered for just an instant.`
`Though it was all filled with rain, the heavens and the courtyard were spread out in front of them...`
`A fitting exit for an eagle leaping from this closed room!`
`"Cornelia, repair the BARRIER!!"`
`"As you wish, Commander Dlanor!`
` Kn-Know that you will not be allowed to break this...!!"`
`Cornelia quickly returned to her senses and set up another red barrier.`
`...However, this was her last one.`
`"Please, allow me to speak...!!`
` Let us accept for the time being that Kinzo escaped through the window...!`
` In that case, how did he lock a window which cannot be locked from the outside?!`
` #ff0000The window was locked from the inside!!#ffffff"`
`"......Useless!"`
`"Yeah, it's all useless!!"`
`Kinzo and Battler grinned!`
`Did she think this feeble red could block the charge of Battler and Kinzo, the two Family Heads?`
`"#5decffAfter Grandfather jumped out the window, Aunt Natsuhi probably noticed a slight draft.`
` She then approached the window, realized it was wide open, then quickly closed and locked it...!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffNatsuhi couldn't have imagined that I'd slip out the window!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffYeah!!`
` So, it's only natural that Aunt Natsuhi thought Kinzo was sleeping in bed!!#ffffff"`
`Now that Battler had found the answer, the red barrier was more fragile than thin glass.`
`The red magical wall of certainty had been smashed again, so easily that it disgraced the name of certainty itself!`
`Unbelievable, right?`
`That barrier was more firm than any Ronove had ever used against Jessica.`
`And yet it had been...destroyed so easily...!`
`Though Battler was rushing fiercely and had almost reached Cornelia, she didn't step aside.`
`Her steel spirit, worthy of the name Eiserne Jungfrau, didn't allow her to step aside.`
`She took a charm from her pocket, placed it against the thin air, and made a sign.`
`Then, not red, but blue burned there.`
`Though it was far more frail than the red barrier, it was her last method of resistance.`
`"Y-You won't get through, you won't!! Let me speak, let me speak!!`
` #5decffBe that as it may, this is the third floor...!`
` How could a wingless human escape from the window...?!!`
` #ffffffKnow that you won't get through, you wooooooooon't!!"`
`"Just quit your whining and watch!!!"`
`"#5decffThis is the answeeeeeer, aaaaaaaahhhhh!!#ffffff"`
`Battler...jumped.`
`He burst through Cornelia and her blue barrier, knocked them away, `
`...and his body flew out the window through the darkness of the rainy sky.`
`The fragments of the blue barrier scattered, beautifully adorning the surrounding air.`
`The closed room...`
`...had been smashed open...!!`
`Battler...flew out of the mansion.`
`Through the sky above the rainy courtyard.`
`...All the raindrops became small round gems and were scattered through the air.`
`Battler flew across the treasure box world of that exquisite stormy sky, ...through the countless gems of rain that filled it.`
`In the sky over the world frozen in time, Dlanor and Battler faced each other.`
`If Battler, who had smashed and flown out the window, was like a knight leaping off a white horse,`
` ...then Dlanor was another knight, who floated in the air, waiting for him.`
`In the air above the courtyard, surrounded by the Ushiromiya mansion and frozen in time,`
` ...the true new Head of the Ushiromiya family and the disciple of heaven who would test him crossed paths...`
`"...Well DONE.`
` When you fall into the courtyard, whether you live or die, it won't change the fact that Kinzo could have defeated this closed ROOM...!!`
` You who have thrown away your life and jumped are a MARTYR...!!`
` Well done, you have smashed our closed room BARRIER.`
` Splendid, Ushiromiya Battler!!"`
`"However, I am the Head Inquisitor of Heresy, Dlanor A. Knox!!`
` I cannot allow you to escape out from under my NOSE...!`
` Now, at the end, allow me the honor of crossing swords with YOU!!"`
`"Sure, bring it on.`
` ...This game is surprisingly unrelenting."`
`In this world where the gems of rain...fell slowly like large snowflakes on a snowy field...`
`...Dlanor and Battler slowly......crossed paths.`
`It seemed slow.`
`And yet, ...it happened in a flash.`
`Their gazes crossed and clashed like lightning.`
`Knight confronted knight head on, and everything would be settled with a single strike...!`
`Blue and red...crossed paths...`
`"#5decffWas it shown beforehand that a blind spot existed within the study for Natsuhi?`
` If it wasn't shown, this theory will not be permitted.#ffffff`
` #ff0000Knox's 8th.`
` It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not PRESENTED...!!#ffffff"`
`Dlanor's double strike with both the blue and red blades reached out to slice Battler.`
`.....and failed.`
`Those longswords, which had never lost over the course of a hundred battles, cut through empty air...`
`"#ff0000When we entered the study, its structure was clearly described.`
`#ffffff ...Too bad for you."`
`For the first time, an expression showed on Dlanor's face.`
`...It was a sudden smile.`
`She had known about that long before.`
`...However, she still couldn't let him escape without attempting that single strike.`
`Not even with her reputation as an Inquisitor of Heresy on the line.`
`She still crossed swords with Battler, even though she knew it would fail.`
`"Yes, I KNEW.`
` ...With your answer, Knox's 8th is not VIOLATED."`
`"...Here it comes. No hard feelings."`
`"Yes, COME."`
`In Battler's hand...was a blade that shone red.`
`That blade etched out the red truth...`
`#ff0000'It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that Kinzo's study was a small villa he had created inside the mansion'`
`#ffffff`
`#ff0000'A study.`
` A library.`
` A place to sleep.`
` And a bathroom and washroom.`
` It was divided into multiple rooms.'`
`That has already been shown.`
`And it suggests that there could have been a blind spot somewhere within the room...`
`Without any mercy...no, without any reluctance, which would have been dishonorable,`
` ...the sword of red truth cut into Dlanor.`
`It cut a beautiful hemisphere through the countless gems of rain that filled the sky...`
`"Well......DONE..."`
`"........."`
`Time...exploded into life.`
`Both of them...fell through the courtyard.`
`One drifted down.`
`The other tumbled through the air.`
`Then, there was a soft sound and a dull thud.`
`...The first was the sound of Battler landing gently in the courtyard.`
`The second was the sound of Dlanor crashing down.`
`After crouching down for a while,`
` ......Battler slowly stood up.`
`Though he had jumped down from the third floor, ...he had landed as lightly as though he had merely jumped over a fence...`
`"B-Battleeeeeeeeeeer......!!"`
`Beato leaned out of the study window, looking to see if the supposedly wingless Battler had landed safely.`
`"Beato!!`
` Come on, jump!!"`
`"Huh...?!"`
`"That window is our way out!`
` ...So jump!!`
` You aren't the kind of witch who can be locked up inside a closed room, right?!!"`
`The study was no longer a closed room.`
`She could jump from here, escape from here...!`
`By now, the closed room that had threatened to capture the witch and suffocate her...had been destroyed.`
`"...Y-Yes...!!`
` Y-You too, Kinzo...!"`
`"Go.`
` From the moment Battler showed his answer, my spirit had already escaped from this room."`
`Kinzo's form became a cloud of gold butterflies and disappeared.`
`The closed room barrier had dissolved, and the power that denies magic had scattered.`
`Beato ran towards the window.`
`...That was the only exit from the closed room of this witch hunt.`
`After glancing at the Chiester Sisters and the subordinates of the Inquisitor of Heresy,`
` she readied her wound-covered body and ran towards the window, just like Battler had done.`
`She looked like Cinderella running as she heard the bell toll.`
`"Th-There's no way we'll let you escape, Beatrice, Illusion of the Witch!!"`
`Erika flew at Beato, trying to latch on to Beato as she dashed,`
` but it was like trying to catch smoke, and she landed face first on the floor.`
`...There's no way a Human could catch a witch.`
`For one such as her, without love, even touching Beato was impossible...!`
`"Chiester Corps, shoot the witch! Shoot her dead!!"`
`"Alignment conflict. Unable to fire."`
`"Allow me to speak.`
` I have no barrier prepared that can block Battler's blue truth."`
`Both Chiester 00 and Gertrude spoke with unbelievably calm voices.`
`"N-No one can stop them?`
` Not Battler? Not Kinzo?`
` Not Beatrice?!`
` If these guys manage to escape, `
`...m-`
`my closed room, my theory...!!`
` I'm...`
`...the detective, `
`...Furudo...Erika...`
`kkggghhhaaaaaaaaaaaggghhgh!`
` Gyaaaaaaaaaaggghhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!"`
`Erika crouched, screaming and clutching at her head.`
`"The great Golden Witch isn't gonna be defeated by something like that geezer's grubby study!!`
` It's still just the first twilight!`
` I'll teach these newcomers that your game isn't that easy!!"`
`Just like Battler, Beato also...flew.`
`She drifted down through the rain treasure box world into Battler's chest.`
`...Battler caught her with both arms as though catching a feather from an angel.`
`It was like a knight catching a princess who had been locked up in a tower,`
` ......like a beautiful picture of a scene in some fairy tale...`
`".........Crap, I think I'm in love.`
` ...Are all the Ushiromiya Family Heads like this?"`
`"If you were to write down the unprecedented feats of Ushiromiya Kinzo, `
`......you would probably have an uproarious tale longer than all the grimoires in the study put together.`
` It seems the tale of the next Head will be worth writing down as well.`
` In fact, it already is being written.`
` It's already a very, very long tale.`
` ......Pu ku ku ku."`
`The demons giggled on top of the roof, holding umbrellas.`
`Then, they quietly looked down over the two in the courtyard.`
`"H-Hahhahhahahahahahaha...`
` ...You're...not bad at all..."`
`"I guess all your games've toughened me up."`
`In shock, Beato...actually praised Battler as he held her in his arms.`
`Battler laughed in his usual carefree way...`
`"......Th-`
`This is......`
`impossible, ...impossible!!"`
`Erika looked down from the window and clenched her teeth, still clutching at her head.`
`Still holding Beato in his arms, Battler grinned back.`
`"Erika."`
`"...Wh-What...?"`
`"I'm not giving the riddle of the Golden Witch to you.`
` I'll solve it.`
` ...That riddle belongs to the two of us.`
` Right, Beato?"`
`"I-Indeed...!`
` My riddle is...yo......yo......"`
`"Yo?"`
`When Battler laughed evilly, Beato's face turned uncharacteristically red,`
` but even so, she spoke while laughing loudly.`
`"My riddle is...`
`yo...yours...`
`...yours alone...!! Ushiromiya Battler!`
` I won't let anyone else solve it...!!"`
`"Heheh, listen to her, saying something like that...!!"`
`Battler snorted, amused that Beato had said something so out of character.`
`And, still holding Beato in his arms, he spun around in a kind of waltz.`
`The falling gems of rain celebrated their victory over this trial...`
`"......He jumped down from the third story...? ...And he's all right...?`
` He jumped down...and escaped from the closed room...?`
` Th-This is ridiculous... This isn't reasoning...... It's insane!!"`
`If Battler had at least been seriously injured and writhing in the mud,`
` ...Erika might still have had some ground to stand on.`
`She might've been able to claim that Kinzo couldn't have jumped down with his old body and gotten away unscathed.`
`...However, Battler stood calmly in the courtyard, looking up at Erika with the dignity of the victor.`
`"Everyone, I...I'll ask one more time.`
` ...This is...impossible, right?`
` There's no way a Human could jump down from a third story and land unharmed...!!`
` Isn't that right, everyone...?!`
` Much less Kinzo-san jumping down from the third floor at his age!! This isn't reasoning!!"`
`Erika tried to get everyone's agreement and somehow turn things around,`
` ...but their responses were no different from how they'd been a short while ago.`
`"No, it would be possible for Kinzo-san."`
`"I wouldn't put it past Father."`
`"This is Father we're talking about..."`
`"There's plenty of crazy stories about that man.`
` Somethin' like this wouldn't surprise me a bit."`
`"Wh-What......?!!`
` I-Is there something wrong with your heads, with your brains, people?!?!"`
`"At any rate, ...it looks like your closed room argument wasn't perfect."`
`"Ah, ...gggrrrrrrrrggh...!!"`
`Not only the servants, but the family members also agreed.`
`They all agreed that there was nothing strange about Kinzo jumping down from a third floor window.`
`J-Just who in the world...is this Ushiromiya Kinzo person...?!!`
`"Well, I'll give you 60 points...`
` Kinzo would've done it with a bit more flash in his younger days.`
` It needs some more tweaking."`
`"Oh, and how much should it be tweaked?"`
`"W-Well...`
` Umm, ...h-he might have jumped down with me in h-his arms!"`
`"Got it.`
` Next time, I'll do that."`
`"...I-If you think you can, just you try..."`
`Beato's voice grew very faint, and she gulped.`
`Then, her body suddenly crumbled away into a cloud of gold butterflies.`
`That was because many people had rushed up to the window, and she was being bathed with gazes filled with the anti-magic toxin.`
`Beato's body became invisible to them and melted into the air...`
`So to their eyes, it appeared that Battler was standing all alone out in the courtyard...`
`"Battleeeeeeeeer!! You okaaaaaaaaay?!!"`
`"I-It looks like he's fine...! Thank goodness!"`
`"...I have LOST...`
` ...In that case, for the benefit of those people in the study as well, ...deliver your final blow to ME.`
` Use your final blue truth to show how Kinzo escaped from the closed room of that STUDY."`
`There was no pain in Dlanor's expression.`
`...Pleasure and pain never showed up on her face in the first place.`
`However, she was only barely able to rise to her feet, using her longsword as a crutch, so it was easy to guess at how heavily she'd been damaged.`
`And, despite her lack of an expression, you could tell that this was a loss she could accept.`
`Battler and Dlanor turned to face each other.`
`"Here I go."`
`"Yes, COME.`
` ........."`
`As though readying herself, Dlanor quietly closed her eyes, but she still stood tall and maintained her air of dignity.`
`"This is my blue truth."`
`The blue power gathered.`
`...Battler slowly approached Dlanor.`
`Then, he faced the rainy sky and yelled out the blue truth.`
`"#5decffUshiromiya Kinzo escaped from the study through the window when Aunt Natsuhi couldn't see him.`
` Aunt Natsuhi didn't notice and locked the window.`
` In this way, Aunt Natsuhi saw Grandfather go to bed, yet Grandfather was able to escape from the study without contradicting the lock of the window or the door sealed by the receipt.`
` I have just demonstrated that it was physically possible for him to escape.`
` Therefore, this battle is over!!#ffffff"`
`The blue wedge flashed through the courtyard along with a blue bolt of lightning,`
` roaring down towards Dlanor's forehead as she stared up at the sky.`
`".........!"`
`"......Beato's game isn't forgiving.`
` It's doubtful whether the classic patterns of the mystery genre even work here.`
` Your swordsmanship isn't bad, but you ought to be a bit more flexible in your thinking."`
`...A massive blue wedge that looked like a pillar...was above Dlanor's forehead...`
`...and had stopped with its tip just slightly touching her.`
`It didn't run her through.`
`...It made no mark larger than being poked with a pencil.`
`When Battler snapped his fingers, the blue wedge shattered and became a shower of translucent gems...`
`...no, drops of rain that poured down over the courtyard.`
`Dlanor sat down in a dazed sort of way...`
`Amidst the thunder and rain, `
`the Successor to the Ushiromiya Family Headship faced the people staring down from the study...and spread his arms wide...`
`"......Welcome to Beato's and my game.`
` Welcome, Furudo Erika...!"`
`"Ahhaha, ......`
` ......Ahhahhahha, kahhahhahhahha...!!`
` How amusing, Ushiromiya Battler...!`
` <Good>, truly <good>...!!`
` Ahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` I'll chew it to bits, `
`this riddle of the witch...!!`
` All the way deep into its guts while it's still alive!!`
` Ahhahhahhahhahhahahahahehyahhahahahha!!"`
`Battler and Beato both looked calmly up at Erika, who couldn't contain her evil laugh...`
`"Ohhohohohohohohoho, ooohohohohohohohohyahhyaaaahhh!!`
` Ah, this is good stuff!!`
` Erika, that was so laaaame, ehihhahhahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"Nnn...nnnggyaaah......`
` L-Lady Bernkastel, `
`...m-my apolo...gies..."`
`"That look on your face.`
` ...It's so incredibly laughable that I'd like to smash it and put a frame around it.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*, my double is so...pathetic, pathetic, lame, lame, heheheheheheheehehehehihhhihihihihihhihahahyhahahahahahaha!!"`
`Bathed in the sneers of Bernkastel, a being who was like a mother to her,`
` ...Erika was so ashamed that it looked as though she'd chew her lower lip to pieces...`
`"...Someday, ...I'll definitely...`
`...definitely......`
` Gwaaaaaaahhh...!!`
` Ushiromiya Battler...`
` ...Beatrice...`
` ...Ushiromiya...`
`......Natsuhiiiiiiiiiii...`
`...iihhihihihihihihihihi...!!`
` Hihyahhahahahahahahaahahaaah!!"`
`"This riddle is ours.`
` ...I won't let anyone get in the way, ...Beatrice!!"`
`"...Y-Yes!"`
`In the Golden Land, the quiet rain...just kept on falling.`
`In the arbor...sat the sad witch whose eyes had lost their glint...and Battler.`
`Virgilia could also be seen there.`
`...She sat next to Beato, knitting quietly.`
`Lambdadelta's game had passed the climax of the first twilight, and they were taking a short break.`
`Gazing out at the golden rose garden soaked with rain,`
` ...Battler considered the present, what was to come, and what had happened so far...`
`To Battler, the act of thinking was itself a battle.`
`Even with the game stopped and Beato unable to speak, ...he could still keep on fighting.`
`...Virgilia suddenly stopped her knitting.`
`Battler noticed it too.`
`...Because, though none should have been able to visit this rose garden, she had noticed a silhouette approaching.`
`"......That's unusual.`
` Not many people are capable of reaching this place."`
`"It's her........."`
`That silhouette, ...which walked amidst the quietly falling rain without so much as an umbrella,`
` ......was Dlanor.`
`"...That was a spectacular garden MAZE.`
` A splendid way to enjoy the ROSES."`
`"Why......are you here?"`
`"It's been some time, <Mrs> Beatrice.`
` ...No wait, now it's <Mrs> Virgilia, is it NOT?"`
`"Long time no see, Dlanor.`
` ...Come over here.`
` We aren't ones to leave a guest out in the rain."`
`"..............."`
`"Don't worry.`
` She hasn't come to fight."`
`"...Do you know her?"`
`"She's one of my old friends from heaven.`
` ...This really takes me back."`
`"That it DOES.`
` <Mrs> Virgilia possesses a deep knowledge in Heavenly STUDIES.`
` I have often argued with her over INTERPRETATIONS."`
`"Ho ho ho...`
` My many intellectual adventures with you were quite enjoyable.`
` I'd like to do it again sometime."`
`"Yes.`
` Let's do it again SOMETIME.`
` I'd love to fight with you AGAIN."`
`They used the word 'fight', but it didn't sound like they meant anything unpleasant by it.`
`It sounded like something old chess rivals would say to each other.`
`Unlike Beato, it seems Virgilia always behaved properly and courteously,`
` so she had many friends in various other worlds, including both heaven and the demon world.`
`Surprisingly, Dlanor was one of them......`
`Dlanor, who had crossed swords with 'me' just a short while ago,`
` ducked her head like someone taking shelter from a sudden rain and sat in the seat Virgilia pointed out, like a guest.`
`"...Is there any type of black tea you would prefer?"`
`"ANYTHING.`
` ...Any tea you make is SUPERB."`
`"Then how about some Darjeeling?`
` ...Battler, Beato, would you like some more?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` Beato and I would like a refill.`
` ...Right?"`
`"..............."`
`As usual, Beato didn't answer,`
` ...but if you quietly gave her a cup, she would sip it from time to time.`
`There was still some black tea left in that cup, but it had already chilled.`
`So Battler asked for a refill for Beato as well...`
`"...I have heard the RUMORS.`
` ...How pitiable that Beatrice, the Endless Witch famous for her cruelty,`
` has been reduced to THIS."`
`"She's no longer participating in the game.`
` ...Lambdadelta is the one controlling the Beato that's on the game board."`
`"I KNOW.`
` ...However, she is the original master of this WORLD.`
` And you are the proper guest, invited by that MASTER.`
` That is why I have come to pay my RESPECTS."`
`On the game board, Beato and I met Dlanor.`
`But those were the game pieces of those witches.`
`They weren't Beato and me ourselves.`
`"Is that why you went out of your way to greet Battler-kun and Beato here...?`
` ...I see you're as conscientious as ever."`
`"That is my way of doing THINGS.`
` ......Greetings, <Mister> Battler.`
` I am Dlanor A. Knox.`
` ...We play opposing roles, but it is a pleasure to meet YOU."`
`"...Sure.`
` I'm Ushiromiya Battler.`
` Pleased to meet you."`
`"Greetings, <Miss> Beatrice.`
` I am Dlanor A. Knox."`
`"..............."`
`"...Beato,`
` she's saying hi.`
` ........."`
`"............"`
`".........`
`...She says 'welcome'."`
`"Thank you very MUCH,`
` <Miss> Beatrice."`
`The witch and the Inquisitor of Heresy, whose job it was to hunt witches,`
` greeted each other around a tea table surrounded by the aroma of black tea.`
`...It was a strange sight.`
`Virgilia made gold butterflies sprout from the palms of her hands and transformed them into a teapot and a can of tea leaves.`
`...It was a very witch-like way to make tea.`
`Of course, she actually was a witch, so that scene wasn't particularly bizarre in itself.`
`...Though I was a bit concerned about whether Dlanor, an Inquisitor of Heresy, could watch such a spectacle.`
`"...Do not WORRY.`
` I am not so boorish as to complain about how my tea is SERVED."`
`"Even though the tea's being made with magic...?"`
`"...There is a tea set hiding in the shadows, and <Mrs> Virgilia is making us tea with it in SECRET.`
` We interpret or judge that it was 'made with MAGIC', and it is written as such in the TALE.`
` ...That interpretation is allowed by Knox's 9th."`
`"Oh my...`
` I do believe the interpretation of the 9th is such a delicate problem that it's viewed as a taboo, even in the Great Court...`
` Even though it's just a personal opinion, if it became known that the Head Inquisitor of Heresy said such a thing, you might be sacked."`
`"No matter what interpretation I record it with,`
` there are no lies in the taste of your TEA.`
` Therefore, I do not worry about how it was PREPARED."`
`".........Aha..."`
`Though she looked cold, ...she was a surprisingly tactful person.`
`...If Dlanor were to deny that the black tea had been prepared with magic, this magic would surely be crushed in a instant.`
`However, the possibility had been presented that a tea set existed and had been used to make the tea normally,`
` so the fact that Virgilia had made tea was, in the end, undisputed.`
`"Magic that hides the result in darkness is EVIL.`
` I will not permit IT.`
` However, magic that enshrouds the process is not necessarily EVIL.`
` My foe is evil itself, not MAGIC."`
`"I see.`
` ...The important thing is that you're being served some tea,`
` so it's just common courtesy to avoid complaining about how it was made."`
`...That's right.`
`When someone makes tea for you, it's common courtesy to be grateful.`
`There's nothing elegant about pushing your way into the kitchen and criticizing how they brew it.`
`"You don't invite your guests into the kitchen.`
` And when you set the table, you should adorn it beautifully in the spirit of hospitality.`
` ...Here you go. Careful, it's hot."`
`"Thank YOU.`
` I would like some sugar and MILK."`
`"*giggle*`
` You still can't drink it straight?"`
`"I'm a KID.`
` It must be SWEET."`
`"......So then, `
`...is magic...`
`a gentle...`
`...lie?"`
`"The word 'lie' makes it sound bad.`
` The word 'embellishment' is probably more fitting."`
`"When giving a child candy, you can take a crumpled up one out of your pocket,`
` or you can use some clever sleight of hand to take the candy OUT.`
` The impression given by each method varies GREATLY."`
`"Well yeah, it'd look cooler if you took it out with a little magic trick."`
`"WRONG.`
` There is meaning in the fact that the result--giving them candy--has been adorned to be even more beautiful and FUN."`
`"...Think of when you give Maria-chan a candy.`
` There's a huge difference between taking it out of your pocket to give to her...`
`and slipping it into her pocket `
`and saying a fairy gave it to her for being such a good girl."`
`"In my opinion, it would be boorish to then question everyone about their alibis and pinpoint who it was that slipped it into her POCKET.`
` The important thing is the result: that the girl received the candy and REJOICED.`
` And it is significant that it was embellished `
`in a way that made her REJOICE."`
`"...That's surprising.`
` When you showed up, I got the feeling you'd deny anything that went by the name of magic."`
`"That is how I act in my capacity as an Inquisitor of HERESY.`
` It is my JOB.`
` However, when I am away from my job, I don't enjoy being quite so cold-HEARTED."`
`"So, you set your personal feelings aside when on duty?`
` ...You do it well."`
`"As an Inquisitor of Heresy, hunting witches is my JOB.`
` ...However, I personally find witches PITIABLE.`
` Despite this, I carry out judgment mercilessly as an INQUISITOR."`
`"...In the end, that doesn't change the fact that I sentence witches to DEATH.`
` ...In the end, my pity is nothing more than a useless EMBELLISHMENT.`
` Whether I have it or not, nothing CHANGES.`
` So, it would be better if I DIDN'T..."`
`"......That's not true.`
` Even if the ends are the same, what's in your heart makes a big difference."`
`"...Your mother's cookies are clearly more delicious than those made by a good pastry shop.`
` ...That's because you know that they were made with heart."`
`"That's right.`
` ......Even if the result looks the same, `
`...whether or not there's warmth behind the feelings of whoever gave it to you makes a big difference..."`
`"Is that SO...?`
` ......Whether I have a heart or not is completely MEANINGLESS."`
`Dlanor's gaze fell to her cup, a little sadly...`
`"That's not true."`
`"........."`
`"After hearing all this, I've changed my view of you a bit.`
` ...And that's why I'm certain the heart isn't meaningless."`
`Virgilia was a little surprised to hear the words she should have said coming from Battler's mouth.`
`After all, understanding the 'heart' is the first step towards finding the essence of magic.`
`By now, ...perhaps Battler has unconsciously started to understand, bit by bit,`
` ...the essence of Beato, the essence of witches...`
`and the very first essence of all, ...magic.`
`Whether you want to become a witch or vanquish them...`
`...The very first step is learning about magic.`
`Virgilia was sure that she'd felt this faint change within Battler...`
`"...As for that last fight, thank you very MUCH.`
` I am grateful for the mercy you showed me at the very END."`
`"That 'me' wasn't me.`
` ...Lambdadelta was controlling him."`
`I joined in on the 5th game partway through.`
`I still haven't participated 'at this point in time'.`
`So until I do join in, the piece 'me' is probably being controlled by Bernkastel or Lambdadelta.`
`"...Just what kind of whim's guiding them?`
` Trying to make it look all cool...`
` They made me look like some kind of knight coming to save Beato."`
`"Lady Lambdadelta wants both witches and Humans to be in balance, resulting in a draw.`
` ......With Erika's appearance, the scales tipped strongly in the favor of the Human side,`
` so she manipulated the tale in a way that supports Beato."`
`"I am aware of THAT.`
` However, pieces cannot do things that are impossible for THEM.`
` And they specialize in actions appropriate to their original PERSONALITY.`
` ...Therefore, that was certainly something that you...that Battler was capable OF.`
` That is why I am grateful to YOU."`
`"...It feels a bit weird to be praised when I didn't actually do anything.`
` ...After the game continues a bit more, I'll probably regain control of my piece.`
` Not sure I'll be able to go easy on you then."`
`"It's the same with ME.`
` The next time we cross swords, I won't hold BACK."`
`"Bring it on. I'll be your opponent.`
` Come at me with all you've got."`
`"I PROMISE. With everything I've GOT."`
`...Dlanor, huh?`
`I'd thought she was an emotionless killer doll without a heart,`
` ...but maybe she actually is pretty approachable.`
`...Though of course, neither of us will show any mercy when fighting on the game board.`
`For a while, we gazed at the rain-drenched rose garden as we quietly enjoyed our tea.`
`"......There is one thing I must apologize FOR."`
`With a sudden sigh, Dlanor muttered something.`
`"What is it?`
` ...If it's about that fight a short while ago, it's already over.`
` We both fought with everything we had.`
` The outcome was just luck of the draw."`
`"No, it wasn't luck of the DRAW.`
` ...I couldn't just let it be, so I came here to APOLOGIZE."`
`"...What are you talking about...?"`
`".........`
`......You're saying you threw the match, aren't you?"`
`Virgilia spoke softly, without hesitating in her knitting.`
`"......That is CORRECT,`
` ...<Mister> Battler."`
`"That <Mister>'s really awkward.`
` Just Battler works fine."`
`"Battler,`
` ...I APOLOGIZE.`
` We did not give it everything we HAD."`
`"......I know.`
` ...#ff0000'Kinzo is dead at the starting time for all games'#ffffff.`
` Beato has already spoken that truth.`
` ...In that battle, Battler-kun could only have achieved a draw at best.`
` He most certainly had no chance at all of winning."`
`"...You're right.`
` ...If you just say that, the whole fight's already over.`
` ...Why didn't you use that red?`
` Don't tell me it was because of a stalemate or something like that."`
`"#ff0000Knox's 2nd.`
` It is forbidden for supernatural agencies to be employed as a detective TECHNIQUE.#ffffff`
` We cannot use that red truth DIRECTLY.`
` However, I gave Cornelia, who was protecting the window, `
`the red truth that #ff0000'the window was never opened after it started RAINING'#ffffff."`
`"Boom.`
` ...That's checkmate.`
` ......Why didn't that girl use that trump card...?"`
`".........!!`
` Th-This is.........agh.`
` A-Allow me to speak...!`
` There is no way to defeat my red!`
` Know that your wish will not be granted...!!"`
`Though she had fought calmly up until that point,`
` ...she quickly got flustered when I dashed forwards.`
`I'd thought she'd been frightened by my sudden attack, ...but the truth was different.`
`Even though she held a trump card that could completely repel me, `
`......she suddenly became unable to use it, and hesitated.`
`"I don't UNDERSTAND.`
` All of a sudden, in that instant, use of that trump card became FORBIDDEN.`
` Once we lost that, your victory was GUARANTEED."`
`"......The Game Master, Lady Lambdadelta, probably interfered."`
`"That bastard...`
` ......So in the end, that whole fight was a farce in the palm of Lambdadelta's hand.`
` She made 'us' play out that entire act according to her script."`
`"I do not like IT.`
` However, since you told me to fight with everything I had, I had no choice but to let you KNOW.`
` ...Please forgive ME."`
`"Still, even though you lost your trump card, you kept on fighting all-out with your remaining cards.`
` I don't believe anyone could find fault with what you did."`
`"...That's right.`
` ...On the contrary, you should be mad at Lambdadelta for butting in."`
`"#ff0000'Kinzo doesn't exist'#ffffff should already be an established FACT.`
` Lady Lambdadelta and Lady Bernkastel should know this WELL.`
` And yet, they are both leaving room for Kinzo to exist as they continue in this GAME.`
` ...It's almost as though the two are conspiring to prevent Kinzo's existence from being DENIED."`
`"In other words, they intentionally let 'Grandfather' escape...?"`
`"YES.`
` They must be after SOMETHING."`
`".........That is a bit odd.`
` ...Lady Lambdadelta and Lady Bernkastel should always be in opposition, unless the witch side is in a superior position.`
` ...It's hard to imagine that those two are conspiring together at a time like this..."`
`"I can't help but think that they have some sort of wicked GOAL.`
` I came here because I wanted you to know THAT."`
`"...So, ...you came all the way here to tell us something like that?"`
`"YES.`
` ...Which means that my business here is FINISHED.`
` I think I will leave NOW.`
` The game will probably resume SHORTLY.`
` I must aid Erika during the rest of this GAME."`
`Dlanor gulped down the last of her black tea and stood up.`
`"Next is the battle of the second TWILIGHT.`
` At that point, I will once again raise my merciless LONGSWORD.`
` ...So I ask the same of YOU, Battler.`
` Show no mercy towards ME."`
`"...I understand.`
` ...If I went easy on you, I'd have my own head smashed in."`
`"On the game board, I am nothing more than Lady Bernkastel's piece and Furudo Erika's SUBORDINATE.`
` In the future, we will probably stand across from each other as opponents many TIMES.`
` ...However, my heart is always NEUTRAL.`
` ...No, ...please forget THAT.`
` ...Such has no meaning considering the relationship between the two of US."`
`"It does.`
` ...There's no doubt you're a fearsome opponent, but you don't piss me off anymore.`
` Though that Erika totally pisses me off."`
`"GOOD.`
` Furudo Erika also pisses me OFF."`
`"Heh, hahahahaha."`
`Dlanor's expression finally softened slightly.`
`...At the very last moment, it felt as though we finally understood each other.`
`"Furudo Erika is a very evil ENTITY.`
` ...She's lost face with her recent defeat and is burning with a desire for REVENGE.`
` Even I don't know what she is PLANNING.`
` However, it can't be anything GOOD.`
` Please take CARE."`
`"...Just knowing she's Bernkastel's piece tells me I can't let my guard down."`
`Dlanor nodded as though satisfied, left the overhang of the arbor and walked out into the rain.`
`"...To think I'd serve as a subordinate to such EVIL...`
` ......Why was I called to this WORLD?"`
`Dlanor let out a small sigh.`
`'Pieces' can do nothing except fulfill the function they have been given.`
`And that function is given to them by the one who controls them.`
`...She probably can't disobey 'her' own player, Bernkastel.`
`".........Lady Bernkastel may be the one who called you here.`
` However, the one who let you into this world is Beato.`
` ...If this child didn't wish it, you would never have been able to make it through the garden maze and arrive here.`
` ...Right, ...Beato...?"`
`"..............."`
`".........`
`...<Miss> Beatrice,`
` what is it that you want from ME?`
` ...I do hope that I can help you in some way, though I may be a subordinate of EVIL..."`
`She spoke to Beato...but of course, there was no response.`
`After bowing once more in thanks for the black tea,`
` ...Dlanor disappeared off into the rainy rose garden...`
`"So, no one can reach this Golden Land if Beato doesn't want them to?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...This child is the one who called Dlanor here."`
`"............"`
`"......So, ...Beato called her here so I could meet with her..."`
`...However, `
`I know of a person who reached this place despite Beato's wishes.`
`It's Ange.`
`...In the last game, Ange reached this place by herself, `
`...even though she was an uninvited guest.`
`Was that...`
`...also something...`
`...Beato wished for...?`
`"I am here, you are here.`
` Beato is here.`
` Dlanor was invited here.`
` ...All of these things happened because this child wanted them to.`
` ...Even the bit of time you and Dlanor spent together drinking tea."`
`"............"`
`"...Beato,`
` what was I......supposed to learn from her...?`
` Does it have something to do with finding your heart...and letting you rest in peace...?"`
`Dlanor A. Knox.`
`The natural enemy of witches.`
`An Inquisitor of Heresy.`
`...A vanguard of mystery...who denies fantasy.`
`Is she here to help...`
`...by gouging out your heart...`
`...and choking the life out of you......?`
`...............`
`"Please stand.`
` On one leg."`
`"............"`
`Cornelia slowly got up and stood on one leg, as she had been ordered.`
`Her hands were clasped behind her back.`
`...Because she had been ordered to do so.`
`Then, with a *thump*,`
` Erika pushed her from behind with both hands.`
`Cornelia landed on the floor face first with a *thud*.`
`"Please stand.`
` On one leg."`
`"............"`
`Cornelia rose shakily.`
`Then, once again, she stood on one leg as she had been ordered.`
`She had been ordered not to hold her ground.`
`So she had fallen on her face over and over again.`
`She had barely managed to protect her nose, but after smashing against the floor so many times, her face was bright red.`
`She wasn't shedding any tears.`
`No, she couldn't shed them.`
`Because she was forbidden to do even that...`
`"Please stand.`
` On one leg."`
`"............"`
`*thump* `
`*thud*.`
`"Please stand.`
` On one leg."`
`*thump* `
`*thud*.`
`*thump* `
`*thud*.`
`*thump*`
`.........*thud*.`
`Erika repeated this falling torture over and over again.`
`At times like this, Erika hated counting things.`
`So she decided that, once she ran out of fingers to count the number of times, she would just repeat it until she lost interest.`
`However, Erika's main redeeming feature was that she never lost interest in anything,`
` so the torture continued on and on...`
`...Erika didn't know why Cornelia had been unable to fully protect the window.`
`So the whole time since then,`
` ...she had placed all the blame of their loss on her.`
`"...Please, allow me to speak.`
` Forgive Cornelia.`
` She has already repented enough..."`
`"Oh, is that true?`
` Then please take her place from now on."`
`"...G-Gertrude has done nothing wrong..."`
`"Gertrude,`
` ......please stand.`
` On one leg.`
` Clasp your hands behind you."`
`"............"`
`Gertrude followed the order...`
`...and clasped her hands behind her back, standing on one leg.`
`"You mustn't resist or hold your ground.`
` You are not permitted to bend your knees.`
` You are not permitted to shed any tears.`
` Got it?"`
`"......As you wish..."`
`"Gertrude........."`
`Erika made a show of walking behind Gertrude.`
`She even enjoyed making her wonder when she'd push...`
`At that time, Gertrude and Cornelia burst with a bright light and disappeared.`
`...Because Dlanor, who must have returned at some point, had sent them back to the heavens for the time being.`
`Erika, who'd had her fun spoiled, gave Dlanor an openly malicious look...`
`"<Miss> Erika,`
` I will bear the punishment for all my subordinates' faults, as their SUPERIOR.`
` I ask that you let them GO."`
`"......<No, thank you>.`
` Punishment only works because it causes pain.`
` ...There's nothing interesting about an unfeeling doll girl that I can't leave a single injury on."`
`Erika slowly grabbed hold of the back of Dlanor's hair, tugging unrelentingly.`
`Dlanor's neck tilted upwards, creaking.`
`"...You may not cause a physical injury, but you do INJURE."`
`"Hmph.`
` As if you had a heart that could get injured.`
` You lowly witch-hunting murder doll.`
` ......Are you trying to talk back to me?`
` Me, the envoy and double of the Great Lady Bernkastel...?!"`
`"......NO."`
`"I got scolded by Lady Bernkastel because you guys are useless...!!`
` Never fail so lamely again...!`
` Un-der-sta-nd...?!"`
`The hair she had grabbed was stretched back as far as it would go, along with more creaking...`
`This didn't cause Dlanor any physical pain,`
` but she could clearly feel Erika's ill will.`
`"......My APOLOGIES.`
` Forgive ME."`
`"Filth."`
`With a sound like a bowstring being cut, ...several of Dlanor's hairs were pulled out.`
`Then, Erika waved her hand about as though trying to brush off something dirty that had gotten stuck to it.`
`"Well, that's okay.`
` I'm done.`
` ......My anger's finally settled down, and my little gray cells are tingling again.`
` ...Please call those two useless people back and reconstruct the crime scene.`
` Let's start the reasoning game."`
`"UNDERSTOOD.`
` ......Gertrude, Cornelia."`
`""As you wish.""`
`The two of them reappeared behind Dlanor...`
`and reconstructed the crime scene for Erika, the one who had just been tormenting them...`
`"...Kinzo's disappearance was nothing more than a bonus round after the first twilight.`
` Let's start investigating the first twilight itself.`
` ...But before we do that,`
` did you realize we were actually given a riddle before the murders even occurred?"`
`"YES.`
` The letter with the mark of the One-Winged Eagle, which appeared at 24:00 last night along with a knock by some PERSON."`
`"That's right.`
` The tale creates the illusion that the events of that instant would be impossible for any Human,`
` making it seem like an unknown witch exists.`
` ...Let's start by crushing this Illusion of the Witch.`
` We'll first check the situation in the dining hall last night when the letter was delivered."`
`"UNDERSTOOD.`
` Gertrude, Cornelia.`
` Reconstruct last night's family conference in the dining hall."`
`""As you wish.""`
`The family conference last night was held with the adult relatives and Battler.`
`And partway through, the servants had arrived to serve tea.`
`"Let's check everyone's location at the instant the letter arrived.`
` How did that go, again?"`
`"Please, allow me to speak.`
` #ff0000Before the family conference, Erika, George, Jessica, Maria, Nanjo, Gohda, and Kumasawa left the mansion and moved to the guesthouse.#ffffff"`
`"Please, allow me to speak.`
` #ff0000Of those who remain, only Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji were in the second floor corridor,`
` while all others were in the dining hall.#ffffff"`
`"Because the family conference was proceeding and the mansion was completely locked,`
` all other humans were unable to enter the MANSION."`
`"Aha.`
` That'd mean there was no one inside the mansion who could've knocked and placed the letter there, right?`
` Heheheh."`
`"YES.`
` The witch side will probably claim that the one who did this...was the witch who wrote the letter, Beatrice."`
`"Ridiculous.`
` A stupid trick.`
` ......There's no guarantee that the letter was placed there at exactly 24:00.`
` It's only sensible to consider that it might've been placed there earlier."`
`"Just a few minutes before the letter was discovered, Shannon and Kanon came in to serve TEA.`
` When they entered, multiple witnesses confirmed that there was nothing suspicious like a letter in the hallway."`
`"#5decffMaybe one of those not in the parlor: Krauss, Natsuhi or Genji,`
` simply saw their chance right after that and placed the letter there.`
` #ffffffNo wait, it should be possible for the people who supposedly went to the guesthouse too."`
`"#5decffWe heard that the mansion was locked and that no one outside could get in,`
` but if someone pretended to have gone to the guesthouse and instead hid inside the mansion,`
` it would've been perfectly possible for them to place the letter there.#ffffff"`
`"Allow me to speak.`
` Blue truth, valid."`
`"In that case, the problem is the 'KNOCK'.`
` Unlike the letter, someone would have to exist there at the instant of the KNOCK."`
`"I see, so this is the so-called proof that a person who shouldn't be there--a witch--existed?`
` This is just so ridiculous.`
` Do they think I, Furudo Erika, would surrender to something like that?`
` *giggle*giggle*, ahhahaha!"`
`"#5decffFirst off, we can doubt whether the knock was even something hitting the door to the dining hall at all.`
` For example, there may be a certain pillar on the second floor which, because of how the mansion's constructed, `
`makes a noise when struck that gets transmitted down the pillar and that sounds just like a knock on the door to people in the dining hall.#ffffff"`
`"#5decffOr they could have misheard some random sound to be a knock, and they all misconstrued it in the same way.`
` Or the recorded sound of a knock could have been stealthily replayed from a tape,`
` which might have been carefully set up to go off at exactly that time.#ffffff"`
`"Either way, I can think of many ways to make them hear a knock,`
`even if no one was on the other side of the door...!`
` How is that? My master!`
` How is my reasoning...?!!"`
`"......That's what she says, ...so what do you think?"`
`"Well, it looks like your cute piece gave it her all thinking up these blue truths, `
`so I guess I'll be nice and give out a few reds♪"`
`I guess I'll start with the letter.`
`We have both the knock made when the bell of the large clock rang out 24:00...`
`And the letter sitting there in an envelope bearing the One-Winged Eagle crest when the door was opened.`
`It's so obvious to suspect that the people who weren't in the parlor secretly placed the letter there, right?`
`#ff0000Krauss, Natsuhi and Genji did not even touch that letter!#ffffff`
`"...Oho?`
` Then, `
`#5decffwhen Shannon and Kanon came in to serve tea, who was the last Human to enter the dining hall...?`
` Let's say it was Kanon.`
` Wouldn't it be easy if Kanon, the last person in, secretly dropped the letter there when he closed the door?#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000Not a single person in the dining hall...no, there's a simpler way to say it.`
` Among all those inside the mansion at 24:00,`
` not a single person placed that letter in the corridor.#ffffff"`
`"So, you can't say that no one touched it?"`
`"Obviously.`
` They 'touched it when they picked it up'.`
` Of course I couldn't say that none of them touched it."`
`"I see.`
` Then let's interpret it this way: `
`#5decffSomeone who existed outside of the mansion at 24:00 placed a letter somewhere other than the hallway beforehand.`
` Then, it was moved by some means and ended up 'placed in the hallway'.#ffffff"`
`"#5decffJust as an example, let's say it was stuck to the bottom of the serving cart the servants were pushing.`
` It was simply glued there in a way that would make it come unstuck after a certain amount of time.`
` When it eventually fell off, it became 'the letter left behind by a witch' who shouldn't have existed.`
` In other words, this is a classic trick `
`where the true sender gives themselves an alibi by making the letter appear at a different time.#ffffff"`
`"Allow me to speak.`
` Blue truth, valid."`
`"In other words, the fact that it landed just outside the dining hall door was just the culprit's good luck.`
` At worst, it might have happened in the kitchen, the corridor, or even inside the dining hall."`
`"...Oh, <good>!`
` If it had happened inside the dining hall, that would've been even more wonderful.`
` Within everyone's sight, a letter would suddenly appear on the floor.`
` And that wouldn't even violate a red truth saying 'no one in the closed room of the dining hall touched the letter unexpectedly'!"`
`"Well DONE.`
` If the letter was stuck to the bottom of the serving cart, then anyone could be the CULPRIT."`
`"That might work okay regarding the letter.`
` However, will that same type of argument apply to the knock as well?`
` Let's try this again, shall we?"`
`"......Please, go ahead."`
`"#ff0000Neither Krauss nor Natsuhi nor Genji knocked!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000This isn't the limited meaning of them knocking on the door, okay?`
` It means they didn't use a pillar to transmit the sound or push the play button on a cassette tape they'd recorded or create that knock sound by any means!`
` Of course, this applies to direct, indirect, intentional, coincidental, and unintentional means!#ffffff"`
`"This wedge has already been knocked in, but I'll repeat it.`
` #5decffMaybe someone other than Krauss, Natsuhi, or Genji made that knock,`
` or else a sound that could be misidentified as a knock.#ffffff"`
`"Please, allow me to speak.`
` Let it be known that #ff0000at 24:00, excepting Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji in the second floor corridor and all of the people in the dining hall, `
`no Humans existed inside the mansion#ffffff."`
`"Please, allow me to speak.`
` #ff0000Let it be known that in addition to Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji, none of those in the dining hall knocked on that door.`
` In this sense, 'knock' includes all direct, indirect, intentional, unintentional, and coincidental events that could create a knocking sound.#ffffff"`
`A direct knock refers to someone literally hitting a door to make a knocking sound.`
`An intentional knock refers to someone creating a fake knocking sound to try and make it appear that someone knocked.`
`An unintentional knock refers to someone unintentionally creating a fake knocking sound.`
`A coincidental knock refers to some kind of coincidence creating a fake knocking sound.`
`"#ff0000In short, this means it was impossible for any character within the mansion to be the source of a knocking SOUND.`
` ...And 'any character' refers even to unobserved people that no one has noticed.#ffffff"`
`'Anyone who was in the mansion' would also include any unknown person X who had snuck into the mansion.`
`Therefore, it literally meant 'it was impossible for anyone inside the mansion to knock', `
`with no word play allowed.`
`"...I see.`
` No matter how much I toy with it, it's impossible for anyone except those in the guesthouse group to create the knocking sound, right?`
` Like me, for example.`
` #5decffWhat if I, Furudo Erika, recorded a knocking sound on a cassette tape...`
`and used some kind of secret contraption to start it playing at exactly 24:00?`
` Of course, I wasn't in the mansion at 24:00.#ffffff`
` There aren't any problems with this, are there?"`
`"No PROBLEMS.`
` However, though the knock did serve as a way of informing them about the letter on the other side of the door,`
` I do not think it would have worked if the letter had fallen ELSEWHERE."`
`If the trick in Erika's theory about the letter being stuck to the serving cart was accurate, `
`then the location that the letter fell was a matter of luck.`
`Because it had fortunately fallen near the door, the people in the dining hall noticed it due to the knock.`
`However, if the location it fell was a matter of chance, `
`...it might have landed in the far off kitchen or remained stuck even after they entered.`
`If that had happened, the knock would have been ignored as though they'd just imagined it.`
`In other words, the knock by itself wouldn't transmit any message at all.`
`It only made it appear as though someone had been there because it was paired with the letter.`
`In that case, the random location the letter fell to off the bottom of the serving cart couldn't be connected with the knock.`
`For the letter to be found thanks to the knock, it would have to be reliably positioned 'on the other side of the door'.`
`However, `
`it was announced in red that #ff0000no one in the mansion placed the letter in the hallway#ffffff.`
`"I'll reword that red about 'placing it' in the corridor a bit.`
` #ff0000No one in the mansion placed the letter in the hallway.`
` This includes doing so by all concepts, such as directly, indirectly, intentionally, coincidentally, and unintentionally.#ffffff"`
`"...For example, let's assume there was a device on the serving cart that 'drops the letter when it stops moving'.`
` In this case, you'd think they could predict that the cart would probably stop just once when those two knocked on the door to the dining hall,`
` and by doing so, they'd be cleverly making it so the letter drops right in front of the door."`
`"But even this doesn't work, okay?`
` The action of 'stopping the serving cart' would indirectly lead to 'placing the letter in the hallway'.`
` That would mean Shannon and Kanon, who were pushing the cart, had 'indirectly and unintentionally' placed the letter there!`
` So even this is no good!`
` Furthermore, setting it up so that the letter peeled off with the passage of time...`
`would mean that the people pushing the serving cart had 'coincidentally and unintentionally' placed the letter there.`
` Of course, this is also no good!!"`
`"Repeat it.`
` 'At 24:00, only Erika, George, Jessica, Maria, Nanjo, Gohda, and Kumasawa existed outside the mansion'."`
`What if someone in the dining hall 'didn't exist in the mansion' right at 24:00?`
` For example, what if they'd slipped out a window just before...?`
`With this wordplay, it might be possible to get around the red truth.`
`"...Repeat iiiiiit...?`
` Even though I'm nice enough to give you all this red for free? Aren't you being a bit greedy?`
` I'm not an idiot like Beato, `
`so I won't go around saying everything my opponent tells me to repeat..."`
`"......I'll give you a full body massage in a bath with marshmallows and konpeito sometime soon.`
` Enough to rub your skin off."`
`"Heheheheh, now you've gotta keep that promise. *slurp*!`
` ...Okay then, here's a freebie♪`
` I'll respond.`
` '#ff0000At 24:00, only Erika, George, Jessica, Maria, Nanjo, Gohda, and Kumasawa existed outside the mansion#ffffff'!"`
`In other words, no matter how much they struggled, those 8 people, including Erika, could not have existed inside the mansion, much less in front of the door.`
`And at the same time, no matter how much they struggled, those inside the mansion could not have existed outside the mansion.`
`"#5decffIn that case, the letter might've been stuck to the ceiling of the hallway instead of the serving cart.`
` The ceiling of the hallway is surprisingly high, so even if you just stuck it there out in the open, maybe no one would notice it.`
` This way, it would certainly fall in the corridor.`
` And you can slip by the red if someone outside the mansion did this!#ffffff`
` <Good> job, me...!"`
`"Please, allow me to speak.`
` #ff0000The letter never existed on the ceiling of the hallway.#ffffff"`
`"Please, allow me to speak.`
` #ff0000Know that the letter never touched the serving cart.#ffffff"`
`"......Wh-Who cares about that?!`
` Anyway, some Human outside the mansion used some kind of trick to place the letter there!!`
` If you try to use that letter and the knock to argue that Beatrice exists, it definitely won't work on Furudo Erika."`
`"Please, allow me to speak.`
` #ff0000It was impossible for anyone outside the mansion to influence anything inside the mansion after the family conference began.#ffffff"`
`"Then someone outside the mansion set up some kind of device before the family conference.`
` Something other than the ceiling or the serving cart!"`
`"Allow me to speak. Blue truth, invalid."`
`"Why...?!!`
` That's the only way, right?!`
` Someone outside the mansion used some kind of device other than the ceiling or the serving cart...!!"`
`"A-Allow me to speak.`
` Unless you can specify or theorize as to what that something might be, your blue truth will not be acknowledged."`
`"Allow me to speak.`
` All of Lady Erika's blue truths regarding the letter have been lost."`
`"They've all been lost, you say...?!`
` Watch your tongues a bit more, useless furniture!`
` If I can just think of that device, it's an instant checkmate...!`
` What do you mean A L L of them?! What do you mean my blue truth is invalid?!`
` How dare you...`
`say such a thing to me,`
` ...the detective,`
` ...Furudo Erika......?!!"`
`Erika's face twisted.`
`...These words that seemed to deny Erika...`
`no, Erika's reasoning...were the worst form of torture and humiliation for her.`
`"...<Miss> Erika,`
` why don't we postpone the riddle of the letter for NOW?`
` ...Your blue stake about 'someone outside the mansion playing it with a cassette tape' is still VALID.`
` If it was possible for sound, then perhaps it wasn't impossible for a letter as WELL."`
`As Erika made to grab and pull Gertrude's hair, Dlanor stopped her with those words.`
`"That's right, my blue truth regarding the knock is still valid...!`
` It's not true that everything's been denied...!!`
` My master! I will solve the riddle of the letter without fail.`
` Please allow me to postpone that for now...!!`
` However, I will definitely figure out the riddle of the knock here!`
` I've hit you with the blue stake that '#5decffsomeone outside the mansion set things up with a cassette tape or something to make a knock sound play#ffffff'...!"`
`"Heheheheheheheheheheh...!`
` You really are a cute kid, piece of Bern's.`
` Lots of spunk.`
` Anyway, Erika's yelling that you forgive her because she's solved one of the two riddles, even though she resigned on the other.`
` So, will you forgive her...?"`
`".........Sure.`
` Normally, I'd never forgive my own piece for the shame of surrendering,`
` ...but if you've managed to solve one of the riddles, I guess I'll let it slide for now..."`
`"...M-My master..."`
`When Bernkastel said she'd let it slide, Erika couldn't hide her relief.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"~ib~Then it's time to get punished~ib~, Erika-chan♪"`
`#ff0000None of the characters misidentified a knocking sound.#ffffff`
`"......Oh?`
` What's that supposed to mean?"`
`"#ff0000Misidentifying a knocking sound means this:`
` they would not mistake a sound very similar to a knocking sound for a real knocking sound.`
` Hitting a pillar to make something similar to a knocking sound is no good.`
` When you record a knocking sound on a cassette tape and play it back, it becomes 'the sound of the tape with a knocking sound on it', and not a knocking sound.`
` So that's no good either!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000In other words, every one of them would correctly recognize a knocking sound of something truly hitting the door,`
` and they definitely wouldn't mishear it.`
` It's totally impossible that any sounds except hitting that door directly would be misinterpreted as a knock!!#ffffff"`
`"...Wh-What the...`
` But that means...at the time the bell sounding 24:00 went off, `
`no one existed who could have hit the door...`
` Gggh, ggghgghhhhh..."`
`"Yep, they don't exist.`
` After all, the Golden Witch Beatrice hit it.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!!"`
`"......So in other words, there's no way to make it work unless you actually hit the door.`
` So what about this?`
` #5decffThere was some kind of device that could knock on the door.`
` There was something like an automatic door knocker, and that made it possible to knock without touching the door with your hands.#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000'To knock' means someone hitting a door with their hand#ffffff, right?`
` I won't accept hitting it with some device, eheheheheheheheheheheh!!`
` They heard a knock at the same time as the 24:00 bell.`
` At that time, everyone inside the dining hall definitely heard it.`
` #ff0000And none of them misinterpreted a knocking sound.`
` Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji were not involved with the making of a knocking sound.`
` No one else existed inside the mansion.`
` And 'knock' refers to the action of standing directly in front of a door and hitting it with a hand.#ffffff"`
`"...Hey, Bern.`
` What do you think of my red?`
` Don't you think this is pretty simple and enjoyable despite being before the first twilight?`
` The Golden Witch made her graceful appearance with a knocking sound.`
` *giggle*giggle*, eheheheheheheheheheheheheheheh...!"`
`"...............`
`*giggle*giggle*`
` Ahhahhahhahahahhahaha!!`
` Interesting, this really is riveting, Lambda...!`
` Wouldn't have it any other way.`
` Yes, how amusing!`
` Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`The two witches doubled over laughing as though this was the most fun thing in the world...`
`"Gah, .........`
` ...M-My master,`
` ...don't worry.`
` If you just give my little gray cells some time, I will definitely reach an answer to this pitiful red...!"`
`"......You're nothing but a lowly piece.`
` Your absence wouldn't hinder my progress in this game in the slightest.`
` If you can't think of any theories in particular, please just go back to the piece tray and gather dust or something.`
` Useless pieces are painful even to remember."`
`"...After all, Bern's pretty forgetful.`
` If you don't try a little harder, Bern's gonna forget you, okay...?`
` You'll collect dust in that forgotten piece tray, awaiting your turn that'll never come.`
` ...I imagine that'd be pretty harsh, don't you think...?"`
`"D-Don't worry, Lady Lambdadelta, and my master...!`
` I promise that I'll keep you entertained and never let you down again...!"`
`"......Oh, how reassuring. I guess you're my double after all.`
` ...Then make sure you really are giving it your all, in more ways than one.`
` If you don't make an impact, I might forget all about you..."`
`As the two witches giggled, they continued discussing the letter and the knock.`
`There was no room for Erika to step in.`
`If she contented herself with that, `
`...she would literally have no place to go...`
`...and would be buried in an eternal oblivion.`
`Erika endured this with a hideous expression, looking with shame at the back of the master who ignored her.`
`And with both fists clenched, she thought frantically in search of some kind of breakthrough.`
`I am the detective, I am Furudo Erika.`
`I am the piece and double and servant of the Great Lady Bernkastel...!!`
`I'll definitely make her satisfied...`
`satisfied...`
`definitely, definitely, `
`gah, ggghggghhhhhh, `
`...Ushiromiya Battler...`
`...how dare you...`
`...humiliate me so.........`
`As she stood there, ignored by the witches and shrouded in darkness,`
` it looked like someone had told her to go stand all alone in the hallway...`
`With the crime in the early morning, we'd completely forgotten about breakfast,`
` so we now had our first meal of the day at a time that could never be called breakfast time...`
`Even Gohda-san's wonderful meal, which had supposedly been in the works since yesterday, provided no comfort.`
`The several empty seats quietly burdened us with a pain-filled sadness...`
`Then, in the middle of this meal that felt like a vigil, Erika suddenly stood up.`
`Everyone focused on her to see what was the matter.`
`Her expression was somewhere between relief and insanity, as though she'd made some groundbreaking and strange discovery.`
`"...Hey, what's up?`
` Are you okay...?"`
`"I've got it, I've got it!!`
` Did you think I wouldn't understand?`
` Yes, I've got it, there's no way something that stupid could happen...!"`
`With a hideous expression covered in cold sweat, Erika glared and lashed out at Battler.`
`"......What `
`do you get...?"`
`"There's no way you jumped down from the third floor study...!`
` Not one of us saw you fall down and land in the courtyard...!!"`
`"........."`
`"#5decffWhen you set up the ladder from the courtyard and saw Rudolf-san go up it to the third story window,`
` you closely observed the construction of the outer wall...and realized that by cleverly using a rain gutter, it might be possible to go down to the courtyard from the third floor window...!`
` You didn't jump down!`
` You used a rain gutter or something and clumsily wriggled down the outer wall!!`
` What do you think of my blue truth?!! Come on, what's your counterargument?!"`
`"......My counterargument?"`
`"You don't have a counterargument?`
` Then my truth is valid, right?!`
` Hey, did you see that?!`
` #5decffTrying to look cool and making it look like you jumped down was all an illusion!`
` You just jumped out and latched onto a rain gutter...!!#ffffff"`
`".........`
`...My argument then was about whether it was possible for Grandfather to escape from the study, right...?`
` And it was possible for Grandfather to escape through the window.`
` All I did was prove that.`
` ...Whether I jumped down or crawled down, that doesn't change anything, does it?"`
`"Don't try to change the subject!!`
` A mere Human can't jump down from the third floor...!!`
` Did you see that, did you see that...?!!`
` What do you think of my reasoning, my master...?!!"`
`"...Are you tired or something?`
` Just calm down and eat some food."`
`When he escaped to the courtyard through the window...`
`Battler really did use the rain gutter to crawl down the wall, just like Erika said.`
`His hand had slipped halfway, and he had fallen from a considerable height,`
` but he had managed to land on his feet.`
`...No one had witnessed this,`
` but most likely, everyone in the dining hall now except Erika had realized that something like this had happened.`
`Since the very beginning, no one had believed that he'd jumped down from the third floor window.`
`...Even if they hadn't witnessed that directly.`
`So they had no clue what Erika was complaining about all of a sudden...`
`and started to whisper, staring at her with cold eyes and dubious faces...`
`"You can't counter that, can you?!`
` You jumping down has already been denied!`
` My truth has won!!`
` My blue truth is valid!"`
`"My master, please acknowledge this!!`
` I am not incompetent or a disappointment...!`
` I will match up to your expectations without fail, so please don't abandon me!! My master...!!"`
`Facing someone that might have been somewhere beyond the ceiling, Erika spread her arms and yelled.`
`Then, ......as if in answer, a massive lightning bolt landed very close by.`
`It was an incredible sound.`
`They could even feel the earth shake.`
`At the same time as that sound, Erika went limp and fell into her seat`
` like a puppet who'd just had all its strings cut.`
`Then, as the sound of wind and rain slowly filled the room once again,`
` ...Erika slowly opened her eyes as though recovering from a bout of dizziness.`
`Then, she continued eating in silence as though nothing had happened.`
`As if she had been acting normally the whole time.`
`...Didn't Erika just stand up suddenly and yell something strange at someone...?`
`Automatically, enough to make one doubt their eyes, Erika continued eating quietly as though everything was perfectly normal.`
`When they saw how ordinary she looked, ...everyone convinced themselves that they were totally worn out...`
`and that they must have just seen some illusion of Erika suddenly yelling.`
`So Erika's sudden transfiguration of a few seconds ago was treated as a daydream...`
`and faded out of everyone's memories...`
`Erika quietly poked at her salad and muttered in a voice no one could hear.`
`Thank you very much, Great Lady Bernkastel...`
` I am Furudo Erika.`
` I am my master's piece and her double.`
` ...I will most certainly present you with an incredible tale.`
` Heheheheh...`
`"That's right, when it comes to utensils, knives and forks are pretty primitive.`
` Chopsticks are the best.`
` Don't you think chopsticks are the easiest way to eat salad?`
` Well, everyone?"`
`"Battler-san returned to the guesthouse at 3:00 AM.`
` Then, the rest of you split up about 30 minutes later, right?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` Drowsiness was finally starting to catch up to us.`
` We decided to take a short rest and then start up again."`
`To smoke out the murderer of the first twilight,`
` Erika closely questioned everyone involved to check their alibis and evidence.`
`To confirm these, she went around the mansion with them,`
` and when needed, took several trips out to the guesthouse through all the rain.`
`...Her vitality was impressive.`
`...Though she was an uninvited guest,`
` everyone had long since stopped feeling anything strange about the way she played the detective...`
`"...It seems Erika is also steadily building her foundation."`
`"It's useless.`
` Whether alibis exist or not, she can't deny our existence.`
` ...Kinzo escaped through the window and is now one with the mists of Rokkenjima.`
` She most certainly won't be able to capture or deny him."`
`"When all's said and done, perhaps you could say he's escaped to the underside of the chessboard."`
`"In that case, maybe it would be appropriate to say he's been stowed away."`
`"...Come to think of it, about those corpses from the first twilight...`
` They've been stowed away too, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` They've been put away in my darkness, which lies between this world and the next."`
`"...And that detective wannabe won't be able to find them...?"`
`"Of course she won't.`
` It'd definitely be impossible for a Human.`
` ......Wanna check?"`
`"Just in case.`
` And we also need to reexamine what Lady Bernkastel's goals will be from now on."`
`"If you know your enemy, you need not fear the outcome of a hundred battles."`
`"If you know the truth, you can win a hundred battles without fighting."`
`"Pukkukukukuku.`
` My, my."`
`Gaap opened up a large hole in the sky and had it swallow all of them up.`
`She invited Beato and Ronove to the gap between worlds where she had hidden the corpses...`
`...That place...was nowhere in this world...`
`and existed at no time of this world.`
`In other words, it truly and literally was a place not of this world.`
`In this place, questions such as 'Where is this?' and 'What time is it?' have no meaning.`
`Every single place led to here, but no place could be reached from here.`
`Furthermore, all times connected to this place, but no time could be passed to from here.`
`In short, ...this place was just what they said it was: the underside of the chessboard.`
`No, perhaps it would be most appropriate to call this the captured pile, where pieces that have left the game go...`
`...Then, through the pitch-black world,`
` a glow like a faint spotlight shone, and five corpses came into view...`
`The five pitiful corpses with their necks sliced open had been arranged neatly.`
`Their eyelids were shut and their hands joined.`
`Apparently, even Gaap had respect for the dead...`
`"Oh my.`
` ......There are five sacrifices for the first twilight in this game?`
` Not six?"`
`"Oh, it's you, Teacher.`
` I was worried about where you'd gone.`
` The game has already reached the first twilight, and as you see, the first victims have appeared.`
` ...So, it's finally time. I'm getting all excited...!"`
`"I see.`
` ......The you that is here looks to be in high spirits.`
` I'm pleased."`
`"??`
` I've got high spirits and a captivating body!`
` Add in my charming disposition, and you've got my only strong points.`
` Wahaha."`
`For some reason, Virgilia praised Beato for being in high spirits.`
`Though Beato was taken aback at such granny-like words coming out of Virgilia's mouth all of a sudden, `
`she pounded her chest and answered.`
`Virgilia had been absent often during this game.`
`She might even have been absent when Battler solved the epitaph, as well as during the uproar that followed.`
`Apparently, she'd been absent for so many critical points...`
`that she didn't really understand much about what had happened so far in this game...`
`"Right now, five corpses have appeared.`
` ...As you can see, their necks have been slit."`
`George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, Genji.`
`All five of them had had their necks sliced open by something sharp...`
`The wound opened wider than their mouths...`
`and made it feel as though they'd no longer need their mouths to breathe.`
`"...I see.`
` So, #ff0000anyone looking at George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, or Genji's corpses could confirm at a glance that they are dead#ffffff."`
`"Hmm?`
` Red?`
` Well, there's no point in me holding out against you.`
` That's right,`
` #ff0000at a glance, anyone could confirm that these corpses are dead, so it's absolutely impossible that they're just playing dead.#ffffff"`
`"Why did Lia use the red...?"`
`"Who knows.`
` ...However, she is always thinking of what's best for Milady.`
` She probably has some idea in mind that will benefit her."`
`"...Hmmm."`
`But they'd hid the corpses here...specifically so that no one would be able to use the red...`
`However, Ronove was right.`
` Virgilia always thought of Beatrice first.`
`A slightly displeased expression rose to Gaap's face`
` as she saw that the corpses she'd gone to such lengths to hide had now been confirmed dead in red.`
`However, in the end, she remembered that she was only a guest and shrugged.`
`"Why did you have Gaap hide the corpses?"`
`"As to that,`
` since the epitaph has already been solved, this game of mine is different from usual.`
` I now have serving and protecting Natsuhi as my goal."`
`"............`
`How would concealing their corpses protect Natsuhi?"`
`"...We've more or less figured out what our opponents' moves will be.`
` This is probably a trap meant to corner Natsuhi.`
` Most likely, they'll sort through alibis for the first twilight and find them for everyone except her."`
`"Last night, Natsuhi-sama was the first to leave the family conference, and then rested alone in her room.`
` ...Unfortunately, she has no alibi whatsoever until the next morning."`
`"We've already made Kinzo's existence impossible to deny.`
` ...However, there is a single move remaining to our enemy that might cancel that out."`
`"I see.`
` ......So, they'll corner Natsuhi and make her confess that Kinzo doesn't exist."`
`"Indeed.`
` The enemy is probably after something like that.`
` By watching the movements of the pieces involved with the family conference, we quickly realized that Natsuhi was isolated,`
` noticed that trap of theirs, and countered with this move."`
`"The corpses disappear!`
` Everyone has alibis, and no one exists who could've moved them.`
` Not only does this support the claim that a witch exists, `
`it also throws doubt on whether there were actually corpses in the first place, just barely allowing Natsuhi to escape being a suspect."`
`"In other words, it's possible for Natsuhi-sama `
`to claim that the sacrifices of the first twilight were only playing dead."`
`"You mean, even though many people confirmed their deaths without fail in the cousin room...?"`
`"Mere confirmation of facts doesn't even approach the red truth...!`
` No matter how much everyone claims to have truly witnessed their deaths, the red truth doesn't exist in the human world!`
` Because the corpses don't exist, `
`Natsuhi can discount their words as a mistake, some sort of trick, or she can say they were all lying,`
` and it's possible for her to do this over and over to buy time for herself."`
`"In the human world, which lacks the red truth, perpetual check is a valid move."`
`"An endless argument with both sides denying the other's claims.`
` ...Not pretty."`
`"True.`
` However, beauty is something to be sought only after victory.`
` When those without victory seek it, it is naught but poison."`
`"Well, they do say might makes right.`
` Wahahahahaha."`
`"And even if I don't think it's beautiful,`
` those Voyager witches will probably like it and say it 'isn't boring'..."`
`".........I see.`
` I've managed to grasp the flow of this game.`
` ...I imagine it will get quite nasty."`
`"We're fully aware of that.`
` ...And we already know that Natsuhi's probably about to be lured into yet another trap."`
`"A trap?"`
`"Indeed.`
` Someone Lady Lambdadelta created, who calls himself a man from 19 years ago, has already threatened Natsuhi.`
` She was ordered to go into a closet in a certain guest room in a few minutes, at 1:00 PM, and hide there.`
` ...Krauss was taken hostage, so Natsuhi can't resist."`
`"......I see.`
` How relentless.`
` ...Can you protect her?"`
`"Of course.`
` After all, Natsuhi isn't the culprit.`
` No matter how much she's treated as the culprit, both the truth and phantoms are on our side.`
` There's no way we'll lose.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`Natsuhi threw her cup of tea to the ground in protest, expressing the anger that flowed throughout her entire body.`
`"...Wh-What do you mean by that...?!!`
` A-Are you saying...you suspect me?!!"`
`"You told me you left before anyone else, returned to your room, and didn't leave that room until morning.`
` However, if you cannot prove that, it doesn't count as an alibi."`
`"Prove...?!`
` How could I possibly do that...?!!"`
`"It doesn't matter how.`
` Objectively speaking, it'll all be fine as long as you prove it was impossible for you to commit the crime.`
` ......Everyone else is cooperating.`
` I want you to stop being so hostile and give me your alibi, along with proof."`
`"...That's right.`
` Almost the whole night is a blank space in time for Natsuhi nee-san.`
` ...She might have left the conference, saying she wanted to rest before us, then gone to the guesthouse and attacked George and the others..."`
`"Please don't be such a fool!!`
` Why would I kill George-kun, and on top of that, my own daughter, Jessica?!!"`
`"Calm down.`
` ...We're all equally suspicious.`
` It's sad, but we all have to prove our innocence."`
`"Yeah.`
` We've been thinking frantically about how to prove our alibis for last night, so that we could clear up the suspicion against us."`
`"I know you can't like bein' suspected, Natsuhi-san.`
` If it frustrates you, then shouldn't your first priority be searchin' for some way to prove your own innocence...?"`
`The relatives spoke as though they were all under equal suspicion,`
` but the mood about the place didn't feel so peaceful.`
`Erika was still in the middle of confirming all of the facts,`
` but except for Natsuhi, who was uncooperative when it came to proving alibis,`
` everyone else had an alibi that was reasonably credible.`
`Only Natsuhi, who claimed that even being suspected was an insult, was uncooperative with Erika,`
` and her position began to grow more and more perilous...`
`This parlor was no longer a place of comfort for Natsuhi.`
`And the sound of the cup smashing had made that decisive.`
`"...Th-That's ridiculous!`
` Why must I be suspected when I've lost a daughter...?!!`
` You're maliciously trying to make me look like the culprit just because I went to bed early last night!`
` I cannot stand this humiliation any further...!!"`
`"Oh, so what are you going to do about it?`
` Show us some kind of alibi that proves your innocence.`
` As if you could!!`
` Give me George back, murderer!!"`
`"Stop it, Eva...!`
` ...Natsuhi-san, you're probably a bit tired too.`
` Same goes for us, of course.`
` Why don't we take it easy for now...?"`
`"......Seriously.`
` We're a little too high-strung."`
`"Aunt Natsuhi,`
` ...where are you going...?"`
`"Searching for alibis or the culprit would be truly laughable at this point...!`
` When the typhoon passes and the police come, everything will be exposed to the light of day.`
` There's no reason whatsoever for us to play at being detectives.`
` Am I wrong, Erika-san?"`
`"Generally speaking, you're right.`
` However, I do have the authority to do this."`
`Who gave her that authority?`
`No one asked.`
`It was an authority given by words of power from a higher world,`
` so the pieces weren't even allowed to doubt it...`
`"I'm leaving.`
` I have no intention of going along with your pointless questioning before the police come.`
` If you suspect me, feel free to do so.`
` I'm counting on the police to clear away that suspicion."`
`......It may be a bit late to mention this, ...but then again, I guess this happens every time anyway.`
`As usual, the phone couldn't connect to the police.`
`Natsuhi said the police would be coming, but that wasn't exactly true.`
`Strictly speaking, the boat would come tomorrow, and they would use the radio on that boat to contact the police.`
`Well, ...it's not like I'll let everyone live that long anyway.`
`...*giggle*.`
`"...Natsuhi-san, it's dangerous to go alone...`
` Perhaps it would be better if we all stayed here..."`
`"Why not let her?`
` This might make for some very good proof.`
` If Natsuhi nee-san gets killed in her own room, that'll be excellent proof of her innocence."`
`"Quit it, Aneki.`
` ......It's probably best if we all get a bit of rest.`
` Our bodies won't last until tomorrow."`
`"If we're going to take a break, we still mustn't let our guards down, got it...?`
` We might not make it through the night, much less tomorrow."`
`".........Aunt Natsuhi,`
` if you're returning to your room, make sure you lock it tight.`
` Close the windows and shutters too, and stay safe.`
` ...I don't want to suspect anyone. And more than that, ...I don't want there to be any more victims."`
`"......Thank you, Battler-kun.`
` ......Then I'll return to my room.`
` Gohda, you're in charge now.`
` I know this is a horrible situation, but see to it that our guests have everything they need."`
`"Y-Yes, Madam...`
` I shall do so..."`
`With everyone watching her, Natsuhi left the parlor.`
`From their faces, she could tell that they were expecting the classic mystery pattern...`
`that 'the first person to quarrel and leave the circle' would become the next victim.`
`.........Natsuhi...couldn't disobey because of the threat against Krauss, who had been taken hostage.`
`Very soon, it would be that promised time, 1:00 PM.`
`She was to hide for an hour in the closet of a specific guest room.`
`It was easy to suspect that this bizarre order was a trap to select her as the next sacrifice.`
`She thought of various ways to resist,`
` but all methods would be useless against a culprit who had a hostage and was observing her from close by...`
`So Natsuhi could do nothing but obediently follow that order...`
`and then claim that she'd been forced to do this for her husband's safety...`
`When the promised time had drawn near, `
`Natsuhi had intentionally acted annoyed and smashed the cup on the ground to give her an excuse for slipping out of the parlor.`
`......At any rate, no matter how cowardly a trap it may be, ...I cannot disobey now.`
`I am now the one who carries the burden of the One-Winged Eagle.`
`...Now that my husband, Krauss, has been captured,`
` I must protect it even if I have to crawl through the mud...`
`"............"`
`...Of course, I am prepared to do so.`
`I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi.`
`Even if I am not permitted to bear the One-Winged Eagle on my clothes,`
` ......Father gave me permission to bear it in my heart...`
`"..............."`
`...I've managed to get this far by plausibly dashing away in a rage.`
`So far, ...everything has gone well.`
`Before my eyes was the doorknob of the specified guest room.`
`...However, ...I wonder if it's locked.`
`The servants are normally ordered to lock any unused rooms.`
`...What will I do if it's locked...?`
`I had dashed away from the others, pretending I was returning to my room.`
`Popping back and asking a servant to unlock this guest room would be obviously suspicious...`
`If I can, ...I'd like to get this eerie hide-and-seek over with without anyone noticing.`
`In that phone call from the one who claimed to be the man from 19 years ago,`
` he said I would win if no one found out, but lose if anyone did find out.`
`He said my husband would be released whether I won or lost, `
`...but as a person with a hostage taken against me, I'd rather not lose...`
`I don't like it at all, but I have to go along with this game.`
`When I softly gripped the doorknob, ...I could feel that it was unlocked.`
`Did Shannon or Kumasawa forget to lock it after cleaning?`
`...Or did that man unlock it in advance...?`
`That man...`
`couldn't be waiting for me in this room, could he?`
`And then, `
`...he'll...`
`.........`
`All that about hide-and-seek might have been a mere excuse.`
`I kept the fact I was coming here secret, and all the others think I'm resting in my room.`
`If I were to be killed in this situation,`
` ...it might create a new baffling murder case, like an extension of the one that occurred this morning.`
`"......Th-That might actually turn out for the better.`
` ...Perhaps this is a good chance to confront the culprit directly..."`
`Natsuhi had some experience with using a naginata, though only casually.`
`Unlike Eva, she couldn't brag about being able to hold off any single ruffian indefinitely.`
`As she was now, she had no realistic chance of challenging a man with malicious intent and winning.`
`"............"`
`She readied herself...and slowly opened the door.`
`She couldn't just stand around in the corridor and risk being seen by someone...`
`The atmosphere inside the guest room...was frigid,`
` and she could sense no trace of anyone waiting impatiently for her.`
`All she could hear were the unsettling sounds of the wind and rain.`
`At first, this seemed to prove that there was no one here to threaten her,`
` ...but soon, it only made an uneasy feeling rise up inside her even more strongly than before...`
`The closet was just off to the side of anyone entering the room.`
`Lined up inside it was a set of hangers for coats.`
`This closet, which had nothing hanging in it, was large enough for even an adult to hide in...`
`She softly opened the closet.`
`...Of course, there was nothing inside.`
`She would have to hide quietly in here for an hour.`
`The room had a wooden floor, but something like a carpet had been laid in the closet.`
`...It seemed sitting down wouldn't be a problem.`
`She had been sure someone would be waiting for her in this room`
` or that a strange letter would be lying in the closet.`
`...In the worst case, she had even imagined that her husband's corpse might be inside there.`
`However, none of these things she imagined turned out to be true.`
`The only thing there was a cold guest room...`
`and a lifeless closet that silently urged her to enter...`
`"......And he told me...to hide in here for an hour...`
` ...He's mocking me."`
`Natsuhi shrugged, turned around, then locked and chained the guest room door.`
`"This way, no one will be able to get into this room.`
` ...In other words, no one will be able to find me for the next hour.`
` I win.`
` What a stupid game of hide-and-seek."`
`This surely must be a total victory in the hide-and-seek game against that mystery man.`
`...However, it was such an easy victory, it made her feel uneasy.`
`Normally, this would be against the rules of hide-and-seek.`
`...Even if she had won, wouldn't this displease the culprit?`
`And now, everyone thought she had returned to her room.`
`If they found a room with a chain set, that would make it an impossible closed room to them.`
`Erika had dashed throughout the mansion to confirm alibis or something.`
`If she noticed that the chain was set on this room, there would probably be an uproar that would end in them cutting the chain and searching the room.`
`...If that happened, Natsuhi would be found hiding in the closet right away.`
`It would be easy to honestly confess as to why she'd been hiding.`
`However, that man had insisted that she not reveal that.`
`...If she did talk, ...she might endanger her husband...`
`Thinking of it that way, setting the chain......no, even the lock might be a bad idea.`
`That's right.`
`This room was unlocked when I came here.`
`If it were to suddenly become locked, it's conceivable that it might catch someone's attention.`
`...It's better if I don't do anything unnecessary...`
`That man only told me to hide...`
`"......So in the end, ...I have no choice...but to do what he says..."`
`I hate doing it, ...but I cannot disobey.`
`I undid those two precious locks,`
` ...went into the dimly-lit closet filled with the smell of old wood, and managed to close the door from the inside.`
`...Pitch black.`
`It reminded me of when I was young, when I used to hide somewhere and then surprise my mother,`
` but that peaceful recollection wasn't enough to kill off my anxiety.`
`It really is pitch black.`
`From here, I won't even be able to check my watch to see if an hour has passed.`
`I'll probably need to open the door a crack every once in a while to let in enough light for my watch.`
`...For now, ...I'll crouch down here.`
`I thought about clutching my knees, but it hurt my back when I tried.`
`I'm not as young as I used to be.`
`Even though I was made to sit on the floor holding my knees in every PE class as a grade schooler, `
`I now have to struggle just to sit down.`
`Just crouching down here for an hour will probably hurt a lot...`
`"............Haah........."`
`I can't believe......I'll be hiding in the darkness for a full hour, with nothing to hear except the wind and rain.`
`Ironically, Natsuhi had made Jessica do the exact same thing in the past.`
`She had done it when Jessica was a little girl, to scold her for her persistent bad habits and teach her a lesson.`
`She'd thought that making Jessica stay put in the darkness would sprout a desire to reflect on her mistakes...`
`and that, this way, she would understand what she had done wrong.`
`...It almost...feels like I'm being made to do the same thing.`
`If that's the true purpose of this hide-and-seek...`
`...............`
`"...How naive of me."`
`This must be my naivety, the hope that if their goal is to make me repent, `
`nothing will happen here during this hour...`
`Uncertainty and fear of that man's shadow are not what I need right now.`
`Will someone suddenly come to this room, open this closet,`
` ...and do something horrible to me now that I've come here in total secrecy as promised?`
`...That's what I should be worrying about.`
`The culprit, ...or one of his accomplices, is very close by.`
`If they weren't, they wouldn't be able to observe me so thoroughly.`
`I don't want to think it, but it's highly likely that the culprit bought off one of the servants.`
`The culprit hid an eerie card with autumn written on it in my room.`
`My personal room is always locked.`
`That trick wouldn't have been possible without a key.`
`Instead of believing that they obtained the key when the servants weren't looking,`
` it's much more realistic to assume that one of the servants lent the culprit a hand...`
`"But, `
`......h-how...`
`...did they know that autumn is my favorite season......?`
` How unsettling......"`
`The thought that this mystery man might be peeking into my heart sent goosebumps running across my whole body...`
`It's true that I like autumn, but I've never said it out loud.`
`I don't think anyone's ever heard me say it.`
`...If I asked even my husband what my favorite season is, he would probably be stumped for an answer.`
`.........N-No.`
`Just once, I told it to a single person......`
`That's right.`
`.........Shannon...`
`On an autumn day long ago, I happened to be in a good mood,`
` and I mentioned that autumn was my favorite of the four seasons.`
`...So, the culprit, or one of their accomplices, has to be Shannon...!`
`"The fact that I like autumn can only be known by Shannon...`
` ...In that case, ...this is clear proof that Shannon is involved...!`
` That card with autumn on it is proof...!`
` ...Outrageous...`
` Even though she's served the family for 10 years......"`
`I trembled and shook with rage.`
`...Didn't Kinzo once say that anger is the fastest sedative to cure fear and uncertainty?`
`It's easy to tell the most fearful humans from within a crowd.`
`They're always the first to get angry.`
`...I remember him telling me that.`
`So I realized that this anger was a sign that I was actually frightened,`
` and I tried my best to remain calm...`
`...However, this is a vital clue for turning things around.`
`Shannon may not be reliable as a servant,`
` but if she's an accomplice used by that mystery man, this might actually be convenient.`
`A weak-willed girl.`
`If I threaten her, she'll probably spill the name of the mastermind in an instant.`
`I'll secretly tell the police about this.`
`It might become a big clue towards arresting the culprit.`
`"...That card was probably meant to shock me and get me to do what he says,`
` ...but he's actually dug his own grave."`
`#ff0000I never told anyone except Shannon that I like autumn.`
`This is unshakable proof that she's working with the culprit...`
`Though I once thought this time in the closet would crush me with uncertainty and uneasiness, it's actually given me the start of a counterattack.`
`If I wasn't given this time in the darkness, I probably wouldn't have noticed this.`
`I'm almost grateful to the culprit for making up this foolish game.`
`...My mood brightened.`
`...I still can't guarantee that my husband is safe, but I'll definitely get him back and force the culprit to face judgment...`
`I clenched my fists tightly...and further strengthened my resolve to avoid losing this fight at any cost...`
`*rattle*rattle*!!`
`At that time, I heard the sudden sound of someone trying to force the locked door open, `
`and my heart leapt.`
`"...Oh, it was unlocked."`
`The voice was Hideyoshi's.`
`I heard that quiet voice, as though he was talking to himself, coming from what was probably the hallway.`
`Apparently, he had thought it was locked and tried to unlock it,`
` but had ended up locking the unlocked door instead.`
`Once again, there was the sound of the lock turning, and now, the door opened with a faint sound...`
`...Why...`
`is Hideyoshi-san in this room...?!`
`Footsteps that sounded like his came in, and there was the sound of him closing and locking the door behind him.`
`Then came what seemed to be the sound of him setting the chain.`
`......Don't tell me...`
`Hideyoshi-san...`
`is the mastermind...?!`
` Or else, an accomplice...?!`
`Is he planning to do something to me in this room...?`
`It would take some time to unlock the door from this side, much less remove the chain.`
`...If Hideyoshi-san doesn't intend to let me escape from here,`
` he won't give me enough time to undo the chain...`
`In that case, `
`...if he opens the closet door...`
`and sees me crouching here pathetically, `
`...just what kind of fearsome words will he say...?`
`I don't want to be found, I don't want to be found...`
`I beg you, pass right on by the closet door...`
`Please keep going into the center of the room...!`
`My head was so filled with a throbbing sound that it felt like it was about to explode, and I almost missed hearing his noisy footsteps.`
`So when I heard a clunking sound coming from the center of the room,`
` I finally realized that he'd passed by the closet...and was deeply relieved.`
`"...Just in case.`
` In this weather, it's pretty much night out there anyway."`
`As he whispered, he did something that made a clunking sound.`
`...He was probably closing the shutters on the windows.`
`Just in case?`
`In case I try to escape out the window...?`
`No, ...that can't be it.`
`That's right.`
`When I left the parlor, everyone was talking about possibly taking a break.`
`After all, several murders have occurred.`
`And the weather's bad.`
`...There'd be nothing abnormal if someone chose to rest in a guest room here instead of returning to the guesthouse.`
`In that case, locking up and closing the shutters to guarantee safety is the proper course of action to take.`
`When he finished closing the shutters, `
`......there was a *thunk*,`
` as though he'd flopped over on the bed.`
`...It was surprising how much of the situation could be grasped just by the sound.`
`......What's going on here...?`
`Did the man from 19 years ago...plan all this out to put me in the same room as Hideyoshi-san...?`
`No, ...that probably...isn't true.`
`He probably planned on me hiding here,`
` ...but Hideyoshi-san coming to take a rest here must have been outside the scope of his plan.`
`Thinking about it that way, ......having him in the room might be odd, `
`but it also might guarantee my own safety.`
`...Unlike his wife, Hideyoshi-san is the kind of person I can talk to.`
`If Eva-san comes, things will probably get complicated.`
`Maybe I should slip out of this closet now while he's still alone,`
` reveal everything to just him, and ask for help...`
`But if I do that, my husband might be killed...`
`Until my husband is released, I shouldn't do anything rash...`
`Should I go out and talk, or hide in here?`
`Moaning from my headache and biting my lower lip, I resisted the urge to crawl out of here...`
`Even if I talk with Hideyoshi-san, I don't know where my husband is being held.`
` I'm sure the traitor who's observing me is nearby.`
`Just talking to him won't solve everything.`
`...I suspect that Shannon is the traitor, but that's no proof that Gohda and the others aren't.`
`...It's all useless...`
` I guess...leaving here and confessing is too dangerous after all...`
`Eventually, ...I heard a strange, sobbing voice.`
`...Whose voice was it...?`
`I strained my ears, trying to hear that strange voice,`
` ...and was shocked to discover that it was Hideyoshi weeping...`
`Hideyoshi, ...who had lost his only son,`
` was finally able to shed tears and cry, ...now that he was all alone like this...`
`...Thinking that he needed to support Eva in her distress, he acted as though he alone was standing firm.`
`However, he has as good a right to cry as anyone.`
`...And now that he's found a place where no one can see his tears,`
` he finally let himself do it...`
`......And I've...`
`...lost my daughter.`
`...I haven't seen her corpse with my own eyes, ...so it still doesn't really feel like she's dead.`
`But if the one who carried her off was the culprit...`
`and he had some repulsive motive for doing it, ...just thinking about it makes it feel as though my chest will tear itself apart...`
`The reason I'm hiding in here now...is that I'm thinking more about my still-living husband than my dead daughter.`
`...But if I were given the chance, ...I'd be wailing at the top of my lungs too.`
`However, ...I still cannot let myself do that.`
`...It isn't because the man from 19 years ago told me to hide.`
`It's because......I'm the final...Head of the Ushiromiya family...`
`It's been completely overshadowed by the recent uproar,`
` ...but last night, Battler-kun found the hidden gold and even gained the Head's Ring from that mysterious envelope.`
`...At the very, very end, when it's all over...`
`I probably won't be able to prevent his ascension as the Head.`
`And when everything regarding the distribution of the inheritance is revealed,`
` ...the Ushiromiya family honor and glory passed down from Father......will plummet to the earth.`
`So, ...I am the final Head.`
`Battler-kun will probably inherit the remaining wealth of the Ushiromiya family.`
`However, its history and honor...will all end with my generation...`
`Therefore, ...I am the final Head.`
`I must not cry.`
` ......Not yet.`
`Until I get my husband back...and avenge my daughter, I will not be allowed to shed tears...`
`In the closet, I silently hung my head as I listened to Hideyoshi-san's sobs...`
`"Wh-Who are you...?!"`
`Huh?!`
`My heart leapt.`
`I heard a sound that must have been Hideyoshi-san, who had probably been lying prostrate on the bed, bounding to his feet.`
`......D-Did he notice me...?`
`"How did you get in here...?`
` ...Wh-What's that...?`
` ...W-Wait a sec...!`
` Wai......ngahh, ...mmpph-"`
`He was clearly in a struggle with someone.`
`...Who on earth could it be?!`
`No, it doesn't matter who it is.`
`It's probably the culprit, and they're probably trying to take Hideyoshi-san's life...!`
`Shouldn't I jump out of here and help him...?`
`If I can't help him, shouldn't I call for help...?`
`...No, but...if I do something like that, I'll be questioned about why I was hiding here...!`
`However, if Hideyoshi-san gets killed like this...`
`No, now isn't the time to be saying that...`
`At this rate, he'll certainly be killed...!`
`I'll jump out of here and help him right now...!`
`Aaah, but if I do that, even if I can save Hideyoshi-san, ...I might be abandoning my husband's life.`
`Hideyoshi-san's life and my husband's life.`
`...How sinful it would be to try and weigh those against each other...!!`
`At that time, there was a loud sound as the door opened and the chain was pulled tight.`
`Someone was trying to open the door despite the chain being set.`
`"Dear, it's me.`
` Could you open up?"`
`"...Eva, ...aah, gwaaaaaaggghhhh...!!"`
`"Dear?`
` ...What?! What's happening?!`
` Dear?!`
` Open up!!"`
`"Ggh...`
`......gggh`
`......ggh......"`
`"Open up!`
` Open up, dear!!`
` S-Someooooooooooone!!"`
`She opened and closed the door over and over again with all her might, but of course, she couldn't snap the chain.`
`Eva-san called for help in a loud voice and raced through the hallway...`
`By this time, the room had settled back into silence,`
` ...and that earlier sense of Hideyoshi being in a noisy struggle had disappeared completely.`
`What's......going on here...?!`
`So, right now, ...I'm in the same room as the murderer who killed Hideyoshi-san...?!`
`In that case, the culprit should try to escape from the room as soon as possible, ...so why are they hiding in here...?!`
`I haven't heard anything...`
` Nothing that might've been the culprit who attacked Hideyoshi-san rushing away.`
`...No matter how much I strain my ears, I can't sense anyone in the room.`
`In fact, ...it's so silent that it makes what happened just a second ago feel like an illusion.`
`In other words, ......does this mean...that the culprit is hiding his breath, `
`...standing just outside this closet, `
`...waiting for me to stumble out...?`
`I don't even know what I should be scared of anymore.`
`If only I could just melt away into the darkness of this closet...!`
`I mustn't remain in this room any longer.`
`I get the feeling I have more to worry about than just my personal safety...`
`But what should I do?!`
`I don't even know if it's a good idea to leave this closet...!!`
`Eventually, the clamber of many rushing footsteps approached.`
`I'll hold my breath again and melt away into the darkness of the closet...`
`Eva dashed back, bringing everyone with her.`
`Gohda was gripping some wire cutters to cut the chain with.`
`After trying to open the door again and confirming that the chain was still set, she yelled through the crack in the door.`
`"Dear!!`
` We're going to open this up...!!`
` Cut it right now!!"`
`"Y-Yes...!"`
`Gohda stuck the large wire cutter, which looked like it could slice off a whole finger, through the crack of the door...`
`and easily severed the chain.`
`"Dear!!"`
`As soon as it was severed, Eva pushed Gohda aside and dashed in.`
`The others tried to follow her, ......but they bumped into Eva, who had fallen to her knees, moaning.`
`So even though they couldn't tell much of what was going on inside the room, `
`...they could tell by Eva's moans that they were too late...`
`"...What the hell..."`
`"Dear...!! Deeeeeeeeeeeear!!`
` Doctor Nanjo!!`
` Look at my husband...! Quickly!!"`
`"I-I'll do it right now..."`
`"You've got to be kidding me...`
` ...It's only been about ten minutes since Uncle Hideyoshi went out saying he wanted to rest..."`
`"...Is there anyone in the bathroom?"`
`"N-No...!`
` There's no one here!"`
`"What could have happened, ...aaaaaahhhh..."`
`"Dear!!`
` Deeeeeeeeeeeeeeear...!!"`
`"......I'm afraid to say...that there's nothing I can do..."`
`Nanjo stood up, hanging his head sadly.`
`It was only natural.`
`Because anyone, even if they weren't a doctor, would think that at a glance.`
`...Hideyoshi...was lying face down on the bed.`
`And stuck deep into his back......was something like a blade with an intricate demonic design on it.`
`When Eva pulled it out with all her might,`
` they could tell that it wasn't a blade, but some kind of stake.`
`And its sharp tip had penetrated nearly 15 centimeters in.`
`It had probably dug deep into the lungs.`
`...If it had been stuck in any harder, the tip might even have pierced all the way through to the surface of his chest...`
`"Didn't I tell you to wait for me?!!`
` Why did you go on alone...?!!`
` Stupid, stupid,`
` stupiiiiiiiiid!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!"`
`"...The culprit probably waited for us to get careless and split up..."`
`"That bastard...`
` So he still hasn't had enough blood...?!"`
`"So he really is...hiding somewhere in this mansion...`
`...and coming after us...?"`
`"But there's something strange here.`
` ...The doors and windows to this room are completely sealed."`
`".........!`
` ...Th-That's right.`
` The shutters are all shut, and the door chain was set until a second ago..."`
`"Huh?!`
` But that's crazy...!`
` In that case, how did the culprit attack Hideyoshi-san in this room...?!"`
`"Maybe they threw this stake through the crack in the door...!"`
`"Hideyoshi-san's bed is in a total blind spot from this crack.`
` You couldn't even kill him with a gun.`
` ......This really is strange.`
` It's a closed room murder."`
`"...A-A closed room murder..."`
`"...It's a bit too early to be sure about that.`
` Maybe he removed the ceiling in the bathroom and escaped to the space above it, or maybe you can close the shutters from outside."`
`"The shutters.`
` ......They didn't budge an inch from the outside.`
` I just went and checked."`
`"...Erika......"`
`It's no wonder everything felt so quiet and relaxed.`
`At some point, Erika had split from the group.`
`Just now, she had finally arrived and poked her face in from the hallway.`
`...When she heard that a crime had occurred in this room,`
` she had watched everyone rush towards the room, but circled around to the outer wall herself.`
`And she had gone all by herself to check that the shutter was down on the window,`
` that you couldn't do anything with it from the outside, ...and that there was nothing out of the ordinary.`
`"Is the inside of the room just like usual...?"`
`"...There's no need to say it like that."`
`"My deepest condolences.`
` So? What's the situation inside the room?"`
`"............"`
`"...The chain was set on the door, so we cut it and entered."`
`"And all the windows have the shutters down.`
` They're locked tight from the inside."`
`"...What are they bickering about in there?"`
`Eva was arguing with Nanjo about something.`
`Apparently, she wanted to carry the corpse to the parlor.`
`Nanjo tried to calm her, saying that they should leave the crime scene as untouched as possible until the police came.`
`"What happened to the other corpses?!`
` The culprit carried them off somewhere, right?!`
` It may be that the culprit isn't satisfied with just killing, but intends to do something with the corpses...!!`
` So no way!`
` No way we're leaving my husband all alone here!!"`
`Eva does have a point.`
`After all, the victims before now have all been carried away after we were shown their terrible wounds.`
`"...Erika-chan,`
` ...you'd probably like to preserve the crime scene, but could you just let this one slide...?"`
`"...............`
`...Do whatever you want.`
` All I'm interested in is the fact that a closed room has appeared that's much more serious than Kinzo-san's study.`
` I have no interest in corpses, so do as you please."`
`"............"`
`Battler's expression was clearly unhappy,`
` ...but she ignored him completely.`
`"...Feel free to carry that corpse out anytime.`
` Or am I in the way?"`
`Erika backed away from the door to open a path.`
`...She showed no trace of any sadness for the dead.`
`Her eyes simply blazed with thoughts of this closed room murder that had appeared.`
`In any event, the great detective had given her permission.`
`...Eva and some others wrapped Hideyoshi up in the sheets, and Gohda and Rudolf carried him out...`
`The sheets were quickly stained red.`
`It was so painful to see that Shannon and Kumasawa stripped the blanket off the bed to further cover the corpse...`
`"...Hey, out of the way."`
`"Yes, I am out of the way."`
`"Let's go to the parlor."`
`"Y-Yes...!"`
`"Dear, deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeear, awaaaaaaaahhhhh...!!"`
`"...Listen up, everyone.`
` From now on, we'll always move as a group.`
` You must not let yourself be isolated."`
`"When the culprit attacked Genji, he probably got a master key.`
` It's clear that even locking up will no longer make you safe."`
`"B-But...even the chain was set. How did they do it...?!"`
`"...It's impossible...`
` The shutters and the chain were firmly set.`
` ...Even with a master key, it'd be impossible to force your way into that room...!"`
`"It must have been Beatrice-sama's doing, ...oooohhhhh..."`
`"...Th-There's no way Beatrice-sama did this...`
` ...The epitaph has been solved, so there shouldn't be any more reason to hold the ceremony..."`
`"Of course we can't understand it...`
` This would be impossible for anyone except a witch...!"`
`"...Impossible for anyone except a witch, ...you say?`
` <Good>!`
` Has a nice ring to it."`
`"Erika-chan, are you listening?`
` We've decided to stick together from now on.`
` First, we're carrying Hideyoshi-san's corpse to the parlor.`
` Can you hold off playing detective until we get there?"`
`"..............."`
`When she heard the words 'playing detective', Erika grimaced visibly.`
`Then, everyone stumbled out, and she took a single step into the now-empty guest room,`
` ......looked around, and burned that scene into her eyes.`
`...Erika claimed to have a photographic memory.`
`If that was true, those few seconds were more than enough for her.`
`Later on, she could sip black tea in the parlor while perusing the photograph of the scene inside her memory,`
` playing the part of an armchair detective...`
`Then, suddenly, her eyes stopped on the closet off to the side.`
`...A closet for hanging overcoats.`
`If it was large enough to fit a coat on a hanger,`
` ......a person should be able to hide in it.........`
`Slowly, ......Erika...`
`...stretched her hand out towards the closet......`
`".........!"`
`Erika's shoulder was grabbed roughly from behind.`
`"...Let's go, Ms. Detective.`
` Didn't you ever learn how to stick together on school field trips?"`
`"Well, whenever I go traveling, someone always dies."`
`"Hey, what do you think you're doing, brats?!`
` Come quickly...!!"`
`Rudolf told them to hurry.`
`After clicking her tongue and glaring at the closet, Erika followed Battler back to the parlor for the time being...`
`...The sound of their footsteps finally faded.`
`That time of terror, when I feared that even the dripping of the cold sweat covering my cheeks might be noticed,`
` had finally...ended.`
`With my hand that still couldn't stop trembling, I slowly opened the closet door and dashed out into the hallway.`
`It's okay, no one's found me...`
`Still, it's a good thing they didn't lock the door...`
`If they had, I wouldn't be able to lock it behind me after I left, and they'd find that suspicious...`
`Anyway, I should leave this place.`
`Then I'll return to my room and pretend that I was sleeping the whole time...`
`Yes, if I don't get back soon...`
`A new murder has occurred.`
`They'll probably try to tell me about it.`
`And they'll probably do it shortly after they carry Hideyoshi-san's corpse back to the parlor.`
`I can get around a phone call by saying I was asleep and didn't notice, but if they come knocking directly, that'll be bad...`
`I have to get back quickly, before they try to force their way in...`
`I don't know whether I should run all out noisily, hide my footsteps and walk in secret,`
` or walk around normally as though nothing has happened...!`
`At the very least, it'll be bad if I bump into them on their way back to the parlor.`
`Anyway, I'll head to my room...at a quick pace, without being noticed by anyone...!`
`I passed through the hallway...`
`to the lobby.`
`If I go up the big staircase in the lobby, ...my room is just a little bit...`
`"Natsuhi-san."`
`"Hya-......!!"`
`Just as she was about to go up the large staircase, Natsuhi heard Erika call out to her,`
` and was so surprised that she visibly jumped.`
`"...I was just about to go and tell you the news."`
`"Th-Thank you very much.`
` Did something happen...?"`
`"......Just now, Natsuhi-san.`
` You were climbing the stairs, right...?`
` Your room is upstairs, isn't it...?"`
`Erika coldly pointed out this strange fact.`
`...Natsuhi cursed her bad luck.`
`"I-I couldn't sleep, so I was going to return to the parlor,`
` ...b-but I wasn't sure whether I had locked my room or not, so I was about to head back.`
` ...I'm a worrier, so this sort of thing happens a lot.`
` Don't worry about it..."`
`"Yeah, that sort of thing does happen a lot.`
` It's a common quirk among people who aren't confident in their memory."`
`Normally, since Erika was clearly making fun of her, Natsuhi might have looked annoyed.`
`However, right now,`
` Natsuhi was extremely relieved to hear Erika admit that this sort of thing happened a lot...`
`"Why are you by yourself, Erika-san...?"`
`"I thought I'd investigate that guest room."`
`"Guest room...?"`
`"Yep.`
` This situation's gotten pretty serious, hasn't it?`
` And investigating the scene of the crime is my right."`
`...Erika's probing gaze peered deep into Natsuhi's eyes.`
`She could tell.`
`Erika already suspected Natsuhi.`
`...Judging by the subtle nuance in her words, she must be planning to make me slip up and reveal that I know about the crime with Hideyoshi...`
`when I supposedly haven't been told about it yet.`
`Natsuhi played dumb and asked what had happened again.`
`"..............."`
`".........`
`...I-Is something wrong...?"`
`"No. It's nothing.`
` ...This is just a repeat of the first crime, isn't it?"`
`"What do you mean...?"`
`"Again, you were in your room.`
` And again, you can't prove your alibi, can you?"`
`"...I don't know what you mean.`
` To turn it around, how can you prove that I wasn't in my room...?"`
`"Ah, that.`
` Then let's take this one step at a time.`
` ...Please worry about your lock later.`
` I have something vitally important to discuss with everyone."`
`"I'll come back after I check my lock.`
` Please get started without me."`
`"...Hideyoshi-san has been killed.`
` We'll be talking about that."`
`"...Wh-What...?!"`
`She had planned on using the need to check her lock as an excuse to escape to her own room, `
`...after which, she would claim to have a sudden headache and stay in bed the rest of the time.`
`However, now that she had been informed of Hideyoshi's murder...`
`It would be clearly suspicious to postpone that and escape to her room.`
`...She was already under suspicion just because she'd been seen heading up the stairs to the second floor.`
`She couldn't afford to do anything else suspicious...`
`Natsuhi gave up and headed for the parlor as Erika had urged her to do...`
`When she opened the door to the parlor, Eva's sobs poured out.`
`And everyone glanced at Natsuhi with grave faces.`
`Those gazes almost made it look...as though they suspected Natsuhi.`
`It was now painfully apparent to Natsuhi.`
`This must have been what that man was after.`
`It was a trap to create a baffling closed room mystery...and try to frame her for it.`
`However, she couldn't have resisted.`
`She couldn't sacrifice her husband's life...!`
`And while it's true I hid in the closet, that's all I did.`
`I definitely haven't committed murder!`
`I might be extremely suspicious, but I'm not the culprit.`
`And most importantly, I'm not under suspicion yet.`
`...I'll tell the police everything.`
`I'll have to endure until then.`
`I'm sure one of the servants is a traitor.`
`Even in a situation like this, if I mention my husband being held hostage,`
` the culprit will hear...and might use it as an excuse to kill him...`
`"Natsuhi-san has just come back.`
` Now that we're all here, I have something very important to discuss with you all."`
`"...Something very important...?"`
`"Yes, it's very important.`
` ...I'd like to lay out everything in front of you all, starting with the first crime."`
`"Then please do that with just the others.`
` I think we should leave that sort of thing to the police.`
` I'm not interested."`
`"Since I have it all laid out, this is a very important thing to discuss.`
` Neither you nor anyone else has the right to refuse."`
`"Wha, ........."`
`Erika used her detective's authority to proclaim the start of an assembly.`
`None of the pieces could disobey.`
`Praying that she wouldn't become the topic of conversation, Natsuhi reluctantly sat on the sofa as she'd been urged to.`
`"......Oh, sorry.`
` Could you close that door for me?"`
`""Y-Yes...""`
`Shannon and Kanon closed the door.`
`...Since it had been decided a short while ago to lock all doors and windows carefully, Kanon locked it.`
`That lock, which existed to protect the safety of this room, `
`...felt like a lock on a prison cell to Natsuhi, ...one that would hold her in place and prevent any escape...`
`...Natsuhi still hadn't noticed.`
`Though Erika had gone into the corridor to check the crime scene in Hideyoshi's room, ...her goal had changed.`
`In other words, from Erika's point of view, the sound of that lock was truly...`
`"Checkmate."`
`Erika said that suddenly.`
`Bernkastel said that suddenly.`
`"Oh, fast!`
` Wow, so you've figured out the culprit already?`
` We've barely gotten to any of the crimes, right?`
` You could've just let me kill a few more and gathered a few clues yourself."`
`"......Okay, Lambda, gather all the pieces.`
` Now we're getting to the most interesting part.`
` Let's both enjoy it to the fullest."`
`"Well, let's see...`
` Why don't you show me what you've got?`
` *giggle*giggle*...!!"`
`"To think she'd lay down the challenge without waiting for game set at 24:00...!`
` What a hasty person, that Lady Bernkastel...!"`
`"It is quite an early challenge.`
` To think that she's already managed to obtain a winning hand at this stage..."`
`"...Normally, you can win by just claiming that a witch exists,`
` ...but with Natsuhi and Kinzo, we've got a lot we need to protect this time.`
` ...Sounds like this fight'll be a pain."`
`"That's no problem at all!`
` I won't let them do as they please with my golden island any longer...!!`
` Bring it on, Lady Bernkastel!`
` Furudo Erika!"`
`...In the Golden Land, the endless rain continued to fall.`
`Battler was nowhere to be seen.`
`It would very soon reach the time that Battler had joined in on the 5th game,`
` and control of the pieces would be passed on to Battler.`
`In other words, he would only be officially added to the game now, in this final stage, `
`where Bernkastel had pinpointed the culprit.`
`So, he had left the arbor a short while ago.`
`Now, the only ones in sight were Virgilia, who continued to knit silently,`
` ......and Beato, ...who just sat there blankly amidst the smell of her black tea, `
`not even putting the cup to her lips......`
`Virgilia stopped knitting for a moment...`
`...and looked out across the vast golden rose garden that extended as far as the eye could see.`
`"...I believe it's safe to say...that at least in the game over who the culprit is, `
`...Battler has gained such strength that he will never surrender again."`
`"..............."`
`"By the 4th game, you had sent him all your messages.`
` ......In other words, ...at this time, Battler-kun is capable of realizing the truth at any moment.`
` ......However, he is still soft in some ways.`
` ...So,`
` even if the games continue like this a hundred times,`
` he won't solve it for all eternity.`
` He'll just wander forever, like someone trying to find the blue bird."`
`And that is......you, Beatrice.`
`It's the same for you.`
`Even if this game continues hundreds more times.`
`You will never reach the answer you seek...for all eternity.`
`Bernkastel will abuse this game without a doubt.`
`Lambdadelta will also churn this game about with the utmost arrogance.`
`At a glance, that may be humiliating and appear to you and Battler as though the game has been stolen from you.`
`......However.`
`That is something the two of you need right now.`
`To end Battler's naive softness.`
`To end your hesitation.`
`"And that's why...`
`you called the two of them here.`
` To end the eternal torture between you."`
`"..............."`
`"Those two will bring you either victory or defeat.`
` But no matter how it goes, that result has already been filled with compassion.`
` ......You should understand that as well by now."`
`Virgilia faced Beato, whom she had come to adore as a daughter,`
` ...with cold eyes that she must not have shown often.`
`It was like the gaze of a mother who, instead of scolding, silently urges their child to recognize their mistake.`
`"Beatrice,`
` ......how long do you intend to stay there, `
`...neither alive...`
`nor dead?`
` ......Not rising up to heaven...`
`nor falling into hell,`
` there on the peak of Mount Purgatory...?"`
`"............"`
`"I am Virgilia.`
` I have guided him through Purgatory and brought him to you at its peak.`
` ...And you are Beatrice.`
` You must choose whether to take his hand and rise up to heaven or grab him and fall into hell."`
`Did you know that the discord called Purgatory, which lies in the gap between heaven and hell,`
` is sometimes more torturous than even hell itself...?`
`On the gates of hell, it is written that you must abandon all hope.`
`...A human without hope can accept their suffering and give up.`
`However, the residents of Purgatory have hope.`
`A hope of possibly reaching heaven, a hope that cannot be abandoned.`
`And it tortures them.`
`Even in the depths of hell, ...no greater torture device exists than the single pin known as hope...`
`"Fly.`
` Fly from the cliffs of Purgatory.`
` ...Take with you the regrets caused by your fleeting, fragile, foolish hopes and open up Pandora's box.`
` Are you scared?`
` Scared of opening the box?"`
`Beato was silent,`
` ......but with a single tear, she nodded slightly.`
`"Is the cat in the box alive or dead?`
` The time has now come...to check.`
` ...If the cat is dead, quickly hold a funeral for it and have it rise to heaven.`
` If the cat is alive, quickly feed it and give it all of your affection.`
` Whether it is alive or dead,`
` your cat box eternally desecrates the cat.`
` ......The key to the box that you were afraid to open...has been brought to you by those two."`
`Beatrice.`
`It's time for you to die now.`
`I hope...`
`I hope that your heart is stopped...`
`...by the hand of the person you desire.`
`......All of the pieces from the game board were gathered.`
`All of the Humans, furniture, witches, and the witches on an even higher level...`
`...had gathered in one place.`
`That place was like a solemn cathedral, with an unbelievably high ceiling.`
`White stonework.`
`Golden ornaments.`
`Though there were windows, there were no entrances or exits.`
`It was a strange, strange place.`
`But for some reason, no one wondered where this strange place was.`
`...Because they were not given the right to think of this place as strange.`
`"The pieces.`
` Have they all been gathered?"`
`"Yes, they have."`
`"Well done.`
` ...What a show.`
` I wonder just how many people there are here."`
`".........No matter how many we see, every being outside the 18 is a phantom."`
`"Making you acknowledge them is what my game's all about.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`The three witches were seated on special thrones set upon a very high balcony.`
`In the center sat the Game Master, Lambdadelta,`
` and on either side of the semicircular balcony sat Bernkastel and Beatrice, facing each other.`
`Below them, Erika ran forward, lifted the corners of her skirt and bowed respectfully.`
`"Great Lady Lambdadelta, we thank you for granting our request for an assembly.`
` ...And Great Lady Bernkastel, my master,`
` please look forward to it.`
` Though it may be only for a short while, I will most certainly make my master forget about the poison that torments her."`
`"Yes, I am looking forward to it.`
` ......I'd expect no less from my double,`
` my piece."`
`Erika and Bernkastel exchanged cruel smiles that'd make anyone want to avert their gaze.`
`"Listen up, witches and Humans!!`
` I hereby announce that with this assembly of witches gathered, the Court of Illusions will now begin!!"`
`The commander of the game spoke with words of power.`
`Though her words were spoken within such a vast space, `
`they rang out with the force of a bell in a bell tower...`
`"Your lives and roles as they correspond to this game are over!`
` The 5th game is now closed, and the 24:00 answer session shall begin!`
` ...Well, I'd like to get started quickly, but why don't we have everyone quickly introduce themselves first?`
` After all, there are so many people here."`
`"Heheheheh!`
` I am Lambdadelta!`
` The Witch of Certainty and the new commander of this game!"`
`"......Bernkastel.`
` Witch of Miracles.`
` ...My goal is to penetrate Beatrice's Illusion of the Witch."`
`"I am the Endless Witch, Beatrice.`
` My goals are to claim my own existence and to protect Natsuhi and Kinzo."`
`"..............."`
`"...Battler-sama,`
` you come next in rank."`
`"......I'm Ushiromiya Battler.`
` I'm fighting against Beato's......no, against the witches.`
` ...That's all."`
`"As I believe you know, you joined in on this game partway through.`
` At the time this assembly of witches opens, you have yet to participate.`
` Do you understand...?"`
`"I get it.`
` ...You probably mean I don't have the right to speak for a while, right?"`
`"Thank you for understanding."`
`Even though Battler held a rank near that of witches, `
`he sat on the foremost of the benches shared with the other relatives, all by himself at one end.`
`He met the gaze of Beato, who was up on the balcony.`
`"You might've said you were my arch-enemy."`
`"......Well, you aren't necessarily my only enemy."`
`"Hmph...`
` ......Let's take this game back.`
` It belongs to us."`
`".........Yeah."`
`I almost said I was fighting against Beato's Illusion of the Witch.`
`......Since the beginning, Beato has been my only enemy.`
`But...right now, Erika and those witches who started toying around with Beato's tale...`
`...are also my enemies.`
`Who should I fight and how?`
`Maybe it's a good thing I don't have the right to speak for a while.`
`I'll calm down and coolly watch over everything...`
`"I am the detective and the one who called for this assembly of witches, Furudo Erika.`
` I will expose the culprit of the 5th game and stick a charming period on the end of this tale."`
`Erika greeted the witches above her and the Humans behind her once again.`
`"I'm also looking forward to it.`
` Okay, remaining pieces, introduce yourselves in whatever order."`
`"Humans!`
` Introduce yourselves, all of you...!"`
`When 45 urged him to introduce himself, Kinzo stood up.`
`"...I'm Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
` I slipped out of the study window and am hiding somewhere on Rokkenjima."`
`"Ushiromiya Krauss.`
` Currently, I have been captured and am being confined somewhere."`
`"I'm Ushiromiya Eva.`
` I'm alive."`
`"I'm Rudolf.`
` ...The rest of us are all Ushiromiyas too, so I'll leave off the family name."`
`"I'm Ushiro-, ...Rosa.`
` I was killed on the first twilight."`
`"Jessica.`
` I also died on the first twilight."`
`"I'm George.`
` ...I also died on the first twilight."`
`"Maria.`
` I died, but look, I'm here talking.`
` See?`
` Dying isn't a big deal, right?`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`"I'm Ushiromiya Natsuhi.`
` ...I am alive."`
`"......Heheheheheheheh."`
`"............Gah..."`
`"Hideyoshi here.`
` I was killed just a short while ago."`
`"Kyrie.`
` I'm still alive."`
`"Nanjo...`
` I am also hanging in there..."`
`"My name is Genji.`
` ......I passed away on the first twilight."`
`"I'm Shannon.`
` ...I'm still alive."`
`"I'm Kanon.`
` I'm also alive."`
`"I-I'm Gohda.`
` Pleased to meet you, everyone..."`
`"I am Kumasawa...`
` Pleased to meet you..."`
`"Now, on to the witches!`
` Everyone, introduce yourselves!"`
`Virgilia's group could also be seen.`
`Unlike the floor Beato's group was on, the second floor had a balcony that looked like raised audience seating,`
` and they sat there, looking down as though they were at a theater...`
`"......My name is Virgilia.`
` I am Beatrice's teacher."`
`"I'm Gaap.`
` Making corpses disappear is my job."`
`"Ronove.`
` I'm in charge of making black tea.`
` Pu ku ku..."`
`"I greet you in the name of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory.`
` I served in the murder of Hideyoshi on the second twilight."`
`""""""The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here!""""""`
`"Let us then have Lady Erika's furniture introduce themselves."`
`"Gertrude.`
` I am an Assistant Inquisitor of Heresy."`
`"Cornelia.`
` I am an Assistant Inquisitor of Heresy."`
`The two of them could also be seen on the second-floor audience seating.`
`They sat apart from Virgilia's group.`
`Then, ...Dlanor, who was seated between the two, slowly stood up.`
`She had a presence and dignity about her, as though she was overseeing everything from that place.`
`"Dlanor A. Knox is my NAME.`
` ......I am Lady Erika's primary ASSISTANT."`
`"............"`
`"Battler,`
` I expect much from YOU.`
` Please don't disappoint ME."`
`"...Let's just both give it all we've got."`
`"Most of the time, there will be no need for Dlanor to step forward.`
` However, when the witch side plays around with ugly word games, I'll need to have Dlanor convict them.`
` ...A miracle like the one in the study won't happen again."`
`"............"`
`"And finally, let us introduce ourselves.`
` We are the Chiester Sisters Imperial Guards, who have been tasked with management of proceedings at this assembly of witches."`
`"H-Hello everyone...!!"`
`"Nyeh nyeh♪"`
`"This ends the introductions of all pieces.`
` A total of 38 people are present here!"`
`There are 38 characters in the 5th game, `
`but if you added all the pieces from previous games too, it would probably rise even higher.`
`This game, which has so often been likened to chess, now has far more pieces than a chessboard.`
`"Very well.`
` Then I guess we'll get started.`
` Let the person who called this meeting begin!`
` ...Oh, excuse me, Mr. Goat.`
` Refill my drink."`
`"...And some popcorn for me."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` ......The one who decided demons ought to eat popcorn when watching a play ~ib~was you~ib~, after all."`
`"Yes, I intend to enjoy this.`
` ......And could I get some black tea and mustard miso?`
` Erika, begin.`
` I'm already starting to get bored."`
`"Yes, my master, leave it to me...!!`
` Order!! Silence!"`
`At the sound of her voice, the Chiester Sisters Corps straightened up, lifted their right knees, and stamped down hard on the floor with their heels.`
`It became a low, deep rumble in the ground, and all chatter in the cathedral disappeared instantly...`
`as their eyes and expressions became even more hollow and empty.`
`...The room fell back into silence, almost as though they were a collection of wax models...`
`Amidst this heavy silence, there was the sound of footsteps...`
`as Erika walked out into the center, where she could catch everyone's attention.`
`When she signaled with her chin, a goat attendant appeared from behind a pillar...`
`...and carried a single, plain chair out into the front and center of the room.`
`It must have been...the defendant's chair.`
`"I, Furudo Erika, will make an accusation.`
` The murderer of the 5th game is..."`
`"Ushiromiya Natsuhi-san.`
` You are the culprit."`
`Erika pointed at Natsuhi and spoke...`
`The Natsuhi wax doll alone...shook and regained its expression.`
`...It was an expression of panic.`
`"Chiester Sisters,`
` please take the defendant to her chair."`
`"Understood."`
`"Wait, ...what are you doing?!!`
` Let go of me!!"`
`45 and 410 both pinned Natsuhi's arms behind her back...`
`and led her to the chair in the center.`
`Natsuhi resisted, but the Chiester Sisters were surprisingly strong, and she couldn't do anything.`
`She turned to the relatives for help, but they just remained silent like wax models...`
`"I, Furudo Erika,`
` will now reconstruct why the crime was only possible for Ushiromiya Natsuhi."`
`"......Beato,`
` of course, you'll be challenging this, right?"`
`"Naturally.`
` I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, Beatrice the Golden.`
` ...Furudo Erika, I challenge you.`
` I'll take these false accusations you're trying to place on my master...`
`and tear them apart!!"`
`"B-Beatrice...!"`
`"Fear not, Natsuhi.`
` You are my master.`
` And you are the true Head, with the One-Winged Eagle engraved in your heart.`
` Do not fear a crime you have not committed."`
`At those words, Natsuhi jerked back...and gulped.`
`Her panic finally disappeared, and she stood up straight.`
`"...Th-That's true...!`
` I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi!`
` I will confront any challenge that would disgrace the Ushiromiya family!"`
`"......*giggle*`
` How can you try a bluff like that in a situation like this?`
` ...You really are the bullied kid in every single Fragment."`
`"So, Bern,`
` make your claims."`
`"I, Bernkastel, claim...`
`that a Human, Ushiromiya Natsuhi, is the culprit of this game."`
`"And you too Beato, okay?"`
`"I, Beatrice, claim...`
`that the culprit in this game is not Human!`
` I am the culprit!"`
`Bernkastel, who smiled daringly, and Beatrice, who smiled firmly, crossed gazes.`
`"Listen, witches and Humans!!`
` Two claims have appeared for a single truth!`
` Is the culprit a Human, Ushiromiya Natsuhi?`
` Is the culprit a witch, Beatrice?!"`
`"If the witch wins, the truth about the 5th game will disappear into darkness.`
` If Erika wins, the Illusion of the Witch will be wiped from the game board.`
` ...In other words, for Beato alone, this is a battle that must not be lost. Are you prepared?"`
`"And what am I supposed be preparing myself for?`
` This has always been just what I wanted...!"`
`...If Erika wins, the Illusion of the Witch will be destroyed.`
`That means the existence of the witch will be denied.`
`Beato was fighting for her life.`
`However, this wasn't the only time she had been fighting for her life.`
`...It had always been a life-or-death struggle, even when she fought with Battler.`
`...Because if Battler had won and destroyed the Illusion of the Witch in the previous games,`
` Beato would have been destroyed.`
`"...That's dirty.`
` Erika alone has nothing to lose if she fails."`
`"I wonder.`
` ...Lady Bernkastel is not a compassionate person.`
` ...I can't imagine she'd give warm treatment to a piece that didn't perform to her expectations..."`
`It was inconceivable that the ruthless Bernkastel would place no blame at all on a piece who had suffered defeat.`
`...Erika was probably fighting for her life just as much.`
`The two claims would clash, and one would be weeded out.`
`One would fall...and would not leave this place alive...`
`The only ones who truly had nothing to lose...were those witches.`
`"OK, no problems!`
` Get started!!"`
`"......In that case, `
`I would like to go first.`
` The murder of Hideyoshi-san is very simple.`
` It should be impossible to suspect anyone other than Natsuhi-san.`
` Except for the victim and Natsuhi-san, all of us were in the same room, correct?"`
`It really was simple.`
`...Except for Natsuhi, everyone had been inside the parlor.`
`And because it was so simple, it was decisive...`
`"...No matter how you look at it, the one who killed Hideyoshi was Natsuhi.`
` No, it's the other way around.`
` ...No matter how you look at it, no one except for Natsuhi could have killed Hideyoshi.`
` There's no room for discussion or debate."`
`"I-I'm telling you, that's a mistake...!!`
` Maybe I don't have an alibi.`
` However, I don't believe a lack of an alibi proves that one is the culprit...!"`
`"Hmph, we know that Natsuhi is the only one without an alibi.`
` But wait.`
` The scene of the murder was a closed room.`
` It should've been impossible for anyone, including Natsuhi, to have committed the crime in that room.`
` Except for me, since I could've done it with magic."`
`"I'll explain the closed room trick--the 'how dunnit'--later.`
` For the time being, I'll start with the 'who dunnit'.`
` ...Because of the aforementioned, it's impossible to suspect any character except Natsuhi-san regarding the murder of Hideyoshi-san."`
`"......Milady,`
` it may be dangerous to press any further on this."`
`"I agree.`
` It's a fact that Natsuhi was hiding in the closet of Hideyoshi's room.`
` ...When it comes to repeating things in red, they'll check to see who's in the room, and you'll be cornered."`
`"...Probably.`
` Lady Lambdadelta is the commander of this game.`
` ...If it suits her fancy, she'll set up Natsuhi as the culprit regardless of the facts."`
`If the typhoon passes and the police come to perform a scientific investigation,`
` perhaps the true culprit will be identified, and the false accusations against Natsuhi will be lifted.`
`However, in this closed-off Rokkenjima, the police will not arrive for all eternity.`
`...In other words, the real truth will not be revealed.`
`Inside this cat box that will never be opened, false charges that everyone accepts are worth no more or less than the truth.`
`"Their aim is most likely to use the simple murder of Hideyoshi to give the impression that Natsuhi-sama is the culprit...`
`before moving on to the first twilight's reconstruction, which has more uncertain elements."`
`"It's not good at all to move forward with the Game Master suspecting us.`
` We should take the initiative."`
`"Sure.`
` .........Lady Lambdadelta!`
` As you are well aware, a fair number of murders were committed during the 5th game,`
`"Skipping to Hideyoshi's murder `
`and stepping backwards and forwards in time will only lead to confusion.`
` It is my belief that we should follow events chronologically and in order, though the decision is yours, of course."`
`"Objection.`
` In the process of prosecuting the culprit, chronological order has no significance."`
`"Objection.`
` Furudo Erika is trying to mix up the chronological sequence in order to create a false impression of the events."`
`"Well, I'm not a fan of confusing things myself.`
` I accept Beato's claim.`
` Erika, start with the first twilight instead of jumping to the second."`
`".........Tch."`
`I definitely saw Erika click her tongue.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`...I understand.`
` So, this is ~ib~a way of telling Rokkenjima's tale~ib~.`
`I was guided by Virgilia, met Beatrice,`
` ...reached the peak from which you can see everything below you, and finally understood the truth of this world.`
`"This is...that thing you were talking about earlier, Virgilia."`
`"......Yes, that's right.`
` Truth is very fragile in this place."`
`"As long as each side makes its own claim, different truths can exist at the same time..."`
`Yes.`
`This really is a trial.`
`Both sides put forth their own truths.`
`This here truly is the Braun tube trial that Virgilia once used as an analogy...`
`"Then I will follow Lady Lambdadelta's orders and start from the first crime at the first twilight.`
` As you know, at 24:00 on October 4th, the first day, `
`following a short break in the family conference, Natsuhi left on her own, saying that she was going to bed early.`
` Therefore, her alibi is completely lost from that time until the next morning."`
`"Oh, is that so?`
` I believe there are several people besides Natsuhi who have dubious alibis.`
` Unless you can clear suspicion from all of them, I cannot allow you to call Natsuhi the culprit."`
`"True.`
` If Erika's gonna call Natsuhi suspicious so confidently, `
`she's first gotta show that everyone else has an alibi.`
` Right, Bern?"`
`"......Yes, of course.`
` Erika will explain that perfectly."`
`"Of course, my master...!`
` In that case, I would like to explain things in order.`
` Let's forget about Genji's murder for now and focus on the crime in the guesthouse.`
` For this case, you'd like to suspect the servants who were in the guesthouse, right?`
` On that night, Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san were there.`
` Isn't that right, you two?"`
`When she turned to face the direction where those two were seated, ...those two wax models alone came back to life.`
`They probably weren't even granted souls until they were allowed to speak.`
`In that case, it would've been better if Natsuhi's soul could've disappeared as well...`
`...Natsuhi, who was in the defendant's chair, kept her soul the whole time, and was constantly hanging her head, looking nervous...`
`Gohda hurried to his feet and answered Erika's question.`
`"Y-Yes, that is correct.`
` On that evening, I was alone in the guesthouse servant room..."`
`"Well, look at my age.`
` Staying up all night would be a heavy burden, `
`so I returned to the waiting room in the guesthouse and went to bed right away on my own, ...yes, yes...!"`
`"...Doesn't that mean Gohda and Kumasawa have lost their alibis?!!`
` Kumasawa claims that she was sleeping alone in the waiting room.`
` Gohda claims he was alone in the servant room.`
` Either of them should have had enough time to go to the cousin room and commit murder!!"`
`"N-N-Nonsense...!`
` Why would we do something like that...?!"`
`"That's right, that's right...!`
` How could I ever kill someone...?!"`
`"Natsuhi said it all.`
` Both Kumasawa, who was sleeping alone in the waiting room, and Gohda, who was alone in the servant room,`
` are in the exact same situation as Natsuhi in her room.`
` Both of them have lost their alibis."`
`"Have no fear.`
` I guarantee that neither of these two are murderers.`
` First off, following dinner, Kumasawa-san left the mansion with me and the others and went to the guesthouse,`
` entered the waiting room, and slept until morning.`
` It's the same for Gohda-san.`
` Once he finished with his job, he chatted with us in the lounge and went to sleep afterwards.`
` Neither of them had the opportunity to commit murder."`
`"Hmph.`
` So, we're finally here."`
`"...I see it's time for me to stand up as well.`
` Your turn is over already, Erika.`
` ...Go summon that bodyguard you rely on so much."`
`Beato glanced at where Dlanor sat on the second-floor audience seating.`
`...However, Dlanor just stared back with those usual expressionless eyes.`
`"Repeat it.`
` 'We have absolute proof of Gohda and Kumasawa's alibis'."`
`"We refuse.`
` ......Why give a hint to an enemy?`
` There's no way we'd answer."`
`"Aha.`
` Did you hear that, Lady Lambdadelta?`
` They say they have no proof!`
` How could they claim that Gohda and Kumasawa have alibis without proof?!"`
`"Good point.`
` What do you say, Bern, Erika?`
` How can you claim that Gohda and Kumasawa have alibis?"`
`"Fall back, Erika.`
` My opponent is Dlanor over there.`
` A mere Human like you can be no match for a witch!"`
`"..............."`
`"No.`
` There's no need for Dlanor to step forward.`
` ......In fact, it's precisely because a mere Human will defeat a witch... that the Illusion of the Witch will now be denied.`
` ...So go ahead.`
` Use the red and blue as much as you like.`
` ...I'm ready for it, okay?"`
`In response to Erika's challenge, Beato smiled boldly yet gracefully and slowly stood up.`
`And they glared at each other between the floor and the balcony...`
`"#5decffGohda and Kumasawa have no alibis.`
` The two of them were in the guesthouse and could have reached the cousin room to commit murder at any time.`
` Unless you can deny that possibility, you cannot treat Natsuhi as the culprit.#ffffff"`
`Beato's blue truth struck out rapidly.`
`The curtain had finally dropped, and the battle had begun...`
`"...A Human like Erika can't use any red.`
` How could she turn this around without calling Dlanor?"`
`"Though Erika cannot use it, her master, Lady Bernkastel, can.`
` ...We mustn't let our guards down."`
`"Blue truth, valid.`
` ...What'll you do, Bern?`
` Will you or Dlanor step in instead?"`
`"It is still not my TURN.`
` And it is not Lady Bernkastel's turn EITHER."`
`"...Yes, that's right.`
` There's no need for us to show up for something like this.`
` ...This is important precisely because a mere Human like Furudo Erika will defeat you, Beato."`
`"......Because you'll be defeated by a Human, we'll know.`
` We'll all know that the fake witch who calls herself 'Beatrice the Golden' is nothing more than a sub-Human phantom."`
`"*giggle*giggle*...`
` If you really could do that, it'd be totally entertaining...`
` Very well, Erika.`
` Let's see what you've got...!"`
`"Explaining it for the first person, Kumasawa-san, is extremely simple.`
` Kumasawa-san, stand."`
`"...Y-Yes...!"`
`"Kumasawa-san, from the time you went to bed last night to the time you were informed about the crime in the morning,`
` did you ever leave the waiting room?"`
`"No!`
` I was sound asleep until morning, I really was!!"`
`"The truth is...`
`...after dinner last night, I had a chat with Eva-san, and she told me something very interesting.`
` ...I tried that out myself."`
`"And what exactly is 'that'...?`
` ...You don't mean..."`
`"That's right.`
` It's what cornered and sealed Kinzo in his study.`
` ...I learned that you can create a seal by putting something between a door and the frame."`
`"......Are you kidding...?`
` Did she actually...do that to Kumasawa-san's waiting room?!"`
`"Erika was in the guesthouse, so there's no obstacle to her having been capable of that."`
`"After all, it was an unsettling night, and a massive amount of gold had just been discovered.`
` Many sorts of crimes might have occurred.`
` ...Where there is a detective, there will be a crime.`
` I foresaw that some kind of crime would take place, so I used this to seal away people whose alibis might otherwise be lost."`
`Erika held a small, folded piece of brown paper high in the air.`
`"After I watched Kumasawa-san, who returned to the guesthouse with me, say goodnight and enter the waiting room, `
`I used this to seal the door.`
` Then, in the morning,`
` when the crime was discovered and caused a big uproar, I immediately went to check Kumasawa-san's waiting room,`
` where I confirmed that the seal was still set.`
` Therefore, I can prove Kumasawa-san's alibi!"`
`"......<Good>.`
` A wonderful alibi. Not a single gap.`
` Kumasawa returned to the guesthouse with Erika, went to the waiting room to sleep, and never left the room until morning.`
` #ff0000In other words, after Kumasawa returned to the guesthouse, she never went to the second floor until morning.#ffffff"`
`The proof Erika had shown was elevated by Bernkastel and became red truth.`
`This truth, which had become red, could no longer be overturned, even by Beato...`
`In other words, in that instant, Kumasawa's perfect alibi had been absolutely guaranteed.`
`"Hohoh!`
` Then what about Gohda?!"`
`"Gohda-san holed up in the servant room right after reaching the guesthouse.`
` I sealed him up in the same way.`
` Then, when Rosa-san returned at 1:00 AM, I happened to notice her when I stepped out into the corridor.`
` I let Gohda-san, who was still in the servant room, know this."`
`"At that moment, the seal was still in place, so from the time we arrived at the guesthouse until 1:00 AM, `
`Gohda-san never left the servant room.`
` And afterwards, he was with me in the lounge until 3:00 AM.`
` And after 3:00 AM, I was on the second floor, `
`so I can guarantee that Gohda-san didn't come up to the second floor."`
`"......Erika's seal proves that Gohda was holed up in the servant room until 1:00 AM.`
` And Erika has proven his alibi from `
`then until 3:00 AM, since she was passing the time in the lounge with him.`
` And Erika has also proven that he never set foot `
`on the second floor until the morning after."`
`"#ff0000In other words, after Gohda returned to the guesthouse, he never went up to the second floor until morning.#ffffff"`
`"Red truth, valid.`
` ...Well done, Erika.`
` The alibi due to your seal on that door has been acknowledged by Bern and elevated to the status of red truth."`
`"Thank you very much, my master.`
` ...I am the detective! I may be Human, but I can use the red truth despite that and surpass Humans!"`
`"So now you claim to have surpassed Humans...`
` It's a thousand years too early for you to talk like that, conceited brat!"`
`"It'll be a pain to have you try anything funny, so I'll make this clear now.`
` In fact, I should've done this in the beginning.`
` I apologize for being so roundabout.`
` This is the situation around the guesthouse at 24:00."`
`"......The gold was found, an emergency family meeting was called for, and Battler-san went to the mansion with the relatives.`
` I, the three cousins, Doctor Nanjo, Gohda-san, and Kumasawa-san remained in the guesthouse."`
`"I have already explained Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san's alibis.`
` George-san, Jessica-san, and Maria-san were playing cards in the cousin room.`
` I actually joined them for a just little bit, and I clearly witnessed that they were alive at that time."`
`"My master, I ask that you repeat this!!"`
`"Yes, I'll respond.`
` #ff0000At 24:00 in the guesthouse, George, Jessica, and Maria were alive `
`and in the second floor cousin room.`
` Nanjo, Gohda, and Kumasawa were on the first floor.#ffffff"`
`"And, since there's no need to hold off on it anymore,`
` I'll confirm that all the victims so far are dead.`
` #ff0000George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, and Genji really are dead.`
` #ffffffHow could they be playing dead with their necks sliced open like that?"`
`"Thanks for repeating that, my master...!`
` If we hadn't made these things clear, you might have started going on about how they were already dead before I guaranteed everyone's alibis,`
` or that they weren't actually dead at all."`
`"......Gah..."`
`Unsurprisingly, Beato's side couldn't get away with the simple plan of claiming that the victims were only playing dead.`
`But in order to overcome Gohda and Kumasawa's alibis, it should've been possible to suppose that the crime occurred before those doors were sealed.`
`However, the opponent had predicted this move perfectly.`
`It had been shown in red that the crime did not occur before the time period covered by Erika's alibis.`
`"Got it.`
` That's the last time the victims were confirmed to be alive.`
` I wish you'd said that in the beginning.`
` ...This means we can ignore everything that happened before 24:00."`
`"......To go even further, `
`#ff0000at 24:00, Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji were in a corridor on the second floor of the mansion.`
` All the remaining people were at the family conference in the dining hall.`
` Of course, at that point in time, no murder had occurred.`
` Genji was also alive.#ffffff"`
`"This isn't something Erika observed,`
` but we can't move the game forward without settling it.`
` Very well, I'll acknowledge that red truth."`
`"Thank you very much for that red truth, my master!"`
`Since Erika had been in the guesthouse,`
` it was only natural that she could explain the situation there.`
`However, since she hadn't been in the mansion at the time,`
` explaining the situation over there would have been extremely difficult for her.`
`...Beato would normally have attacked there with the blue truth, `
`saying that the people in the dining hall had all agreed to keep to the same story, `
`that someone had snuck out of the dining hall, and that they might have committed murder in the guesthouse.`
`However, because Bern had instantly settled that matter with the red text,`
` Beato had completely lost her chance to strike back...`
`"Dammit........."`
`"...Very troublesome.`
` ...To think we would be put at such a disadvantage..."`
`"This is almost the exact opposite of Riiche's fights with Battler..."`
`"...In fact, the situation might be even worse than it was back then."`
`At a glance, the fight between the two of them resembled our previous fights.`
`However, there were some vital differences.`
`The first was whether or not Beato was the Game Master.`
`The Beato who fought against me was the Game Master.`
`So she knew all the truth.`
`That's why she was able to use the red text at will.`
`However, the current Beato isn't the Game Master.`
`She's just a single piece on the game board.`
`...In other words, even Beato doesn't know the truth.`
`So you could say that Beato is now in the same position I once was.`
`Also, though Erika may seem to be in the same position I once was,`
` the situation for her is totally different.`
`She's connected to the witch called Bernkastel.`
`...Even though she isn't the Game Master, she's capable of elevating Erika's statements to become red truth.`
`Because of this, Erika can use the red truth, even though she's neither a witch nor the Game Master.`
`Beato, who's supposed to be the witch, possesses no truth nor red she can use.`
`And yet the detective, Erika, can use the red truth.`
`The advantage has completely flipped over to the other side.`
`...Perhaps you could say that the current Beato is in a much worse position than I was when I fought with her.`
`After I got used to the game, Beato stopped responding to my demands that she use the red,`
` but in the beginning, she had responded to almost all of them, giving me quite a few hints.`
`That's why we were able to fight on par.`
`However, Bernkastel is different.`
`She fully understands the rules of this game...and is prepared to corner Beato without even a hint of restraint.`
`......And because of this, I knew.`
`In the past, ...Beato went easy on me so that we could fight on par with each other...`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...`
` This has become quite an amusing fight.`
` ...I see, so I must fight from the position Battler once stood in."`
`"......Beato..."`
`"In the past, I've insulted you and called you incompetent.`
` ...I can handle much, much worse than this. *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"It's now impossible to suspect Gohda and Kumasawa.`
` You can't win by arguing that point any longer."`
`"Yes.`
` Let's switch to a different approach."`
`"The next in line would probably be Nanjo.`
` He was also in the guesthouse."`
`"Nanjo was in the lounge with Erika.`
` ...However, I believe the time periods before and after that have been left open."`
`"That's right, I'll strike there.`
` ...Nanjo,`
` you were relaxing in the first floor lounge of the guesthouse with Erika and Gohda, correct?"`
`"Yes...`
` I was with Erika-san the whole time..."`
`"And during what time was this?"`
`"F-From 1:00 AM to 3:00 AM."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` It was the period between 1:00 and 3:00.`
` Doctor Nanjo, Gohda-san, and I were relaxing in the lounge.`
` ...Repeat it, my master!"`
`"I'll respond.`
` #ff0000From 1:00 AM to 3:00 AM, Erika, Nanjo, and Gohda `
`spent their time in the lounge on the first floor of the guesthouse.#ffffff"`
`...Though she had flat-out refused to repeat what Beato told her to, she responded to Erika's demand immediately.`
`The red truth...was starting to corner Beato.`
`...She grimaced as though in pain, but she still struck back with the blue truth.`
`...No, perhaps she really was in pain.`
`Now that the characters apart from Natsuhi have had their alibis established, the Illusion of the Witch is also being denied.`
`Beato perceived the denial of her existence as pain...`
`"#5decffEven so, he shouldn't have an alibi for the time period before and after you were in the lounge!`
` It was possible for Nanjo to commit the crime too!#ffffff"`
`"That's right.`
` I get that Nanjo was in the lounge with Erika from 1:00 to 3:00, but what about before and after that?`
` ...What about that, Erika?"`
`"Yes.`
` First, the alibi for before 1:00 AM.`
` This is no problem at all.`
` I played cards with the cousins in their room until 24:00,`
` and then went downstairs to the lounge, where I met Doctor Nanjo."`
`"That's right...`
` At 24:00, I met Erika-san after she came down the stairs and spoke with her, learning that she was quite the connoisseur of the mystery genre.`
` I realized that I'd found a kindred spirit..."`
`"When I went into the library to solve the epitaph's riddle,`
` I noticed that there were several original copies of famous foreign mystery novels stored there.`
` So, I wanted to discuss them with the actual books in hand.`
` We moved to the library and were talking the whole time.`
` Constantly, until we moved to the lounge."`
`Cramped though it was, that book storage room in the guesthouse was stocked well enough that it was fair to call it a small library.`
`In it were several famous foreign mystery novels that Kinzo had once taken a liking to.`
`Of course, they were all originals and in English, but English was no problem for either Erika or Nanjo.`
`For this occasion, they had borrowed the key to the library one more time from Gohda in the servant room.`
`At that point, Erika checked the seal again, and, of course, reset it.`
`Damn her.`
`Even though she keeps it sealed for anyone else to enter or leave, she alone enters and leaves whenever she wants.`
`"I see.`
` So, from 24:00 until 3:00 AM when you went to sleep, you were with Nanjo the whole time?`
` That means Nanjo's alibi is the most rock solid of them all."`
`"Yes, that's it exactly!`
` My master, repeat it...!"`
`"I'll respond.`
` #ff0000After 24:00, Erika was with Nanjo the whole time until 3:00 AM.#ffffff"`
`At 24:00, the crime in the cousin room still hadn't occurred.`
`So this way, an alibi had been established for the period before the time they were in the lounge.`
`"After that, we walked out of the library and into the hallway at 1:00 AM.`
` When we did, we just happened to bump into Rosa-san as she returned.`
` I then told Gohda-san about that.`
` ...I figured it was probably a servant's responsibility to welcome in a guest."`
`Gohda asked if he should bring a towel, but Rosa refused.`
`She quickly headed up to the second floor.`
`At this point, Erika, Gohda, and Nanjo gathered together and decided to have a drink...`
`Their alibis in the lounge up until 3:00 AM have already been proclaimed in red, so there are no problems there.`
`"Let's continue on to after 3:00 AM.`
` This is Doctor Nanjo's alibi after we split up.`
` At 3:00 AM, Battler-san returned and the people in the lounge went their separate ways.`
` Doctor Nanjo, Battler-san and I went up to the second floor.`
` I then said good night to Doctor Nanjo.`
` At this time, of course, I put a seal on the door to the doctor's room as well."`
`"And it went unchanged until the crime was discovered.`
` I flew out of my room at the same time as Battler-san's scream `
`and checked to see that the door to Doctor Nanjo's room was still sealed.`
` Therefore, Doctor Nanjo's alibi is perfect both before 1:00 and after 3:00...!"`
`"Splendid, Erika.`
` #ff0000Both your seal and your red truth are perfect.`
` Nanjo had the alibi of being with Erika until 3:00 AM.`
` And he didn't leave his room after 3:00 AM until morning.#ffffff"`
`Erika made use of the seals on the doors `
`and was granted red truths from Bernkastel one after another...`
`For me, demanding that Beato repeat something had been about maneuvering and tactics,`
` ...but it's totally different for Erika.`
`For her, it's like having a trump card that can make red whenever she wants...`
`"This concludes the proof of alibis for all suspects in the guesthouse.`
` ...Any problems?"`
`"...I-I do have a problem...!!`
` And that problem is, ...umm......"`
`Beato racked her brains to find some point to latch onto, but Erika's red had been ruthlessly perfect.`
`...There was no point she could take issue with...`
`Beato kept thinking hard, trying to fault Erika on something,`
` but her expression was so wrought with desperation that anyone could tell by looking...`
`"Beato's complaint is rejected.`
` I can't sense any problems at all.`
` ...It's totally <pop>, <cute>, and <perfect>!`
` Alibis for all humans in the guesthouse have now been proven."`
`"...Wait a sec, Erika.`
` Are you trying to leave me out of this?`
` Ushiromiya Battler also should've had a chance to commit the crime.`
` ...After all, I was in the same room as the victims all night.`
` I'm not gonna let you skip past this part while ignoring me.`
` ...?!"`
`At that time, an arrow twisted like a golden snake and hit me.`
`It didn't pierce through me, but it slapped me hard on the cheek like a whip.`
`"Battler-sama, your right to speak has not yet been recognized.`
` Be warned."`
`"...Oooww...dammit..."`
`"Yeah, I understand, Battler.`
` ...And my apologies. Forgive me.`
` ...Erika!`
` You still haven't shown an alibi for Battler!`
` Battler is the man who was sleeping alongside the victims.`
` Shouldn't he be placed under suspicion more than anyone else?!"`
`"Beato's right.`
` You can't go skipping Battler like that."`
`"My apologies.`
` I had completely forgotten."`
`"After Battler returned at 3:00 AM, you went up to the second floor with him.`
` And I believe you also went to your own room and slept.`
` You may have gone to the cousin room at 24:00, but I don't think you went there after 3:00 AM."`
`"...Will you now claim that you went to crawl into Battler's bed later on?`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` Well, if you say you were looking at Battler's sleeping face all night long to confirm his alibi in the cousin room,`
` then I'd accept it, riiight?"`
`"Yes. I listened to him breathing in his sleep all night long. Got a problem with that?"`
`"...What...?!"`
`"I, Furudo Erika, can prove that Battler-san returned to the cousin room at 3:00 AM,`
` that he went straight to bed afterwards, and that he went straight to sleep.`
` And I can prove that until he woke up, noticed the gruesome situation the room was in, and let out a scream, nothing happened in that room."`
`"So you have no need to worry.`
` Battler-san isn't the culprit.`
` He's just the charming first discoverer, who entered the murder scene without realizing it was one and slept until morning."`
`"That's insane...`
` It shouldn't be possible for you to prove that with those seals you love so much...!`
` How can you prove this?!!"`
`"......That's ridiculous.`
` At that time, I entered the room alone.`
` Erika probably went into her room too.`
` How can she say something like that, as though she saw the whole thing...?!"`
`"She never said she saw it.`
` ...The room Erika was assigned to... where was it located?"`
`"Erika, please tell me.`
` How can you prove so much about Battler?"`
`"......*giggle*giggle*`
` I'd expect no less from a true detective..."`
`"My room was right next to the cousin room.`
` There was only a single thin wall between them."`
`"...Y-`
`You don't mean...`
` ...You...put your ear against the wall...`
`...to check what was happening in the cousin room...?"`
`"Yes.`
` My ears are perfect.`
` Right after Battler-san entered the room, I put my ear against the wall and checked to make sure nothing strange happened."`
`"...You said you could prove that nothing happened until Battler let out a scream the next morning...`
` ...You don't mean..."`
`"Yes.`
` I put my ear against the wall and listened in on that room until morning, without sleeping a wink."`
`......Everyone...`
`was stunned into silence......`
`She put her ear against the wall...`
`...and for the entire time until morning...`
`...she listened to what was going on in Battler's room...`
`Just what would that have looked like...`
`Until dawn, she had killed her breathing in a pitch-black room,`
` clinging to the wall shared with the cousin room...`
`Like some kind of creepy venomous spider clinging to the wall of a darkened room...`
`Bernkastel alone was grinning in triumph.`
`"...Due to the progression of the game, I realized that Battler, the one who had received the Head's Ring, would be a key player.`
` ...I was sure that Battler would be a victim of the first twilight."`
`"Yes.`
` So, just as my master told me to do,`
` ...I put my ear against the wall until morning without a wink of sleep, checking to make sure nothing unusual happened...!"`
`"Erika has a photographic memory.`
` And her hearing ability is on par with a tape recorder.`
` ...It would have been impossible for him to deceive Erika's ears, either to kill George and the others or make those wounds on their throats."`
`"...It's an accepted power of the detective's authority.`
` I have no choice but to acknowledge it.`
` I'll confirm it in red...!`
` #ff0000Ushiromiya Battler returned to the cousin room at 3:00 AM and fell asleep.`
` After that, until the discovery of the crime, absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened in the room!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000In other words, it was impossible for Battler to commit murder or damage the corpses.#ffffff"`
`"......Nng, `
`...ggghh......"`
`The red from the pair forced Beato to show an expression of considerable anguish...`
`It was only natural.`
`Those red truths not only guaranteed Battler's alibi, but a number of other things as well.`
`First off, it meant the murder was impossible for anyone after 3:00 AM.`
`And since the cousins were confirmed to be alive as late as 24:00, the time period of the crime automatically became...`
`'between 24:00 and 3:00'.`
`That meant the alibis for all people who weren't in the guesthouse before 3:00 AM...`
`had also been guaranteed automatically.`
`"...That one hurts...`
`...a lot......"`
`"After 24:00, Erika was in the guesthouse the whole time.`
` So, it should have been difficult for her to prove alibis for all of the people in the mansion..."`
`"It should've been almost impossible to prove alibis for Eva and the others.`
` ...But now, all she has to do is prove that they never visited the guesthouse between 24:00 and 3:00,`
` and she can prove those alibis..."`
`"...Anyway, we'll have to construct it so that the murders were possible before 3:00 AM.`
` And we have to prove that it was possible for one of the people in the mansion to do it...!"`
`The people who had been in the guesthouse all had alibis.`
`The crime didn't occur before 24:00.`
`The crime couldn't have occurred after 3:00.`
`In other words, there was no way for the murders to happen unless someone from the mansion committed the crime between 24:00 and 3:00...`
`In order to protect Natsuhi, she had to establish that it was possible for someone other than Natsuhi to commit the crime.`
`Ironically, the witch had to prove that a Human had committed the crime...`
`"......Still, this is getting pretty difficult.`
` ...Until 3:00, Erika was in the lounge.`
` And you have to pass through there to reach the second floor.`
` In other words, she's practically like a manager for the guesthouse's second floor."`
`"...This tactic may be a bit overused, but if it was possible for someone to go up to the second floor without Erika noticing,`
` we should be able to prove that the crime was possible for anyone."`
`"It's probably possible for a Human to climb up to a second story window if they really wanted to."`
`Of course, Beato had also thought of striking back that way.`
`...And Bernkastel must have thought this as well.`
`"Battler, Nanjo, Gohda, Kumasawa.`
` We realize that the crime was impossible for all these people in the guesthouse.`
` ...However, what about the Humans in the mansion?!"`
`"As I have already said, and as my master has even proclaimed with the red truth, `
`I was in the lounge on the first floor of the guesthouse.`
` And to reach the second floor, one must pass through the lounge.`
` In other words, it was impossible to reach the second floor without me seeing it."`
`"And what if that wasn't impossible?`
` #5decffFor example, what if someone placed a ladder against the outer wall of the guesthouse and snuck in through a second story window?!`
` There must be a way to reach the second floor without passing through the lounge!`
` That way, it would be possible to reach the crime scene without you seeing it...!#ffffff"`
`Beato finally struck back.`
`Before now, she'd let Erika take total control and attack her with the red over and over.`
`During that time, Beato's counterattacks with the blue truth had been few in number, even including this one...`
`"Of course, I knew you'd try saying that.`
` I couldn't have my lookout in the lounge become meaningless.`
` So first, I must prove that my lookout was perfect."`
`"...First off, because of how the guesthouse is constructed, `
`it's impossible to reach the second floor without me seeing it from the lounge.`
` There are no places under cover, nor are there any physical or mental blind spots.`
` ...My master, repeat it!"`
`"#ff0000It is impossible for someone to reach the second floor of the guesthouse without anyone in the lounge noticing it.`
` ...Though of course, this only refers to reaching the second floor from inside the building.#ffffff"`
`"<Good>, my master!`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ...So, next is Lady Beatrice's theory that there might be a way to reach the second floor from the outside.`
` This really is a problem.`
` After all, there are trees that could probably be climbed, and someone could've used a ladder.`
` Even crawling up the rain gutter can't be ruled out as impossible.`
` But I ~ib~can't let you do that~ib~."`
`"Hoh, you won't let me...?`
` And how's that?`
` Did you stay up all night circling the guesthouse?`
` No, you couldn't do that.`
` You were in the lounge...!`
` From the lounge, you can only see a small part of the outer perimeter through the window!"`
`"That's true.`
` I couldn't prevent all methods of climbing up to the second floor from the outside.`
` ...However, I was able to prevent all entry to the second floor."`
`"Prevent...entry...?!"`
`"...I had already foreseen this move.`
` ...How terrifying...that she would be so persistent...!"`
`"Because of how the guesthouse is constructed, the windows are the only method of entry from the outside to the second floor."`
`"The locks? Not important at all.`
` I only had to prove that none of the windows or shutters were opened even once.`
` After I witnessed the location of the hidden gold, `
`I returned to the guesthouse and immediately began severing all methods of entry to the second floor of the guesthouse that didn't pass through the lounge.`
` ......Yes, it's exactly the same.`
` No different from the rest...!"`
`"...Don't tell me...`
`you used that seal of yours...on all the windows of the guesthouse...?`
` In that weather, ...dressed like that...?"`
`"Well, I did have my swimsuit from when I drifted here."`
`"......You're insane...`
` ...At a house where you were welcomed as a guest, `
`you did something like that in the middle of the rain, even though nothing had happened yet...?"`
`"For a normal Human, it would have been an action so suspicious as to be completely impossible.`
` ...However, she is the witch's piece."`
`In the middle of all that rain,`
` Erika sealed all the windows from the outside...`
`...to create an alibi showing that no one could've snuck into the guesthouse from the outside.`
`She climbed up the wall herself...and did that to all the windows on the first and second floor.`
`No, to all things that could possibly have permitted entry.`
`Although, after hearing that she'd listened to the cousin room all night long, without even sleeping a wink,`
` this new bizarre action didn't seem quite so impossible...`
`This had probably also...looked like a venomous spider.`
`A disgusting spider crawling over the outside guesthouse wall during a storm...`
`"......You...`
` ...Just what do you...`
`...think of this Ushiromiya family...?`
` Is this how you repay us for welcoming you as a guest...?!"`
`"To a detective, the Ushiromiya family is nothing more or less than the stage upon which the crime occurs.`
` ...Before the outbreak of the crime, it was important for me to memorize the names of the characters, memorize the layout of the land, `
`and prepare for the upcoming crime by devoting my time towards collecting and creating all possible alibis."`
`"From my perspective, detectives who don't prepare anything before the outbreak of the crime are pretty third-rate.`
` After all, we all know that someone will die wherever we spend the night."`
`"......Furthermore, at the time the crime was discovered,`
` Erika confirmed that none of those seals had been broken.`
` That's why Erika wasn't the first one to reach the cousin room when the corpses were found."`
`"Even without inspecting the corpses, she could be certain of several things thanks to the red truth.`
` It was more important to check the seals and construct alibis."`
`"My master is perfect.`
` All I did was prove everything perfectly by following my master's orders...!"`
`"Well done, Erika.`
` My double, my piece...!`
` What do you think, Lambda?`
` Doesn't this prove that Erika's lookout in the lounge contains absolute reliability as far as constructing alibis...?"`
`"...Yeah, I acknowledge it.`
` Erika, your seal is perfect.`
` I'll acknowledge it in red.`
` #ff0000It was impossible to reach the second floor of the guesthouse without passing through the lounge, `
`and impossible to reach it at all without Erika, who was in the lounge, knowing about it!#ffffff"`
`"Thank you very much, Lady Lambdadelta...!`
` So, you know what's coming next, Great Lady Beatrice!`
` #5decffTherefore, the time of the crime is limited to the single hour between 24:00, when they were confirmed to be alive,`
` and 1:00 AM, when our party in the lounge started!#ffffff"`
`"Uu, `
`...gah`
`...ah..."`
`"I've already said it, but at 24:00, I went down to the lounge,`
` hit it off with Doctor Nanjo, and was engrossed by a discussion of the mystery genre in the library until 1:00 AM."`
`"...It's a bit embarrassing, but I grew so wrapped up in that discussion...`
`that I wouldn't have noticed if anyone had passed through the corridor during that period.`
` ...Quite a regretful mistake for a detective."`
`After doing all that maneuvering and setting up seals to guarantee a perfect alibi,`
` she became too engrossed in a mystery discussion and left an opening...?`
`Her relaxed smile was completely shameless, the total opposite of her words.`
`It almost seems like it's the other way around.`
`It's enough to make you think that this was an intentional trap...`
`...to make it clear to all that only Natsuhi didn't have an alibi between 24:00 and 1:00...`
`"In other words, it paradoxically means this:`
` the only ones who could have reached the cousin room and committed the crime...are those characters who have no alibi between 24:00 and 1:00!"`
`Her eyes clearly hinted that Natsuhi was the only one who fit this description...`
`...It should've been a crime whose time and location were completely unknown during that long night.`
`But because of the alibis Erika had constructed,`
` it had been limited to the time period between 24:00 and 1:00.`
`Erika left the cousin room at 24:00.`
`That marks the last confirmation that George and the others were alive.`
`And after the party in the lounge started at 1:00,`
` it was impossible to reach the cousin room by any method.`
`"......Damn her, ...and from a mere Human..."`
`"This is quite bad...`
` The night has been sealed up into an hour, ...and at this rate, there won't be many suspect pieces left..."`
`"...Damn it, Lady Bernkastel...`
` ...Nicely done..."`
`"Unlike Battler, I'm not an idiot.`
` ...After watching this game five times, I've got more than enough cards in my hand.`
` ...`
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"Then let us continue.`
` Let's examine the alibis of the remaining suspects, the people in the mansion.`
` After all, we only have to worry about the single hour between 24:00 and 1:00.`
` That shouldn't be difficult at all."`
`"Let's start with 24:00.`
` At this time, Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji are in the second floor corridor, and all of the others are in the first floor dining hall.`
` This has already been shown by my master's red!"`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` #ff0000At 24:00, Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji were in the corridor on the second floor of the mansion.`
` The rest of them were in the dining hall on the first floor.#ffffff`
` And as you know, there was a mysterious knock, and a letter with the One Wing seal on it appeared.`
` The discussion surrounding that continued on until 1:00.`
` I will say it with the red truth.`
` #ff0000Of all the people in the dining hall, not one of them left the dining hall until 1:00 AM...!#ffffff"`
`Since the possible times for the crime had been limited to between 24:00 and 1:00...`
`The adults in the family conference, who were confirmed not to have left the mansion between 24:00 and 1:00,`
` all had proven alibis.`
`"...A-And how do you intend to prove that?!`
` Erika's in the guesthouse!`
` Did someone prove it by using one of your favorite seals on the dining hall door?!`
` You have no convincing evidence or proof...!!"`
`"#ff0000The red truth is simply truth, and there is no need to provide evidence, proof, or room for a counterargument!!`
` #ffffff......You made that rule.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle* *giggle*giggle*giggle* ehehehehehahahahahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`This overbearing red truth hadn't only given alibis to the adults in the dining hall.`
`It also gave alibis to Shannon and Kanon, who had come to serve tea,`
` and even guaranteed that they never left the dining hall.`
`In other words, ...the only ones who didn't have proven alibis...`
`were these three: Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji...`
`No, ...there were only two left.`
`If Krauss and Genji had their alibis proven,`
` it proves that no one but Natsuhi could've been the culprit...!`
`"Let's do Genji next.`
` He's a victim, but you can't deny the possibility that he committed the crime in the cousin room and was then killed himself."`
`"And furthermore, though he was in the second floor corridor at 24:00,`
` he then returned to the servant room to transfer the phone call for Natsuhi and was completely isolated."`
`"Which means it was possible for Genji to commit the-"`
`"I'll say it in red.`
` #ff0000When Genji finished transferring the call, he immediately returned to the waiting room.`
`#ffffff That's just a cold, hard truth, without any evidence, proof, seals or alibis, got it?"`
`"Then, at 1:00 AM,`
` there was another break in the family conference, and Rosa returned to the guesthouse.`
` ...At that time...`
`I'm truly thankful for your cooperation, Ushiromiya Eva-san.`
` Please rise...!"`
`"......Erika-chan wasn't the only one, okay?`
` I was also certain that something would happen that night."`
`"She's the person who taught me how to make those seals.`
` And she helped me to check the alibis of those people under suspicion...!"`
`"During the break at 1:00 AM,`
` I went to Genji-san's waiting room and used the same seal as Erika-chan...!`
` In other words, if that wasn't broken, `
`it would mean no one entered or left that room between 1:00 AM and the next morning...!!"`
`"Now, Kanon-san and Kumasawa-san.`
` Please rise."`
`Kanon rose expressionlessly, and Kumasawa got to her feet timidly.`
`"In the morning,`
` you two went to wake Genji-san because he had slept in, right?`
` And at that time, you noticed that the door was sealed, broke the seal, and opened the door, correct?"`
`"...Y-Yes.`
` ...I thought it was some kind of prank."`
`"I didn't think deeply about it at the time."`
`"I'm not asking for your opinions. Just give us the facts.`
` Did you break the seal and enter the room?"`
`""Y-Yes...""`
`"With the red truth, I'll guarantee that Eva, Kanon, and Kumasawa's statements just now are the truth.`
` #ff0000At 1:00 AM, Eva sealed Genji's waiting room, and that seal was broken by Kanon and Kumasawa in the morning when the crime was discovered.#ffffff`
` This'll be a pain, so I'll add on some more.`
` #ff0000During the short break at 1:00 AM, the first two to leave the dining hall were Rosa and Eva.`
` Until Eva returned, everyone in the dining hall remained there.`
` After seeing Rosa off, Eva went to the waiting room and sealed it.`
` Of course, she did not enter the room at all at this time.#ffffff"`
`"This is all information gathered from the people involved.`
` It isn't a red truth without a basis.`
` It's a truth due to proper reasoning constructed from testimony.`
` Not only testimony, but the limits of scientific investigations such as collecting fingerprints were used here."`
`"After all, Kinzo-san's study is a treasure vault with all kinds of chemicals!`
` I obtained all sorts of results to create an ultimate truth, infinitely close to a red truth.`
` This isn't a science mystery, so I'll spare you the details."`
`As Erika swaggered around the cathedral, she arrogantly touted her scientific knowledge.`
`She had thorough knowledge of all the chemicals in Kinzo's study and had used them to conduct a scientific investigation,`
` which had now been acknowledged and made into a red truth by Bernkastel.`
`...She didn't explain the details, but she had obtained results that were convincing even without the red truth.`
`Collecting fingerprints with aluminum powder.`
`Component analysis of the mud under someone's shoe and various chemical reactions from the clinging rain water.`
`...Erika just walked into someone else's study several times...`
`and used several chemicals however she pleased, all without asking the family's permission.`
`However, no one could fault her for this.`
`The pieces couldn't hinder any action the detective might take for the investigation.`
`That's the power of the detective's authority.`
`"......You act like you own the place...`
` ...From now on, I'll tell everyone I meet. If someone claims to be a detective, never welcome them into your house as a guest."`
`"That's probably a good idea.`
` Giving shelter to a detective is just about the worst omen of misfortune out there."`
`"......Because of this,`
` it has been proven that it was only possible to reach Genji's waiting room `
`and commit the crime between 24:00 and 1:00 AM.`
` And furthermore, by Erika's investigation, it has been proven that it was impossible for Genji to reach the cousin room."`
`It had already been made clear in red that, after transferring the phone call to Natsuhi, `
`Genji had gone straight back to the waiting room.`
`And because of Erika's scientific investigation, further red had been added, `
`saying `
`#ff0000Genji never left the mansion after 24:00#ffffff...`
`Because of this, it's been made clear that Genji couldn't have reached the guesthouse, `
`much less the cousin room...`
`"Now, ...only Krauss and Natsuhi remain...!`
` Everyone else has had their alibis proven, haven't they?!!"`
`"...I-`
`Impossible......`
` .........!"`
`Natsuhi's mouth flapped open and shut like a suffocating goldfish.`
`And that's an accurate analogy.`
`...Natsuhi's mind was blank and spinning out of control, and she felt as though she really would suffocate.`
`"...Ushiromiya Natsuhi,`
` ...I'll give you one last chance.`
` Confess that all of the crimes were the work of your husband."`
`"...F-Fool!!`
` Do I look like the kind of woman who would falsely accuse her husband?!!"`
`"...Beato,`
` Natsuhi's denied it.`
` I'll give you the same chance.`
` ...You understand, right?`
` ...Or wait, don't tell me...`
` You aren't going to take advantage of the fact that Krauss is missing to try and pull a Devil's Proof on me, are you...?"`
`"......Gah, ghh......"`
`Beato realized that they were rapidly approaching the end of this battle.`
`Normally, Beato should've been able to argue against these alibis of Erika's in several ways, using the blue truth.`
`However, all of those alibis had been accepted by Bernkastel and Lambdadelta as red truth,`
` and Beato no longer had any room to argue...`
`"...It's like......`
`those witches are distorting things, so that they match with a plotline Erika's drawn up..."`
`"That's right.`
` If the Game Master, Lady Lambdadelta, accepts a truth,`
` its authenticity will not be questioned.`
` The world that comes after will be formed based on the final remaining truth. ...This happens no matter how far this final truth is from the real truth."`
`"There's no way Uncle Krauss is the culprit.`
` He's being held prisoner somewhere.`
` ...W-Wait,`
` we can't deny the possibility that Aunt Natsuhi was skillfully tricked into believing that during the phone call..."`
`"Do you suspect Natsuhi and Krauss, Battler-kun?"`
`"Well......"`
`"Erika's truth has been constructed in a cowardly fashion, but it is a proper truth.`
` Though the witches did conspire with her, it has still been acknowledged as a red truth.`
` In other words, it cannot be a fake truth built solely on lies."`
`"...This means that even Erika's truth is supported by logic.`
` The truth about Natsuhi and Krauss being culprits is also very possible.`
` Even if it's a mixture of truth and lies, it 'makes sense logically'.`
` ...It's a mixture of truth and lies...that is just as valuable as truth is.`
` ...Which of those two truths will you believe?`
` That is up to you to decide."`
`"......No.`
` ...I'll......trust Aunt Natsuhi...and Uncle Krauss.`
` I realize they're in some money trouble."`
`"But even so, ...I don't want to believe that they're the culprits.`
` No, I can't believe it...!"`
`"On this game board, where the red is steadily cornering Natsuhi, how do you intend to let her escape?"`
`"...I-I don't know...`
` However, ...I seriously don't want to give up...!`
` Aunt Natsuhi was just caught in a cowardly trap.`
` ...Erika's reasoning has fallen for that trap completely...!`
` So whether it's intentional or she's being manipulated, Erika is aiding the true culprit."`
`"......Erika has accused Aunt Natsuhi of being the culprit, ...but even if everyone here believes that,`
` ...in fact, for that very reason, I want to be the one person who trusts Aunt Natsuhi...!"`
`If everyone believes it's her, will that become the truth?`
`If everyone accepts a lie, will that become the truth?`
`Must an honest person be dragged up to the guillotine, all alone and taunted by liars?`
`"I...don't like it.`
` ...If no one else will believe in Aunt Natsuhi, then I will...!!`
` The real truth isn't something that's determined when everyone accepts it!`
` It's something you find after thoroughly investigating both possibilities...!`
` So this trial is a downright lie!`
` This trial exists for no reason other than to set Aunt Natsuhi up as the culprit!!"`
`"...Beato is doing all she can to plead Natsuhi's case, right?"`
`"Wrong.`
` Beato is trying to refute Erika's argument.`
` ...She's just defending!`
` You can't fight in this trial by simply resisting all of your opponent's claims.`
` This is why Beato always cornered me in the past...!"`
`"She isn't gonna beat Erika by finding flaws in her reasoning!`
` She has to find a different truth and show Lambdadelta, the commander of this game, `
`...`
`that her truth is more correct than Erika's...!!"`
`"Can anyone create a truth where Natsuhi isn't the culprit,`
` without violating the red truths that Lady Bernkastel has shown...?"`
`"...I-I don't know...`
` But...as long as I don't believe that Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit, there's got to be a different truth!"`
`"It's even okay if the culprit for the crime was a witch.`
` That's better than having Natsuhi be framed by an incorrect truth...!!"`
`"......So, no matter how much red truth you are shown,`
` you won't believe that Natsuhi is the culprit, correct?"`
`"Yeah...!`
` For all things, there should always be some people who believe and some who don't...!`
` No matter how much evidence is stacked up against her, someone has to believe that she's innocent!`
` There must be several truths in the world that cannot be proven with evidence.`
` I don't ever want to accept that something's true just because everyone says it is!!"`
`How can you be sure that there's nothing on the back side of the moon if you've never seen it?!`
`Is there some reason that you have to believe it?!`
`Until you see the back of the moon with your own eyes,`
` you can deny neither the possibility that nothing's there at all...`
`nor the possibility that there's a thriving culture of space bunnies...!`
`You should never assume something is the truth until you actually check it.`
`This court is a malicious thing, trying to force a single interpretation on a truth that cannot be checked.`
`I believed there was a civilization on the back side of the moon!!`
`But that was in elementary school, and I was made fun of and laughed at.`
` So I thought it was embarrassing to think that a civilization lived on the moon, `
`...and I threw away that 'belief'.`
`I'd been told by a book my mom read me that rabbits lived on the back side of the moon,`
` so I believed that for a long, long time.`
`...But when everyone said it was wrong,`
` I abandoned that truth without even trying to check it!`
`...Even without evidence,`
` I abandoned the truth I believed in...!`
`And now, everyone is starting to believe that Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit.`
`Even though no decisive evidence has been shown...!`
`Even without evidence, Erika's words sound reasonable, so they're probably the truth...?`
` Is ~ib~that~ib~ why you're throwing away your 'belief' that Aunt Natsuhi is innocent, despite a lack of proof?!`
`"If no one else will believe, ...then I will...!`
` I believe the real truth only appears if you look with both eyes, one denying and one affirming...!!`
` No matter how much she tries to make us believe that Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit, I believe she isn't!`
` I won't abandon that belief!!"`
`".........Understood.`
` Then I will give you just a single red truth.`
` I will give this single bit of power to you, now that you possess the will to fight in the truest sense."`
`"Power......?"`
`"By the name of the Finite Witch Virgilia.`
` ......No, as the former witch Beatrice, I will grant you this red truth.`
` #ff0000Ushiromiya Natsuhi is not the culprit!#ffffff"`
`"A plea bargain.`
` ...If you acknowledge that Krauss is the culprit,`
` Erika will suspend her pursuit of Natsuhi.`
` From then on, the investigation will proceed assuming that Krauss, whose location is unknown, is the culprit."`
`"What'll you do, Beato?`
` At this rate, Natsuhi's in serious trouble, right?`
` ...Will you accept the plea bargain?`
` If you're willing to abandon this Ushiromiya family honor thing, `
`Bern'll be kind enough to let you get off with a draw, okay...?"`
`Krauss is currently missing, and it's unknown whether he's alive or dead.`
`Like Kinzo, he's no different than a 'cat in a box' that has disappeared into the mists of the island.`
`A cat inside a box is unfixed, and no interpretation of it can be denied.`
`It is the root of endless interpretations.`
`The true source of the Endless Witch's power.`
`In other words, no matter how much Bernkastel claims that Krauss is the culprit, `
`...she can't make that the sole truth.`
`In other words, the Krauss culprit theory and the witch theory can be in almost perfect balance.`
`...It would mean making the game a draw.`
`This was cajolery, ...offering her a second chance if she abandons the honor of the family she swore to protect...`
`and consents to a Fragment that stomps all over that honor.`
`There's no room for false confidence.`
`For Beato, to lose is to die.`
`...In this game, she should always choose a draw unless she has an overwhelming advantage.`
`"...Mu, ...uu......"`
`"I won't allow you to treat my husband like the culprit!!`
` My husband is the Successor to the Ushiromiya Family Headship!!`
` The only person who will inherit the glory of the Ushiromiya family!`
` I will never let you treat him like a criminal...!!"`
`"...Are you sure, Natsuhi...?`
` ......If you refuse to suspect Krauss, ...then...you'll be the only one left.`
` ...Alibis have been proven for everyone else, ...in other words, Hempel's Raven...!`
` Even without any evidence, ...it will be determined that you are the culprit...!"`
`"And if I'm the only one left, what then?!`
` I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi!!`
` I will not run or hide!`
` I am innocent!!`
` And I am the representative of the noble Head, with the One-Winged Eagle engraved into my heart!!"`
`"If you wish to insult me, go ahead!`
` If you wish to ridicule me, do as you please!!`
` No one can damage my honor with a mixture of truth and lies!!"`
`With a dignified voice, ...Natsuhi stated her case openly before the witches above her.`
`However, this response of hers might've been exactly what Bernkastel had intended...`
`"...Natsuhi refuses the deal.`
` ......And you, Beato?`
` ...You understand, right?`
` The instant Natsuhi is specified as the culprit, Lambda will make her verdict.`
` As soon as that happens, the Illusion of the Witch will be denied, and you'll disappear into the mist.`
` ...Do you plan to let Natsuhi's foolish bragging drag you down to the depths of hell...?"`
`"......Nn......gah......"`
`"...Riiche,`
` you fought well.`
` ...This is our chance.`
` Convince Natsuhi and try to work out a compromise...!"`
`"Both Lady Lambdadelta and Lady Bernkastel have boredom, not you, as their true enemy.`
` ...They probably want to have this game repeat and play some more.`
` If they see that you're willing to make a concession, `
`they will most likely accept it gladly and move on to the next game."`
`"If we move on to the next game, ......then what will happen to the Natsuhi of this game, `
`...the Natsuhi of this Fragment...?"`
`"Now isn't the time to be worrying about that, right?!`
` Natsuhi is just a piece!`
` Even if she gets removed from this game, she'll show up again in the next one!"`
`"But that doesn't apply to you, Milady...`
` I believe you know what Lady Bernkastel plans for this game.`
` It's a more realistic goal to make use of that and aim for victory in the next game instead.`
` ...Accepting Lady Bernkastel's deal might be our one and only good option right now...!"`
`"Throw away that useless pride of yours!!`
` Neither Kasparov nor Deep Blue won every game!`
` The person that wins more games wins in the end, right?!`
` If a witch gets too attached to a single match, a single life, a single piece,`
` ...that witch dies!!"`
`".........My apologies, `
`......but I cannot do that.`
` ......I know the strength of a man who believed even though everyone said he was wrong,`
` ...and I know the suffering he went through when he was forced to abandon that belief...!"`
`"I will not abandon Natsuhi!`
` Why?`
` Because if everyone else suspects Natsuhi, then someone has to believe in her!`
` Because truth can only be found in the gap between those who doubt and those who believe...!!"`
`"I won't abandon her!`
` Even if everyone believes that Natsuhi is the culprit, I will still claim that I, the witch, am the culprit...!!`
` If I can't even make that claim, my existence isn't worth anything...!!"`
`"...I cannot lose.`
` The truth isn't something anyone gets to deny.`
` ...Only when you doubt and abandon it yourself does it disappeeeeeeear!!"`
`"Is that your answer, Beato...?"`
`"Yeah, of course I refuse!!`
` Ushiromiya Krauss is not the culprit!!"`
`"......Fool.`
` I won't let you take that back, okay...?`
` Here's what you get for being a quick-tempered moron.`
` By the name of Bernkastel, Witch of Miracles, I speak with the red truth.`
` #ff0000Ushiromiya Krauss is not the culprit.`
` And he was killed long ago,`
` shortly after you heard his voice over the phone, get it?#ffffff"`
`"...N-No......`
`...D-Dear, ......aaah...aaagghhhaaaaaaaaahhhh......"`
`Bernkastel's cruel and ruthless red blade gouged Natsuhi...`
`...It was...totally merciless......`
`Natsuhi had been crushed with uncertainty, not knowing whether Krauss was alive or dead,`
` ...but she had still been capable of believing that he was alive...`
`And now, ...that hope, ...that expectation...had been crushed, ...without any chance for a miracle...!!`
`She had thrown herself into this trap out of concern for her husband's safety.`
`She had now lost her daughter and husband......and everything she had gained since marrying into the Ushiromiya family.`
`No, ...even after all this,`
` ......one thing still remains.`
`If her husband has been lost, ......then right now, she is the last person who can protect the honor of the Ushiromiya family.`
`She still...couldn't let it end here......`
`Even wrapped up in so much sadness, ...Natsuhi would do all she could to protect that honor...`
`with this final bit of strength...`
`"Nope, it's all over!`
` It's been determined with the red truth that none of the remaining people in the dining hall left that room until 1:00.`
` In other words, alibis have already been proven for everyone except Natsuhi!"`
`"...Well done, Erika and Bernkastel!`
` You've fully proven that the crime was impossible for everyone except Ushiromiya Natsuhi!`
` Why don't I start reading aloud from the verdict?"`
`"...At 24:00 on October 4th, 1986, the defendant, Ushiromiya Natsuhi, `
`left before the others while pretending to return to her room to sleep, `
`and murdered George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, and Genji one after another during the one-hour period before 1:00 AM!"`
`"Let me tack something on.`
` Due to circumstantial evidence, include the murder of Krauss."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` In this situation, it's unthinkable that anyone except Natsuhi could kill Krauss!!`
` A revision to the verdict!`
` During the hour before 1:00 AM,`
` Krauss, George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, and Genji were killed one after another!`
` It's only possible for any of these murders to have taken place between 24:00 and 1:00!`
` The only person without an alibi during this time was Ushiromiya Natsuhi...!`
` From this point forward, the defendant will be treated as the true culprit."`
`"Furthermore, because it has been fully proven that the crime was possible for Humans, `
`Beatrice, Endless Witch...!!`
` This Court of Illusions hereby denies your existence!!"`
`"You'll be given a chance to plead your case, but can you prove an alibi for Natsuhi?`
` Or can you prove that it was possible for someone other than Natsuhi?`
` If you can do that, Natsuhi will stop at being one shade short of absolutely guilty,`
` and the denial of your existence will be put on hold for this game..."`
`If Natsuhi had an alibi, Beato would've shown it long ago.`
`In fact, wasn't the whole point of that trap to make her lose her alibi...?`
`"Even if her alibi is not proven, ...I will believe in Natsuhi's innocence...!!`
` No matter how much you try to pin your fake truth on her!!`
` I am the true culprit!`
` Natsuhi is innocent!!`
` Even without any proof!!"`
`"...The truth is known only by the master of the night on this island, Beatrice the Golden.`
` I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi!`
` Now that my husband has passed away, I am the Head of the Ushiromiya family!!`
` My determination will not bend no matter how you try and humiliate me!"`
`"Why, you ask?`
` It is because Father gave me permission to engrave the family crest of the One-Winged Eagle into my heart...!!`
` How do you intend to disprove the existence of this honor with your evidence and your alibis?`
` You cannot!!`
` The Ushiromiya family crest engraved into my heart is immortal!!"`
`......Now that Natsuhi and Beatrice had practically been placed on the guillotine, `
`...they cried out with all the strength of their determination...`
`However, that did nothing but bring a cold smile to Lambdadelta's face.`
`Erika had constructed a truth that Lambdadelta could accept.`
`...And no one could construct a more convincing truth to deny Erika's.`
`In that case, the most convincing truth would swallow up everything else...and become the one and only 'truth'.`
`Even if it happened to be different from the real truth.`
`The truth of those in the past is swallowed up by the truth of those in the future.`
`...This can happen even for a mixture of truth and lies.`
`As long as everyone acknowledges it as true...!`
`"......Sheesh, stop howling already.`
` ...I like it best when witches sob and beg for their lives when they're about to be burned at the stake.`
` When they try and bluff like you do, it's such a killjoy.`
` In that case, I guess I'll send you one final gift. A red truth to smash that bluff wide open."`
`"...Wh-What do you mean......?"`
`"...S-`
`Stop it, ...Lady Bernkastel...`
` ...Hasn't it already been overwritten with the truth you wished for...?`
` That truth and Natsuhi's should be able to coexist...`
` Please don't defile it, `
`......please........."`
`"#ff0000Natsuhi, `
`when did Kinzo ever say it was okay for you to engrave the One-Winged Eagle into your heart?`
` Those were just the words of the Kinzo from your delusions, weren't they?`
` ...You know, the real Kinzo...`
` Not once in his entire life`
` did he ever trust you from the bottom of his heart,`
` and not once did he ever consider letting you bear the family crest!#ffffff"`
`When that heartless announcement was made, ......Kinzo stood up.`
`"Natsuhi!! You need not listen to this!!`
` No one can defile the crest engraved in your heart!!`
` That is yours alone!!`
` Don't let your pride as the final Family Head be forgotten forever!`
` Natsuhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!"`
`"Just shut up and disappear.`
` You miserable delusion of Natsuhi's."`
`"Nngggaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!`
` You cannot erase me! You cannot erase my soul!!`
` Not as long as the crest is engraved into Natsuhi's heart!!"`
`"That's enough, you lying illusion.`
` #ff0000The real Kinzo wouldn't say that.`
` Disappear.`
` You, the illusion of Kinzo inside Natsuhi's mind, beautified by Natsuhi to suit her own purposes.#ffffff"`
`"Gwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhaaaaaaaahhhh, `
`Na...`
`tsuhi...`
`nnggwoooooooooooohhhhhhh...!!!"`
`A bright red flash of lightning smashed Kinzo over and over again as he screamed.`
`Then, he crumpled like a doll...and sat back down in his chair as though nothing had happened.`
`The fierce emotion had left Kinzo's face.`
`He had truly...become like a wax model.`
`And so, ......he would never again share kind words with Natsuhi...`
`......That's right.`
`The true Kinzo...`
`never once trusted Natsuhi during his entire life.`
`The true Kinzo...`
`...never once considered allowing Natsuhi to bear the One-Winged Eagle.`
`...Because, of course...`
`Kinzo had already vanished before the start of the game.`
`The Kinzo that appears in this game...`
`......is nothing more than Natsuhi's...`
`...delusion...`
`Every part of this Kinzo, `
`...who believed in Natsuhi and entrusted her with protecting the family honor...`
`was a phantom...`
`...created by Natsuhi......`
`"#ff0000Pitiful woman.`
` You will now face the truth...that you never gained Ushiromiya Kinzo's trust as long as he lived.#ffffff"`
`"Wah...`
`...waaah..."`
`"...Natsuhi, `
`...don't cry.`
` ...Kinzo...`
`entrusted the Ushiromiya family...`
`to you, right...?"`
`...No, he didn't.`
`Not only did he not entrust her with that, `
`...he never even said hello...`
`...or met her gaze even once......`
`"...Uu, ...uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh...!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!"`
`Natsuhi's cry was a mixture of sadness and many other emotions, `
`...and it echoed throughout the cathedral...`
`...Natsuhi could no longer stop her tears.`
`Some last, faint element that had cheered her up until today, `
`that had allowed her to endure as an Ushiromiya, as the wife to the Head's representative, ...and as the final Family Head...`
`...had been torn to bits...`
`Natsuhi no longer...`
`...had anything left.`
`Natsuhi could no longer allow herself...to even call herself an Ushiromiya......`
`Those difficult days, those painful days.`
`Those days where she still gave everything she could for the family she'd married into despite it all.`
`...The very few happy days among these.`
`All of these flitted through her mind, one after another...`
`...and disappeared.`
`All of those once-beautiful memories...`
`were then...crushed by Bernkastel's red truth, `
`......smashed to bits and scattered,`
` ...plunged deep into her hands,`
` ...and smeared red with mournful blood...`
`...It was...`
`the red of sadness and truth.`
`"That is all.`
` ...Just because the crime exists as it does,`
` this level of reasoning is possible for Furudo Erika.`
` ...What do you think, everyone...?"`
`Lambdadelta...clapped.`
`Then, a bit later, Bernkastel also clapped, looking pleased.`
`The expressionless, wax figure-like audience followed suit,`
` and the unshakable verdict was welcomed with a great applause......`
`And so, ......the 'truth' of this tale...`
`was decided......`
`Right now, no humans exist on this island except for those in this parlor.`
`And, with one exception, it has been shown that none of them have committed murder.`
`And, the culprit is among these people.`
`"...Whoa, whoa.`
` ...In that case, ...it's conclusive, isn't it...?"`
`"Unless the culprit is a witch who committed murder with magic, that is..."`
`"...It was you?!`
` You killed George, killed my husband?!`
` Why?!!`
` Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?!!"`
`"...I-I didn't kill anyone...!`
` I-I...d-didn't...!!"`
`"..............."`
`In a panic, and with a voice that was far from calm,`
` ......in a manner that was, to put it coldly, unsightly...Aunt Natsuhi denied the suspicion placed upon her...`
`However, ...there was no longer any way around it...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~She~ib~`
` stood up, ...brushed back her long hair, pointed at Aunt Natsuhi, and said it one more time.`
`"...You're the culprit,`
` Ushiromiya Natsuhi-san."`
`Red-faced and tear-streaked, `
`...Eva walked up to Natsuhi...`
`and grabbed her by the collar.`
`Then, wordlessly, she slapped Natsuhi's cheek.`
`Natsuhi, who had never been slapped in her life,`
` was shocked by the taste of iron, which she was feeling for the first time.`
`It turned into a scuffle between Eva and Natsuhi.`
`Battler immediately tried to stop them,`
` but Eva planted a sharp knee into Battler's gut and he doubled over.`
`"Give them back, give back George and my husband!!`
` Why did you kill them?!`
` You murderer, murdereeeeeeeer!!"`
`Sobbing, Eva kicked Natsuhi, who had fallen to the ground, over and over.`
`Battler tried once more to cut in and stop them, but he was brushed aside, `
`...and after that, no one tried to stop them.`
`Repeating her son and husband's names over and over, Eva kicked Natsuhi.`
` And kicked her.`
` Then she started grabbing whatever her eyes fell upon and throwing it.`
`...Natsuhi was hit with a steaming teacup...`
`and a can of black tea, whose tea leaves fell out all over her.`
`She was kicked, her hair pulled and dragged up,`
` her cheek slapped so many times that it started to swell.`
`No one tried to stop it.`
`It wasn't because they were worried about Eva kicking them too.`
`It was because they thought it an appropriate act of retribution for a person who had lost her beloved son and husband.`
`A proper...retribution.`
`A proper...truth.`
`Everyone in the parlor accepted that Natsuhi was the culprit...`
` ...They accepted the truth Erika claimed.`
`So it became a proper truth, and Natsuhi was designated as the proper culprit.`
`She had already lost the husband and daughter who might have protected her,`
` ...and even Kinzo, who should have given her a final bit of strength, had already vanished like a bubble in the ocean of illusions...`
`No longer...would anyone protect her.`
`No longer...would anyone believe her.`
`So she was now...the true culprit.`
`Eva's shoulders heaved with her heavy breathing.`
`...Apparently, her anger still hadn't abated.`
`Erika patted her shoulder and made Eva take a step back.`
`...Of course, this wasn't to protect Natsuhi from violence.`
`It was to further humiliate Natsuhi, ...now that she had been branded as the culprit.`
`"Natsuhi-san,`
` I've solved two of the three riddles.`
` The 'who dunnit'.`
` And the 'how dunnit'.`
` The final riddle--the 'why dunnit'--must always be confessed by the culprit herself.`
` Please follow the rules of the mystery genre and confess."`
`The 'why dunnit'...refers to the motive.`
`"If this was a third-rate mystery,`
` ...you would let out a high-pitched laugh about now, confess to the crime,`
` and start telling the story of her sad past.`
` ...Don't tell me you intend to make me explain that part as well?"`
`"...I am not the culprit!!`
` Someone, believe me!!`
` I just had my husband taken hostage, was threatened, ...and fell into a trap...!!"`
`Natsuhi, with her hair a mess and her face red and tear-streaked, `
`...protested to everyone, `
`...but no one met her gaze.`
`Because it has already been resolved that Natsuhi was the culprit.`
`Because Lambdadelta had acknowledged that the culprit of the tale was Natsuhi and had woven it that way,`
` none of the pieces would pay any heed to Natsuhi's...to 'the culprit's' words...`
`"Natsuhi isn't the culprit!!`
` I am the Golden Witch, Beatrice!!`
` I am the one who commands Rokkenjima's night and who has reigned since long before the time you were all still scared of the dark!"`
`"Why can't you just call it my sin? Why must you suspect Natsuhi?!!`
` Acknowledge me!!`
` I committed all the crimes!!`
` There's no way a Human is the culpriiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`The Illusion of the Witch had already been crushed, ...and Beato's voice didn't reach anyone.`
`The verdict had already been made.`
`......Everything had been decided.`
`"No one can hear you.`
` You're a phantom, a mere illusion!`
` Go back to being a simple portrait!`
` You're a faint phantom of a witch, born when Kinzo shared his illusion with his relatives!!`
` That is the truth chosen by this world!!"`
`"So, Great Lady Lambdadelta!!`
` Now is the time for you to bury the ridiculous and foolish illusion that this witch claims is the truth...!!"`
`"Goodbye, Beatrice.`
` ......I made you a witch expecting that you'd either become my friend `
`or help distract me from my boredom.`
` And you've answered to my expectations.`
` The second one, that is.`
` ...Heheheheheheheheheheheheheh!!"`
`"...I...`
`...am a witch...`
` Even if Lady Lambdadelta doesn't acknowledge it, `
`...I'm a witch......"`
`"Oh, sure, but you wouldn't even be capable of believing that if I hadn't become your guardian in the first place...!!`
` Yep, this is 'game over' for you.`
` You'll be buried in accordance with the rules of your game board.`
` ...What happens to the losers in your game, again...?"`
`"Beato has already shown that clearly in a previous game.`
` You get made into a mound of living flesh before being tossed into the goats' dinner party and getting chewed to bits."`
`"Now there's a fitting end for you, Beatrice.`
` And I did come all the way here just to hear the death cries of one as haughty as you...!!"`
`One by one, a massive number of goat attendants slipped out from the shadows of the pillars and began to fill the cathedral.`
`The goats paid no attention to Natsuhi, who was seated in the center,`
` but the crowd completely enveloped her.`
`From Beato's point of view up on the balcony, `
`...it probably looked like a huge boiling pot of goats.`
`".........Heh, `
`...*cackle*, `
`...hahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` That's right, `
`...the contract has been like this since the beginning...!"`
`"Yep.`
` Our contract said that whenever you stopped entertaining me,`
` you would relieve me of my boredom with your life!"`
`"Come, strip the title of witch from this woman and throw her into the pot of goats!!"`
`Suddenly, there were goats standing right behind Beato.`
`...They lifted her up roughly.`
`"Let me hear some nice screams.`
` You're the wine I've been fermenting all this time."`
`"...Then perhaps refusing your request will be my final strike back at you..."`
`"Yeah! I made her say it!`
` Uhihihahaaah!!`
` The best screams always come from a girl who's just said some tired line like that.`
` ...Fall!`
` Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiceeee...!!!"`
`The goats carrying Beato no longer viewed her as their master.`
`After holding her above the pot of clambering goats, which were snorting heavily in anticipation...`
`...They threw Beato's slender body into the air.`
`All at once, the squirming goats faced the heavens and raised their arms.`
`It was almost as though they would be able to forget their pain for just a short while by devouring her flesh.`
`As she flew through the air, Beato tried to smile boldly,`
` ...but it was so stiff that it seemed even more pathetic,`
` much to Bernkastel's amusement.`
`When Beato fell into the pot, the goats caught her.`
`Of course, they didn't do it gently.`
`The arms of countless goats pulled at her flesh to keep it for themselves.`
`They tried to tear her to bits.`
`It didn't have to be flesh.`
`Hair, fingernails, shoes, even bits of her dress worked just fine.`
`The mouths of those goats were the gateway into hell.`
`However, Beato was too big to enter into that gateway.`
`So they had to chew and tear her into bits small enough to fit into it...!`
`......Beato let out a bold laugh.`
`She laughed from inside the pot of goats.`
`However, her expression was very different from the one she had wanted.`
` ......It was an expression not of a witch, ...but of a single Human yelling in her death throes.`
`Then, the sea of goats parted.`
`Dlanor leapt forward, slicing all the goats in her path with a single flash of her longsword.`
`...It was a clean slice, like cutting through butter.`
`The goats were surprised by Dlanor's sudden appearance and stepped back.`
`In the center, Beatrice cowered in tatters, `
`...sobbing...`
`"What's this supposed to be,`
` Dlanor, Inquisitor of Heresy?"`
`"My apologies, but I have something to SAY.`
` There is someone who has an objection to this RULING.`
` His name is...`
`Ushiromiya Battler."`
`All of the goats stared at Battler.`
`"What is unsatisfactory about the court's RULING...?`
` ...Do you possess any new evidence or truth sufficient to request a RETRIAL...?"`
`"...............Gah..."`
`I get it.`
` ...Dlanor is offering me a helping hand.`
`If she hadn't jumped in here, it'd all be over.`
`And now, I fully understand how I'm supposed to fight.`
`But because I understand how, ...I am unable to fight right now.`
`After all, I can't win by simply countering Erika's truth.`
`If I want to deny her truth, I'll need to present a different one.`
`...And I still don't have a clue what that truth is...!`
`"There is nothing that is not healed with TIME.`
` And there is no truth that cannot be reached if you spend enough time SEARCHING.`
` ...However, all trials have a limited time in which the truth must be DECIDED.`
` Therefore, a truth that cannot be reached within that limited time cannot become TRUTH."`
`...Yeah, ...I know that...!!`
`By now, everyone is certain that Aunt Natsuhi's the culprit.`
`It might be too late now, ...even for the real truth...!`
`Aunt Eva's violence will probably go unstopped,`
` and no one is even thinking about protecting Aunt Natsuhi.`
`It's no longer a situation where we can say 'oh, the truth will eventually be found'.`
`And in this world, ...the time remaining to expose the truth...is very short.`
`It's already 24:00, at the game's end.`
`The police won't come.`
`The truth won't be revealed!`
`Only the truth decided upon here and now will remain...!`
`"..............."`
`I slowly stood up, `
`...walked in front of Beato, `
`...and faced Dlanor.`
`......I have no plan.`
`I don't know the truth.`
`...However, ...if I don't jump in now, I won't get another chance to fight...`
`The red used by Erika's group is mercilessly strict.`
`I seriously doubt that I can put together a truth where Aunt Natsuhi isn't the culprit without violating that red...`
`"...Why the uncertain FACE?`
` How PATHETIC."`
`"D-Dammit......"`
`"...B-Battler..."`
`"I'll be the one to kill you.`
` ...I want to keep that promise.`
` ...And yet,`
` ...right now,`
` ...I don't have any plan at all..."`
`"......That's okay...`
` In this world, `
`...there is no truth.`
` ...The truth is made later on and overwrites what comes before it.`
` Real truth...`
`...doesn't exist anywhere..."`
`"Now this is a splendid scenario, Dlanor.`
` It just wouldn't be interesting unless a knight appears before the princess's execution.`
` ...And there's nothing better than watching heads roll before your very eyes!`
` Erase the old piece and the unneeded player all in one go!!"`
`"As you WISH.`
` Glory be to the Great Lady Bernkastel!`
` I am the Head Inquisitor of Heresy, Dlanor A. Knox...!!`
` Step forward, Ushiromiya Battler!!"`
`"...D-Dammit, I've got nothing more to lose...`
` If you wanna see me struggle, I'll show yooooooooouuuuu!!"`
`The only reason Erika's theory is so strong is because of those seals.`
`She was given red so quickly just because Lambdadelta easily bought the alibis created by those seals.`
`But the seals aren't red truth!`
`Just sticking paper in a door crack is far from perfect.`
`There's no way something like that can prove anything with 'certainty'...!`
`"Begin, Battler!!`
` Ready to let those goats turn you into a pile of meat along with your beloved Beatrice?!"`
`"Oh, and I'll mix the leftovers from your precious sister into that pile.`
` Wouldn't that make for a wonderful stack of meat?`
` ...Then we can wrap it up in a dumpling, steam it, and maybe add some soy sauce!!"`
`"No, the best way would be to fry them in a pan with some eggs and ketchup!!"`
`""Ahyahhahahahahahahhhayhhyahyayhyahahahaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!""`
`"D-Dammiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt!!`
` #5decffCan't we doubt the reliability of these seals of Erika's?!`
` Something like wedging some paper in a door can't create a perfect alibi!`
` It might be that someone noticed by chance and happened to put it back in the same place...!!#ffffff"`
`The blade of my blue truth should have slashed diagonally through Dlanor's chest.`
`...However, Dlanor's expression didn't budge in the slightest, and there wasn't a single wound on her chest.`
`"I was wondering what you'd throw out there, but this is ridiculous..."`
`"...Allow me to explain.`
` This is what I sealed the doors with.`
` ...Did you think this was paper, Battler-san?"`
`Erika once again held up the thing that looked like brown paper.`
`"This is packing tape.`
` And its adhesive power is extremely strong.`
` ...I used scissors to make it easier to tear."`
`"Furthermore, I wrote my signature, which cannot be reproduced, in three places:`
` across the tear point, across the edge between the door and the tape, and across the edge between the tape and the doorframe.`
` Therefore, it's impossible to tear it off without leaving a mark, and it's impossible to reattach too...!"`
`"Permission to unsheathe the 'Red Key'."`
`"Granted."`
`"#ff0000Due to the above, the seals are guaranteed to be PERFECT.`
` <Miss> Erika's seals were not broken by anyone, and deception is IMPOSSIBLE!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffI'll acknowledge Erika's seals...!`
` However, Aunt Eva's seal on Genji-san's room should be different!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000Eva's seal was of the same type as <Miss> Erika's.`
` That is because this method of sealing was one that <Miss> Erika and Eva conceived of together after DINNER.#ffffff"`
`"#5decffErika said something about a scientific investigation and fished through the chemicals in Grandfather's room, right?!`
` There might have been some kind of solvent in there!!`
` If you used that, you might be able to tear off the packing tape without leaving fingernail marks!!#ffffff"`
`"Please, allow me to speak.`
` #ff0000It is impossible to tear off any of the seals by any method without leaving marks.#ffffff"`
`"Please, allow me to speak.`
` #ff0000There were no suspicious marks on any of the seals...!#ffffff"`
`"Therefore, it's been proven that nothing was done to any of the seals.`
` Repeat it!!"`
`"Yes, gladly.`
` #ff0000All of Erika and Eva's seals`
` were not tampered with in any way that hindered their ability to act as seals, such as being scraped off.#ffffff"`
`"...Dammiiiiiiit,`
` ...damn you, using packing tape that leaves marks all over the place...!"`
`Dlanor isn't my only enemy.`
`There's also her subordinates, Gertrude and Cornelia.`
`And also Erika and her master Bernkastel.`
`And even Lambdadelta, the one who hijacked Beato's game!`
`Everyone in this cathedral is an enemy.`
`That fierce rush of red immediately repelled my feeble truth.`
`...It's obvious why.`
` I don't have any alternate truth.`
`Even at this final stage, ...I have nothing...`
`"Were the seals all that you had to DISCUSS?`
` You promised to give it everything you've GOT."`
`".........Nngg......"`
`If I only knew a truth that could prove Aunt Natsuhi's innocence...`
`If I could only make a theory that weaves its way through Erika's red...`
`...Dammit, I don't know anything!!`
`"...Do you have any chance of winning...?"`
`"...I left it at home.`
` Mind if I go back and get it?"`
`"I have already lost.`
` ...I am prepared for my fate."`
`"...I promised that I'd kill you.`
` So I won't let anyone else do it.`
` I'll definitely keep that promise...!!"`
`"Liar.`
` ...I'll never trust your promises again."`
`"Huh?`
` When did I ever make a promise to you, and what was the lie...?"`
`".........Heheheh, ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` ...After hearing you say that, hell might not be so bad.`
` ......Ehahahahahahaha, gahahahahahaha...!!`
` Kill us! Bernkastel, Lambdadelta...!!`
` Hyahhahahahahahahahahahaahahahaha!!"`
`Beato let out a shrill cry, overcome with laughter.`
`...It was a broken laugh, and tears streamed down her cheeks.`
`Battler's words would no longer reach her ears.`
`She kept on laughing insanely, like a broken record...`
`"Is it OVER?`
` PITIFUL.`
` I truly am DISAPPOINTED, Ushiromiya Battler...!!"`
`"Hyahhahahahahahahahaha, hiihhahahahahahahaahahahahhyahahahahahaaaaaahh!!`
` Kill me, Dlanor!! Slice me in half with that red longsword of yours!!`
` Hyahhahahahahahahahahaahhaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`Nng, ...nngaaaaaaaaaaaaggghhhhh!!`

`In the face of these insane arguments, `

`Each time I brandished my desperate blue truths,`

`Their red truth is getting more and more perfect...`

`want to see Beato like this...`

`She's just a pitiful woman who's been trampled over and lost all hope,`
` with tears streaming down her face and a tragic smile that I can't bear to look at...`
`"Does your truth no longer EXIST?"`
`No, `
`...I have one...`
`last thing.`
`"...And that is a different truth, where Natsuhi isn't the CULPRIT?"`
`...That's not it.`
`All I can do is prove that Aunt Natsuhi isn't the culprit.`
`After that, `
`...I can't show what the real truth is at all...`
`"...But even so, ...maybe at least you'll be saved that way."`
`"Why......?"`
`"...I can show without a doubt that Aunt Natsuhi isn't the culprit.`
` ...However, I cannot show a different truth.`
` ...If Erika's truth is dispersed, the crime will return to darkness, and there might still be room for you to exist."`
`"Yeah, if you can do it.`
` ......But if you can't show a new truth, that means you're incompetent and useless as a player.`
` I'll have you vanish from this game board for all eternity."`
`At this point, the Game Master is Lambdadelta, `
`...and 'she' is there too.`
`This probably doesn't mean losing a single game,`
` but being banished from this game for all eternity for losing.`
`From what the witches have said in the past, `
`I can faintly imagine the place 'pieces' are sent when they're banished.`
`It's known as the depths of oblivion, `
`...an eternal darkness that lies on the far side of an eternal oblivion and where there is no concept of life or death...`
`...I'm going to disappear, aren't I...`
`However, ...Beato will remain.`
`As long as Beato remains, no matter how suspicious Aunt Natsuhi is, `
`...there will always remain space for the witch to be the culprit...in other words, room for Aunt Natsuhi to not be the culprit.`
`...As long as that space exists, ...someone will eventually expose the truth.`
`It doesn't have to be me.`
`Anyway, ...eventually, someone will smash this fake truth to pieces...!`
`I understood that the time had come to abandon myself for the sake of this other person who would eventually appear, `
`...for the sake of the real truth...`
`"...Well, `
`...it looks like I'll have to break my promise to kill you after all."`
`"Don't.`
` Don't leave me as the only one alive.`
` I'll disappear with you.`
` Let that be your final tribute to me.`
` ...I beg you, if you just do this one thing, I don't need anything else..."`
`"......Have you used up everything you HAVE?`
` ...I really am disappointed in you, Ushiromiya Battler."`

` Erika has been following this procedure, right...?"`
`True, Erika hadn't used the red herself even once so far.`
`...She always had Bernkastel, a witch, repeat her statements...`
`"Your red truth isn't something you obtained for yourself.`
` ...It's a supernatural truth given by a paranormal being.`
` In other words, it isn't reasoning.`

`With that, the trial for the 5th game ended.`
`The detective, Furudo Erika, accused the culprit, Ushiromiya Natsuhi.`
`There are three riddles that the detective must explain.`
`The first is the 'who dunnit'.`
` Who is the culprit?`
`As previously stated, it is Ushiromiya Natsuhi.`
`The second is the 'how dunnit'.`
`How did they carry out the crime?`
`During the hour between 24:00 on October 4th, 1986 and 1:00 the next day,`
` Ushiromiya Natsuhi went to the cousins' room on the second floor of the guesthouse and the servant waiting room on the first floor of the mansion.`
` There, she carried out the murders.`
`It is only possible for the crime to have taken place during that hour,`
` and for that one hour, alibis have been proven for all characters except Natsuhi.`
`From the sky, a massive, red longsword, even greater in size than the one Dlanor held, came crashing down like a thunderbolt,`
` piercing through Battler's heart and pinning him in place while he still stood...`
`In that instant, Beatrice became a golden splash and faded away,`
` ...and her former minions disappeared as well.`
`As the heartless witches looked down at the cathedral's center, laughing coldly,`
` ...all that remained was Battler, with the red longsword sticking through him, and Dlanor.`
`"Agh......nng, `
`......gghh......"`
`"...Rest in PEACE, Ushiromiya Battler.`
` What a SHAME.`
` I thought you were a more capable person than THIS."`
`".........Guh........."`
`Battler blew bubbles of blood,`
` ...closed his eyes slowly,`
` ......and died...`
`Dlanor stared on in silence,`
` ...then turned on her heels when she saw his life leave him.`
`After that, all that remained was the corpse of this sorrowful man, pierced by the sword that acted as a massive, red grave marker,`
` and lit by the faint glow let in from the cathedral's skylight......`
`And then, there is the third riddle the detective must uncover.`
`The final riddle, ...the 'why dunnit'.`
`Why did they commit the crime?`
` The motive.`
`In third-rate mysteries, there's no need to uncover this.`
`After all, even if you don't expose the motive, the culprit will just confess it when all's said and done.`
`However, Furudo Erika was first-rate, so she would expose even this.`
`Natsuhi was being confined in the parlor, under everyone's watchful gazes.`
`Then, Erika made use of everyone to diligently and persistently search all places, even Natsuhi's room, `
`for clues about her motive.`
`"Well, now that we have all gathered,`
` just what is it that drove Ushiromiya Natsuhi-san to commit these terrible murders?`
` Through my investigation, I, the detective Furudo Erika, have discovered the general outline that explains this.`
` I would like to announce it now."`
`Everyone remained silent, urging her to continue...`
`Erika tossed some of Natsuhi's possessions that had been 'confiscated' onto the table...`
`"First, these are past diaries that were discovered in Natsuhi-san's room.`
` They have barely been used at all in recent years,`
` but they describe in detail the period shortly after she became a part of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"Most of them were locked, but in order to find the full truth behind this crime,`
` I used my authority, which everyone has acknowledged,`
` to destroy the locks on all of them."`
`"...H-`
`How barbaric...`
` ...Reading...`
`another person's diary..."`
`"If we're barbaric, what does that make you, murderer?!!`
` A criminal like you has no right to privacy!!"`
`"And this is what I found from these diaries.`
` Natsuhi-san ended up married to Krauss-san due to special circumstances."`
`"...I imagine that all of you here know much more about this than I do.`
` Natsuhi-san and Krauss-san were not married because of love or as a normal arranged marriage.`
` ...If anything, it was more like taking a hostage."`
`"...Th-That is not true!!"`
`"This is written on the 24th page of this red diary: `
`......'I am a hostage being imprisoned by the Ushiromiya family under the guise of marriage.`
` However, if everything can be resolved this way...'"`
`"Natsuhi-san,`
` right here, you've already acknowledged that you were a hostage.`
` ...Kumasawa-san, you have served Natsuhi-san since the time she first came here, right?`
` Could you tell me about what it was like at the time?"`
`"......Y-Yes, that's correct.`
` ...I did catch wind of something similar to what you describe...`
` ...I think that by now,`
` ...only Doctor Nanjo and I know of the details regarding Madam's marriage..."`
`"Very true...`
` ...That was during Kinzo-san's golden era, when he did whatever he pleased...`
`He defeated all of his enemies and expanded his financial power.`
` ...Natsuhi-san's family was one of those enemies."`
`As though the time to talk had suddenly come at hand,`
` Kumasawa and Nanjo openly delved into territory that should never have been touched upon again...`
`This was concerning the period during which Kinzo was most feared for his ferocity.`
`It has been said that, though Kinzo had many assets and connections, `
`he held a grudge after being looked down upon by members in the elite as being an upstart.`
`Because of this, apparently, `
`Kinzo wanted to find Krauss a wife from a noble family and use this to raise the Ushiromiya family's status...`
`Then, he overcame Natsuhi's family in a financial struggle...and proposed that a marriage be performed as a method of reconciliation.`
`And the person he picked...was Natsuhi.`
`Natsuhi had been raised to be clean and pure in a family of Shinto priests--making her a true noble lady.`
`By choosing her, not only did Kinzo cause them the worst possible humiliation,`
` he also won what he considered to be a nice trophy.`
`So, that marriage proposal was humiliating to Natsuhi from the very beginning...`
`"Regarding the aforementioned facts, both Kumasawa-san and Doctor Nanjo's claims`
` just now match with the contents of the diaries."`
`"Therefore, since the time Natsuhi-san first took the name Ushiromiya Natsuhi, `
`she has held a strong resentment against the Ushiromiya family.`
` ...What do you have to say, Natsuhi-san?`
` Do you acknowledge this?"`
`All of the cold gazes turned to face Natsuhi...`
`"...Y-Yes, it's true that I thought that at first...`
` I thought I was being forced into a marriage without love, ...a hostage under the guise of a bride..."`
`"However, ...my husband...never viewed me as a mere hostage...`
` ...He understood what I had gone through and gave me compassion and affection...`
` My husband...was the only person who could understand me...!"`
`"...I see.`
` That makes sense.`
` And there are many scenes in your diaries `
` showing that Krauss-san knew of your difficulties and showed kindness."`
`"However, on page 47 of this diary, `
`you describe these moments as being unpleasant, correct?"`
`"Let me read aloud.`
` 'When Krauss tries to show kindness, it only makes me feel more wretched.`
` Sometimes, I think he might even be trying to humiliate me further'.`
` ...Therefore, we can tell that Natsuhi-san repaid her husband's kindness with contempt."`
`"...W-Wait...!`
` Yes, I may have thought that at the beginning...!`
` Back when I was still overwhelmed with unease, `
`I couldn't accept his kindness and wrote of my distrust from time to time...!`
` But I eventually realized he was sincere and grew to accept his feelings...!"`
`"Well, nothing like that appears in any of these diaries."`
`"...I-I never even wrote it down,`
` those feelings were so secret...!"`
`"Judging by many diverse bits of evidence and testimony,`
` it's clear that you despised your husband.`
` And there exists no evidence `
`that you eventually accepted his feelings, as you claim."`
`"......I-I loved my husband...!!"`
`"You can't find any testimony or evidence that can be used to elevate that statement to the level of red truth, right?"`
`"...D-Does anyone need evidence to say they're in love...?!"`
`"You can't trust anything besides the red truth...!!`
` Statements that aren't red don't count as evidence at all, and they can't be trusted at all!`
` All non-red letters are falsehoods that exist to deceive me!!`
` 'I love you'?`
` Who would believe that when spoken with the white text?`
` No non-red words can ever be trusted!!`
` All I can trust in this world are the red truth and the pieces of evidence I offer to my master to gain it!!"`
`"You lying Human who can't speak the truth!!`
` Humans lacking the red truth have no right to speak of love or the heart or truth!`
` Did you know?`
` Men aren't as stupid as you women think they are.`
` Men never really take it seriously when a woman says 'I love you'...!"`
`"...What a pitiful person...`
` I see that you've never truly loved someone..."`
`"Romance is unnecessary for a detective.`
` I don't think I've ever used the word romance except to explain a motive for murder."`
`"No matter what you say, we loved each other...!!`
` I should be apologizing to my husband for always writing down my complaints and nothing else...!`
` But I have devoted my heart to him...!!`
` Even if I can't prove it, ...that is the truth!!"`
`"Rejected.`
` You just don't know when to give up, do you?`
` By now, due to evidence and testimony, `
`it's clear you hated both your husband and the Ushiromiya family."`
`"That's right!!`
` I can't even count the number of times I've heard you complain...!!"`
`"Oh, and you've never talked behind Hideyoshi-san's back...?!"`
`"Dammit, you killed my husband!!`
` How dare you say that?!!`
` Die! Die and apologize to my husband!!"`
`"Please cease your violence, Eva-san.`
` This is now the precious moment where I question and convict the culprit.`
` It's not yours, okay?"`
`"Well then.`
` Over the next several years, she appeared to have gotten used to her new way of life,`
` but in actuality, an intense hatred still lurked in her heart.`
` Taking that into consideration, there would be nothing odd at all about her deciding to take revenge."`
`"D-Don't act like you know what I'm thinking...!!"`
`Each time Erika read Natsuhi's diaries, one after another,`
` ...she exposed more of Natsuhi's emotions during those painful days.`
`...Natsuhi hadn't written them to leave those words behind.`
`She had written to forget those memories and seal them away.`
`That's why she had written down her feelings during those painful days, `
`...locked them up, and sealed them away for all eternity.`
`However, Erika claimed that these were Natsuhi's true, hidden feelings that had been locked away and concealed.`
`Since it had already been 'concluded' that Natsuhi was a murderer, everyone accepted Erika's claim.`
`By this point, the red truth wasn't even necessary to establish Natsuhi's motive.`
`As long as the reason seemed plausible, everyone would believe it.`
`No matter how much Natsuhi might object, no one would believe her.`
`No one could accept the truth Natsuhi spoke of, about the days she had spent loving her husband.`
`That had been painted over by a false truth, in which she hated her husband and swore revenge against him...`
`The pen of the gods that composes the truth had been given to Erika.`
`"And so what?!`
` Who gives a damn about your past?!!`
` Murderer, murdereeeeeer!!"`
`"S-Stop that...!`
` I can understand how Natsuhi-san felt...!"`
`"I always thought this day would come, eventually...`
` ...Poor thing, poor thing..."`
`"I think she's just one of the pitiable victims `
`of Father's wild life."`
`"I knew of the pain in Madam's heart...`
` I always tried to support her, `
`...but I failed, and look what has happened..."`
`"...I don't...`
`even understand...`
`the emotions of love and hate."`
`"......You will, someday.`
` It can become a reason to live...`
`and also a reason to kill."`
`"............"`
`"...............`
`...I-`
`Is Aunt Natsuhi...`
`...really the culprit...?"`
`"Well, now that you mention it, `
`there is just one person besides Natsuhi-san that might be the culprit."`
`"...Wh-What?`
` Hey, are you serious...?!`
` Why didn't you say something that important sooner?!!"`
`"Natsuhi-san,`
` the truth is, there is one person besides you for whom the crime was possible.`
` ...If you truly claim that you aren't the culprit,`
` it means that person must be the culprit."`
`".........Huh...?"`
`"Who is it...?!`
` Who...?!"`
`"Ushiromiya...Kinzo-san."`
`"......Ah, ......"`
`"Early this morning, Kinzo-san went outside through the window of the third floor study,`
` and his location is unknown.`
` Isn't that right, Battler-san?"`
`"...Nngg, ......"`
`"Just like Natsuhi-san,`
` Kinzo-san has no alibi whatsoever.`
` The truth is, for this crime, it was possible for Kinzo-san to be the culprit as well."`
`"I just assumed that he never existed in the first place, `
`so I totally forgot about him until just now.`
` Allow me to apologize."`
`She didn't look shy or apologetic in the slightest.`
`Erika bowed in as unpleasant a manner as ever...`
`...She had held a grudge ever since her defeat in the study battle...`
`"Natsuhi-san, you gained Kinzo-san's trust and are the person who served closest to him, right?`
` So, shouldn't you know better than anyone else?`
` ...This incident is actually the crime of the Family Head, carried out by Ushiromiya Kinzo-san."`
`"...Y-`
`You dare...`
`...call Father...a criminal...?"`
`"Don't worry.`
` I have prepared more than enough evidence and testimony `
`to explain the 'why dunnit' if Kinzo-san was actually the culprit.`
` If you say, for example, that you have put yourself on the line to cover for Kinzo's crime, I am more than capable of supporting you."`
`"Ever since the late period of the author Ellery Queen,`
` even the theory created by the detective can sometimes change the plot itself.`
` You really can't afford to be careless in this day and age."`
`"...I won't let you...`
`...treat Father like the culprit!!"`
`"Natsuhi-san,`
` calm down, place your hand on your chest, and think carefully.`
` ...If you accuse Kinzo-san of being the culprit, this entire case will be resolved.`
` You will no longer be held accountable for another person's actions, and your honor will be restored."`
`In other words, by pushing the crime onto Kinzo, Natsuhi would be saved...`
`However......`
`"...I-I have been entrusted with the honor of the Ushiromiya family...by Father...`
` ...Did you really think......that I would defile Father's honor, ...the Ushiromiya family honor, `
`just to clear away the false accusations made against me...?!!"`
`Of course, Natsuhi knew that she wasn't the culprit.`
`And she also knew that Kinzo wasn't.`
`So being framed herself and pushing the blame onto Kinzo were both unacceptable, unbearable outcomes.`
`"Are you sure?`
` As I have already established quite thoroughly,`
` alibis have been proven for everyone except you.`
` If you will not accuse Kinzo-san,`
` ...then this time, it really will be clear that you are the culprit, `
`and that will become the truth, right...?"`
`"If you intend to label me as the culprit and call that your own personal truth,`
` then do whatever you like...!`
` I am sure that God knows of my innocence...!`
` Eventually, he will prove it!!"`
`If it came to a choice between her and Kinzo being framed, `
`...Natsuhi would sacrifice herself.`
`Perhaps...`
`...that was her way...`
`...of protecting the Ushiromiya family's honor.`
`"......Aunt...Natsuhi..."`
`"And I even gave you a chance..."`
`.........Stupid woman.`
`This future where your name will eventually be cleared...`
`doesn't exist for any of you...not for any of the pieces on this board.`
`Natsuhi...had made her decision.`
`If they were going to call her the culprit,`
` ...she would let them.`
`She boldly rejected the thought of selling Kinzo's honor to gain a momentary truth where she wasn't the culprit...`
`And, therefore...`
`The tale was woven with her as the culprit.`
`In the future, if the accusations against her are proven false.`
`This tale will probably be rewritten...`
`However, that future will never come.`
`...I think...`
`Truth is a fleeting thing.`
`Even if I am a good person until my death...`
`If some heartless person after my death overwrites the records and says I wasn't a good person,`
` and if that is shared with everyone else...`
`...Then even all the goodness in which I lived my life could be overwritten easily.`
`And so, I think...`
`That I won't live as a good person for all eternity....`
`"...If you claim that Kinzo-san was not the culprit,`
` he will need an alibi proving that the crime was impossible for him.`
` Otherwise, we cannot truly be certain that you are the culprit, Natsuhi-san."`
`Erika has probably known for a long time.`
`Kinzo is nothing more than an illusion to make the inheritance problem more uncertain.`
`However, it would be very hard to prove that he was an illusion.`
`The only way to do this would be to confirm Kinzo's death,`
` ...but as has been made known by the red truth in previous games, Kinzo died a long time ago.`
`And in this 5th game, his corpse hasn't even appeared.`
`In a situation like this, it wouldn't be easy to absolutely prove his death...`
`If Kinzo's death was confirmed, ...it would practically erase that defeat in the study.`
`It was the only way Erika had of removing the humiliation of that loss.`
`And there was something that could confirm Kinzo's death almost as certainly as real proof.`
`And that was.........'the confession of the culprit'.`
`It would mean having Natsuhi herself acknowledge that Kinzo no longer existed in this world.`
`That way, it would be acknowledged that Erika's reasoning in the study was correct,`
` ...that loss would be painted over, and it would be rewritten as Erika's victory...`
`Battler hung suspended by Dlanor's red longsword.`
`Beato had disappeared by having her existence denied, ...and her minions had gone too.`
`In this cathedral that they had disappeared from,`
` ...only Natsuhi and the witches convicting her remained.`
`"So, `
`...you still claim that Kinzo is alive and remains somewhere on this island...?"`
`"That's correct...!`
` Father is in good health...!`
` No matter what anyone says, I will not change my statement...!"`
`"The red truth from the previous games says that `
`#ff0000Kinzo is already dead#ffffff.`
` ...But that's not enough to satisfy you, right, Bern?"`
`"...Yeah, that's right.`
` I'm after a perfect victory.`
` ...So there's nothing interesting about getting a checkmate just because Kinzo's death has been confirmed by the red.`
` ...I want to win by forcing Natsuhi to say she's resigned.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"Then why don't you try it?`
` Show us what you've got."`
`"My master, let us now achieve a perfect victory...!!"`
`"Of course.`
` .........Natsuhi,`
` you say Kinzo is certainly alive, but you don't know where he is, correct?"`
`"Yes, that's right...!`
` Father left through the window and his location is unknown...!`
` He is so troublesome sometimes...!"`
`"Lambda,`
` I'm gonna make Kinzo's location from 24:00 until the morning absolutely clear.`
` ...`
`#ff0000From 24:00 until morning, Kinzo stayed in the same room.#ffffff"`
`"......?`
` Well, that's true, ...he was a corpse after all.`
` ............`
`...No, I'm sorry.`
` That's right, totally right.`
` I won't butt in.`
` It sounds interesting, so keep going."`
`"......From now on, I'll use the word Kinzo to refer to 'the living Kinzo'.`
` After all, Natsuhi claims that he's alive.`
` ...I'll say more with the red truth.`
` #ff0000Kinzo does not exist anywhere outside the mansion.#ffffff`
` ...Isn't that right? Erika."`
`"Y-Yes, my master...!!`
` I searched for Kinzo all over the premises outside the mansion...!`
` However, I was unable to find him...!"`
`Because of the detective's authority, Erika could 'find all clues'.`
`Therefore, if Erika was unable to find 'a hint that Kinzo existed outside the mansion',`
` it was the same as proving that Kinzo didn't exist outside the mansion.`
`Therefore, Bernkastel repeated that truth of Erika's...`
`"#ff0000Kinzo does not exist outside the mansion. #ffffff`
`.........Hey, Natsuhi.`
` If 'Kinzo does exist', then this means he must be somewhere inside the mansion.`
` Do you have any idea where Kinzo might be hiding...?"`
`"H-How could I know...?!`
` After all, think of the weather.`
` There would be nothing strange about him leaving the courtyard `
`to hide somewhere in the mansion and dry the rain off...!"`
`"Pfft, ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*`
` From this point forward, I will repeat the same thing several times.`
` ...I'll give you many chances for an honorable surrender.`
` ...If you're too stubborn, you'll lose even your true honor."`
`"......N-No matter how you threaten me, I will not give in...!!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*`
` I just love teasing pieces like you.`
` ...Then, let us continue."`
`"...For the aforementioned reasons, it is unthinkable that Kinzo-san could have been somewhere outside the mansion.`
` ...So, first off, I performed an extensive search of the third floor, where the study is."`
`"However, there was nowhere he could've been hiding.`
` ......We couldn't find any trace of Dad on the third floor."`
`"So then, where is he, Natsuhi-san?"`
`"I-I don't know...!`
` If he isn't on the third floor, perhaps he's hiding in the basement..."`
`"Ah, yes, the basement.`
` The boiler room, that underground storage room...every part of your suspicious basement was also included in my search."`
`"Yes, I searched too...!`
` I didn't see Father anywhere...!"`
`"I'll say it again.`
` Where is Kinzo-san, Natsuhi-san?"`
`"I-In that case, he was probably on the first floor or the second floor...!!"`
`"I see, process of elimination does tell us that, doesn't it?`
` We then thoroughly searched the first floor.`
` And the result?"`
`"......Nothing.`
` We were unable to find Father."`
`"I'll say it again.`
` Where was Kinzo-san, Natsuhi-san?"`
`"Th-Then he was probably hiding on the second floor...!!`
` How should I know where Father was hiding?!"`
`"Are you sure about that...?`
` Do you really not know where Kinzo-san was hiding...?"`
`"M`
`......Madam knows...`
`...where Kinzo was hiding...?!"`
`"......That's...insane..."`
`"That...can't be true..."`
`Both Shannon and Kanon knew that Kinzo was already dead.`
`So they didn't have a clue how Erika would use a phantom of a person who didn't exist to corner Natsuhi...`
`"#ff0000Kinzo is nowhere outside the mansion.`
` Kinzo isn't on the third floor.`
` Kinzo isn't in the basement.`
` Kinzo isn't on the first floor.`
` Therefore, the only place Kinzo could possibly exist is the second floor.#ffffff"`
`"I accept that red truth.`
` ...Natsuhi,`
` Kinzo should be somewhere on the second floor.`
` Will you still not tell us where he's hiding...?"`
`"N-No matter how many times you ask, it won't change the fact that I don't know!"`
`"Erika,`
` start from the beginning and go in order, investigating the entire second floor.`
` ...Use the detective's authority to avoid missing a single clue and to see through all types of hidden doors and hidden rooms...!"`
`"Yes, my master...!!`
` That Natsuhi-san's pretty dumb, isn't she...?`
` She still can't see where we're going with this."`
`"*giggle*`
` No need to talk more than is necessary.`
` Come on, Erika.`
` Take everyone with you and begin the investigation...!"`
`Erika used her detective's authority to take everyone, even Natsuhi,`
` and go up to the second floor to search every room, starting at one end.`
`Even for rooms that were thought to have nothing at all to do with the crime, Erika did not relax her search in the slightest.`
`...Her search was thorough in every single room as they moved through them all...`
`"So, you still won't tell us where Kinzo-san is hiding?"`
`"Stop saying that!`
` How many times do I have to say that I don't know...?!"`
`"Natsuhi-san,`
` ...even if we do keep searching, we'll never be able to find Kinzo-san at this rate, right?"`
`"...?!"`
`Of course.`
`Kinzo doesn't exist.`
`No matter how long this search continues, it's just a waste of time.`
`This was known by Erika, the witch's piece, and Natsuhi, the one who knew the truth...`
`"In that case, this search will end in the room at the far end of that corridor.`
` ...In other words, it will have been proven that Kinzo wasn't in any of the rooms except that one.`
` What do you think about that?"`
`"He isn't on the third floor or the first floor or the basement,`
` and he isn't in any of the rooms on the second floor except the one at the end.`
`So if he really did exist inside the mansion,`
` ......it had been proven that he could only exist in that room at the end.`
`In other words, this was Hempel's Raven.`
`Because it had been established that a 'living Kinzo' couldn't exist anywhere except the final room at the end of the corridor,`
` that automatically meant that a 'living Kinzo' existed in that final room...`
`...And that room at the end of the corridor was...`
`"Oh, ......ah........."`
`"Which room was at the end of the corridor, again?"`
`Lambdadelta was munching on a refill of popcorn.`
`"That's Natsuhi's room, Lady Lambdadelta...!!"`
`"...In other words, Kinzo had no place to hide except inside Natsuhi's room.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*!`
` Do I need to say it in red?"`
`"Of course...!"`
`"#ff0000Kinzo does not exist anywhere outside Natsuhi's room!#ffffff"`
`"Well then,`
` that means this room is the only place left.`
` ...It means Kinzo-san isn't anywhere outside this room."`
`"...I-Isn't this my room?!!`
` Where exactly in my room do you claim Father is hiding...?!"`
`In a rage, Natsuhi unlocked the door to her room and pointed inside.`
`...Of course, Kinzo was nowhere to be seen.`
`"Do you see Father anywhere in here?!`
` Look!!"`
`"......I see, looks like he isn't there.`
` Did he realize we were coming and escape out the window?"`
`If Kinzo wasn't in this last room, ...it meant that he didn't exist anywhere.`
`'There was no living Kinzo outside the mansion'.`
`'There was no living Kinzo inside the mansion'.`
`Therefore...`
`'No living Kinzo existed'.`
`However, Erika didn't make that argument.`
`She had pointed that out herself, without making a checkmate.`
`It was because Bernkastel didn't want to win by cornering Natsuhi with the red truth.`
` She wanted to force Natsuhi to accept a humiliating resignation...`
`"I have not only been searching for Kinzo-san himself all this time.`
` I have been looking for signs that Kinzo-san hid somewhere between 24:00 and the morning.`
` And no such signs have existed."`
`"...In other words, from 24:00 until morning,`
` Kinzo was always holed up in the same room.`
` And that was Natsuhi's room!"`
`"It means the checkmate of red truth `
`has finally cornered the piece known as Kinzo's phantom inside Natsuhi's room."`
`"Hey, Natsuhi-san.`
` This means you were with Kinzo in this room until morning.`
` Do you still claim that you didn't know where he was?"`
`"I'll acknowledge it with the red truth...!!`
` #ff0000During the night, between 24:00 and morning,`
` a living Kinzo could not have existed anywhere outside Natsuhi's room!!#ffffff`
` I permit you to use this truth to advance your argument about how he could only have existed in Natsuhi's room!"`
`"A plea bargain.`
` ......Hey, Natsuhi.`
` ...Even someone as stupid as you must have realized the fix you're in now.`
` This is your last chance.`
` ......Make Kinzo the culprit."`
`"Call the Ushiromiya Family Head a criminal and crush the Head's honor to protect yourself.`
` If you show that you have the guts to do that, `
`I'll change the plot into one of a tragic heroine taking the blame to protect the Family Head."`
`"Father is innocent!`
` I cannot call Father a criminal!!"`
`"...She's refused the deal!`
` Hehehehehehehe, okay, Bern.`
` Do it...!"`
`"#ff0000During the night, between 24:00 and morning, `
`there exists no place for a living Kinzo to exist except inside your bed.#ffffff"`
`"......Wha, `
`...and...`
`...wh-`
`what do you mean...by that......?"`
`"After conducting a thorough search of this room,`
` and a detailed scientific examination,`
` I discovered that Kinzo did not exist anywhere in this room between 24:00 and morning.`
` However, your bed is the only exception."`
`A shocked silence dominated the room...`
`Natsuhi completely forgot to close her open mouth...`
`"Last night,`
` around the time the gold was discovered, so probably at about 23:00,`
` Kinzo-san escaped from the window on the third floor and snuck into the bed in your room.`
` ...And, as an even more unfortunate result from my investigation, `
`it has been proven that you were also sleeping in that bed."`
`"I'll repeat it.`
` #ff0000From 24:00 until morning,`
` a living Kinzo could only have existed inside Natsuhi's bed.`
` And last night, Natsuhi also slept in that same bed.#ffffff"`
`"Wow, look how close they were.`
` So, you two were so close to each other, you slept sharing the same pillow?"`
`"Blue truth.`
` #5decffTherefore, it is suspected that Ushiromiya Natsuhi and Ushiromiya Kinzo had sexual relations with each other.`
` Why else would a man and a woman share the same bed all night long?#ffffff"`
`"H-How rude!!!`
` T-T-To think that I would...`
`...d-do such a thing...with the Father I respected so much...`
` I-I won't allow you to say such things!!"`
`"Natsuhi,`
` use the red truth to counter this blue truth.`
` Of course, since you aren't a witch, there's no red that you can use.`
` So I'll speak with the red truth in your place.`
` At least, I will if you can show me convincing proof...!!"`
`"...H-`
`How could such proof...`
`even exist?!!`
` How low are you willing to sink to mock me?!`
` D-Dammiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`Natsuhi tried to attack Erika, `
`...but Eva pinned her arms behind her back, so she couldn't do anything.`
`"How unsightly.`
` ...In order to take revenge against the Ushiromiya family, `
`you first schemed to take control of everything the family owned.`
` For that reason, you used your body as a weapon and ensnared Kinzo-san."`
`"I never did anything of the sort!!`
` I have never given my body to anyone except my husband!!"`
`"I understand why you want to deny it,`
` ......but testimony from several witnesses has already made it clear that you've had repeated secret meetings with Kinzo-san."`
`"After all, last night, you went to 'say goodnight' to Kinzo-san...`
`with just the two of you alone in his study, right?`
` And beyond that, I've collected multiple bits of testimony regarding clear traces of sexual intercourse."`
`"Are you insane?!?!`
` Who was it?!`
` Who said something so ridiculous?!`
` G-Gohda?!`
` Shannon?!`
` Was it Eva-san?!`
` Yes, you must be behind something this ludicrous!!`
` Who was it?! Whooooo?!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"`
`"I've received testimony from those involved.`
` Wow, this is pretty fatal.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*...! No room for doubt now!"`
`"Hey, Natsuhi,`
` looks like you don't even have a scrap of honor left now,`
` ...but I'll give you one, final chance before I build you the worst of all possible Fragments.`
` ......Go ahead and say that Kinzo wasn't there, okay?"`
`"That's right, you sure are stubborn, Natsuhi.`
` ...The Ushiromiya family has already been torn to ribbons, right?`
` ...Are you really that desperate to confuse the inheritance problem by pretending Kinzo exists?"`
`"This is my final challenge...in protecting the honor of the Ushiromiya family, which Father entrusted me with...!!`
` My husband's business will definitely...definitely succeed!!`
` Until we can use that to repay our debts, I cannot hand over the inheritance of the Ushiromiya family!!"`
`"I will protect Father and my husband's honor!!`
` That is...my mission!!!"`
`"...Wanting to protect the honor of the dead is an admirable trait."`
`"He's not one of the dead.`
` We're talking about the honor of a convenient delusion inside Natsuhi's head.`
` ......`
`#ff0000The real Kinzo never once `
`ordered Natsuhi to protect that honor.#ffffff"`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!"`
`As Natsuhi screamed, she fell down to her hands and knees...`
`She no longer had any way to reject the fake truth that Bernkastel and Erika had weaved...`
`"......By my name as the Game Master, Lambdadelta,`
` ...I acknowledge Lady Bernkastel as the victor of this game!`
` ...If anyone has any objections, state your name now!!"`
`...............`
`Of course there were none.`
` All of those who might have objected had been erased...`
`"No objections!`
` Bern, this is your victory, and a wonderful victory it is!`
` Now, you must weave up the Fragment of the truth!!"`
`"Sure.`
` I'll go weave up the truth.`
` ...This is the truth of this sad, pathetic tale.`
` ...Though I did want Natsuhi to acknowledge her crime while half-laughing, half-crying.`
` After all, that's standard in the genre, right?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`After being forced into a marriage she hadn't wanted,`
` Natsuhi developed a grudge against the Ushiromiya family and was filled with a desire for revenge.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 3)`
`Natsuhi, also hoping to take revenge for the financial submission her parents' family had been forced into by the Ushiromiyas, `
`schemed to capture the Ushiromiya family's wealth.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 4)`
`Knowing that the wealth of the Ushiromiya family was, in practical terms, under Kinzo's personal control,`
` she initiated sexual relations to curry favor with him and managed to ensnare him.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 7)`
`(*From the Bernkastel Docs: Page 682)`
`To curry favor with Kinzo, `
`Natsuhi repeatedly imitated Beatrice, the witch of Kinzo's delusions, and engaged in sexual acts.`
`Kinzo saw his long-lost mistress in Natsuhi and was easily ensnared.`
`Furthermore, by chance, she was sometimes witnessed in this guise by the servants, and this became part of the foundation for the Legend of the Witch.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 8)`
`(*From presented evidence #17)`
`(*From the Bernkastel Docs: Page 802)`
`However, late at night on October 4th, 1986, Ushiromiya Battler discovered the hidden gold.`
`The relatives were in an uproar and decided that Battler should succeed the Headship, so Natsuhi planned the crime.`
`She murdered the children in the so-called 'cousin room' and tried to frame Battler for the crime.`
`Furthermore, Genji was murdered for opposing this scheme.`
`Later on, Hideyoshi was also murdered.`
`From this point on, she displayed the strong intent to indiscriminately murder all those involved.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 27)`
`(*From Supplemental Materials B: Page 61)`
`(*From the Bernkastel Docs: Page 1103)`
`The following outlines the details of the crime.`
`24:00, October 4th, 1986.`
`Natsuhi decided to commit the crime.`
`She asked Genji to assist her, but was refused, so she murdered him.`
`She then murdered her husband Krauss in his own room.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 40)`
`(*From Supplemental Materials S: Page 8)`
`(*From the Bernkastel Docs: Page 1105)`
`(*From GC Internal Docs: General Affairs A09 #9974)`
`Afterwards, she went to the so-called 'cousin room' on the second floor of the guesthouse,`
` waited for Rosa to join the rest, and killed George, Jessica, Maria, and Rosa.`
`She damaged the necks of those corpses.`
`Afterwards, because there were people in the lounge on the first floor, she waited in an empty room on the second floor.`
`She hid in this empty room until the people in the lounge dispersed and went to bed.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 41)`
`(*From Supplemental Materials S: Page 10)`
`(*From the Bernkastel Docs: Page 1131)`
`(*From GC Internal Docs: General Affairs A09 #9974)`
`The people in the lounge dispersed just after 3:00 AM.`
`Natsuhi left the empty room and escaped from the guesthouse.`
`She returned to her personal room, where she met up with Kinzo, who had been hiding there.`
`She stayed there until morning.`
`Kinzo left the room early next morning and concealed himself somewhere near the guesthouse.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 41)`
`(*From Supplemental Materials S: Page 29)`
`(*From the Bernkastel Docs: Page 1200)`
`(*From GC Internal Docs: General Affairs A09 #9974)`
`Afterwards, Kinzo saw his chance and carried off the corpses of the six victims one by one, hiding them.`
`Unfortunately, these hidden corpses have not been found.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 42)`
`(*From Supplemental Materials S: Page 37)`
`(*From GC Internal Docs: General Affairs A09 #9974)`
`Natsuhi, who had failed in her scheme to cast suspicion on Battler, changed her plan to include the murder of all present.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 58)`
`(*From Supplemental Materials T: Page 19)`
`(*From the Bernkastel Docs: Page 1348)`
`(*From GC Internal Docs: General Affairs A09 #9974)`
`Predicting that one of those present would eventually want to take a rest in a private room,`
` Natsuhi concealed herself inside a closet in one of the guest rooms.`
`At about 1:00 PM, she murdered Hideyoshi after he entered that room.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 61)`
`(*From Supplemental Materials T: Page 26)`
`(*From GC Internal Docs: General Affairs A09 #9974)`
`From the time the others became aware of the incident to the time that they carried Hideyoshi's corpse out, Natsuhi once again concealed herself in the closet.`
`Furthermore, as proof of this, a button from Natsuhi's clothes was found in the closet.`
`Afterwards, she left the closet and tried to return to her room.`
`However, Furudo Erika found and questioned her first, and she confessed to the crime.`

`GC Official Notice #0172`
`4434`
`Due to the result of Illusion Trial #0147-007982 (24:00, October 5th, 1986), we announce that the following has been determined:`
`That Ushiromiya Natsuhi did admit to her crime.`
`For 13 months following this announcement, related docs may be perused at the Great Court Legal Offices Document Management Center, First Subsection.`
`             Great Court Deputy Chief`
`             Head Inquisitor of Heresy`
`             Dlanor A. Knox`
`"Then let's all assume that I did it, okay?!`
` That's what you want me to say, right?!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh...!!!"`
`As though she'd given up and decided that it'd be useless to try and talk her way out of this any longer,`
` Aunt Natsuhi screamed that out.`
`...It was a sad incident.`
`I wanted to believe that, despite the pitiable circumstances that led to her marriage into the Ushiromiya family,`
` ...Natsuhi just might have been able to grasp a sliver of happiness together with Uncle Krauss and Jessica.`
`...However, by Aunt Natsuhi's own doing, Uncle Krauss...`
`and even her beloved daughter Jessica...`
`had been heartlessly killed...`
`It was even harder to believe that Grandfather had been an accomplice and hid the corpses...`
`However, judging by the clear testimony given by several people who knew him, `
`Grandfather's mental state for these last few years has been far from what anyone would consider normal.`
`Perhaps, possessed by a mad devotion to the mistress he had lost long ago,`
` ...Grandfather might truly have believed that Aunt Natsuhi was a reincarnation of Beatrice.`
`Where is Grandfather now?`
`Like Erika had theorized,`
` did he really believe that he could revive Beatrice by carrying out murders following the epitaph,`
` succumbing to Natsuhi's cajolery?`
`...Right now, is he holding some kind of disturbing ceremony with the bodies he carried away...?`
`"Are you......`
`...satisfied now......?`
` ...This...`
`...is what you wanted to make me say, right...?"`
`Aunt Natsuhi sobbed as she spoke.`
`"...This is...`
`......your revenge, isn't it...?`
` You, the man from 19 years ago...!!"`
`This 'man from 19 years ago' that Aunt Natsuhi kept mentioning was supposedly someone who had caught her in some sort of trap.`
`However, she had only mentioned that this man from 19 years ago existed,`
` and she most certainly hadn't tried to explain what had happened 19 years ago...`
`"I'm sure...that man's underling is one among us here.`
` ...I'm sure that right now, that man is ridiculing me through one of you..."`
`"......Then tell me...!`
` Are you happy now?`
` Has a bit of that pain and suffering you've endured for 19 years gone away...?!`
` ......I finally understand.`
` ...The reason you've cornered me so far...is because...you wanted to make me acknowledge that, right...?"`
`"...Natsuhi-san,`
` other than us, there's absolutely no one here.`
` Please stop this insanely desperate charade and quit pretending that someone who doesn't exist actually does."`
`Erika laughed mockingly, but, as Aunt Natsuhi looked at us...`
`...No, as she looked at some being behind us, ...she hung her head and shook.`
`Then, ......she confessed to her sin.`
`"I......committed murder..."`
`"So, you've finally acknowledged your crime directly."`
`"No,`
` this is not about what has happened today and yesterday.`
` ......I will confess to a murder that occurred 19 years ago."`
`The adults all whispered together, wondering what this was about.`
`...Because they had never heard about a murder case 19 years ago.`
`"N-Nineteen years ago,`
` ...I......committed a sin.`
` ......I couldn't forgive it.`
` ...That......baby...!!"`
`"Baby?`
` Now what are you talking about?"`
`"...On that day 19 years ago, `
`...Father entrusted me with a baby.`
` ......Since I still couldn't bear a successor on my own, Father told me to adopt a child,`
` ...and he made me hold a baby that he said had been brought here from an orphanage..."`
`"Do you have any idea...how humiliating that was to me as a woman...?!"`
`With a mix of conflicting emotions, of anger, sadness, regret and possibly defiance, `
`Aunt Natsuhi confessed.`
`Her humiliation as a woman when she was no longer expected to bear a child.`
`And also, the indescribably unpleasant feeling of being made to hold an unfamiliar baby.`
`It caused her great sadness and rage,`
` and before very many nights passed, it ate a hole into her heart...`
`And then, ...I sold my soul to demons...`
`......It happened when I went on a walk through the rose garden to the harbor, along with a servant holding the baby...`
`...I wanted to be alone,`
` ...but that female servant holding the baby faithfully followed me everywhere.`
`I was unable even to tell her to stop following me, ...and therefore unable to escape from the child's crying......`
`......That day...`
`marked the beginning of 19 long, headache-filled years...`
`......Then, we faced the cliff from across the fence.`
`If by taking that baby...`
`and throwing it down onto the rocky beach far below me, `
`...I could undo it all...`
`...I really did listen to that demon's temptation.`
`"Then, ......for the smallest of moments, I thought of how wonderful it would be if I really could do that,`
` ...and lent an ear to that temptation.`
` ...At that time-"`
`The servant holding the baby stepped on a large rock, twisted her ankle, and staggered...`
`She leaned against the rough fence, ...and at that time, I thought I heard the fence creak loudly.`
`I told her to look out and tried to grab her shoulder.`
`"...No, `
`...I shouldn't be so vague...`
` I'll repent.`
` I'll confess.`
` ......At that moment, I'm sure that...as I told her to look out,`
` .........with both hands, `
`I reached for that servant's shoulder, `
`and with a thud, `
`...pushed her away hard..."`
`The rough fence snapped from the base,`
` ......and the servant, `
`...along with the baby held in her arms,`
` ......fell down towards the rocky beach below...`
`Even though...`
`...I remember that moment vividly,`
` ...for some reason I recall a vague...`
`and very strange feeling.`
`It almost felt as though instead of falling,`
` ...the two of them were silently swallowed up into empty space.`
`So I didn't even hear the sound of them crashing to the rocky beach.`
`No, I'm sure I heard it.`
`But because I wanted to think that they'd disappeared,`
` ...I must have erased that sound from my memory...`
`"......And then......?"`
`"For an instant, ...I thought it was a dream.`
` ...It was high enough that I couldn't see the two of them below me just by leaning over.`
` So I didn't know whether their fall...or the few seconds before that...had actually happened or not..."`
`I must have been wishing so strongly that the child would fall...`
`that I just had a daydream...`
`Trying to make myself believe this, I hurried back to the rose garden.`
` ...Then, I decided to let the servant take care of the baby, choosing to take a rest alone in the garden...`
`......Then, `
`.........Father asked what had happened to the baby, `
`.........`
`......and an uproar began over the disappearance of the servant `
`who had been in charge of it.........`
`Eventually, the broken fence was discovered,`
` ......and two corpses were found at the bottom of the cliff...`
`...The child had apparently been here for reasons that couldn't become known, so its existence was hushed up,`
` ...and the official story was that the servant had had an accident on her own and died.`
`That's right.`
`I...stole away two innocent lives in one go......`
`As for the poor servant, ...her family was graciously compensated.`
`Her aged husband, who didn't know the truth, accepted this even though he grieved over the unfortunate accident.`
`Then, just a few years ago, he died of old age, ......and I confessed the truth over his grave, apologizing.`
`"......But until this day, `
`...I have never apologized to that baby.`
` ...Yes, `
`......that's what you're after, isn't it...?"`
`"So right here, right now, I'll confess to my crime!`
` ...I, Ushiromiya Natsuhi, `
`......did 19 years ago...`
`...push you off a cliff...`
`and try to kill you..."`
`...But...`
`you didn't die, did you...?`
`......You're still alive, `
`...and you still call me 'Mother'...`
`......You came to this island...`
`and took your revenge on me, didn't you...?`
`For these 19 years...`
`...You knew that the one you should have called your mother pushed you off a cliff,`
` ...and you must have lived a very hate-filled life...`
`"...And now, ...you've taken everything I've gained since pushing you off that cliff,`
` 18 years of my life, ...and smashed it all to pieces...`
` ...I no longer have my beloved husband and daughter.`
` ...And I've lost even my honor...`
`and am being called a murderer...`
` ......No, ...I really am a murderer, aren't I..."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ...It all went according to your plans.`
` ...I'm now regarded as a killer...`
` .........How's that...?`
` Is this enough...`
`for your revenge...?`
` My husband and daughter have been killed, `
`...I've been made to look like a murderer, ...like an adulteress even...`
` After seeing me living in disgrace like this,`
` .........are you satisfied...?!`
` Yes, I'll bet you're quite satisfied...`
` ...Because my family...`
`...my honor...`
`...everything......has been stolen from me...`
` ...Ooohh, `
`...*hic*...`
`aaaaaaagggghhhhhh!!"`
`"......After all this, do you still claim that you were framed?`
` Seriously, you just don't know when to give up."`
`"Can you hear me?! You, the cursed child from 19 years ago...!!`
` Are you satisfied now?!`
` You've stolen everything from me now!!`
` What else could you want?!`
` ...Please, `
`...just...`
`......forgive me......"`
`"...It's useless, isn't it..."`
`"Huh......?"`
`"......Battler-san,`
` did you say something?"`
`"It's all useless."`
`"......B-`
`Battler...ku...n...?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` ...It's useless, isn't it...?`
` It's all useless..."`
`"Ah, `
`......aaahhhh.........!!"`
`The marriage ceremony ended without any problems, and the reception was held inside the cathedral...`
`As the goat demons partied raucously, `
`Dlanor could be seen leaning against a pillar, trying to escape from the noise.`
`Then, Gertrude appeared and whispered some kind of report to her.`
`"......Is that TRUE?"`
`"Allow me to speak.`
` Aide Cornelia is currently heading towards the scene.`
` ...I suggest that Lady Erika be contacted as well."`
`"UNDERSTOOD.`
` I will tell HER.`
` ...Gertrude, contact the head of ceremony SECURITY.`
` ...Prepare for BATTLE."`
`"As you wish."`
`"I apologize for interrupting your chat.`
` I am in charge of security for this ceremony."`
`"Huh? Is it me?!`
` Do you want something?"`
`"...I told you you were going too far.`
` Champagne Tower Bowling was always a bad idea.`
` Looks like it's time for a scolding.`
` *giggle*giggle*..."`
`"Hey, Beeeeeeern!!`
` Hey, what's going on, did I do something wrong?!"`
`"The reception desk has received an envelope from an unknown sender addressed to Lady Lambdadelta."`
`"I always ignore anonymous calls and letters.`
` Just throw it away."`
`"But, ...please look at this..."`
`"......What's that?`
` ...Did you tell anyone you received this...?"`
`"No, only the two Sisters at the reception desk and I know.`
` They have already been ordered to keep silent."`
`The instant she saw that envelope,`
` Lambdadelta snatched it away and lowered her voice.`
`...Bernkastel had walked away and was apparently making fun of Erika.`
`Bern--and of course, Erika--were both drunk.`
`If they were left alone, they'd probably forget about this.`
`It's true that this envelope has no sender written on it.`
`...However, the seal done on it in gold leaf...`
`fulfills the same purpose.`
`...This seal is...`
`Lambdadelta hid behind a pillar, ripped the envelope open,`
` took out its contents, and read them.`
`Her eyes instantly started to glint,`
` ......and she smiled like a kid who's just thought of a nasty trick...`
`"...What is to be done?`
` The sniper team is carrying red warheads.`
` If you give your permission, I will give the order to load them."`
`"......`
`...What are you talking about?`
` Do you realize how important these guests are?`
` If a stray bullet hits one of these attendants, `
`all the new Chiester Sisters will be sent straight from the factory to the guillotine for the next ten years."`
`"Understood. We will intercept with regular warheads.`
` Shall we post watches around the Seven Sisters of Purgatory?"`
`"Why would we need those?`
` After all, the Seven Stakes are Battler's...and now Erika's furniture.`
` Why would we post watches around our allies?`
` Just make sure security is nice and tight."`
`"Just now, we received a recommendation from Assistant Inquisitor Gertrude suggesting that we make preparations for battle.`
` Her reasons are unknown."`
`"From Gertrude?`
` ......Heheh.`
` Then follow that recommendation.`
` A party's more fun once you liven things up...!"`
`"Understood.`
` ......00 calling Chiester 17, Chiester 38, Chiester 45, Code R, be on your guards.`
` Transmitting level 2 alert."`
`"17, <copy>."`
` "38, <copy>."`
` "45, understood...!"`
`"It'd have been so much cooler if you'd said <copy> too nyeh."`
`"Ah, I just got nervous...!"`
`"Ah, right.`
` 45, come over here a second."`
`"Wh-What is it?`
` H-Hey, we're on the job...!`
` Stop, don't play with my ears...!"`
`"Your ears.`
` Better fold them down nyeh."`
`"......What did you say...?!`
` You're kidding, right?`
` That's impossible...!"`
`"Cornelia is heading there NOW.`
` ...The odds of Beatrice attacking here are extremely HIGH.`
` I recommend suspending the reception and EVACUATING."`
`"What's going on, Erika...?`
` Something go wrong with the entertainment...?"`
`"N-No, my master...! Please continue to enjoy the reception.`
` ...Hey, somebody,`
` let's get Lady Bernkastel some more dried plum wine...!"`
`Erika didn't have time to hide her agitation.`
`When Bernkastel saw this, ...she knew that their final, late guest had finally arrived.`
`"Luci-nee,`
` I hear there's been some movement in the guesthouse."`
`"...The guesthouse?`
` Who cares about the game board now?"`
`"Well,`
` ...they're saying that Kanon-kun disappeared from the cousin room..."`
`"What?!`
` Are you a moron?`
` The cousin room is a perfect closed room, with the door and all the windows perfectly sealed.`
` It's impossible for him to escape...!"`
`"No, I've been snooping about as well.`
` ...There's no mistake.`
` Kanon has disappeared from the cousin room."`
`"...He's probably hiding somewhere in the cousin room.`
` Or else, he's managed to trick everyone since the beginning...and was never in that room to begin with."`
`"That's impossible.`
` It's been guaranteed that 'everyone' is in the cousin room except the specific names Lady Erika read aloud back then.`
` It's impossible for him to trick his way out of there."`
`"...How did he get past the Jungfrau seal barrier...?`
` No, first off, where on earth is Kanon?`
` Find him at once...!"`
`At that moment, the cathedral suddenly went black.`
`The surprised commotion of the guests filled the cathedral...`
`"......She's here."`
`"00 calling <All Chiesters>.`
` Code R Alert!`
` Chiester 17, can you repair the electrical systems?"`
`"Negative.`
` Communications with the management staff have been severed."`
`"<All Chiesters, Code Red>!`
` <Rock 'n' Roll>!!"`
`"<Copy.>"`
`"<Copy.>"`
`"<Copy.>"`
`"U-Understood. Ah! I mean <copy>!"`
`The sniper teams in the chandeliers all released their safeties at once.`
`The entire security team down in the hall loaded their ammunition.`
`"...Lady Erika, let us evacuate to the waiting ROOM.`
` It is dangerous HERE."`
`"What's dangerous?!`
` I'm the territory lord of this world!`
` Why should I have to run away in fear?!"`
`"Gertrude, set up a VIP guard BARRIER.`
` Call Cornelia back here at ONCE."`
`"Yes, executing."`
`"A barrier?!`
` I need to be wrapped in one of your pitiful, pathetic barriers while I'm wearing a wedding dress?!`
` How insulting!!"`
`This disturbance made even Battler groan, as he sat in the next seat over like a doll...`
`"......Uuu......"`
`Even with his soul sealed, Battler probably realized that something strange was going on...`
`"She's late.`
` Right, Lambda?"`
`"Totally.`
` She sure kept us waiting."`
`"What was that just now?`
` A love letter from someone...?"`
`"A fan letter.`
` From the Lambda-chan Fan Club."`
`Lambdadelta played dumb and munched some popcorn.`
`Then, the lights finally turned on...`
`It was clear that during that blackout,`
` ...Beatrice had snuck in somewhere nearby, possibly even inside the cathedral itself.`
`The whispering demon attendants all realized it as well.`
`Whose scheme was this, ...and what were they doing?`
`...Though it may have been imprudent, they were looking forward to this, and an excited chatter filled the cathedral...`
`"Looks like she came."`
`"G-Gaap...!`
` They let you come back too...?!"`
`"Come on, putting me in a jail is pointless."`
`"True! Pu ku ku ku."`
`"...But Riiche.`
` ......Battler's closed room, the cousin room, `
`...and even the final possibility, the next room over, have all been sealed...`
` ...How are you planning to save Battler...?!"`
`"Let us suppose...`
`that Milady has found some trick X.`
` If so,`
` she would inevitably have to march in here to thrust that in Lady Erika's face..."`
`"But...against all of these Chiester troops...?`
` ...I can't believe this many of them were hiding here...!`
` It's impossible... She'll be sewn to death...!"`
`Rabbit ears dashed all about the hall.`
`...Incredible that she could remain hidden and unnoticed with so many people around...`
`"...If she can just get close enough to challenge Erika, ...she should be able to get herself an even fight."`
`"I see, that move.`
` ......However, does Milady have that item with her?`
` ...She always complains, and dislikes it when I prepare them for her.`
` ...My, my.`
` She's a troublesome one to the end."`
`Amid the crowd, Ronove took something out and showed it.`
`...When Virgilia saw, she understood what 'that' in his hand meant...`
`True, with 'that', ...it should be possible to stop the attacks from the Chiester troops...`
`"Well, if it doesn't work on Erika, we're through.`
` The problem is getting her right in front of Erika, if only for a second.`
` ...The Chiesters will probably prevent that with all they have.`
` ...Lia,`
` ...do you think you can gain her that time...?"`
`Virgilia gave a small nod.`
`However, the problem was the two Chiester troops standing at her back.`
`...Since the time she'd tried to jump out in front of the procession, she had been marked constantly...`
`It was possible, with Virgilia's vast magical power, to momentarily take out all of the Chiester troops in the cathedral.`
`That would only gain a short bit of time, but it would be enough to confront Erika.`
`...The Chiester troops knew this, so they kept a close eye on Virgilia with tense faces.`
`At that moment, `
`...the great cathedral door was blasted to bits.`
`The fragments became bright gold butterflies...`
`which danced across the room in a beautiful blizzard of gold leaf...`
`That golden storm...`
`...slowly faded away...`
`Then, `
`...at the entrance to that red-carpeted path to the grave...`
`...a calm, majestic figure was...`
`"Guards, shoot to KILL...!!"`
`"Negative, conducting identity comparison."`
`Dlanor ordered the guards to shoot the intruder right away, but Chiester 00 didn't respond.`
`Was it because she had been warned about shooting the guests...`
`and was afraid of the consequences of possibly shooting a drunk guest pulling some sort of prank?`
`No. 00 was just cooly and calmly carrying out her duties.`
`"...Oh, what a surprise... And I thought you weren't going to make it."`
`"............"`
`The pair faced each other from either end of the long red carpet.`
`However, in between them `
`stood several dozen Chiester honor guards...`
`"It took you quite some time to come here, most honored guest!!`
` You had us all quite worried!`
` But I am glad you managed to make it to the reception at least...!!"`
`"......Heh, `
`...heheheheheheheheheheheheh..."`
`Beato...laughed...`
`That chuckle...`
`...made Battler's eyes quiver slightly.`
`"...Y-`
`You......"`
`"...Did I keep you waiting? Furudo Erikaaa?!`
` ...I'm here to celebraaaaaate...!"`
`She had an overpowering and evil presence about her, ...strong enough to make anyone shiver.`
`Was there really any need to confirm her identity now?`
`Who else could possess such an overwhelming presence?`
`"B-`
`Beaaaaaaaa`
`trriiiiiiiiiiiiice!!!"`
`"'Let us meet again in hell' is a favorite parting line of mine, but-"`
`"Identity confirmed.`
` It is the Great Lady Beatrice!!"`
`"This time, it really did happen,`
` Furudo Erikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`At that moment, the two Chiester troops standing behind Virgilia slumped over and fell to the floor.`
`...Ronove had touched the bases of their big ears from behind.`
`It was clear that he had applied some sort of magic.`
`"Someone find a doctor.`
` These girls appear to be ill."`
`"<All Chiesters, open fiiiiiiiiiiire>!!"`
`"Beato, now!!"`
`Just an instant before the Chiester troops could fire, Virgilia raised her arms to the heavens.`
`Her magical power, which was more than enough to remind all present what her name had meant at the height of her strength,`
` became a spirit wave that exploded throughout the cathedral.`
`Its shockwave made the stained glass windows shatter, and colorful glass shards poured down everywhere.`
`"S-Spirit particle warfare defenses!! Hurry on reboot!!"`
`However, all of the Chiester honor guards, who didn't have spirit particle defenses, toppled over like dolls.`
`The ceiling snipers were defended and able to avoid a crash, but it would take several minutes before the system could be rebooted.`
`......That span of time...`
`...should be enough to reach Erika...`
`However, it wouldn't be possible to defeat Erika in just a few minutes.`
`There was no way they'd be able to carry Battler away in that time...!`
`What else could they use this precious time for?!`
`Beato dashed down the red carpeted path.`
`She ran down the path to the grave, which was lined by Chiester troops lying there like corpses.`
`She had called this place hell.`
`...In that case, running from hell to the grave was actually going backwards.`
`Beato's figure dashing through the corpse-ridden path truly symbolized her resurrection...!`
`"Milady, take this...!"`
`"Got it!!"`
`As she dashed, she snatched something white from Ronove's outstretched hand.`
`There was no longer anyone blocking her path to Erika...!!`
`However, at that instant, a golden thread came from in front of her and rapidly sewed through the red carpet towards her like a sewing machine!`
`"Hoh, we have a meddler...!!"`
`"Reloading complete, requesting data nyeh!"`
`"Firing radar targeted.`
` Data link to 410!!"`
`410 was clever.`
`She had predicted that Virgilia would go for a spirit particle attack...and had folded her ears and 45's over beforehand.`
`So, they were the only ones who weren't taken out.`
`"Firing!!"`
`Once again, the golden sewing thread chased after Beato, weaving like a sewing machine.`
`It was as though an undulating golden snake was shooting after her.`
`"Impudence...!!`
` You mean to delay my precious showdown with Erika...?!"`
`Beato jumped sideways away from the red carpet, then dashed across the long table covered with beautiful food.`
`The gold snake chased her, sewing through the pure white tablecloth like a sewing machine and scattering dishes left and right...!`
`The goat attendants ran about wildly, trying to escape.`
`The cathedral was wrapped in pandemonium.`
`"...I can't believe some of those rabbits evaded the spirit particle attack...!"`
`"This is bad.`
` If they take up that position, ...there's nothing we can do...!"`
`The pair of snipers, attacking from the chandelier high above, were much further away than Erika was--too far for Beato to reach.`
`Furthermore, their position landed the entire cathedral inside their range of fire!`
`"...Too bad nyeh, Beatrice-samaaa.`
` The trials of love are harsh nyeh!`
` 45, new magazine!!"`
`"You mean this?"`
`Gaap handed her the magazine.`
`...45 always handed them over backwards, so 410 was a bit confused to have one handed to her the right way up...`
` ...?!?!`
`"Nyeh?!`
` Nyeh nyeh nyeh,`
` let go, nyeh nyeh nyeh!!"`
`No matter how distant a position they might take, it was no problem for the elusive Gaap.`
`Gaap twisted their long ears up, then tickled them with her thumbs.`
`The Chiester's greatest weapon was also their greatest weakness.`
`The two doubled over with laughter.`
`"...I've got these two, `
`...but how many seconds do we have left?`
` The other Chiesters will be reactivating..."`
`On the other chandeliers, even more powerful Chiesters were slowly starting to move again...`
`It would be impossible to buy any more time.`
`"Ah, Gaap!`
` Thanks, I'm in your debt!!"`
`"Don't forget to thank these guys too."`
`"Beato-, good luuuuuck, hang in theeeeere!!"`
`"You don't have much time!!"`
`"Erikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`Beato cut through the crowd of scampering goats like Moses.`
`Her goal was straight in front of her.`
`The place where Erika and Battler were seated...!`
`Then, a red barrier took form, blocking her path.`
`It was the VIP-guarding barrier that Gertrude had set up.`
`She stepped forward and laid out a last line of defense to block Beato's path.`
`"Let it be known that you will get no closer."`
`"You think a wall like that can stop meeeeeeeeeeeeee?!!"`
`"How long until the Chiesters REACTIVATE?"`
`"W-Within 30 seconds..."`
`As the oldest of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, Lucifer stood in waiting behind the bride and groom.`
`She wanted to save Beato.`
`If she could just distract Gertrude for a moment, the wall would disappear...`
`However, the Seven Sisters were furniture.`
`They served the territory lord.`
`So, they couldn't move to help Beato...`
`Dlanor glanced over at Lucifer.`
`There was a coercive tint to her eyes.`
`"......You are not allowed to move except by the orders of your MASTER."`
`"......Nngg..."`
`"Who's our master...?!"`
`"It's Erika now, idiot...!"`
`"No, our master is Battler-sama!"`
`"True. Erika only speaks on his behalf."`
`"That's right, Onee-sama! Whose furniture are we?!"`
`"It's just too delicious, ...let's dig in!!"`
`The red, absolute barrier flickered for just an instant.`
`Beelzebub's stake had pierced Gertrude's shoulder, and her concentration had wavered.`
`...But it didn't break.`
`Slowly and expressionlessly, Gertrude turned to look at Lucifer.`
`"...By whose orders?`
` Know that Lady Erika has made no such order."`
`"We do have orders.`
` ...Th-The orders of our master!!"`
`"............"`
`"How can a master who cannot speak give orders...?"`
`"E-Even though he can't talk, `
`...understanding your master's will is furniture's job!!"`
`"Then, ...it cannot be helped."`
`The Seven Stakes shot at Gertrude at once.`
`...Gertrude had chosen to take all of those direct attacks, refusing to abandon the barrier until the last moment.`
`Though she was resilient enough to be called a literal iron maiden and received no damage at all,`
` it was more than enough to make her flinch and lose control of the barrier.`
`"Good work, my furniture!!!"`
`Beato shot through the scattered, red fragments of the barrier,`
` ...and she was finally right in front of the bride, her rival, Erika...`
`However, there stood the final shield protecting Erika.`
`...Death Sentence Dlanor!!`
`"......You're too LATE.`
` ...Time is already UP, Lady Beatrice!!"`
`"Chiester 17, data link to <All Chiesters>.`
` Incoming data from Archangel Satellite. Homing Format, Verdict-Model Conceptual Guidance."`
`"Chiester 20, reactivation complete."`
`"Chiester 127, reactivation complete."`
`"Nihhihihihihi... Time's up nyeh.`
` Nihhyahahaha!!`
` No, not there,`
` noooooooooo!!"`
`"......Riiche,`
` good luck..."`
`"......Be...`
`...a...`
`...to..."`
`"...Keh, ...D-Dlanor...!!"`
`"Back off, Dlanor A. Knox.`
` This isn't your fight."`
`"...I have received a red truth denying you from Lady Bernkastel.`
` ...I'm afraid that this will become your GRAVE...!"`
`I don't know what Bernkastel has allowed her to say.`
`However, I don't need to sit around and let that longsword tell me.`
`"I'll play with you all you want later.`
` But for now, back off!"`
`There's no time.`
` The Chiesters have already finished reactivating.`
`I'm only living on a bit of borrowed time.`
`"You will be the one to RETREAT...!!`
` You are the pitiable actor who has chosen the wrong time to make an APPEARANCE!!"`
`Dlanor's red longsword cut a large arc of absolute denial,`
` ...which headed straight for the crown of Beato's head.`
`However, in that instant, there was *thunk*, and the curve missed slightly.`
`Beato didn't let this good fortune go to waste.`
`She slipped past the longsword, `
`...knocked Dlanor aside, `
`...and finally stood right in front of Erika...!`
`This time, not a single person stood in her way!`
`"Uuu...guh...`
` ...This is...`
`POPCORN???`
` Wh-Where did this come FROM...?"`
`"Urgent request from the bride's bodyguard team!!`
` Let the Chiester Sisters Imperial Guards fire at the intruder immediately!!"`
`The commotion...quieted...`
`...However, `
`...no one...`
`shot.`
`...Why...?`
`They could have shot if they'd wanted to.`
`All of the Chiester troops had completely targeted her and removed their safeties.`
`Of course, all of them had finished reactivating.`
`...However, `
`...they hesitated to pull the trigger.`
`"Wh-Why aren't they shooting?!`
` Let the ceremony guards immediately...!"`
`"...W-WAIT.`
` ...L-Look at THAT..."`
`Dlanor's expression grew grim.`
`...Then, she quietly...put her red longsword away...`
`After all, ...Erika would have to make a decision.`
`If she decided to ignore it, they could shoot to kill.`
`However, if Erika picked that up, ...they must not do so.`
`So, they couldn't pull the triggers until Erika decided...`
`"...Why won't anyone shoot...?"`
`"Look closely.`
` ...See what Beato just threw at Erika?"`
`Lambdadelta pointed, still chomping down popcorn.`
`...It was hard to see from the balcony.`
`Beato had thrown something like a white handkerchief at Erika.`
`It had fallen to Erika's feet.`
`...What was that white thing...?`
`"...She really knows what she's doing, that girl.`
` She knows what it means to be the main character."`
`"How...`
`...interesting..."`
`"............"`
`The thing that had hit Erika in the face and fallen to the floor...`
`...was a white glove that Beato had gotten from Ronove.`
`Hitting someone with a glove like that could only mean one thing.`
`It was...`
`"Ooh, Zepar! What's this?!`
` What does it mean?!"`
`"This is...`
`...a request for a duel!!`
` If she picks up the glove, it means she's accepted!"`
`"And if she doesn't, the Chiesters will shoot?`
` Why would she pick it up?!"`
`"She doesn't have to.`
` ...However, we and the demon attendants would probably spread the word far and wide that she dishonorably ran away from a duel...!!"`
`""She would be known for eternity as a coward who ran away from a duel of love!!!"`
`Beatrice waited firmly and composedly.`
`If Erika just kicked it away...`
`...Then at that very instant, `
`...the Chiesters would probably all fire at once, turning her into golden embroidery.`
`So, Erika didn't have to pick it up.`
`However, ...she could not afford to be afraid of picking it up.`
`After all, ...she was the true victor, who had defeated Battler's closed room trick and logic.`
`If she was the victor, she should have nothing to fear.`
`So, ...if she was afraid of doing it,`
` ...it would prove that she still felt a tinge of doubt about her victory...`
`"......If I don't pick it up,`
` I can kill you without getting these clothes dirty."`
`"That would probably liven up your reception.`
` ...However, you will pick it up."`
`"Oh?`
` ...And why is that...?"`
`"...I've brought a wonderful gift just perfect for you.`
` ...You want to know what that is.`
` ...Therefore, you'll pick it up."`
`"Not interested. Goodbye."`
`"...You'll pick it up.`
` ...I know...`
`that you want to hear about the closed room I've brought you...`
`which, unlike that trivial guest room of Battler's,`
` ...is simple, basic,`
` ...and absolutely cannot be solved."`
`"...A closed room...`
`that absolutely...`
`...cannot be solved......?"`
`"...I know you want to accept my challenge.`
` ......After all..."`
`"............"`
`"You are-"`
`The detective.`
`Erika threw off her wedding dress as though it were a cape...`
`Yes.`
` Before she is a bride or a piece or a witch...`
`She is one thing first and foremost-`
`"I...am the detective.`
` ......I acknowledge you as my opponent.`
` However, ...are you qualified to participate in this game?`
` Have you managed to fix the logic error...?"`
`"If you pick that glove up,`
` I will prove that I have fixed it in my fight against you."`
`"............"`
`"........."`
`"<Good>!!"`
`Ooooooooohhh!!`
`The cathedral was filled with chatter.`
` ...Erika...had picked up the glove.`
`A duel! A duel!!`
`The cathedral was wrapped in a bizarre excitement.`
`At Erika's nod, Dlanor pushed the crowd away, leaving the pair alone.`
`...People were permitted to witness this duel.`
`However, no one would be allowed to interfere in any way...!`
`".........Uuughhh..."`
`"...It's okay, Battler-san.`
` ...I've already found a way to save you."`
`"H...`
`H...`
`H... `
`How...?"`
`"I'm going to save you now.`
` Please hang in there just a little longer..."`
`Beato's resolute expression returned, and she grinned boldly, looking down on Erika.`
`Ah, there can be no doubt...`
` ...That's the expression worn only by the Golden Witch, `
`...the presence of the master of closed rooms.`
`A shadow dashed through the stormy rose garden.`
`It was incredibly light and swift.`
`The raindrops never touched him, he made no splashes in the countless puddles, his feet left no tracks in the mud.`
`That rushing figure...was Kanon...`
`Then, he ran up the stairs...`
`to the entrance of the mansion.`
`He did not slow down in the slightest to open the door.`
`...He ran straight at it as though trying to break through, ...and leapt into it...!`
`Though the door was shut, even that couldn't stop Kanon.`
`He slipped through the door, fell into the entranceway, and slowly stood up.`
`His body wasn't even wet.`
`...And, ...as he recalled those nostalgic days spent serving the Ushiromiya family, which would never come again, `
`...he ran once more.`
`He was heading for Battler's guest room.`
`He ran past the servant room, `
`through the entrance hall, `
`and past the door to the parlor.`
`Then, the doors to the kitchen and the dining hall came into sight...`
`All of it brings back fond memories.`
`...There was the honor and rigidity of serving Kinzo directly.`
`However, that man wasn't rigid all the time.`
`...When the family was out of sight and he didn't have to preserve that air of majesty,`
` his face could turn unbelievably childish, and he would sometimes ask me to take part in strange pranks.`
`......The Master let me shoot lots of guns, didn't he...`
`...That...was pretty fun.`
`Krauss-sama was actually surprisingly kind.`
`He must've gotten the impression that the Master bullied me a lot.`
`Whenever I was the only one around, he would talk to me in a very familiar way, almost as though he was a classmate of mine.`
`...I sort of regret that I held back and never did anything but nod in return...`
`Madam was a really strict person...`
`...Ever since some rumor went around saying that she was strict on female servants but soft towards male servants, I get the feeling she viewed me as an enemy.`
`However, she was also a woman to be pitied.`
`...When I've seen her alone, I've noticed her shoulders sag with the pain many times.`
`There were a lot of servants, weren't there...`
`...Some lasted a short while, others stayed a long time.`
`Genji-sama was the one person I might have called my father.`
`...I am both grateful and resentful towards him over many things.`
`...They all mix together, cancel out, and I end up with a neutral emotion.`
`In that case, Kumasawa-san could probably be called my mother.`
`...She's helped me out many times.`
`I've always wanted to repay her someday,`
` ...and now I've lost that chance for all time.`
`Shannon...`
`...is my Nee-san.`
`Without her, I wouldn't have been able to be me.`
`Thanks for teaching me that the ocean is blue...`
`...Gohda?`
` ......I hate that guy.`
`Still, when I complimented his stew, `
`he would sometimes turn red and say there was enough for seconds.`
` ...I didn't dislike that part of him.`
`I wonder why such a strong memory popped up at the instant I ran past the dining hall...`
`And then, `
`...my memories of Jessica.`
`...Ooh.`
` ...I-It's a boy servant...`
` ...How...old are you...?`
`I think those were the first words she spoke to me.`
`...Come to think about it, she was probably interested in me ever since then.`
`I really did...have enough time to build up a love that wouldn't lose to George-sama and Shannon's.`
`But...since I could only see the gray sea, I wasted almost all of that time.`
`What does she like about me?`
`What do I like about her?`
`I get the feeling we never really made that clear.`
`...No, she told me.`
`We should've stayed together longer to eventually find that out.`
`...It would've been fine to find reasons for our love later.`
`...It took me...`
`far too long...`
`to realize that.`
`......Now, I think I can accept it.`
`I know why Shannon won the duel.`
`God must have been watching.`
`You had so much more courage than I did, and God didn't abandon you...`
`I reached the hallway with the guest rooms.`
`...There was someone lying on the ground.`
`It was Battler.`
` ...He was lying just outside the guest room, a chain tied to his neck.`
`...He had probably struggled to do something with the chain lock from the outside until he lost consciousness...`
`His fingernails on both hands had been torn off, and they were stained with blood.`
`...I could tell at a glance just how hard he had tried until the final moment when his heart had died.`
`The collar binding him wouldn't disappear unless the chain lock was set.`
`"...Battler-sama,`
` ......it's all right.`
` ...I'm going to save you now..."`
`".........!"`
`Battler responded faintly.`
`He probably hadn't even imagined that help would come to this eternal closed room.`
`...He was so scared that this might be an auditory hallucination brought about by a fleeting delusion...that he couldn't bear to open his eyes easily...`
`Kanon grabbed Battler by the arms and dragged him into the room...`
`The inside of the room...was terrible.`
`The windows had been brutally shattered, and the wind and rain had made its way inside.`
`All kinds of tools and furniture lay broken there.`
`However, Battler hadn't smashed them out of rage.`
`The curtain had been removed, torn, and twisted up into a bundle.`
`...He had probably used trial and error to see if that could be used as a rope for some trick.`
`He had tried using everything in the room, exploring all possible options of escape.`
`The traces could be seen throughout the room, and even in the bathroom.`
`...The empty bathtub was stained with just a bit of blood, `
`...and the nippers lay there on the bottom.`
`To protect this tale, `
`...he had nearly been prepared to accept Bernkastel's brutal method of escape,`
` cutting himself into pieces...`
`...and washing himself down the drain.`
`He was even willing to tear apart his own body...`
`...To protect the game that Beato had entrusted him with,`
` ...he had probably questioned himself over and over in this bathtub, wondering if there was any other way out.`
`...By the clock of the game world, not even a single day had passed.`
`...However, just how many years has it been in the closed room of the logic error?`
`When faced with an endless span of time, any way of ending it, no matter how cruel, is tempting.`
`......However, he had rejected that until the very end.`
`And, `
`...even in the last moment when his heart died, `
`...he had wanted so much to show his iron will to escape from this closed room...`
`...that he had chosen to fall here in the corridor, `
`...with the chain still around his neck...`
`"......Battler-sama,`
` ...it's Kanon.`
` ...Please, come to your senses..."`
`He wiped Battler's face with a towel wetted in the sink.`
`In response to that cold sensation, Battler's heart slowly started beating again...`
`"......Ah...`
`...`
` ...I-`
`It's you, `
`...Kanon-kun..."`
`"Yes, it's me, Kanon.`
` ...You did well...`
`...to endure until today."`
`"Heh...heheh...`
` ...Looks like...`
`I slept in...`
`just a little too...`
`much..."`
`Battler realized that the feel of the towel on his neck meant that the cursed collar and chain were gone.`
`"There's no longer anything binding you here.`
` ...Come on.`
` Please, head back quickly."`
`"......B-`
`But...`
`...if I unset that chain lock, `
`...that chain will come back..."`
`"Don't worry.`
` No longer does any chain exist to bind you, Battler-sama.`
` ...I will remain here."`
`"What...did you say...?"`
`By now, Battler knew the terror of this endless closed room better than anyone else.`
`So, he was more filled with shock than happiness, ...shock at the determination of the one who was willing to become the new prisoner...`
`"I will be fine.`
` There is no need to worry."`
`"...B-`
`But..."`
`"Battler-sama, isn't there still something you have to do...?"`
`"...I-`
`I..."`
`"Go back, quickly.`
` ...There is someone fighting in your place.`
` And, there is someone awaiting your return.`
` ...Will you not...`
`...go back?"`
`His stern words and gaze...shot straight through Battler.`
`"...Are...you sure?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...That will be fine.`
` This way, I can repay my debt from back then."`
`"...Debt?`
` Do you owe me something?"`
`"You aren't the one I owe, Battler-sama.`
` It's okay, so go.`
` I don't like being indebted to others.`
` ...Go, quickly.`
` ...You must not keep her waiting now.`
` ...So...hurry."`
`Battler couldn't argue back anymore.`
`He silently bowed his head, ...unset the chain, and opened the door.`
`Kanon had remained in the room, so no chain appeared about Battler's neck.`
`...He could leave this closed room just by running out...`
`The happy-sounding voices that he had heard at the far end of the corridor...`
`...had been replaced with an excited chatter.`
`There must have been some sort of strange disturbance going on.`
`As Kanon went out into the corridor to see me off, `
`...the merciless collar and chain had already captured their new prisoner.`
`He would remain inside this endless closed room...in Battler's place...`
`"......Kanon-kun,`
` I feel the same."`
`"About what?"`
`"I...don't like keeping debts.`
` ...I'll definitely repay you.`
` And I'll do it soon."`
`"...I hope I can count on that...`
` Go on. Run.`
` ...Run to the one you love.`
` And please, never get lost again...!!"`
`Battler didn't turn back again.`
`He ran with everything he had.`
`He ran out into the corridor, whose warmth he had cursed so many times.`
`That cursed chain no longer bound him.`
`He ran to the very end of the corridor, `
`...beyond the light...`
`Kanon, still connected to the chain, `
`...watched him go, then quietly returned to the guest room.`
`Now, he only had to worry about his own job.`
`Stay in this room, `
`...and fix the error in logic.`
`"......Now, `
`...I set the chain lock..."`
`As soon as he set it, the chain disappeared from his neck.`
`...Then, if he hid in the one place Erika hadn't checked...`
`......The broken logic would be fixed...`
`The closet door opened slowly.`
`It was well-oiled, and opened without a sound.`
`...It was cramped inside, and dark.`
`This tiny space...is the last place I'll see.`
`As long as I remain hidden in here, the logic will be preserved.`
`"......That's an easy job.`
` ...Easier than caring for the roses."`
`Kanon went in it...and closed the double doors from the inside.`
`...As soon as he did, `
`...a single small gold butterfly appeared,`
` ...melted into the darkness of the closet, and vanished.`
`It was a sign that the logic had been fixed.`
`The witch's game had already stopped, and the clock of the world of pieces would never tick again.`
`So, for all eternity, `
`...no one...`
`would come to save him from this place.`
`"That's okay.`
` ......This way, ...I've paid back my debt,`
` Beatrice."`
`The power of the gold butterfly brooch taught me about love.`
`In the third game, it gave me some quiet time alone with Jessica.`
`...I get the feeling it did many other small things for me.`
`At any rate, ...I've paid back all of my debts now.`
`Now, all of my debts are...`
`......That music tape Jessica lent me.`
` ...I never gave that back, did I...`
`That's okay, isn't it, Jessica...?`
`I liked that one.`
`Can I accept that as a present...?`
`...You want me to dub over it and hand it back...?`
`Ha, ...hahahahahaha...`
`............`
`......`
`Slowly, `
`...Kanon's body began to melt...`
`into a cloud of gold butterflies...`
`And, ...after the inside of the cramped, dark closet glittered like a golden planetarium, `
`...it faded away like the light of fireflies, `
`...and was painted over by a pitch blackness.`
`......For all eternity...`
`In the cathedral, the goat attendants...were all jostling around either side of the red carpet.`
`On the red carpet, `
`standing across from each other, `
`...were Beato and Erika.`
`In their hands...were the pistols given to them by Zepar and Furfur.`
`"Flintlocks, are they?`
` How old-fashioned."`
`"Pay it no mind.`
` Demons are very particular about style."`
`Its form was similar to an actual old-fashioned gun, but this was, of course, a demon's gun.`
`This wasn't a gun that would propel a lead bullet with an explosion caused by gunpowder.`
`...Like the pistols used in the duel between Shannon and Kanon, whose bullets had contained a magic that would always kill,`
` these pistols also had bullets that were not made of lead...`
`"...Beato..."`
`"There's no need to worry.`
` She'll win easily, and you'll have to deal with her insults again, Lia."`
`"When this match is over, we should ask to be paid every now and then.`
` ...After the fight ends, perhaps the occasional trip down to the Caribbean would be satisfactory."`
`"Enough talk about 'when the fight is over'...`
` That's an ill omen before a duel."`
`"Beato! Take this seriously!!`
` This is no time to be standing around laughing!"`
`"Why is Riiche relaxed and Lia tense? Come on."`
`"""Beatrice-sama, you can do it!!"""`
`"...Beatrice-sama is at a disadvantage in this duel."`
`"Why...?!"`
`"...Normally, witches are able to use strength in numbers to achieve victory.`
` However, since the game has been suspended, she has nothing on her side except 'the riddle of Battler-sama's guest room'."`
`"If Erika can just strike a blue wedge through that one riddle, it'll mean she's solved everything!!"`
`"They can win.`
` ...I believe in Beatrice-sama...`
`...and Battler-sama,`
` ...our two masters...!"`
`"...Did you call ME?"`
`"Thanks."`
`"...?"`
`"For once, `
`...it feels as though our chances of winning are 50/50.`
` So I'd like to thank you beforehand."`
`"It is simply my JOB.`
` There is no need to thank ME."`
`"......`
`...In the last game,`
` ...when you protected me after I lost pathetically,`
` ...I was happy.`
` That was the first time in my life that anyone has ever protected me.`
` ...Even my master has never done so.`
` All she has given me is a way to cancel out my pain by exposing the truth of others,`
` so that everyone ends up hurting each other."`
`"......`
`...Please, forgive my ARROGANCE.`
` ...I felt that I needed to protect YOU.`
` ...When I realized what a frail truth you live by,`
` when I saw you being tormented by the tyranny of a mixture of truth and lies that seemed more plausible,`
` ...I wanted to protect YOU."`
`"Thank you.`
` ......It wasn't for long, but you were a wonderful partner."`
`"And will remain SO."`
`"...You're right.`
` Once we've defeated her, let's make tons of mysteries on this island together.`
` I'll have you solve them, and tease you as we play.`
` ...How does that sound?"`
`"...I like IT.`
` I look forward to your CHALLENGE."`
`"Ah, sorry, that's a lie.`
` I take it back.`
` ...That'd be one of those loser flags, wouldn't it?"`
`"Pft-"`
`""*giggle*giggle*giggle*, ahahahahaha.""`
`""Now, are you ready, duelists?!!""`
`When the two demons clapped their hands, the duelists instantly returned to their bold, tense smiles.`
`"The bullets within those magic guns are not lead!"`
`"They are bullets of red and blue truth for the battle between mystery and fantasy!!"`
`"As long as you possess truth, your bullets are endless!"`
`"However, being hit by a single one means instant death!"`
`""Are you both prepared?!""`
`"Certainly."`
`"Of course."`
`""Lady Lambdadelta, o great and powerful Witch of Certainty and member of the glorious Senate,`
` please come forward!!`
` Will you swear to oversee this duel?!!""`
`"Of course.`
` I swear it."`
`The crowd split, and Lambda walked forward with Bernkastel by her side.`
`She looked between the faces of the two duelists.`
`Then, ...she took out an envelope with the seal of the One-Winged Eagle...and lifted it high.`
`"Beatrice has sent me her revisions to the tale inside a sealed envelope.`
` After inspecting it, I find its contents to be valid.`
` I proclaim that the logic error has been avoided!!`
` 'The chain lock is still set!`
` And without any contradictions with any red truth made up to this point!'"`
`*chatter*chatter*chatter*...!!`
`...The many goat attendants knew the details of Battler's closed room.`
`They realized how difficult it was.`
`And, though fiery debates had swept across the crowd during the reception, `
`none had been able to find an answer.`
`And now, ...it was clear that Beatrice had already reached one.`
`"Therefore, this duel is legitimate.`
` It will center around one, single point.`
` The closed room of Battler's guest room!`
` Battler disappeared from within a closed room sealed by a chain lock!`
` Therefore, Erika has been armed with the blue truth.`
` Beatrice has been armed with the red truth to counter back.`
` ...The duel will continue until one side is victorious!!"`
`"Splendid."`
`"Perfect."`
`"OK.`
` Well then, Beato.`
` Present your new, revised tale and riddle to Erika."`
`"Kanon used magic `
`to escape from the cousin room without breaking the seals.`
` He reached the guest room and used magic to let Battler escape from that closed room."`
`"......Hmph,`
` what a foolish tale."`
`"Very well.`
` Erika, is there anything you wish to confirm?"`
`"Repeat it.`
` 'The one who rescued Battler was, without a doubt, Kanon.'"`
`"Very well.`
` #ff0000The one who rescued Battler was, without a doubt, Kanon.#ffffff"`
`"Repeat it.`
` 'Battler and Kanon are different people.'"`
`"I'll say it.`
` #ff0000Battler and Kanon are different people.#ffffff"`
`"...Hmph.`
` That's enough."`
`"Erika, are you done confirming things?"`
`"That was all I needed.`
` I've already decided how to fight."`
`"OK!`
` Let both sides load their bullets...!!"`
`Erika turned around, pressed her finger against the barrel of the pistol,`
` ...made her blue truth into a bullet, and pushed it in.`
`There was no rule saying that she had to turn away, but she didn't want her expression to be read.`
`...Or, it might have been because she couldn't stand the tension of looking at Beato's bold smile.`
`Beato had already finished loading her red truth.`
`She waited for Erika to finish while calmly puffing on her pipe.`
`Then, ...she looked at Battler, who sat on the throne of the territory lord, right next to the two witches who were here as witnesses.`
`......Battler's consciousness was still hazy.`
`However, he apparently understood that Beato had come to duel for his sake, so that he could be saved.`
`It was all he could do to just look at Beato with those sluggish eyes, `
`...but a flood of emotions passed between them.`
`...There was no need for words.`
`A look was enough for them now.`
`Erika closed her eyes tightly, ...her finger still up against the barrel.`
`At that moment, her stunning powers of concentration made all the distractions of the outside world disappear.`
`...<Good>.`
`It's always been like this, but my concentration really is good.`
`Are you ready, me? Furudo...Erika.`
`First, let's lay out the situation.`
`Battler disappeared from that closed room.`
`The chain lock is set.`
`Did he disappear by magic?`
` Of course not!`
` There has to be a trick!`
`Kanon didn't save him with magic.`
`He just came, took Battler's place, and set the chain.`
`...Everyone knows that much!`
`The problem is the next step.`
`No, it's actually the step before that one.`
`Kanon was in the cousin room in the guesthouse.`
`That room was completely sealed with packing tape, and it's been proven that the seal was intact until the time of the logic error.`
`In other words, Kanon escaped from a closed room that was absolute, with no chance for excuses or twisted logic.`
`<Good>!`
` This is why she called it a simple yet ultimate closed room.`
`...How did he escape from the perfect closed room known as the cousin room?`
`Heheh.`
` If I got stuck thinking only about that question, I'd be no better than your average kid detective.`
`...That room is a perfect closed room, so 'there is no way to escape'.`
`In other words, trying to think of ways to escape from there is a waste of time!`
`The real question...`
`is how Kanon was somewhere outside the cousin room when it was sealed.`
`The cousin room is a completely sealed can.`
`If he was in there when it was sealed, then it's already game over.`
`In other words, ...at the time the cousin room was sealed, he wasn't inside it anymore!`
`Let's look at the time I checked everyone's locations and sealed the rooms.`
`That's the most suspicious part.`
`At that time, we have the five people in the next room over,`
` whom I confirmed with my own eyes.`
`Hideyoshi, `
`George, `
`Kumasawa, `
`Shannon, `
`and Nanjo.`
`...I mentioned the names of those five people during the location check...and confirmed that they were in the next room over.`
`Then, I checked to see whether 'everyone else' was in the cousin room...and had that confirmed for me as well.`
`I said 'everyone else', so whether he was Kanon or Yoshiya or even Purupuru Piko-Man,`
` they all should have been sealed in the cousin room.`
`It seems perfect, at a glance.`
`However, though that phrase 'everyone else' seems perfect,`
` ...it's fishy!`
`Strictly speaking, 'everyone else'...`
`refers to 'all humans whose names I did not mention directly'.`
`In other words, there are exceptions!`
`For example, `
`...it's been confirmed that Hideyoshi and George were in the next room over.`
`So, humans with the name Hideyoshi or George`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` '`
`~ib~don't need to be inside the cousin room~ib~`
`'!`
`It seems that Kanon told Jessica that his real name was Yoshiya,`
` ...but that was no red truth.`
`In other words, ...what if Kanon's real name is the same as one of those in the next room over?!`
`They seem to be about the same age, so let's use George.`
`So, what if there were two Georges in that room?!`
`That doesn't violate the red truth saying that Hideyoshi, George, Kumasawa, Shannon, and Nanjo are in the next room over.`
`Let's say that Kanon's real name was Tanaka George.`
`Both Ushiromiya George and Tanaka George could exist in that room at the same time!`
`In other words, ...there were six humans with five names!`
`It looked to my eyes as though there were only five people in the next room over, but a sixth person, Kanon, was hiding somewhere.`
`I don't have the detective's authority, so it wouldn't be that difficult for him to fool my eyes and hide.`
`I see, the double name trick...`
`Stupid, so stupid...!!`
`All right, I've made my logic!!`
`Kanon, who was hiding in the next room over, not the cousin room, left by the window after the seals were placed-`
`*bang*!!`
`"Ah, ...owww..."`
`The gun had fired, and the tip of my finger was stained with blood.`
`The blue truth gunpowder had exploded.`
`...Ah, `
`...dammit...`
`...I've already...`
`had Dlanor seal that one...`
`'Blue truth arguing about the window of the next room over is forbidden', `
`so I can't use it...!!!`
`"...Oh, an accidental discharge?`
` Careful now, guns can be dangerous.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`"Sh-Shut up!!`
` It's just a little mistake...!!"`
`"......The window of the next room over.`
` You sealed it with some absurd trick, right? Gaap told me."`
`"...I-Is that so?`
` And so what?!"`
`"Dlanor, remove that foolish seal.`
` *cackle*cackle* That seal has become your shackles."`
`Beato has figured out everything I've been thinking.`
`And she's acting so confident, telling me to go ahead and use that argument...!`
`"...Lady Erika."`
`"...P-Please remove it.`
` ...That fool,`
` ...I'll make her regret this...!!"`
`""It seems you are ready, duelists!!`
` Please face each other with your pistols.`
` Then fire with the sparks of truth!!""`
`After facing away and readying herself one last time, Erika spun around.`
`Beato had been facing her since the beginning.`
`She wore a confident, challenging smile, as if she'd been kept waiting.`
`Then, without any signal, the two slowly raised their guns, `
`...pointing the red and blue glints that hid within their barrels at each other.`
`"Come. I could do with a little fun."`
`"...Begin!!!"`
`"First is how Kanon escaped from the cousin room.`
` ...I'll use that as my bullet!"`
`"Hoh, so you'll start from there.`
` ...Let's have it.`
` Hold nothing back!"`
`"Here I go!!"`
`After holding the gun high and pointing it at Beato once more,`
` Erika pulled the trigger with statements of red and blue truth.`
`"#ff0000The cousin room is guaranteed to be a perfect closed room until the end.#5decff`
` So, if Kanon really was in this room, it would be impossible for him to escape!`
` In other words, Kanon was not in that room at the time it was sealed!!`
` The name 'Kanon' is an alias.`
` His real name is still unknown!`
` If his real name happens to be the same as anyone in the next room over, that wouldn't contradict the check on who was in that room.`
` In other words, it's possible for him to be in the next room over, not the cousin room!!#ffffff"`
`The goat attendants chattered and clapped their hands.`
`...Thinking 'Yes, such a move would work!'`
`Ah, I love watching this.`
`I love being surrounded by this chatter.`
` ...After all, ...I am the detective!!`
`"#ff0000It is true that the next room over was sealed, `
`but at the time of the logic error, only the doors were checked to see whether the seals were preserved.#5decff`
` Therefore, there is a chance that the window seals were broken.`
` Kanon was in the next room over...and escaped through that window...!!#ffffff`
` That is all!!!"`
`Any other theory would be impossible!!`
`If this doesn't work, `
`...then there's no truth left!!`
`As soon as she said 'that is all', both of them fired at the same time.`
`...After the blast rang out, `
`...it was Erika's gun that fell to the floor...`
`Beato's red bullet had knocked Erika's gun from her hands.`
`Was it...arrogance, or confidence?`
`If she had just aimed that bullet at Erika's heart, the whole thing would've been over...`
`Beato had missed on purpose.`
`There was a bold smile on her face.`
`It was as though she was offering to play with Erika a little longer.`
`...No, that's exactly what made her Beato.`
`Beatrice, the witch who mocks others with unsolvable closed room tricks...!`
`"#ff0000At the time the next room over was sealed,`
` Hideyoshi, George, Kumasawa, Shannon, and Nanjo were in it.`
` And, the number of people in the next room over was five.`
` No one existed there except for those to whom those five names refer!`
` All people can only go by their own names!!#ffffff"`
`"......Uu...`
`...gkk...`
`...`
`......!!"`
`It was a thoroughly merciless red truth...`
`It was simple...and severe...`
`Now that the number of people had been limited to five, any leeway for Kanon hiding there had been completely denied.`
`Also, it was now clear that only people holding those five names existed within the room.`
` Erika couldn't even make a new theory by suggesting that one person held two names, so that the five names referred to only four people,`
` which would let an unnamed Kanon sneak in.`
`Furthermore, the part about how people could only use their own names was a fatal blow that cut down countless theories...!`
`"...Come to think of it, you've only ever met the half-sleeping me from the previous game, haven't you...?`
` What do you think, Erikaaa?`
` ...How do you like the game of the Golden Wiiiiiiiiiitch...???"`
`"That's insane...`
` ...A-Are you saying...`
`that Kanon slipped out of the room by magic...?!`
` Ghh, ...gkk...`
` ...M-More importantly, `
`why did you just knock my gun away...?!!"`
`"The human side must crush all of the witch's riddles, whereas the witch side need only crush the human's theories once.`
` ...Don't you find that unfair?`
` So, I decided to have it be even."`
`"...E-Eveeeeeeeen...?"`
`"I've decided that I'll make my victory condition the destruction of all of your theories.`
` ...I've won the riddle of Kanon's escape, but there's one more!`
` Let's return to the first battleground, where you gave Battler so much trouble!!"`
`When Beato snapped her fingers, that guest room of Battler's was reconstructed.`
`She meant to fight once more in the room that had threatened Battler with a logic error, determined to settle things once and for all.`
`"Erika, pick up your gun.`
` ...We'll have this room be your coffin!"`
`"......I say the same to you!!`
` I'll make you regret...`
`ever giving me this chance!!"`
`"Witness,`
` allow Erika to use X."`
`"...X?`
` You mean, a basis that doesn't need to be explained?`
` What are you gonna let her do?"`
`"Let's give Erika permission to use blue truths for Kanon and this 'guest room trick',`
` without making her explain how he escaped from his closed room."`
`A theory explaining how Kanon saved Battler would also need to explain how Kanon escaped from his own closed room, or it would have no basis.`
`Erika had already lost that basis.`
`...Beato was giving her a handicap by saying that she didn't need to explain that part.`
`"...O-Of course!!`
` You've already used the red truth to guarantee that Kanon saved Battler!`
` It's only natural that I be given this privilege...!"`
`Erika faced away again and concentrated even harder...!`
`As though twisting the knob on a radio, she turned all noise and idle thoughts down to zero.`
`Let's go, Furudo Erika.`
`Detective, Furudo Erika!`
`As long as Kanon reaches this place, rescuing Battler isn't hard.`
`The trick is as follows:`
`Kanon used some kind of escape trick X to reach the front of the guest room.`
`While I was busy in the bathroom, ...Battler left the closet.`
`Battler undid the chain lock.`
`Battler went outside.`
`Kanon entered in his place.`
`Kanon set the chain lock.`
`Kanon went into the closet. The end!`
`...This satisfies the two red truths about the chain lock being set and Battler's absence.`
`And, in exchange for this escape trick, Kanon remains inside the guest room.`
`...There's no room for argument on how tightly this room can act as a closed room.`
`That chain is cursed.`
`In this demonic closed room, one person must remain as a sacrifice for it to be acceptable.`
`...However, is such a simple theory really enough...?`
`The rescuer switched places with him.`
`Then, the rescuer hid in the closet.`
`No other sort of theory is possible.`
`And yet, Beato thinks she can win.`
`In that case, ...does some other trick exist...?`
`It's impossible!`
`I swear on the history of the mystery genre that there's absolutely, definitely, categorically no other way!!`
`But if I give in here, I couldn't call myself a detective!!`
`Consider it, imagine, don't stop thinking...`
` That's how you drive blue wedges into witches!!`
`...What I can expect to see is...yes.`
`A wordplay trick!`
`It can only be some kind of 'wordplay' that just barely slips through the net of words spoken in red...!`
`In that case, I'll crush all possibilities!`
`I'll have them repeat line after line!!`
`This final duel...has already begun, even though we haven't pulled our triggers yet...!!`
`"Repeat it.`
` 'At the time Battler was rescued, only Kanon entered the guest room.'"`
`"I acknowledge it.`
` #ff0000At the time Battler was rescued, only Kanon entered the guest room.#ffffff`
` I believe that was the whole point..."`
`"Repeat it.`
` 'From the time I entered the room to the time of the logic error, Battler, Kanon, and I were the only ones who entered or exited the room.'"`
`"#ff0000I acknowledge it.`
` From the time you entered the room to the time of the logic error, you, Battler, and Kanon were the only ones who went in or out of the guest room.#ffffff"`
`"Repeat it.`
` 'This refers to three people.'"`
`"#ff0000I acknowledge it.`
` It refers to three people: you, Battler, and Kanon.#ffffff"`
`"Confirming definition.`
` Can I assume that when you say 'three people', that's equal to the number of bodies?`
` You're saying that three bodies went in or out of the room, right?"`
`I've had enough of things being mixed about with names and numbers of people.`
`I want this point to be clear...!`
`"#ff0000Of course.`
` Three people--in other words, three bodies--went in or out.`
` Only you and Kanon entered, and only Battler left.`
` It has already been said in red that all people can only use their own names.`
` Therefore, the names Erika, Battler, and Kanon can only be used by those people.#ffffff"`
`"Repeat it.`
` 'I am not the rescuer.'"`
`"#ff0000Of course!#ffffff`
` You are the detective, are you not?`
` Don't worry, I will respect that!"`
`"Confirming definition.`
` 'How do you define rescuer?'"`
`This is also important.`
`I want to quickly remove the possibility that I rescued him accidentally.`
`"#ff0000I'll define 'rescuer' to mean any person who reset the chain lock after Battler unset it.`
` This definition applies whether said person intended to rescue Battler or not.#ffffff"`
`Since she said 'after Battler unset the chain lock', it's impossible for this to have occurred before I set foot in the room.`
`From that point on, I wouldn't undo the chain again 'for all eternity'.`
`After all, the game was suspended at that point.`
`Therefore, it was impossible for me to have been the rescuer accidentally.`
`More, ...I can focus it even more...`
`The chain can only be set from the inside.`
`It's impossible for a person to escape on their own.`
`Therefore, we know that Battler didn't escape by himself.`
`And I'm not the rescuer.`
`Only Kanon can be the rescuer.`
`And, Beato has already said that Kanon is the rescuer with the red truth.`
`...There's nothing to doubt.`
`There's no room for anyone but Kanon to be involved.`
`...At least, so far!`
`"Repeat it.`
` 'Going in or out refers to when someone crosses the boundary between the guest room and the area outside it.'"`
`"#ff0000I acknowledge it.#ffffff"`
`"Repeat it.`
` 'By the guest room, we're referring to the entirety of`
` the bedroom,`
` the bathroom,`
` and the closet.'"`
`"#ff0000I acknowledge it.#ffffff`
` I've no intention of wriggling out of this by saying the closet isn't part of the guest room."`
`"Confirming definition.`
` The inside of the guest room is divided into three sections: the bedroom, the bathroom, and the closet."`
`"#ff0000I also recognize it as such.`
` Furthermore, you have already confirmed with the red truth that two of those sections,`
` the bedroom and the bathroom, had no one hiding in them.#ffffff"`
`"Repeat it.`
` 'There is someone in the closet.'"`
`"I refuse."`
`"Why's that?!`
` Because Kanon is hiding there?!"`
`"Kanon can use magic.`
` It's true that he hid himself in the closet for a time, but he then immediately vanished with his magic...!`
` So, there is no one in the closet!`
` I cannot respond!"`
`"I ask you to repeat it once more!!"`
`"Fool, the witch side has no obligation to explain how they did things with magic!"`
`...No, it's completely obvious.`
`There's no way she can say that Kanon disappeared with magic using the red truth!`
`After all, magic doesn't exist!!`
`But...is this...enough?!`
`...I've gone through every last minor detail.`
`And yet, there's an uncanny lack of dubious points.`
`I can't think of any way around the theory I've had since the beginning.`
`Kanon must be in the closet.`
`He has to be.`
` There's no way he isn't!`
`I'll say it again!`
`This closed room can only be escaped from by switching places with a rescuer.`
`If Kanon tried to escape as well, another rescuer would be needed.`
`However, no rescuer exists for Kanon!`
`Battler 'escaped', so it's impossible for it to be him.`
`And I won't undo the chain 'for all eternity'!`
`The people who have gone in and out of the room have been confirmed both by name and number of people!`
`...At this rate, `
`...my theory...`
`is set in stone.`
`First, here are the details of the situation that are certain!`
`#ff0000The game ended while I was inside the guest room,`
` so I did not undo the chain lock that I had previously set.`
`So, it can't be that he escaped after I left the room.`
`Furthermore, the chain lock was set at the same time I entered the room.`
`No one could have left the room during the few seconds between the time I entered and the time I set the chain lock.`
`The guest room was sealed at the time Battler's 'corpse' was examined, `
`so until I came again and broke the seals, it was absolutely impossible for anyone to go in or out.`
`Therefore, when I entered the room, it is certain that Battler was hiding somewhere inside the guest room.`
`The only chance Battler had to escape was after I broke the seals.`
`To be even more specific, he had no chance to escape except for the time I was in the bathroom.#ffffff`
`By the above premises, Battler's trick to escape with the chain still set is as follows!`
`#5decffBecause of the aforementioned reasons, the only one who could've set the chain lock, which can only be set from the inside, and allowed Battler's escape...`
`is Kanon, the only person to enter the room except for me and Battler!`
`After Kanon entered the room, he set the chain,`
` hid in the one place that he could hide inside the guest room, the closet-#ffffff`
` ...Ah?!`
`Whoa, that was close!!`
`They almost got me, ...they almost tricked me!!`
`I thought I'd cornered him in the closet.`
`It's the opposite!!`
`They're trying to make me think he's in the closet!`
`What was the order in which I searched the guest room?!`
`First, the bedroom.`
`We confirmed with the red that there was nothing there.`
`Then, the bathroom.`
`We confirmed with the red that there was nothing there.`
`That's it right there!!`
`When I examined the bedroom, there was nothing there.`
`However, while I was investigating the bathroom,`
` ...Kanon slipped out of the closet...`
`and 'hid again' somewhere in the bedroom!`
`In other words, my guarantee that no one was in the bedroom...was torn apart during a span of one minute...!`
`I've spotted it!!`
`This is the witch's trap, an attempt to lure me into thinking that Kanon's in the closet...!`
`The place he's really hiding...is the bedroom...!!`
`"Heh, `
`......*giggle*...`
`...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` ...I've found it,`
` ...I've finally found...`
`your...`
`trick...!!"`
`"............"`
`That was a close one.`
`If I'd been one step slower, I'd have said there was nowhere to hide except inside the closet,`
` and then she'd just say that the closet was empty.`
`Huh? ...N-No, wait...`
`It works the same way in reverse...`
`I see, now I get it...`
`It's a logic switching trick...!`
`Damn that Beato... So, in resolving the logic error, she's discovered this strange trick!!`
`If I only notice the closet, she'll have Kanon hide under the bed.`
`And if I only notice the bed, she'll have Kanon hide in the closet.`
`Even though either one would be right, I'd lose no matter which I chose.`
`Unless I expose both at the same time, I can't checkmate her...!`
`Incredible...`
`I've never heard of such an unfair trick...`
`If it was a sleight of hand, it'd just be a cheap one.`
`If it was a mystery, ...it'd just be cheating...`
`However, in this witch's game, it's a legitimate...`
`...'logic trick'...`
`In chess, it'd be called a double check.`
`No, a discovered attack.`
` ...Or wait, would it be a discovered double checkmate...?`
`Even though this sort of logic would be a foul trick in the mystery genre, `
`...in this world where witches and mystery war, `
`......it is...such a refined board layout...`
`The beautiful placement of the black pieces that cornered my white king felt almost like an art, `
`...so beautiful that, if I were a god in some old legend, I might wish to stick it in the sky as a constellation...`
`That beauty...`
`...even brought tears to my eyes...`
`...For the first time, `
`...I felt honored...`
`...at being allowed to participate in this game of truth and witches as a human.`
`And, ironically, `
`......it taught me, the one who had always believed in a single truth, that there isn't necessarily just one truth.`
`If I just broaden my perspective, I can see completely different truths.`
`...And though each of those truths are 'truth', ...they're incomplete if they're all you can see...`
`......In my life until now, just how many truths have I missed because I was blinded by some trivial truth...`
`......This is...`
`...the true nature of the world...`
`"...Because of our arrogance in thinking that only one truth exists,`
` ...whenever we find one truth, we get blinded to all others.`
` ......Thank you, Beatrice-san.`
` ......I never thought...`
`that I would learn `
`the true nature of this world from a witch."`
`"............"`
`Slowly, `
`...with a soft and quiet gesture,`
` ...like a flower opening with the morning dew dripping down its side,`
` ...Erika raised her gun...`
`"It's my...victory.`
` I've seen through your double check."`
`"......Then come."`
`"...`
`#5decff'Battler's guest room disappearance trick' is as follows.`
` ...While I searched the room, Battler was hiding in the closet.`
` Then, during the disturbance in the bathroom, he unset the chain and escaped from the room.`
` At that time, Kanon was waiting for him in the hallway.`
` Kanon entered the guest room in his place and set the chain.`
` This is the trick to Battler's disappearance.#ffffff"`
`"#5DECFF...And, afterwards, `
`......he hid in the bedroom.`
` This happened after I checked to see that there was no one unexpected in the bedroom, so it's valid.`
` In this way, Kanon the rescuer concealed himself in the bedroom.#ffffff"`
`Erika's blue bullet flew in a strange arc,`
` became a wedge of the blue truth, and pierced straight down through the bed and the floor beneath.`
`Beato didn't pull her trigger.`
`...However, she did quietly argue back with the red truth.`
`"#ff0000Kanon does not exist in the bedroom.#ffffff"`
`Oooooohh... The goat attendants gasped.`
`Erika had apparently been defeated, denied by the red truth.`
`...For the goats, who couldn't see more than a single truth, it probably looks as though I've lost...`
`"Pft, ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...`
` Next up is the real one.`
` ...This is the answer from a Human capable of understanding multiple truths.`
` ......It looks like the tale of illusions will end on the second twilight.`
` ...So, why don't I carry out the remaining twilights...`
`and open the door to the Golden Land.`
` ......If you are to disappear,`
` then it should be surrounded by your golden roses...!"`
`The fires of blue truth flashed at Erika's feet,`
` ...and she loaded a blue truth bullet once more.`
`That overflowing blue power was now making her entire gun burn with a blue flame...`
`She wasn't aiming for Beato.`
`She was aiming behind Beato.`
`......At the closet...!!`
`"Now that the bedroom has been denied, you've nowhere left to run!!`
` Diiiiiiiiiiiiiee, Kanooooooooooooonnnnnnn!!"`
`The five wedges of blue truth she released shot right past Beato's cheeks, hair, and shoulders, `
`...then pin-cushioned the door to the closet to gouge whatever human was inside to death...!`
`The five wedges slammed into the door in a vertical line.`
` In other words...`
`On the fourth twilight, gouge the head and kill.`
`On the fifth twilight, gouge the chest and kill.`
`On the sixth twilight,`
` on the seventh twilight,`
` on the eighth twilight...`
`Gouge and kill and kill and kill...!!`
`...After being gouged by so many thick and sharp wedges,`
` ...the human inside wouldn't stand a chance...`
`"............"`
`"...Here's the truth I've exposed.`
` ...That is all!"`
`When she proclaimed that she had finished, the five blue wedges piercing the closet disappeared.`
`However, the many large, splintered holes left behind showed that it had indeed been pierced...`
`Then, ...as though this completed the ceremony that led to the Golden Land,`
` ...the room that had been created around them...became countless golden flower petals and drifted away...`
`By now, the duelists and the crowd of attendants...were surrounded by the golden rose garden of the Golden Land...`
`However, the closet behind Beato remained.`
`...It stood there all by itself, like a coffin...`
`...Then, as though teased open by a dreary wind,`
` the hole-covered closet door slowly...`
`...opened...`
`Inside, `
`......was a human figure...`
`That figure was covered up to the head by what appeared to be a grayish robe.`
`...Of course, that also had large holes showing that it had been stabbed into...`
`Eventually, it became clear that this was not a robe, but a raincoat.`
`...If he had rushed here from the guesthouse,`
` then there would be nothing strange about him wearing this into the guest room...`
`...Then, `
`...with a rustle, `
`...the raincoat...`
`...lost its human shape, `
`...crumpled, `
`...became a cloud of gold butterflies, `
`...and disappeared...`
`"......Wh-`
`What the...`
`......"`
`Inside the coffin of the closet,`
` ...nothing remained except an empty darkness......`
`"#ff0000Kanon does not exist in the guest room.`
` ......Of course, this includes all parts of the closet, the bedroom, and the bathroom.#ffffff"`
`"Ah......`
`......ah......"`
`"Kanon let Battler escape and hid in the closet...`
` ...Then, he used magic to disappear.`
` ......This is the witch's truth.`
` ......That is all."`
`"Th-This fight is OVER...!! Say no m-"`
`""And the winner is...`
`...Beatrice!!!""`
`Oh, ...ooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhh!!`
`The attendants let out a cheer.`
`Virgilia's group couldn't help but scream and shout in joy.`
`The Seven Sisters jumped about in celebration...!`
`Then, at the same moment the two demons proclaimed Beatrice's victory, `
`the Head's Ring worn by Erika, who was slowly crumpling to the ground, and the cursed ring on Battler's finger...both burst.`
`At the same time, Battler coughed violently.`
`Battler...was starting to regain consciousness...!`
`"Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!`
` Battler-saaaaaaaaaaaaan!!!"`
`Beato latched onto the coughing Battler in joy.`
`Then, Virgilia, Gaap, and Ronove did the same.`
`All of the Seven Sisters also crowded about him in delight.`
`"...Heh, `
`...heheh, `
`...what a nasty trick...`
` Are you sure something like this will count...?`
` With a trick like this one, those Humans will start complaining again about how this is no mystery..."`
`"No, it was a splendid trick!`
` People without love cannot 'see' it...!`
` ...Battler-san,`
` ......Battler-san,`
` ...waaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh...!!!"`
`"Lady Erika, Lady Erika!!`
` Someone, help her, QUICKLY!!"`
`...The rose of blood in Erika's chest wouldn't stop opening its petals...`
`"...Third degree conceptual denial syndrome.`
` ...Use of continuous neutralizer impossible, ...neutralization only possible by an emergency approval for resurrection.`
` ...The piece's master must provide approval for resurrection..."`
`"L-Lady Bernkastel, give your approval for her RESURRECTION!!`
` ...Lady Bernkastel...?! Wh-Where did she GO...?!"`
`"Search request to ceremony guards. Find Lady Bernkastel...!!"`
`"Understood.`
` <All Chiesters, data link>. Search format...!"`
`"...H-How cowardly...`
` To think that someone's master...`
`...wouldn't watch her piece's duel until the end...`
` ...Know that it is far too cowardly!!!"`
`Erika, who was being held by Dlanor, had already realized that her master was nowhere to be seen,`
` ...but she didn't feel lonely.`
`On the contrary, ...she was relieved that she wouldn't need to be brutally scolded in the last moments of her life...`
`""Gods and demons.`
` Please pass on the story of her noble passing.""`
`"...Noble...?`
` ...Hah, `
`......the bad guy is supposed to die pathetically and make the main character look awesome...`
` ...Ggh, *cackle*, `
`......ha...haha..."`
`I'm not anyone's piece anymore.`
`...I can finally...control my own role...!!`
`"L-Lady Erika...!!`
` Y-You mustn't MOVE...!!"`
`"...Stand back...`
` ...Stay baaaaaaaaaaaaack!!"`
`When Erika yelled with all her soul,`
` ...those who surrounded her were forced back and fell on their butts...`
`"I am...`
`...the Witch of Truth, Furudo Erika...`
` ...The Witch of Truth...is the witch...who can withstand the truth.`
` ...Now, `
`...I can finally...accept the real truth about myself..."`
`The toxin of her own concept being denied raced through her.`
`...Her vision was already starting to blur.`
`At the other end of her twisted range of vision...`
`were Battler and Beato, hugging each other and looking at her...`
`Their expressions are firm.`
`...That's okay.`
`Pity and sympathy would only make me look more pathetic.`
`...For a loser, that sort of expression...is the best...`
`"Lady Erika...!! The duel is already OVER...!!"`
`"It isn't."`
`"Not until the pair is separated by death."`
`""We won't let anyone disgrace her final moments.""`
`The two demons grabbed Dlanor's shoulders and held her back...`
`Dripping blood, `
`...breathing heavily, `
`...and with an awkward gait, `
`...Erika walked towards Beato and Battler despite it all...`
`As the blood dripped from her, it became golden flower petals, which drifted away.`
`...So, as she walked, `
`...she looked both divine...`
`...and beautiful.`
`The duel wouldn't end until one of them died.`
`So, even though it had been settled, ...it hadn't ended.`
`Beato and Battler told the people bunched around them to step back, ...and they both walked forward to face the noble loser...`
`"......Erika..."`
`"...Congratulations on your resurrection.`
` Looks like you have bad luck with women.`
` ...You'll never get a decent one to like you..."`
`"...True.`
` ...And I'd never fall in love with a decent woman."`
`"Beato,`
` ...no, I ask this of both of you."`
`"......You wish for one final clash...?"`
`"............"`
`"...Erika..."`
`"...Very well.`
` ...We are not so boorish as to refuse your noble request."`
`"Thank you."`
`As her consciousness began to waver, ...Erika raised her gun again.`
` She pointed it at the two of them.`
`Beato also...raised her gun to point at Erika.`
`Then, Battler placed his hand on hers...`
`"If it's already resolved,`
` ...what more could there be to argue about...?!"`
`"...Erika-sama......"`
`"Why...`
`is there nothing I can do...`
`at a time like `
`THIS...?"`
`"...Watch until the end.`
` That's your job as her friend, isn't it...?"`
`Both sides silently loaded their bullets of truth without saying a word.`
`The color packed into each barrel...was red...`
`So, though neither side spoke, `
`...did they both know what trump card the other would use...?`
`"......Now, `
`...at the end, `
`...I'd like to finally introduce myself..."`
`What's she saying? This late into the game...`
`No one could imagine the red truth Erika had loaded...`
`"......Beato,`
` ...are you sure?"`
`"......`
`...Yes.`
` I don't mind..."`
`"...I understand.`
` ............"`
`"Let's at least pull the final trigger together."`
`"...I know..."`
`Battler placed his hand on top of the finger that Beato had around the trigger.`
`"...Battler-san, ...I'm glad...I met you."`
`"We will...`
`be together...`
`for all eternity."`
`"Ahhah, you just had to flirt right in front of me!!`
` It's pissing me off.`
` ...You know, I really can't stand teary farewell scenes."`
`...Yes, the bad guy really does need to wear this face at the very end!!`
`"...That's a nice look.`
` ...Married life with you would probably have been fun enough to make me vomit."`
`"Of course.`
` I'd spin you around every day, `
`locked up in a world of pleasure that'd make you forget Beato-san in a second!"`
`"Hah.`
` It's a thousand years too early for you to capture Battler's heart, little girl."`
`"You've never looked cuter than you do now.`
` ...I guess both of us really do need to finish it this way!!"`
`"...Come."`
`"This is detective Furudo Erika's final parting line... `
`and self-introduction!!"`
`Erika spun in a magnificent and graceful rondo, scattering blood and golden flower petals around her as she raised her gun.`
`"#ff0000Hi, pleased to meet you!`
` I'm Furudo Erika, the detective!!`
` I may be an uninvited guest, but please, welcome me!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000I'm the visitor,`
`"...Sorry, but..."`
`"#ff0000Even if you do join us-#ffffff"`
`""#ff0000That makes 17 humans.#ffffff""`
`Earth to earth.`
`Ashes to ashes,`
` dust to dust.`
` Illusions to illusions.`
`And dreams to dreams.`
`A dream is something drawn in the sand between the coming and receding waves.`
`Something so fragile that it's wiped blank every time a wave comes in.`
`So, the heartless might sneer, saying that drawing such things is useless and meaningless.`
`However, no wave will ever come again to wipe away the dream she drew.`
`And now, that final, beautiful dream of hers...will not disappear for all eternity.`
`Come, try and picture it.`
`It's as though the rays of the gentle afternoon sun on a warm spring day...`
`simply forgot to grow dim ever again.`
`It truly is...such a wonderful thing...`
`—Witness to your final dream`
`Publius Virgilia Maro`
`The suspects were gathered in a room, and several Inquisitors of Heresy were reporting on the results of their investigation.`
`Their uniforms closely resembled those of Eiserne Jungfrau, but they were slightly different.`
` Also different were the badges signifying their department.`
`Then came the sound of someone clapping their hands once.`
`It was the lead female Inquisitor.`
`She was announcing that all reasoning had been completed.`
`"As has been shown, it is all quite clear.`
` Know that the preceding logic has proven the nonexistence of your alibi."`
`At the other end of her pointing finger was a quivering maid with frightened eyes.`
`Her name was...`
`...no, that's not important.`
`What matters now is that she could've entered the closed room study where the victim was found whenever she pleased,`
` and furthermore, that her claimed alibi for the time of the crime has been proven to contradict the facts.`
`Shaking, the maid tried to continue in her illogical pleading, but all of her statements had already been seen through.`
`"With this, we conclude our proof of the 'who dunnit' and the 'how dunnit'.`
` Know that your position as the culprit is now an unshakable fact."`
`"Y-You must be joking...!`
` Wh-Wh-Why would I kill the Master I loved and respected so...?!`
` I have no motive, no reason...!"`
`"...Who did it and how.`
` Know that establishing these is more than sufficient.`
` Please, allow me to speak.`
` Know that motives are unnecessary in mysteries."`
`The Inquisitor spoke coldly.`
`After finishing her witch's prayer, Virgilia stepped back from the coffin, which lay on an altar bedecked with many beautiful roses.`
`In her place, Battler moved to the front of the coffin, wearing his territory lord's cape...`
`Though the cape was supposed to represent dignity and majesty,`
` it somehow made Battler look smaller.`
`Battler held a book with a majestic binding in his hand.`
`It was...a game record that had just been written.`
`Or, perhaps it was a tale.`
` A game.`
` Or else a Fragment.`
`Written in it...was the 'dream' that would be more enjoyable for her than any other...`
`Battler pressed it against his forehead and contemplated for some time.`
`"............"`
`Then, he kissed it...`
`and laid it gently in the coffin.`
`It rested upon her chest.`
`She looked like a little girl clutching her favorite stuffed animal as she drifted off to sleep...`
`"...This is...`
`the sole tale I have to offer up you."`
`This tale will be shut up with you in your coffin, for all eternity.`
`So, no one will be able to read it except for you, there in your coffin.`
`"Shut away in that cat box, `
`the only `
`unchanging, `
`inviolable, `
`...eternal tale."`
`"This way,`
` ...no one will be able to defile it.`
` ...No one can deny it,`
` and no one can argue against it.`
` ...This is just between me and her,`
` ...just the two of us,`
` our one and only certain...`
`truth."`
`Those bastards...`
`A man dashed through a town wrapped in twilight.`
`The daytime hustle and bustle of this beautiful village, which combined the traditional with the orderly in the classic style of the last century, now seemed like a mere dream.`
`The orange setting sun was already hidden behind the clock tower, and the narrow alleyway was rapidly descending into darkness.`
`As the gas lights began to turn on, they only made the darkness of the twilight stand out all the more.`
`The man sprinted.`
` There was no time.`
` He had to hurry.`
`He'd had several experiments to do and things he had to check, and it had all taken longer than he'd expected.`
`"Yes, there's no mistake there.`
` The 'who dunnit' and 'how dunnit' are more than enough in the mystery genre."`
`In the mystery genre, the motive, or the 'why dunnit', is given the lowest priority.`
`To have a murder, you need to have a culprit, and he needs to commit a crime.`
`Motive isn't required for that.`
`So, it's usually the most ignored element.`
`In fact, these days, there are even some who call it unnecessary.`
`"If you find the culprit with nothing but the 'why dunnit', that's no mystery.`
` That's propaganda.`
` However..."`
`However, just because of that fact...`
`...It doesn't mean you can neglect the motive, ...the heart.`
`"...We both know how much fun she'll be having in her final sleep.`
` So, I doubt anyone could disturb it.`
` ...After all, who could possibly disturb a sleeping child smiling at a happy dream?"`
`"............"`
`"Come.`
` ...It is time for us to leave.`
` If we're too noisy, we'll wake her from her dream."`
`"...You're right.`
` What else should you do with a sleeping kid `
`except put a blanket on them, turn off the lights, and walk away quietly..."`
`After looking at the coffin one last time, Virgilia turned around quietly.`
`Battler did the same, ...but then he stopped and turned to face the rose-covered altar...`
`"............"`
`Battler offered up his final words within his heart.`
`As long as those words didn't leave his mouth, no one would be able to know what they were.`
`...However, those words of the heart caused Battler's expression to change several times.`
`At first, he frowned sadly.`
` ...Then, his face clouded with remorse, `
`and then changed to a bitter, exasperated smile.`
` ...It flashed through several varied expressions.`
`Then, ...the final expression that crossed his face...`
`was, surprisingly,`
` ...a gentle smile.`
`".........`
`............"`
`Something rose to Battler's lips.`
`However, he bit it back down.`
`There could certainly be no words to describe the many feelings he kept in his chest.`
`So, ...saying anything aloud would probably be crude.`
`Battler understood this...and stopped himself from speaking once more with a wry smile.`
`"............"`
`"...Thank you."`
`"Oh, I have done nothing to deserve your gratitude..."`
`"...I'll leave the rest to you."`
`After seeing Virgilia nod back at him, Battler turned away from the altar one more time...`
`...and left the chapel.`
`Virgilia also disappeared,`
` ...and with that, all disturbances that might have interrupted 'her' blissful sleep had vanished...`
`The Inquisitors of Heresy listened with calm...no, scornful gazes.`
`They listened to the frantic babbling of the maid accused of murdering her master.`
`However, nothing she said could bury the fault in her own alibi.`
`They were all mere emotional arguments.`
`I loved and respected the Master so much.`
` I had no motive for killing him.`
`No matter how much she spoke,`
` it only made her look more and more like the floundering true culprit struggling pathetically.`
`The requirements for the 'who dunnit' and 'how dunnit' had been satisfied.`
`As for the 'why dunnit', the motive, the heart...`
`...No matter how much she spoke of gratitude for her master, who had graciously given her a job when she'd been left by the wayside after various misfortunes,`
` it didn't help her case in the slightest in the mystery genre.`
`Therefore, her motive didn't matter.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`All of that could just be `
`~ib~squeezed out~ib~`
` of the culprit afterwards.`
`An Inquisitor of Heresy took out a roll of parchment and held it forth, cutting off the maid's sobs and protests.`
`"This is how you committed the crime.`
` Know that this indictment has been received by the Great Court and that your arrest has been approved.`
` Here is the warrant for your arrest.`
` Motive is unnecessary.`
` Know that such a thing is completely extraneous to the matter of pinpointing the culprit.`
` Please, allow me to speak.`
` Know that we of the SSVD possess methods of forcing unrepentant criminals to reveal the truth."`
`"With these interrogation tools blessed by the powers of justice, we Inquisitors of Heresy will strap up your limbs, burn you, crush you, stretch you and hang you,`
` and in so doing wring the red truth out of you.`
` ...It isn't even necessary for you to confess!`
` Aides, arrest that maid!"`
`"It wasn't me! I didn't kill the master...!!`
` N-No, noooooooooo!!"`
`"Hold it right there.`
` You've got the wrong culprit."`
`A man kicked the door open, and the Inquisitors were all shocked at the sight of him.`
`"...Wh-Why are you here?`
` Know that this case is no longer your responsibility...!"`
`"Quiet.`
` You find one person without an alibi and just assume that she's the culprit?`
` Do you really think there's no need for a motive, for a heart, in crime?`
` Crimes are committed by people.`
` There are no crimes without a heart.`
` I'll never accept a theory that neglects the heart."`
`"Kn-Know that your obsession over the 'why dunnit' is simply embarrassing...!`
` The 'why dunnit' is unnecessary!`
` Such a thing can be extracted easily through interrogation!`
` Even the Great Court has already acknowledged that this woman is the culprit...!!"`
`"True, the Great Court does assume that everyone besides the maid has an alibi.`
` But that's just because they heard you say so, and they've mistaken your overconfidence and conceit for wisdom.`
` If any one of the other suspects loses their alibi, your evidence so far proves nothing.`
` ...Just look at how pathetic some of these other alibis are.`
` Did the clock in the reception hall chime midnight at exactly the right time?`
` Did the dog by the back door bark at everyone?"`
`"So, you managed to prove the maid's alibi false.`
` Congratulations.`
` But does it end there?`
` It may have been possible for her to do it, but does she have any motive at all?`
` Are the alibis for the others absolutely perfect?`
` This maid wasn't the only one with a false alibi.`
` You have to keep on searching if you want to find the others.`
` Was there some sort of grudge against the victim? Or some money-related problem?`
` Don't abandon motive, don't abandon the heart.`
` Dry mysteries where the motive can just be figured out later aren't worth anyone's time."`
`"I-If the maid isn't the culprit, then why did she fake an alibi?!`
` Even asking such a question is a waste of time!`
` Know that we just have to interrogate her, wring out the red truth, and have her sign in red blood to everything that happened at the time of the crime!"`
`"Yeah, you probably can do that.`
` You can just use that torture of yours to squeeze out everything frankly and objectively, as seen from the eyes of God.`
` But you know what?`
` ...I'll never accept mysteries and theories that lack heart."`
`"I-I have already taken over responsibility for this case!!`
` I even have a decree right here!`
` Come now, Aides, know that there is no reason to hesitate!`
` I order you to arrest this maid!!"`
`When she gave this order, her subordinates hesitated, looking back and forth between their superior and that man...`
`"I won't let you.`
` The real culprit's a different person.`
` It's possible to use motive to find them, `
`and their alibi trick is an old one.`
` You can't neglect the heart."`
`"Th-There's no need for that...!!`
` We just have to find the suspicious ones who could have committed the crime, interrogate them, and squeeze out the red truth!!`
` On the off-chance that they aren't the culprit, `
`then we just have to interrogate the next suspect...!!"`
`"You call that reasoning?"`
`"Stand back!!`
` We will arrest that woman!!`
` Know that this maid is the culprit!!"`
`"#ff0000It is forbidden for a servant to be the culprit!!#ffffff"`
`"Wh-`
`What...`
`...did you say...?!?!"`
`The words of power blasted away the Aides trying to arrest the maid.`
`"#ff0000...Van Dine's Twenty Rules, Rule #11.#ffffff`
` ...If you want to torture this maid, make sure you double check the alibis for the second wife and her lover first."`
`"Th-Those two already have a clear alibi for the time of the crime...!!"`
`"That, an alibi?`
` Dammit, a fool like you couldn't understand no matter how easy I make it for you.`
` If you want to call yourself the Head Inquisitor, try and figure out at least that much for yourself.`
` Until then, I'll be taking that maid's arrest warrant."`
`"Th-Then what about you?!`
` Can you prove that this maid didn't commit the crime?!`
` Know that she was clearly away from the kitchen at the time of the crime!`
` What was she doing then, and where?!`
` She can't prove it, I can't prove it, and you can't prove it! No one can!`
` That's why we have no choice but to use these torture devices to interrogate her until the red truth is squeezed out!!"`
`"You can squeeze as much blood and truth from the true culprit as you damn well please.`
` However,`
` I won't let you interrogate or torture anyone who isn't that culprit."`
`"Th-This is why everyone says you're too soft...!`
` All the suspicious must be interrogated!`
` That is how we Inquisitors of Heresy conduct our witch trials!!"`
`"That's right, we are Inquisitors of Heresy.`
` Felling evil witches is our job.`
` However, we mustn't risk hurting the innocent.`
` We mustn't put them under suspicion...!`
` All humans have their own personal truths.`
` Those should only be exposed when they commit crimes.`
` We've been given the right to expose them.`
` But there's one thing we can't do."`
`"...Wh-What...?!"`
`"No one, not even God, has the right to expose the innocent truths of those who have not sinned!!"`
`The maid finally realized that he was trying to protect her.`
`"...I-I don't know who you are, but...`
` Th...`
`...Thank you...`
`...very much...!`
` I'm...really not...the culprit!"`
`"Yeah, I know.`
` ...Your boyfriend said he'd be willing to give up everything to prove your alibi.`
` You should thank him.`
` That kid said that honor and reputation are worth nothing compared to you."`
`"...B-But, if he does that, he'll..."`
`"It won't come to that.`
` Exposing the secrets between lovers is a job for third-rate magazines.`
` That's not mystery.`
` ...I'll never allow for heartless reasoning."`
`Then, for the first time, the man's sullen expression relaxed, and he patted the maid's head roughly.`
`"...I'm sure you two will be happy together.`
` Still, meeting together in secret while on the job is hardly praiseworthy.`
` Try to keep that to a minimum."`
`"...Th-Thank you so much...`
` Thank you so much..."`
`These words were heard only by the two of them.`
`The man had learned of her innocence, which could only be proven by exposing the secrets of a pair of young lovers,`
` and he had rushed about in search of a solution, resentful of the arrogance of those trying to expose this by forcible means.`
`"The point of theory-making is not to create a culprit `
`or to trample the truths that lie in the hearts of those who have not sinned.`
`...If you want to play the detective, don't neglect the heart.`
` Otherwise, we're just intellectual rapists.`
` Don't forget it!!"`
`"Uu...ggh...ggggghhhhh...!!"`
`When the man spoke, the Inquisitors no longer had any way to argue back.`
`This man's name is Will.`
`And yet, that's not what everyone used to call him.`
`Head Inquisitor of Heresy of the SSVD, the 8th District Repentance Enforcement Agency of the Great Court of Heaven.`
`Wizard-hunting Wright.`
`"This is the last thing I have to pass on to you guys.`
` If you want to be the next 'Wizard-hunting Wright', remember it.`
` No matter what!!"`
`Quietly, quietly.`
`...The rain fell down.`
`The rain of sadness dripped down the outer walls of the chapel, quietly washing away the dust of the world of the living.`
`The chapel doors were open.`
`During a wedding, only those with invitations are allowed inside.`
`However, during a funeral, the doors are open to all who remember the deceased.`
`...So, this must be a funeral.`
`A shadow holding an umbrella approached the chapel.`
`It was...Will.`
`"............"`
`A reception desk had been set up at the chapel's entrance.`
`As the shadow approached, Kanon, who had been sitting at this desk, stood up and welcomed him with a bow.`
`"...This is the reception desk.`
` We are collecting the names of all mourners.`
` If you would sign in here..."`
`"Sorry, `
`but I'm not a mourner.`
` ...I'm here to meet with someone."`
`You came to a funeral to meet someone...?`
` A dubious expression rose to Kanon's face.`
`Will pulled an envelope from his pocket and showed him the sender's name.`
`"...My apologies.`
` Please, enter."`
`"Thanks.`
` ...Could I at least have one of those?"`
`"...Thank you very much.`
` ...I am sure she will be pleased."`
`Kanon handed him one of a set of golden roses, which were being handed out to all the mourners.`
`Will took it, `
`...silently bowed his head, and entered the chapel.`
`Inside the chapel, several people who appeared to be the family of the deceased were gathered,`
`"Oooooooohhh...`
` Beatriiiiice...`
` Why, `
`whyyyyyyyy...`
`oooooooohhhhh..."`
`"Father, please, take care...`
` Why don't you rest in the waiting room for a bit..."`
`"............"`
`"I killed her,`
` ...I did it...!"`
`"Absurd...!`
` How could that be, Rosa-sama...?"`
`"Father's really bawling."`
`"...Yeah. 'Beatriiiiice', huh?"`
`"I'm sure he didn't cry this much when Mother passed away."`
`"Hey.`
` Now's not the time to say things like that."`
`Some sobbed, unable to conceal their tears,`
` and some spoke softly of old memories.`
`...They were all remembering the dead in their own way, ...it seemed.`
`When Will approached the altar, several people turned around.`
`Of course, none of them knew who Will was.`
`Paying this no mind, Will walked in front of the casket on the altar, which seemed to be buried under golden roses.`
`...Inside the casket, there was no corpse.`
`Instead, as though it lay there in place of a body,`
` ...was a single, thick book with an extravagant binding.`
`The space all around it was filled with countless golden roses.`
`There were words printed on the book's cover.`
`'To my beloved Beatrice.`
` October 5th, 1986'`
`"...<Miss> Beatrice.`
` If it was <Mrs>, then forgive me.`
` ...I've never met you.`
` However, allow me to express my condolences."`
`He took the rose he had received from the reception area and placed it in the casket.`
`...He had absolutely no connection to the woman called Beatrice.`
`However, since he had come to visit a funeral, he had to show this minimum amount of respect for the dead.`
`As part of this, Will prayed for the passage of the dead into the next world...`
`"Pardon me, `
`...but who might you be?`
` I am Ushiromiya Krauss.`
` I'm serving as the chief mourner.`
` This is my child, Lion."`
`"Pleased to meet you.`
` I'm Ushiromiya Lion."`
`"...Lion?`
` ...Who the heck are you?"`
`"It's written as '睆御', but pronounced 'Lee-on'.`
` ...I guess it is a bit strange for a Japanese name."`
`"............"`
`Will stared at Lion's face, wearing a confused expression.`
`He hadn't seemed particularly interested in Krauss, but Lion had apparently drawn some sort of reaction from him.`
`Rather than interest, it was more as though he felt like something was out of place.`
`"...Krauss-sama,`
` Madam says it is about time..."`
`"Ah, I see.`
` ...Ladies and gentlemen.`
` If we're too noisy in here, it may disturb the dead.`
` I've been told that the waiting room has been readied.`
` Shall we move over there?"`
`When Krauss called out to everyone, they began to move towards the chapel waiting room.`
`"My apologies.`
` Lion, could you entertain our guest for now?`
` I will guide the others to the waiting room."`
`"Yes, Father."`
`It looked like a natural conversation, with no awkwardness for either father or child.`
`"Father and child, is it?"`
`"Yes, but why do you ask...?"`
`"Ushiromiya Krauss's child is supposed to be Jessica."`
`"Jessica's my little sister.`
` Do you need me to call for her...?"`
`"......`
`...No, that won't be necessary."`
`Apparently, ...some sort of game was already being played right off the bat.`
`Scratching at his head with an irritated look on his face, Will glanced around.`
`"...Pardon me, but what sort of relation did you have with the deceased?"`
`"None at all.`
` ...It's a real pain."`
`"......Then why did you come to this funeral?"`
`Since Lion was a fairly mild person, Will's behavior was met with nothing more than a blank expression.`
`...A normal person would probably have put on a dubious look long before this.`
`Will scratched his head again and yelled angrily at someone other than Lion.`
`"I'm here.`
` Isn't it about time you showed your face?"`
`The members of the Ushiromiya family had already followed Krauss's instructions and moved to the waiting room.`
`By now, no one could be seen in this cold, vast chapel decorated with gold roses except for Will and Lion.`
`"...So, you've come,`
` ...Wizard-hunting Wright, Inquisitor of Heresy."`
`The girl's voice came suddenly from behind the pair.`
`When Lion turned around in surprise, a girl had appeared out of nowhere and drifted down on top of the altar.`
`She landed softly on the sacred funeral altar as though this was perfectly normal,`
` crushing the golden roses under her shoes...`
`Of course, Lion didn't know this girl.`
`...Just why on earth were all of these people unrelated to the funeral popping up one after another?`
`"I'm already retired.`
` If you have a job you need doing, go ask the new Wright."`
`"No.`
` You're the one I want to ask.`
` I'm giving this case to you.`
` ...Did you read the 'tale' I sent you...?"`
`"...I skimmed it."`
`"I-I don't know who you are, but please get down from there.`
` That's a sacred altar."`
`Snapping out of a daze, Lion told the girl to get down off the altar, but she ignored this completely.`
`On top of that, Will kept on talking to the girl as though Lion wasn't even there.`
`"I hear this is Lion.`
` Who is that, exactly?"`
`"You've already heard who."`
`Ushiromiya...Lion.`
`There's no case of a person with that name appearing in any of the previous games.`
`"Is this your piece?"`
`"No.`
` It's a true and proper piece of this game board.`
` A character appearing in the story."`
`"You're the Game Master.`
` That means it's your piece."`
`"*giggle*...`
` ...I've just moved from Beato's cat box into a larger cat box.`
` Lion is one of the pieces who has a possibility of appearing inside it."`
`"...Ah, I see.`
` ...In other words, it's your piece."`
`"It's a piece I've placed...would be the correct way to say it."`
`"So you're saying this piece isn't your subordinate, like Erika."`
`"...Erika? Who's that?`
` ...*giggle*giggle*."`
`"........."`
`"...Erika...san?`
` ????"`
`"Don't try to understand.`
` You'll just get a headache."`
`Lion didn't have a clue what they were talking about.`
`However, though neither person was familiar, `
`it seemed clear that they both knew a lot about the Ushiromiya family.`
`"I-I don't know what you two are talking about...`
` Anyway, you, girl.`
` Please, get down off the altar.`
` I ask this as the Successor to the Ushiromiya Family Headship."`
`Even Lion was finally forced to speak in a raised voice to that girl, who continued to chat while casually standing on the altar.`
`However, the girl ignored this completely.`
`On the other hand, Will did show a reaction.`
`"...The Successor is supposed to be Krauss."`
`"My father, Krauss, will be the acting Head until I turn 20.`
` Then, I am to succeed the Headship."`
`"First I've heard of this.`
` Can you prove it?"`
`It seemed that even Lion was starting to get ticked off by now.`
`That calm expression appeared to twitch slightly.`
`"This is the Successor's Silver Ring of the One-Winged Eagle.`
` Is that proof enough for you?"`
`"......A silver ring?`
` The golden Head's Ring has appeared several times, but I've never heard anything about a silver ring for the Successor.`
` ...I don't remember Krauss or Jessica ever wearing one of those."`
`"*giggle*...`
` I'm glad.`
` For someone who's just skimmed it, it seems you've read it pretty well."`
`"When a witch hands you a story, you never know when something absurd will pop up.`
` Especially when it's a great witch from the Senate."`
`"...Wh-`
`Who in the world...`
`are you two?!`
` Sorry, but I don't have a clue what you're talking about.`
` If you've finished offering flowers for the departed, please make your exit.`
` It seems you two aren't worthy of our family's hospitality."`
`Lion finally ran out of patience.`
`These were the strictest words that this gentle kid could unleash.`
`However, Will and the girl seemed not to care at all...`
`"I didn't come here because I wanted to."`
`"We're wasting time, so let's move onwards.`
` ...Wright,`
` try and beat this game.`
` As the Game Master, Bernkastel, I invite you to join in."`
`"I refuse."`
`"Why?"`
`"I'm retired now.`
` ...Reasoning and mysteries aren't my business anymore."`
`"How do you intend to spend the rest of your life?`
` Is Wizard-hunting Wright going to give up witch hunting?"`
`"...There's still fox hunting and clam hunting to look forward to.`
` I didn't come here to discuss the rest of my life with you."`
`"So, you came here to refuse?"`
`"Know that your powers of deduction are truly a sight to behold..."`
`"Then do as you will.`
` Go wherever you please.`
` ...That is, assuming that you can leave this place."`
`"......Tch.`
` ...So?`
` What are the terms and payment?"`
`In truth, Will had resigned himself from the beginning.`
`He knew that he was incapable of refusing an invitation from the Great Lady Bernkastel.`
`"'Who killed Beatrice?'`
` That's my game.`
` In payment, I'll forgive you for your insolence and let you leave this chapel."`
`"I hear that boredom-hating witches just love being spoken to rudely."`
`"That's only for hags who've tired of life after a thousand years.`
` I'm still plenty young,`
` so I love thinking up horrible fates in which to trap rude men like you..."`
`"...Tch.`
` So?`
` Who's my enemy?"`
`"There is none.`
` There's no one to stand in your way.`
` I just want to sit back and watch you make your beautiful checkmate in this game...`
` I've even found you an ally.`
` That's what this Lion is for."`
`"...?"`
`After hearing that name spoken out of the blue, Lion frowned once more.`
`Apparently, they were moving things along without Lion's knowledge or understanding, which the latter seemed to find truly irritating.`
`"Lion is a member of the Ushiromiya family...`
`and should prove to be a useful ally, seeing as no one in the family knows you."`
`"...I'm not sure what this is all about, but I can hardly be of assistance until I know what's going on here."`
`"There, see?`
` ...With help like this, it'll be a piece of cake."`
`"Entertain me...and my master, Wizard-hunting Wright.`
` ...Auau may be a polite theatergoer,`
` but I might throw popcorn at you if I get bored, okay...?"`
`"............"`
`Will scratched at his head with a displeased look on his face.`
`He wasn't at all interested in getting involved,`
` ...but by now, he realized that he couldn't disobey Bernkastel's orders.`
`Then, he approached the casket and pointed at its rose-filled insides.`
`"You ask me to solve the case of Beatrice's murder, but...`
` #ff0000Van Dine's Twenty Rules, Rule #7.`
` It is forbidden to have a crime without a corpse.#ffffff"`
`"#5decffThat's a Devil's Proof.`
` Maybe it just isn't inside the casket?`
` Unless you can prove that no corpse exists, this is mystery.#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000Rule #1. It is forbidden to have a crime without all clues presented.#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000Don't worry.`
` Everything is gathered here.#ffffff"`
`"........."`
`Though there was no change to Will's unsatisfied expression,`
` ...he seemed to have understood the general pattern of this place.`
`...The simple fact that a mere Inquisitor of Heresy had been summoned by an uninhibited, fickle, cruel great witch of the Senate...meant that he'd be treated as no more than a mere underling.`
` All along, he had possessed no way to refuse her...`
`"...So, who killed the owner of this empty coffin...?`
` ...I'll answer that question.`
` However, you'll let me do things my way."`
`"As you like."`
`"First off, ...I need to make you understand the current situation."`
`"...Yes, that would be extremely helpful at the moment."`
`Lion's expression seemed nonplussed, angry, and confused, all at the same time.`
`"Over here.`
` ...It'll be faster to see it for yourself."`
`"...Wonderful.`
` Please, lead the way."`
`Will signaled with his chin for Lion to follow him and spun around.`
`After snorting once in an unsatisfied manner,`
` Lion followed him, as though resigned to see Will's little show.`
`...As she watched them leave the chapel,`
` ...Bernkastel sneered silently at them, a cold smile on her face.`
`"......As the miko of the great Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating, Featherine Something Auaurora, `
`and as the Witch of Miracles, ...I, Bernkastel,`
` announce the start of this game."`
`"...The tale's title is 'Requiem of the Golden Witch'.`
` ...Spin a tale fitting for Beato's funeral.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*`
` Well now, let's see just how you drag out the guts."`
`She watched until the pair had left the chapel.`
`Bernkastel's form evaporated into the empty air, just as she had arrived.`
`All that remained was her unpleasant cackling...`
`Outside, it was still raining.`
`When Kanon saw the guest and the Successor approaching the reception desk, he bowed deeply.`
`"...Good work.`
` You can take a break now, so would you mind leaving?`
` Umm,`
` ........."`
`"......It's Kanon.`
` Yes, as you wish."`
`Kanon bowed deeply, then disappeared.`
`"Don't you remember the names of all your servants?"`
`"...Our family has many young servants coming in and out, and they're usually replaced quite frequently.`
` Well now.`
` What are you trying to explain to me?`
` Who are you, and what business do you have with this family?`
` Of course, there's no need to convince me.`
` Feel free to head on home, if you want."`
`"There is no going home.`
` Not for me,`
` ...not for anyone."`
`"Could you please give that a rest?`
` Stop speaking in confusing riddles like that all the time.`
` Even I have limits to my patience.`
` If you don't want me to see you off, should I call Genji or Gohda?"`
`"Don't freak out.`
` ...Look at this."`
`"Yes, I can see that.`
` It's one of the memorial roses.`
` Are you going to show me some kind of magic trick?"`
`Will took one of the flower offerings,`
` then showed it to Lion, as though pointing out that there were no mechanisms or tricks.`
`Then, he slowly lifted it upwards.`
`"...Watch."`
`"Yes, I'm watching.`
` Is a dove going to fly out of it?`
` Or is it going to be flags and fireworks?`
` ...Huh?"`
`Will threw the rose.`
`Anyone would have expected it to fly in an arc and land in some puddle.`
`It didn't, which was why Lion had been struck dumb.`
`The rose thrown by Will certainly had flown in an arc.`
`It should have sped on rapidly through the air.`
`However, as soon as it passed out from the shade of the eaves and was about to reach the rain, `
`...it stopped right in midair, `
`as though the air surrounding it had turned into syrup.`
`That wasn't all.`
`As it hung in midair, the rose's beautiful golden petals began to darken one after another, `
`...and it became a black husk, like burnt charcoal.`
`And, even after this happened, it remained suspended there in the air...`
`"...What sort of trick is this?`
` ...Ah-"`
`"Don't move."`
`Lion had moved closer to try and touch the remains of the rose, which still hung in the air.`
`Will had roughly blocked the way with his arm.`
`It was as though he was telling Lion that leaving this place meant certain death.`
`"...This chapel has been cut off from the Fragment.`
` We're currently locked in a concentrated loop of time."`
`"What...`
`...do you mean by that...?!"`
`"...Explaining's a pain, so I'll just give you the short version.`
` Basically, unless we play along with that witch's game, no one can leave this place."`
`"...Wh-What...?!`
` The funeral is already over!`
` I'm sure some people will want to return to the mansion or the guesthouse.`
` We can't be locked up in here!"`
`"If you've got a bone to pick, that witch is the one you're looking for.`
` Being stuck in a place like this isn't any more pleasant for me."`
`"That girl's your friend, right?!`
` Make her stop all this weirdness."`
`"She's probably sitting in a spectator's seat with a bucket of popcorn about now.`
` She won't come if we just call her."`
`"Wh-What on earth is going on?!!"`
`That short sentence described all of Lion's feelings at that moment.`
`However, Lion had seen the rose Will threw wither in an instant in the rainy darkness.`
`...Lion tried doing the same thing with another rose, but the effect was exactly the same.`
`No one would want to use their own body to test this fearsome something that could make roses crumble instantly...`
`"There's only one way for us to be released from here.`
` ...We have to play along with Bernkastel's game."`
`"...You mean the one about who killed Beatrice?"`
`"That's what she's telling us to investigate.`
` If you could fill me in, this'll go more quickly.`
` ...That fickle witch will be completely satisfied.`
` You'll be able to get rid of the two of us, and I have a date with Diana when I get back.`
` ...If I keep her waiting too long, she'll start tearing up the sofa again."`
`"Who killed Beatrice, you say...?`
` That's hardly something you should go barging into a funeral and asking the family about."`
`"Questioning the family is one of the basics of the mystery genre.`
` Just give up and accept it.`
` ...I do know that Beatrice is the mistress of Kinzo, the Family Head."`
`"......`
`You really are a strange person.`
` ...How do you know so much about this family?`
` ...Are you sure you have no connections with us...?"`
`Will knew this much about the Ushiromiya family...because Bernkastel had shown him all of the Fragments so far.`
`Of course, he had no sort of connection with the Ushiromiya family himself.`
`The very plane of his existence was on a different level.`
`"However, Beatrice died a long, long time ago.`
` According to Genji, she passed away before the mansion was completed,`
` but the reason for her death is unclear.`
` ......To be honest, this is the first I've heard about her being 'killed'.`
` ...Tell me about it."`
`"...My name is Ushiromiya Lion."`
`"Willard.`
` Call me Will."`
`For the first time, Will introduced himself.`
`Their mutual introduction was finally complete, and Lion was finally able to talk with him on an even footing.`
`...However, Lion took a deep breath and looked up at the sky, wearing a vague smile.`
`"Will-san."`
`"Call me Will.`
` I'll call you Lion."`
`"...Will.`
` To be honest, ...even I don't know much about this person called Beatrice."`
`"......I see.`
` I guess it's called a game for a reason."`
`If only Lion could've told him everything, revealing the truth without any effort from Will...`
`Apparently, things wouldn't be so easy after all.`
`"Everyone who enters the Ushiromiya family knows the name and image of Beatrice."`
`"That's because of the massive portrait hanging in the entrance hall, isn't it?`
` That portrait was first displayed in April of 1984."`
`"Seriously, ...how is it that you know so much?`
` ...Ah, well.`
` It's about time I stopped finding that odd.`
` I'm sure you'll just start speaking in riddles again."`
`Lion was the Successor and lived in the Head Household.`
`That made conversations with Kinzo an everyday occurance.`
`Because of this, Lion must have been used to chatting with people who were moody or hard to follow.`
`With the understanding that getting stuck on the details would be nothing but a waste of time, the conversation naturally fell into a pattern as though Lion and this unknown man Will were long-time friends...`
`"Everyone knows Beatrice.`
` And yet, no one knows her.`
` Kinzo's the only one who's ever met her."`
`"...The Head seems to be particularly cranky today.`
` I'll introduce you to him when the chance presents itself, so I ask that you develop an appropriately discreet attitude, Will-san."`
`"That was quick.`
` ...I thought you'd resist a bit more than that."`
`"I'm used to speaking with the Family Head.`
` I've learned to accept most unreasonable situations and just go with the flow."`
`Bernkastel had set up a 'barrier' cutting the chapel off from the rest of the world.`
`To destroy that, they would have to find out 'who killed Beatrice'.`
`For Lion, who had already experienced many of Kinzo's rantings, understanding this much was more than enough...`
`The Ushiromiya family members were relaxing here and there around the waiting room.`
`A light buffet-style meal had been set up, but it was a bit stale, and not particularly appealing.`
`Even so, those voracious kids seemed to find it intensely interesting.`
`The cousins had set up camp around it, with Maria at the center.`
`The adult siblings had also formed a group in a different corner.`
`Perhaps because of Kinzo's absence, everyone seemed to be a little more relaxed.`
`"...Lion,`
` where did you go?`
` ...And who is that?"`
`"Mother,`
` I was entertaining this guest of ours.`
` Will, this is my mother, Natsuhi."`
`"No introductions needed.`
` Just tell me what you have to say."`
`"Huh? Did you say something?"`
`"No, he said nothing.`
` This is Will-san.`
` It seems he knew the deceased."`
`With a smile, Lion casually smoothed over Will's words.`
`"He wants to know more about Beatrice.`
` ...Do you know anything about her, Mother?"`
`"......`
`...Lion, the departed is an individual to whom the Head owed a great debt.`
` Nothing more, nothing less.`
` This funeral is a ceremony for the Head to repay his benefactor for all he received while that person still lived.`
` That is what I have been told, and there is nothing more to it than that."`
`"...Thanks, Mother.`
` Will, that's all my mother knows."`
`Natsuhi was eager to deny the scandal about Beatrice being Kinzo's mistress.`
`However, she also had enough sense to realize that this scandal was probably true.`
`Picking up that Natsuhi was in a bad mood and didn't want to talk about this anymore,`
` Lion brought an end to that conversation before Will could say something rude again.`
`"Will,`
` this chapel belongs to the family."`
`"So you're telling me to follow the family's rules?"`
`"Speak in a manner appropriate for a guest of the family.`
` Let me be the medium for all of your conversations.`
` I ask that you follow those two rules."`
`"I'll work on that."`
`"...The mess this Bernkastel witch or whatever has dragged us into is a real pain.`
` Because of that, I'm willing to help you.`
` But we're equal partners in this job, and you'd best not forget that."`
`"And here I thought you were just some well-bred rich kid.`
` Seems you can speak up after all."`
`"I must be prepared to shoulder the Ushiromiya family's future, after all."`
`"......Got it.`
` Let's solve this crime together, Watson."`
`"I'm glad I can help.`
` I wouldn't want to keep your dear cat Diana waiting.`
` Won't she need to be fed soon?"`
`"I gave her extra food today, `
`so she should be good for a while.`
` ......I'm surprised you realized Diana was a cat."`
`"I figured it'd be just a bit too eccentric for her to be a human woman who scratches at sofas when you keep her waiting."`
`"...Hmph."`
`"So?`
` Who will you talk to first?"`
`"Anyone.`
` Everyone.`
` ...Those ones over there are Krauss's siblings, right?"`
`"From right to left, there's Aunt Eva, `
`Uncle Hideyoshi, `
`over there is Uncle Rudolf, `
`Aunt Kyrie, `
`and over there is-"`
`"Ushiromiya Rosa.`
` ...When she was a girl, she once got lost in the forest and bumped into a woman calling herself Beatrice in a hidden mansion."`
`"...I know I shouldn't be surprised anymore,`
` but you really do know everything, don't you?"`
`"So, you know about that story too?"`
`"I managed to overhear her saying that today.`
` ...It looked as though it was bothering her, so I pretended not to hear."`
`"Real model student, you are.`
` ...Introduce me.`
` I want to ask about it."`
`"You're asking this of the model student who pretended not to hear because it just might be a painful topic?"`
`Even this outrageous arrogance is nothing compared to Kinzo.`
`After muttering this several times mentally, Lion shrugged and nodded at Will.`
`"Oh, it's our Successor-sama.`
` And who is this...?"`
`"Oh, Aunt Eva.`
` This is Will-san.`
` He came to offer flowers for the departed."`
`"But who cares about that.`
` Tell me everything you know about`
`...nngah-"`
`"He says he wants to know what sort of relationship the Ushiromiya family has had with the deceased."`
`Lion spoke with a bright smile after pinching Will's butt.`
`Will silently protested, as though saying 'I saw that coming, but damn that hurt'`
`, but Lion just played dumb and smiled at Eva like a model student.`
`"Well, `
`"It probably makes more sense to say 'her relationship with Father'."`
`"No need to beat around the bush.`
` She was Father's mistress."`
`"If you call her that, Natsuhi nee-san will yell at you again.`
` He's 'indebted' to her, right?`
` *giggle*"`
`"Yep, that's right.`
` Wahahahaha."`
`"...Well, there you have it."`
`"I have no interest in anyone but Rosa, `
`gghh-"`
`"I do believe...that you said you met with Beatrice, Aunt Rosa."`
`"........."`
`This whole time, Rosa had been hanging her head.`
`Lion's words made her shoulders quiver.`
`"She just suddenly came out with it today.`
` It's a bit hard to believe."`
`"It's the truth...!`
` I killed Beatrice!"`
`"Perfect, our work here is finished."`
`"Don't get ahead of yourself."`
`Rosa broke down crying and laid her head on the table.`
` Kyrie and Hideyoshi tried to console her...`
`"Rokkenjima is covered by a dense forest.`
` We only know about one tiny portion of it.`
` Just the mansion, the rose garden,`
` and the little path that leads to the harbor."`
`"For years, there's been stories about how Dad built a hidden mansion somewhere in the vast forest that no one knew about,`
` and that he had a mistress living there."`
`"Rosa-san probably stumbled on the hidden mansion by chance..."`
`"If I hadn't taken her out with me, she never would have died...!`
` She was so innocent, like a chick.`
` I took her out, and she just followed along obediently!`
` She stayed right behind me, trusting me completely...!`
` And because I made her take such a dangerous path...!!"`
`"Did you make her walk that way because you were hoping she'd slip and fall from the cliff?"`
`"I never meant to do that!`
` I just thought she'd like to see the ocean...!`
` No,`
` it just looked like the path would be hard to walk,`
` and I thought it would be easier going if we went down the cliff first...!!"`
`"That's not what it means to kill someone.`
` It was an accident."`
`"An accident she never would have had if I hadn't brought her with me, right?!`
` It's my fault!!`
` And then, I abandoned her when she was covered in blood and ran home!!"`
`"It isn't your fault.`
` Beatrice had never seen the ocean before.`
` ...You showed her that for the first time ever.`
` She was probably so excited that she just happened to take a bad step."`
`"...H-How can you know that...?"`
`"Beatrice might thank you for what you did, but she would never hate you."`
`"......`
`Really?`
` ...Is that...`
`really true...?"`
`"She's the one who begged to see the world outside the fence, right?`
` Though it was only for a short while, you made that dream of hers come true.`
` If I were Beatrice, I'd thank you for that short bit of time.`
` If she knew that you've been suffering all this time for it, she'd probably feel sorry for you."`
`"...Beatrice is grateful for what you did.`
` You're the one who taught her that the sea is blue."`
`"......Is that...`
`...true...?"`
`"I guarantee it."`
`Will made that statement openly and boldly.`
`It wasn't clear how Rosa took those words.`
`However, ...it had apparently been enough to remind Rosa to take a handkerchief out of her pocket and wipe her eyes with it.`
`"...Thank you."`
`"Those are the words Beatrice is whispering to you even now."`
`"......Thank you..."`
`Rosa wiped her eyes with the handkerchief one more time and hung her head.`
`It no longer looked like a fit of sobbing, but more as though she was speaking with the Beatrice of that day within her heart,`
` ...one last time.`
`"...You really have no problem making claims you could never back up, don't you?"`
`"Back up?`
` Is that really necessary to comfort a woman?"`
`"......`
`It seems I underestimated you."`
`How many years did it torment Rosa?`
`Now, finally,`
` ...she would probably be able to face that innocently smiling Beatrice, who had seen the ocean for the first time in her life.`
`She was the only one who could forgive Rosa.`
`Now, the two of them could finally speak together...`
`"...I don't know who you are, but thank you.`
` ...I wonder if she'll forgive me."`
`"You've worried about it for nearly 20 years.`
` That's far too long.`
` She'd tell you that you've suffered more than enough already."`
`"...That's right, Aunt Rosa.`
` The sadder you are, the sadder Beatrice would be."`
`"......You too...`
` Thank you.`
` ...I don't know if I'll be forgiven,`
` ...but I'll keep on speaking to my heart to see whether she'll forgive me or not.`
` ...Thanks, you two.`
` Sorry for showing you such an embarrassing side of me."`
`"And I'm sorry to say this right after saying something so pretty,`
` ...but I want you to talk to me.`
` Tell me what happened back then."`
`"...Will-san!"`
`"Thanks, but it's fine.`
` ...I'll talk.`
` Hiding this and keeping quiet about it for so long might have been my greatest sin."`
`"Exactly when was it that you met Beatrice?"`
`Upon hearing this question, ...Rosa closed her eyes lightly, reaching back to a past she didn't want to remember...`
`"...It was about 20 years ago.`
` ...20...or wait, it might have been 19 or 18 years ago.`
` ...I'm sorry.`
` I've tried to force myself to forget it for so long that I've nearly forgotten that part completely."`
`"It should have been 1967."`
`Ronove had guaranteed that with the red truth in the 3rd game.`
`"Th-That's right...`
` It was probably about 1967.`
` I can remember what happened as clearly as a picture...`
` I'll never forget..."`
`"If it's tough for you, don't feel like you have to tell us."`
`"Yes, clear as a picture, if you don't mind.`
` ......Ngah!`
` ...Dammit, that hurts, Lion."`
`"What does?"`
`"At the time, I was in a state of shock, since my tutor told Mother about something that was supposed to be a secret.`
` On that day, I became reckless, and I kept on running deeper and deeper into the forest."`
`This tale has also been told in a previous Fragment.`
`Back when Rosa was just a kid, she went deep into the forest,`
` ...found a hidden mansion, and met with a mysterious woman who called herself Beatrice...`
`"...But that forest is so thick, even pushing your way through a bit of it is hard, right?"`
`"I even surprised myself...`
` To think that I made it so far into such a dense forest.`
` ...I was tormented by twigs and sharp leaves over and over again."`
`"However, that wasn't enough to bother me on that day.`
` ...After all, I wanted to disappear into the forest and vanish forever.`
` ...If, by some chance, there really was a witch's mansion in the depths of the forest,`
` ...I hoped that she might take me to the some paradise, or else turn me into a frog and make me a resident of the forest."`
`"So, you then reached the hidden mansion, Kuwadorian,`
` and met a woman who called herself Beatrice."`
`"...Yes.`
` I met her."`
`"Was that Beatrice the same as the one in the portrait?"`
`"......`
`...Yes.`
` They were the same person.`
` Beautiful blue eyes.`
` Golden hair.`
` A black dress.`
` It truly was the person in that portrait.`
` ...When Father first had it hung,`
` ...I realized that the 20 years I'd spent trying to forget...must have seemed just as long to Father, if not even longer, `
`and I became even more fearful of my sin..."`
`"Stop there.`
` ...Are we sure that this is the same Beatrice that Rosa-san met?"`
`Immediately, Kyrie spoke the question that Will had been thinking of.`
`It would be too rash to assume that the Beatrice Kinzo met and the one Rosa met were the same person.`
`The time and generation didn't match up.`
`"Beatrice is supposed to be that lady of leisure who lent Dad all that gold shortly after the war, right?"`
`"By usin' Beatrice's gold as a foundation, Father revived the Ushiromiya family and got super rich.`
` Then he bought Rokkenjima and moved over.`
` Rosa-san meetin' her must've been at least 10 years after that."`
`"A woman who could do as she pleased with 10 tons of gold could hardly be some little girl.`
` And 10 more years passed before she met Rosa.`
` ...Rosa,`
` about how old did the Beatrice you met look?"`
`"...She looked older than I was at the time,`
` ...but even so, it looked as though she might just be reaching adulthood.`
` Yes, just the sort of age of the Beatrice in the portrait."`
`"Did she look middle-aged or past her prime?"`
`"If I had to call her an adult or a child, she was clearly closer to being a child.`
` There's no way she was middle-aged."`
`"And isn't that strange?`
` We have the Beatrice you met and the Beatrice who gave Father the gold, `
`but their ages don't match."`
`"In other words, they're different people."`
`"Different people...who look very similar and have the same name..."`
`"It might've been her daughter.`
` A kid would obviously end up lookin' like her mother."`
`"His mistress's daughter...`
` It is possible.`
` Perhaps Father had an illegitimate child with the Beatrice who gave him the gold."`
`"And then, Rosa bumped into Beatrice the Second.`
` ...That way, the ages fit just fine."`
`"............"`
`"I see...`
` In other words, there are two people who can be called Beatrice."`
`Kinzo secretly raised his mistress's child in a hidden mansion.`
`It made sense.`
` Everyone nodded, agreeing.`
`...However, Will's expression was slightly unsatisfied, and he scratched at his head...`
`"So, it would seem that `
`this funeral exists for the two Beatrices he couldn't mourn, because they were kept secret..."`
`"Rosa,`
` I know you probably don't want to remember, but tell me about that accident.`
` After Beatrice fell, was she still breathing?"`
`"No.`
` ...Her eyes were open wide.`
` She fell upside down, head first, and knocked her head against a sharp crag on the rocky beach.`
` And she fell from such a height...`
` Her skull had split and caved inwards.`
` ...That beautiful golden hair was stained red with blood almost instantly..."`
`"Was it the sort of wound that clearly showed that she was dead?"`
`"Yes.`
` I saw the insides of her cracked head!`
` It had caved in deep enough to fit your fist inside it...!`
` No one could be naive enough to see that and still hope that she was alive!"`
`"...Will,`
` do you really need to ask anything more?"`
`"That's enough for the time of the accident.`
` What did you do afterwards?"`
`"I dashed away at full speed.`
` ...I can't say I was thinking about calling for help.`
` ...I wanted to escape from that place as fast as I could.`
` Half-crazed, sobbing, and out of breath, I kept on running about at random.`
` ...Eventually, I came across a familiar lion statue."`
`"Oh, the one in front of the chapel?"`
`"No, the one behind it.`
` ...Anyway, I made it back to the mansion.`
` I couldn't tell anyone, and I didn't want to.`
` I stayed quiet until nightfall.`
` It was so horrible of me.`
` If I had hurried and told someone, they might have brought her a first aid kit, and she might have been saved..."`
`"How is a first aid kit going to help with a crushed cranium?`
` ...You didn't kill her.`
` Don't worry about that anymore."`
`"............"`
`"Then, ...what did you do next?"`
`"...That night, I turned over in my bed so many times.`
` I couldn't sleep.`
` ...Late that night, I quietly...`
`...called Genji-san on the phone and told him..."`
`"...What did he say?"`
`"He told me to let him handle everything and to speak of this to no one.`
` ...I spent the next several days terrified that Father would call for me and scold me brutally.`
` But...he didn't.`
` Genji-san kept on doing his job quietly, just like normal.`
` ...Father stayed locked up in his study, not knowing any of it..."`
`"At the very least, none of us ever heard about it."`
`"...Genji-san probably managed to clean everything up nicely."`
`"After all, they couldn't let knowledge of that child go public..."`
`"Hmmmmm...`
` Even if she was an illegitimate child, she was still his daughter by blood.`
` It must've been tough for Father, not bein' able to hold a real funeral for her..."`
`"...I suppose that's why we're having this funeral."`
`"And then?"`
`"That's all I know."`
`"......`
`And that's all I know too."`
`"I'm not hiding anything else.`
` I've told you everything.`
` ...I swear it."`
`"............"`
`Will scratched at his head, letting his gaze wander.`
`It had taken Rosa a lot of determination to make this confession, but it was nothing particularly special for Will.`
`It had apparently been little more than a review of information he already knew...`
`"Thanks, Aunt Rosa.`
` ...Is that enough for you, Will?`
` Are you satisfied?"`
`"That's enough.`
` It was a nice review."`
`To Will, Rosa's memories gave only information that was already known.`
`This was the first time he'd heard all that about her running back to the mansion after Beatrice fell to her death,`
` but none of it was particularly surprising.`
`Apparently, Rosa didn't know any more than this...`
`If he wanted to learn more than what was in the Fragments Bernkastel gave him, he would need to find new testimony.`
`"Lion,`
` tell Kinzo that I want to talk to him.`
` It looks like we won't get anywhere without asking the man himself."`
`"Where are you going?"`
`"...Off to cool my head and organize my thoughts.`
` Don't follow."`
`"Well then, pardon me.`
` Please take your time."`
`After giving an elegant bow, Lion made a face, tongue sticking out.`
`Unless Will had eyes on the back of his head, he couldn't have seen this last bit...`
`Will returned to the chapel by himself.`
`The cold air and the monotonous sound of the rain were comforting.`
`"...So, how's the game going?"`
`And he had come here for a little peace and quiet...`
`As soon as he let out a sigh of relief, that voice rang out.`
`"That's my line."`
`It was as though she had been sitting there all along.`
` ...Bernkastel appeared on top of the altar once more.`
`Beatrice's altar must've been extremely comfortable.`
`"...Battler annoyed me over and over with his incompetence.`
` You're quite competent compared to him, so it's much more relaxing to watch you work."`
`"Unlike Ushiromiya Battler's games, I have nothing standing in my way.`
` It's easy."`
`"That sort of game has already ended.`
` Tales can be enjoyed twice.`
` First you love them.`
` Then you tear out their guts.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Tch. So I'm a butcher now."`
`"So?`
` Do you think you've figured out who killed Beatrice...?"`
`"Rosa's confession is something I already know from a previous Fragment.`
` There was no brand-new information.`
` ...We're still at square one."`
`"*giggle*giggle*..."`
`"Unless Ushiromiya Kinzo tells us what really happened, we won't get any further than this.`
` Don't tell me that arguing with Kinzo and persuading him to spill the beans `
`is supposed to be part of this game."`
`"That'd be fatally boring.`
` ...Kinzo refuses to speak of the truth and is himself the king protected by his castle,`
` but it wouldn't be any fun to have that stand in the way of your game..."`
`"...I won't torture.`
` It's not my style."`
`"I know.`
` As the Game Master, I will grant you power.`
` So that you can get the truth from Kinzo, of course."`
`Still wearing shoes, Bernkastel stepped into the casket, picked up one of the flowers that had been set as offerings,`
` ...and blew hard, as though scattering fluff from a dandelion.`
`Then, a single petal broke off and drifted down towards Will,`
` no longer gold, but with the shine of a transparent crystal...`
`"The 'detective's authority'?"`
`"Hmph, what, that pathetic ability?`
` ...No.`
` This is an invitation to the grandstands."`
`"...'Theatergoing authority'?`
` ...That's supposed to be forbidden without authorization from the Senate."`
`"I'm the one giving it. On my game board.`
` Who's going to stop me...?"`
`"...Hmph."`
`Though the crystal flower petal danced in the wind, it wouldn't fly away until Will accepted it.`
`He remembered how useless it was to argue with witches and snatched it up.`
`When he did, the petal flashed brightly for an instant, melted into Will's palm, and disappeared...`
`"Entertain me if you can.`
` And try and enjoy yourself.`
` ...You must also be interested in seeing what the guts of Beatrice's game board look like, right?"`
`"Not really."`
`After Will's rude answer,`
` Bernkastel vanished into thin air, leaving behind an obnoxious laugh...`
`"...Tch."`
`After clicking his tongue, Will turned around unhappily.`
`...When he did, it felt as though his gaze had crossed that of a shadow standing right in front of him, near the door that led outside.`
`"Who is it?"`
`"Ah, ...p-pardon me...`
` I heard a voice, s-so I wondered who it was..."`
`"Ah, Shannon.`
` So you're running the reception desk this time...?"`
`"Yes.`
` I've been taking it in turns with Kanon-kun to run the reception desk..."`
`"And Kanon?"`
`"A short while ago, he was ordered by, umm,`
` ...L-Lion-sama to take a break, so he's resting now."`
`"...So, you don't know Lion either?"`
`"Huh?`
` ...No, that's not..."`
`"Ushiromiya Lion is the Successor, the one who wears the silver ring.`
` ...Why are you stumbling over that name when you've worked here for 10 years?"`
`"...Th-That's..."`
`"Don't worry.`
` I don't recognize Lion either.`
` ...Krauss is supposed to be the Successor.`
` Jessica is supposed to be his only child.`
` There hasn't been a single Fragment with anyone named Lion in the Ushiromiya family."`
`When she realized that Will didn't recognize Lion either, Shannon relaxed.`
`Apparently, she was a bit relieved to find that she wasn't going crazy by herself.`
`...However, her expression quickly grew uncertain once more.`
`"Wh-Where...is this place...?`
` I think it's the Ushiromiya family chapel.`
` ...However, something feels different about it.`
` Also, I never knew that someone named L-Lion-sama existed.`
` ...And yet Madam, Krauss-sama, ...the Master, Milady, and all the relatives all talk as though it's perfectly natural...`
` I just...don't understand what's happening..."`
`"...Lion is a piece placed by Bernkastel.`
` She also said that, in order to place that piece, she switched over to a larger cat box.`
` ...On top of that, it seems this world isn't a proper world, but one made out of several different Fragments sewn together."`
`It's as though...this is a special stage set up specifically for this game.`
`...I'm sure she's nodding at my thoughts right now, laughing and chomping down popcorn.`
`"How long have you worked here in this world?"`
`"...T-Ten years."`
`I see.`
` So it really is a special stage.`
`After all, right when I entered the chapel, I spotted Kinzo.`
`Since Shannon has been working here for 10 years, this world takes place in 1986, the stage of Beato's game.`
`In that case, Kinzo shouldn't exist.`
`However, he definitely was here a few minutes ago.`
`Bernkastel promised that all of the information needed for reasoning was gathered here.`
`She must've really packed it together to fit everything in...`
`I see, so it really is a special stage.`
`"You've served the Ushiromiya family for many years.`
` So, just how much do you know about Beatrice?"`
`"...I know the Master loved her deeply, but other than that..."`
`"Is that all?"`
`"A-And, umm, `
`......they say that she's the master of Rokkenjima's night`
`...umm..."`
`"That's right.`
` The name of the ghost rumored to wander the mansion night after night is also Beatrice."`
`That brings the number of Beatrices to three.`
`The first is the Beatrice from more than 30 years ago, who is said to have given Kinzo the gold.`
`The second is the Beatrice from 20 years ago, who met Rosa.`
`The third is the Beatrice of the ghost stories, who is rumored to be the master of the night on Rokkenjima.`
`"...Furudo Erika's reasoning was probably correct.`
` It started out as a legend of evil spirits on Rokkenjima.`
` Later on, elements such as Kinzo's occult hobbies, the name and portrait of the mysterious woman, Beatrice,`
` and the epitaph got mixed in, and it was all integrated into the Legend of the Golden Witch."`
`"...Then, the darkness of the night gained the personality of a witch.`
` That's the third Beatrice.`
` This became the veil for the serial murders."`
`"...Uh, umm......"`
`Apparently, she didn't understand a word of Will's sudden monologue.`
`Shannon tried to follow along, but she seemed to be having difficulty.`
`"Don't waste your time trying to understand.`
` You'll just get a headache."`
`"M-My apologies..."`
`"Kanon doesn't know Lion either, right?"`
`"......Yes.`
` Kanon-kun was the same as me."`
`Shannon...and Kanon, is it...`
`"......`
`...Call Kanon over here. I want to talk to the pair of you about something."`
`When Will said these words, Shannon's face went blank and her eyes went wide.`
`"My apologies.`
` We aren't allowed to leave the reception desk unmanned, so I can't leave to go get him."`
`"Then find a replacement and have them take over the reception desk until you get back.`
` You, me, and Kanon.`
` ...We, the three people who don't know Lion, need to talk."`
`"..............."`
`"........."`
`"...We've been told that one person is enough to run the reception desk."`
`"But no one told you there was anything wrong with two people manning it, right?"`
`"We're low on helpers today, so we were told that having two people at the reception desk would be unnecessary."`
`"Who gave you that order?`
` Kinzo? Krauss?`
` Or was it Lion?`
` I will check with them."`
`"It was...the one who orders me.`
` I cannot disobey orDERS."`
`"Who is this person?`
` I'll negotiate with them."`
`"You cannot...NEGOTIATE.`
` It iS the oNE who orDERS US."`
`"Call Kanon over here.`
` ...I hate theatergoing just as much as I hate torture."`
`Slowly, ...Will pulled his right hand out of his pocket.`
`When he slowly opened his fist,`
` ......a small, bright glow emanated from it.`
`The flower petal given to him by Bernkastel had become a glowing, sparkling mark on his hand...`
`He held that hand out towards Shannon...and slowly approached her.`
`"Call Kanon.`
` I want to check something with you two."`
`"I...C A N`
` N O T CALL HIM.`
` DO YOU S T`
`I L L ...`
`WANT  ME`
` TO...?"`
`"If you don't call him, I'm going to use my authority."`
`"IF YO`
`U INS`
`IST, `
`...I CA`
`N CA`
`LL HIM`
` SPECI`
`ALLY FOR`
` YOU, `
`BUT..."`
`"............"`
`"       ."`
`There was some kind of incomprehensible tension between the two.`
`Will stood there, his left hand still in his pocket and his right palm glowing and stretched out towards her.`
`Shannon just stood there, her hands still folded politely in front of her,`
` ...her posture beautiful.`
`And yet, ...it felt oddly as though windswept drops of rain were sparking and crackling in midair...`
`"I `
`W`
`I`
`L`
`L`
`  GO  CA`
`LL KA`
`NON `
`KUN. `
`ARE `
` YOU `
` ABSOLUTELY `
` CER`
`TAIN`
`?"`
`"........."`
`Shannon's face was still kind and gentle.`
`And yet, the tension was as icy as a frozen lake...`
`...Beginners in chess will sometimes move their king into check without noticing it.`
`One might mercilessly capture the king in this situation, ...but high-level players are supposed to calmly tell their opponent about their mistake.`
`'If you take one more step,`
` ...you'll get captured'.`
`This was...similar to that...`
`"........."`
`...I see.`
`So, after all...`
`"I get it.`
` That's enough.`
` ...You guys can take it in turns to run the reception desk."`
`Slowly, ...Will lowered his hand.`
`"Thank you for understanding."`
`The glow slowly vanished from Will's palm.`
`That completely incomprehensible tension melted away like a sugar cube in water.`
`However, nothing had changed since the beginning.`
`Will's expression and Shannon's expression...were the same as they always had been.`
`"Oh, are you leaving?"`
`Footsteps approached them.`
` It was Lion.`
`"Just having a casual conversation.`
` I wanted to ask her something."`
`"...What could that be?`
` Did you find what you were looking for?"`
`"......`
`Yeah."`
`"I'm honored to have been of service."`
`"........."`
`"That's a shame.`
` If you were looking for an umbrella, I could've gotten you one right away."`
`"Did you convince Kinzo?"`
`"...I told him that a rare guest wanted to greet him.`
` He says he'll meet with you."`
`"Did you tell him that I wanted to ask about Beatrice?"`
`"Isn't that your job?"`
`With a slightly mischievous look, Lion turned away.`
`Will scratched his head and shrugged, looking annoyed.`
`"...Ah, well.`
` Guess I'll get a chance to try this out at least."`
`Will opened his right hand and showed it to Lion.`
`It was just a hand, without anything remotely remarkable about it.`
`Lion's head tilted to the side in bafflement at this strange gesture.`
`"Good work.`
` ...Umm,`
` ...wait, your name was..."`
`"It's Shannon."`
`"That's right, Shannon.`
` Please take over at the reception desk.`
` And make sure you keep warm."`
`"Thank you very much, Lion-sama."`
`Shannon bowed deeply in response to Lion's kind words.`
`There was not even a trace of tension in her manner...`
`"Let's go, Will.`
` You don't want to miss this chance.`
` ...The Head's mood changes quicker than the autumn sky."`
`"Good luck."`
`"...Here we go."`
`"I've brought Willard-san."`
`"........."`
`Kinzo and Genji could be seen in the VIP room.`
`Kinzo was sitting back in a chair, his eyes closed as though in a troubled sleep.`
`"...Master,`
` the guest has come to see you."`
`"............Nn."`
`...Those eyes were red from crying.`
`They regained their focus and slowly fell on Will.`
`"...I am...Ushiromiya Kinzo."`
`"...Will."`
`"I'm Willard.`
` Allow me to express my condolences."`
`"...So, you came here to attend Beatrice's funeral.`
` ...Just who are you?"`
`"I'm no one. I have no connections with anyone.`
` Don't think too deeply about it.`
` You'll just get a headache.`
` ...Ow."`
`"I ask that you choose your words a little more carefully. (*smile*)"`
`"...Hmph, what a strange guest.`
` So?`
` What business do you have with me?"`
`"I want to ask about Beatrice."`
`"What......?"`
`Kinzo's gaze grew sharp.`
`Lion felt a bit lightheaded and wondered why this guy had to be so direct.`
`"Why do you ask?`
` You're no one, aren't you?`
` Why do you want to know about Beatrice?`
` What is your purpose?"`
`"Because I'm no one,`
` I can listen to your tale impartially and record it.`
` You'll probably leave this world before too long.`
` If you die without telling anyone anything about Beatrice,`
` your children will adorn Beatrice with whatever tale they please, writing that into their memories."`
`"Pft, hahahahahahahahahaha!`
` You entertain me, boy.`
` Do you plan on writing my will for me?!"`
`"But that is none of your business.`
` Beatrice is mine alone.`
` No matter what other people say,`
` no one can defile our tale. What they say is of no consequence!`
` No matter how Krauss and the others misconstrue it, it will be neither painful nor vexing to me."`
`"...Willard-sama,`
` the Master is not fond of wills.`
` He is not the sort of man who would abandon a task, so that it might be performed after his life ends."`
`"...Probably true.`
` I thought it sounded a bit unlike you."`
`"The ability to struggle on as long as we have life is what makes us human!`
` You think I would give up so soon and leave behind a will? How laughably absurd!"`
`"Yes, that does sound a bit more like you.`
` ...It's not your style to ask someone to write about the past, just because you think your death is drawing near."`
`"...We know how deeply you loved Beatrice-sama.`
` You are the model most worthy of respect that any of us know, and an example for us to follow in every aspect of our lives.`
` Please guide our wandering souls and tell us just how much you loved her, Grandfather.`
` How you were able to live through everything you faced because of her love.`
` ...I only ask for you to guide us by showing us that love's strength..."`
`"You're pretty good at this."`
`"It's your fault for being so tactless."`
`"Boy,`
` what do you know of Beatrice?`
` A truly ignorant person wouldn't even be interested in learning more.`
` The mere fact that you know Beatrice's name shows that you are neither ignorant nor unconnected."`
`"Good point.`
` ...The Beatrice I know of...`
`is the woman you loved, the one you met before the mansion on Rokkenjima was even built.`
` However, she probably departed from this world, leaving behind a daughter.`
` And that's the girl who was raised in Kuwadorian."`
`"...Oho."`
`"Willard-sama,`
` there is no building known as Kuwadorian on Rokkenjima."`
`"...That name, Kuwadorian...`
` ...You mentioned it when we were talking with Aunt Rosa too.`
` ...What in the world does it mean?"`
`"You should have an idea by now.`
` It's the name of the hidden mansion deep in the forest where his mistress's daughter lived."`
`"Interesting.`
` ...So, you actually know the name of Kuwadorian.`
` ...Continue. You have sparked my interest."`
`Kinzo shrugged and grinned...`
`"The one living in Kuwadorian was probably Beatrice's daughter.`
` However, it seems that you, at least, didn't think of her that way."`
`"Oho.`
` ...Then how did I think of her?"`
`"When Ushiromiya Rosa went to Kuwadorian, Beatrice told her a little about herself.`
` ...In that conversation, she referred to you as Kinzo.`
` It was the same when she spoke to you directly.`
` Though she said that she thought of you as a father, she didn't call you Father.`
` ...She either chose not call you that, or she wasn't allowed to call you that.`
` That can only mean one thing."`
`"And what might that be...?"`
`"Reincarnation.`
` You didn't think of your daughter as a child Beatrice left behind.`
` You believed that the dead Beatrice had revived into a new body.`
` ...Genji,`
` once in the past, you spoke in front of Natsuhi and several other family members,`
` stating that there never was a child between Kinzo and Beatrice."`
`"...I have no memory of saying this."`
`Of course, 'this game's Genji' probably wouldn't remember that.`
`However, near the end of the first game, when the survivors had all gathered in Kinzo's study...`
`Genji was asked whether Kinzo and Beatrice ever had a child together, `
`and he denied it, saying 'I have not heard of anything like that'.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"That may have been a lie, but in a way, it was a model answer for one of Kinzo's confidants.`
` ...After all, in Kinzo's eyes, she ~ib~wasn't a daughter~ib~, but Beatrice reborn."`
`"Will...!`
` I don't know what you're talking about, but I will not let you slander the Family Head!"`
`"This isn't slander.`
` It's reasoning.`
` ...However, I understand the heart.`
` In your eyes, Beatrice was the woman you loved most.`
` She remained that way even after death, for all eternity, and without fading in the slightest.`
` I doubt you thought of her as Beatrice reborn at the moment of her birth."`
`"However, it wouldn't be strange if you slowly began to wonder whether that child, `
`whose blue eyes and beautiful blonde hair reminded you of a younger Beatrice,`
` might actually be Beatrice reborn."`
`"......Master,`
` shall I...?"`
`Shall I drag this rude child out?`
` Genji asked Kinzo.`
`For a while, Kinzo hung his head in silence, as though remembering something from his own past.`
`"Your daughter grew to be beautiful, and nearly identical to her mother.`
` You must've been ecstatic.`
` However, I doubt you'd be completely satisfied by that alone.`
` ...After all, though she was Beatrice reborn to you,`
` she didn't think of herself that way."`
`"...How can you know that?"`
`"Whenever she was called Beatrice, she got this feeling she couldn't shake away, a feeling like something was out of place.`
` ...People never feel anything out of place about the name they're given at the time of their birth.`
` However, she did have that feeling.`
` That must mean she was aware that the name Beatrice wasn't hers."`
`In Kuwadorian, she asked both Kinzo and Rosa about who she was.`
`'Who am I?`
` ...Everyone calls me Beatrice.`
` ...And that does indeed seem to be the name of a great witch, as you say.`
`...But that isn't me.`
` I cannot use any magic.`
` ...I simply have the soul of that witch sealed inside my body.'`
`"......Her memory...`
`would have returned eventually.`
` ...She must truly have been Beatrice reborn.`
` ...Her memory was coming back bit by bit.`
` My magical ceremonies were helping her regain her memories one little bit at a time..."`
`"...H-Head-sama..."`
`"There's no need to be surprised.`
` If you line up the information in all the games so far, this is the obvious answer you get.`
` ...The high-level Beatrice talked about this. By metaphor, she said that Kinzo refused to let the witch's soul escape even after death,`
` and instead caught it and locked it up in a body of flesh. She also said that her power and memory had been sealed.`
` If you match that interpretation of hers to this theory, it all makes sense."`
`"......Willard-sama,`
` thanks to powerful magical ceremonies, the Master gained a reborn child of the dead Beatrice-sama.`
` That cannot be denied."`
`"I won't deny the stork.`
` And I don't intend to doubt the depths of Kinzo's love for this woman called Beatrice.`
` ...How a man shows his affection for a child who's the only living reminder of her mother is no one's business.`
` If she grew to look more and more like Beatrice, and Kinzo's love gave rise to a new, special emotion,`
` I find that a very human reaction."`
`"......You think...`
`you can understand my love...?"`
`"I'm not qualified to understand it.`
` However, I'm also not qualified to deny it."`
`"......Oooh, `
`...Beatrice...`
` ...Please, `
`...forgive me..."`
`Kinzo sobbed quietly for a while, wiping away his tears...`
`Because of love, `
`he believed she was Beatrice reborn...`
`and raised her that way.`
`However, somewhere in his heart, `
`...he might have felt pangs of conscience, `
`telling him that he might be forcing his emotions on someone who wasn't really Beatrice.`
`Then, the Beatrice of Kuwadorian had an unexpected guest, Rosa.`
`That woman simply couldn't believe that she was the Beatrice Kinzo desired.`
` She couldn't stand the fact that she didn't understand who she was, and she wanted to escape to the outside world.`
`Then, ......she fell from the cliff...and died.`
`"Genji handled that death, which couldn't become public knowledge, very quietly."`
`"............"`
`"Funerals aren't for the dead.`
` ...They exist so that those who are alive can sever their ties with the dead.`
` ...You could never do that.`
` That's why it festered within you."`
`"...Beatrice...`
`...ooooooooohhhh..."`
`"...G-Grandfather......"`
`"You lost your mistress's daughter...`
`...no, you lost Beatrice twice.`
` Unable to let that sorrow show on the outside, you kept it locked up in your heart,`
` ...and it eventually festered and turned to madness.`
` That's what spurred on your abnormally strong interest in the occult in your later years."`
`"Oooooooooohhhh!!`
` Beatriiiiiiiice, Beatriiiiiiice!!`
` Why?!!`
` Why did you leave me twice?!`
` Your smile,`
` that beautiful hair,`
` those eyes...`
` ...Why did you die in my arms not once `
`but twice?!"`
`"Is that how much...`
`...how much you...`
`...ooooooohhhh, `
`oooooooooooooooooooooooohhhh...oohhh..."`
`By now, Kinzo wasn't even trying to suppress his sobs.`
`He sometimes scratched at his head in anguish.`
`Sometimes faced the heavens like an opera singer.`
`Kinzo yelled over and over again, repeating Beatrice's name...`
`At that moment, there was a quiet sound of a door closing.`
`...When they turned around, she was already there.`
`Kumasawa had appeared.`
`"......If they already know that much,`
` perhaps we can tell them the rest...?"`
`"...Though, if they know that much,`
` I don't believe there is anything more to tell..."`
`"No, we should tell them.`
` As a woman, `
`...I've always thought that the heart of Kuwadorian's Beatrice is a story that should be told.`
` And now, someone has appeared who is worthy to hear it.`
` I believe that now is the time to tell all, without holding back."`
`"........."`
`"Kumasawa-san, do you know something?`
` About Beatrice...?"`
`"Of course she does.`
` ...In the fourth game, we have testimony from the ferryboat captain saying that Kumasawa went in and out of Kuwadorian.`
` I'd be willing to bet that Kumasawa had different work shifts at the mansion and Kuwadorian.`
` There was a young girl to be taken care of.`
` Kumasawa, with her long experience in taking care of children, must have been of immense value."`
`"......That is correct.`
` You might even call me her wet nurse."`
`"No way...`
` ...I can't believe it.`
` ...So, ...everything Will-san is saying is the truth."`
`"...Yes.`
` It is a fact.`
` ...A secret mansion was constructed on the opposite side of the island for Beatrice-sama.`
` Kuwadorian's existence...is truth."`
`"I don't know when Kinzo married his official wife,`
` but at that time, he already had an enormous store of wealth and had bought Rokkenjima whole.`
` He then built two mansions and set up two separate lives."`
`Kinzo's children had also been aware of Kinzo's clandestine eccentricities at the time.`
`It probably hadn't been easy to maintain two separate lives.`
`Moreover, Kinzo's wife had been suspicious and had sniffed around all the time...`
`"The Master stayed in Kuwadorian as much as time allowed.`
` He would sometimes pretend to go on a business trip and stay there for several days,`
` treasuring the time he spent with Beatrice-sama.`
` ...It was not a father-daughter relationship.`
` You could sometimes catch a glimpse of his great love for the dead Beatrice-sama, and it was a heart-warming thing."`
`"The way you say it makes it sound like he sometimes treated her `
`as a substitute for the dead Beatrice."`
`"Oho.`
` If it sounded that way, my apologies.`
` ...Beatrice-sama probably accepted her father's love.`
` However, I will not deny `
`that she was sometimes forced to bear a love she didn't understand."`
`Kumasawa's tone made it sound as though she was scolding Kinzo.`
`As a mother who had raised many kids, Kumasawa had probably spotted that Kinzo's love was sometimes misplaced.`
`However, the more she grew to look like her mother,`
` the more distorted and twisted Kinzo's heart became...`
`Because of his deep love, `
`it grew very, `
`very...`
`...twisted...`
`"......You are right to scold me, my friend.`
` ......I understand.`
` My love is eternal and undying.`
` ...However, I must acknowledge...`
`that I poured that affection `
`onto the wrong person..."`
`"...Grandfather...`
` ...Wait, ...you don't mean..."`
`"Lion-sama,`
` all humans in this world are tied to each other.`
` Even if they do not notice, there is always some sort of tie.`
` Those ties...wrap themselves around people and bring them together."`
`"No way......`
` ......Grandfather......"`
`Just as Kinzo had done, Lion also wiped away tears and stared down at the floor.`
`Apparently, the truth had been too much of a shock for the young Successor to handle...`
`"...Master,`
` the time to speak has arrived, has it not?"`
`"......`
`...I see.`
` So, that time has come, ...my friend."`
`"Unless you tell us,`
` none of the truth will become clear."`
`"......Master,`
` ...I believe they may have the qualifications and the right to know."`
`"I know.`
` Perhaps on this day of my fickle funeral, Beatrice in heaven has given me a chance to atone...`
` ...Forgive me for not telling you this before now."`
`After taking a deep breath, Kinzo finally lowered the hands that had been covering his face...`
`and looked at Will and Lion with those red eyes.`
`"............"`
`"...Grandfather..."`
`"You listen too, Lion.`
` ...Guest.`
` Willard, was it?"`
`"Yeah."`
`"...I thank you for giving me a chance to speak of the truth while I am still able.`
` ...You must surely be a messenger from heaven sent by Beatrice...`
` ...You have my gratitude..."`
`"Beatrice isn't the one you have to thank.`
` It was just a witch.`
` ...Well, I guess they're both witches..."`
`"Hmph, ...I do not care who it was.`
` I have been given a chance.`
` That is enough.`
` Thank you, Willard."`
`Kinzo slowly stood up and held out his right hand.`
`He was offering to shake hands.`
`It must have been Kinzo's way of expressing his gratitude...`
`Will responded.`
`Then, the two hands gripped each other tightly in silence.`
`When they did, ...a bright light poured out from the gap between the two hands.`
`"......Nn-"`
`Will felt as though something the size of a grain had burned itself into his palm.`
`...It was the power that Bernkastel had given him.`
`The light grew brighter and brighter.`
`However, it seemed that Kinzo and the others couldn't see it.`
`"...Now, I will speak.`
` I met Beatrice...`
`Beatrice Castiglioni...just before the end of the war.`
` She came from across the sea..."`
`"............"`
`"...Are you...Kinzo?"`
`"It's how Grandfather looked in the past.`
` I've seen photos.`
` ...Just what on earth..."`
`"It's the theatergoing power that Bernkastel gave me.`
` ...Don't try to understand."`
`"I'll just get a headache?"`
`"You're getting the hang of this."`
`At one time, Genji told Battler that he looked like Kinzo in his youth.`
`Sure enough, though the young Kinzo wasn't exactly the same as Battler, they looked very similar.`
`"...Allow me to introduce myself again.`
` ...I am Ushiromiya Kinzo."`
`"Grandfather..."`
`Even the voice seemed to resemble Battler's somehow.`
`Clearly, Battler had inherited Kinzo's blood more thickly than any other...`
`"I had no desire to succeed the Ushiromiya Family Headship.`
` ...My being chosen as the Head was nothing more than a prank of fate."`
`"...In the Great Kanto Earthquake, those in charge passed away, and you were selected from the branch families."`
`"That's correct.`
` After all, Grandfather was wise despite his youth, and he already possessed a dignity fitting for the Headship."`
`"Fuhahahahahahahaha...`
` Ridiculous.`
` ...Those greedy elders kept looking out for their own personal interests and couldn't decide on a new Head at all.`
` It was as foolish as arguing about who the new captain should be on a sinking ship."`
`"So, since you had no connections with anyone in the main family, you were selected right out of the blue."`
`"It's all because of my toes.`
` If only I'd had one less toe on each foot, my life may have turned out quite differently..."`
`In the Ushiromiya family, polydactyly was seen as a mark of good fortune.`
`After all, many of the great ones in their family history had possessed it.`
`"It was all very pathetic.`
` The elders didn't care whom they dragged in as long as it wouldn't benefit any one of them particularly."`
`"So, they just happened to hear that someone in one of the branch families had six toes,`
` and decided that would do well enough."`
`"Precisely.`
` The elders didn't care what sort of novice became the next Head, `
`as long as they could make him their puppet.`
` In fact, the more this person was ignorant of leadership, the better it would be for them."`
`"...Grandfather..."`
`"Lion,`
` it is quite different in your case.`
` ...You will be the one who inherits everything I have.`
` That is the fate you were granted on the day of your birth.`
` That is why I gave you that silver ring and raised you so strictly.`
` ...You are quite different from me.`
` You are already a splendid Successor, of whom no one could be ashamed..."`
`"...Y-Yes sir..."`
`"A puppet for a Head...`
` ...I doubt that could've been easy."`
`"...Heh, `
`...hehahahahahahahahaha..."`
`As he pondered about where to begin, Kinzo laughed bitterly.`
`It would probably bring back painful memories no matter where he started from...`
`"It...lasted for so long, that span of gray days.`
` That dizzying stretch of time I spent dead, like moss growing on a rock..."`
`I became the rope in the tug of war between the elders, who thought of nothing but their own profit,`
` ...and I probably could have snapped at any moment.`
`However, people are far more resilient than one would think.`
`Though I spent so many days as though I had been killed, ...I was not killed.`
`So, I was forced to search for death on my own...`
`Before I realized it, I had reached an age at which the young would laugh at me if I tried to call myself young.`
`That dizzyingly long stretch of gray was left completely empty.`
`It lasted for a full 20 years.`
`In 20 years, a person can be born, find a purpose, and even become their own man with their own place in the world.`
`In short, ...if one truly becomes a human only when they have become a working adult...`
`Then I spent a period of time long enough to create a human...`
`doing nothing but playing the part of those greedy elders' puppet.`
`Ironically, though that time aged my body, it did not age my mind.`
`My mind alone...`
`was still as young as it had been during those rich, happy days before I was summoned to Odawara.`
`And yet, my body alone grew older and older.`
` Eventually, the vast gap between the two reached almost incomprehensible levels.`
`So, I could hardly believe that the worn-out man in the mirror was really me.`
`No, it really wasn't me.`
`The 'Head of the Ushiromiya family' was just a name.`
`It had no power.`
` It didn't require that I have any independence.`
` There was no need for me to get involved with anything.`
`I was just a doll sitting there on the doll rack, gathering dust.`
`I remember nothing but lazily flipping through Western books I liked, locking myself up inside my own world,`
` ...doing nothing but playing with roses and drinking terrible drinks.`
`And it lasted a full 20 years.`
`Before I knew it...`
`I suddenly had a wife I did not know.`
`...It wasn't any wife I had chosen.`
`It was the daughter of some noble family that the elders had chosen and forced on me for their own reasons,`
` ...but that did not matter to me.`
`I did not love my wife, but neither did I dislike her.`
`...I just didn't care.`
`I fathered a few children, but that wasn't out of love for my wife.`
`They were just born before I knew it.`
`...That's all there was to it.`
`None of it mattered.`
`No, that's not quite right.`
`...Everything was decided by someone other than me, and I simply obeyed.`
`That was the job...`
`of the 'Ushiromiya Family Head'...`
`"Yes. On some level, I did feel as though I was being slowly and quietly killed."`
`"I can't believe it.`
` To think that you, the one who has been praised for being such a bold and wise ruler, lived life like that for so long..."`
`"...Lion,`
` there is nothing so long and faint as a life you do not live for yourself.`
` And yet, it slides on by in the blink of an eye.`
` ...Do not forget this."`
`"A life...you live for yourself..."`
`"Living means having your own will.`
` ...You probably were dead during that time."`
`"Precisely.`
` I wanted to live.`
` No, I wanted to die.`
` ...How can a puppet die?"`
`"......`
`...By cutting...the strings."`
`"Correct.`
` That would be death, and it would also be life, `
`...since it would mean being free."`
`Before I realized it, trouble was brewing in the world.`
`World War II.`
` The Pacific War.`
`Japan had extended their war fronts too far to the East and West, and the tide of war was changing.`
`Thanks to the influence of the elders, I was able to avoid conscription.`
`...Of course, this was not out of compassion for me.`
`It was because I was their precious puppet.`
`So, the war never really felt that close to me.`
`However, when I personally decided to abandon their protection, it was very easy.`
`At that time, the Ushiromiya family had almost completely collapsed,`
` and since the elders had apparently gathered enough of the scraps to last them the rest of their lives,`
` they seemed to care little for what I did, now that they no longer had any use for me.`
`So, I realized that I had finally found my time to die.`
`One by one, `
`I cut the threads I was hanging from, `
`...and began to search for a place to end my life.`
`"So, you searched for death on the battlefield?"`
`"...I thought that if I was going to die anyway, I should try to be of some use to my country.`
` ...No, that's a lie.`
` I probably just lacked the willpower to end my own life.`
` War was a suitable excuse for death."`
`"I heard that Grandfather had knowledge necessary for public works projects and construction, `
`so he was tasked with setting up facilities for the Navy construction team."`
`"Hmph, and what a foolish mistake that was.`
` If only I had just said that I had no useful skills, I could have been sent to the dangerous front lines right away..."`
`"So, you didn't need to go to the front lines?"`
`"Some of the others were overjoyed at their luck.`
` It was the opposite for me.`
` I had only wanted to get drunk on the liquor known as dying for the sake of one's country.`
` ...The US planes did nothing but cut across the skies of that forgotten island.`
` ...They didn't have even a bullet to spare for me, much less a bomb."`
`"Is this the time you met Beatrice, Grandfather...?"`
`"Correct.`
` She came to me from the sea..."`
`"Where did you meet her?`
` You mentioned an island."`
`"Yes. This island.`
` That's where she arrived."`
`"...So, you met here, on Rokkenjima?"`
`"What's going on...?`
` ...I heard that Rokkenjima was uninhabited until you bought it, Grandfather.`
` I never knew there was a Japanese military base here."`
`"Pft, hahahahahahahaha...`
` Ah, yes, you could hardly call that a military base.`
` It was just a cave.`
` I was one of the guards of that cave."`
`1944.`
`Due to the honorable defeats at Saipan and Guam, Japan's Absolute National Defense Zone strategy was in shambles.`
`Where had the gallantry shown at Pearl Harbor gone?`
`The old attackers were now the ones on the defensive.`
`At that time, it was said that the last trump card for the Japanese military was a type of manned torpedo known as the Kaiten.`
`It was said that these ultimate weapons, packed with 1.55 tons of explosives, were capable of sinking any kind of warship with a single blast.`
`To strengthen homeland defense,`
` the Navy drafted a plan to build a string of hidden bases from Hachijo Island to Yokosuka,`
` all to house submarines loaded with Kaiten torpedoes.`
`"I knew that there was a Kaiten base constructed on Hachijo Island,`
` but was there actually one on Rokkenjima too...?"`
`"What fool decided it would be a good idea to plant a base on this desolate island?`
` ...To better preserve its secrecy?`
` Hmph, ridiculous.`
` ...I could never understand what the higher-ups were thinking, and I didn't particularly want to."`
`The Kaiten, which could finish off a large warship with a single strike, truly was an ultimate weapon.`
`It was hoped that the presence of submarines capable of loading these weapons in the waters just off of Japan would allow for a powerful sea ambush as a final line of defense.`
`So, to aid in the establishment of a base with absolute secrecy, the uninhabited island Rokkenjima was raised as a possible candidate.`
`An investigation of the island resulted in the discovery of a large cave in the cliffs,`
` and this was apparently deemed to be a suitable location for a submarine base.`
`"So, you were tasked with aiding in the establishment of that base?"`
`"Establishment?`
` Certainly, if you can call digging out a cave 'establishment'.`
` Not only that, the base was abandoned before its completion."`
`"Why?"`
`"Wahahahahaha!`
` Because at that time, Japan no longer had any submarines large enough to transport a Kaiten torpedo.`
` How truly laughable.`
` What's the point in having a submarine base if there aren't any submarines left?`
` If there's one thing that never changes, it's politicians and their meaningless projects."`
`The base on Hachijo Island was outfitted with Kaiten torpedoes and became a base for direct attacks,`
` but Rokkenjima was never supplied with any.`
`Furthermore, the construction was eventually suspended,`
` and a minimum number of men were stationed on the island, waiting for orders from above that never came.`
`Could the fact that it was a hidden base actually have sealed our fate?`
`The higher-ups had already completely forgotten about this useless and pointless cavern.`
`We were nothing more than guards for a mere cave.`
`We spent our days farming, fishing, and playing with the dirt,`
` all the while gazing up at the American formations flying past.`
`...Some of our group were relieved at the prospects of the war ending before anyone remembered we were here...`
` and before any of us had to face a real battle.`
`Of course, it was the opposite for me.`
`I hoped and hoped for the American troops to advance and kill me as soon as possible.`
`Those days were empty and blank.`
`Let us go back.`
`...Back to the turning point in my life and my fate, `
`...the time that Ushiromiya Kinzo finally became truly alive...`
`"Step it up!!`
` What are you doing, slacking off when the fighting's so close?!"`
`Stars seemed to spin around inside my head.`
`I could just lie down on the floor, but that'd only make him more angry.`
`I've got no intention of being obedient.`
`...Still, it'd be stupid to get myself punched for no reason, so I got up and stood at attention...`
`"............"`
`The fighting's close, is it?`
`You really think the American troops are likely to show up on this forgotten island?`
`Then let them come right now.`
`That's what I've been waiting for all this time.`
`"What's this cowardly look you're wearing?!`
` Is this how afraid you are of death?!`
` Are you so scared of those Americans?!`
` You won't be killin' any of them with an attitude like that!!"`
`"............"`
`I got hit again.`
`...Could you please quit your whining already?`
`Filthy cowards.`
`They let themselves be controlled by this inexplicable anger because it's the only way to distract themselves from their own fear.`
`Heart and spirit aren't of any use when the battle becomes hopeless.`
`When trapped by an insurmountable hopelessness, humans tend to rely on several other emotions to escape their fear.`
`For these young, inexperienced soldiers, anger was a very convenient emotion to fall back upon.`
`Anger is the wine they used to paralyze their fear.`
` It made them chant 'damn the British, damn the Americans' as they swung their bamboo spears around and called it 'drilling'.`
`The more wine you drink, the more you need to drink to get drunk.`
`Their useless anger continued to pile up, day after day, without pause.`
`I...did not fear death.`
`So, I had no need of the wine called anger.`
`This made their cowardice all the more apparent to me.`
`"What's that look on your face?!`
` Ushiromiya, you've lost your nerve down to your very soul!!`
` You're a fish, that's what you are.`
` You've got the eyes of a dead fish!!"`
`However, it went both ways.`
`Just as I was able to spot their cowardice...`
`They were able to pick up on my lethargy.`
`"Is Ushiromiya Kinzo here?!`
` The lieutenant's looking for you!"`
`"Stand up!`
` No slouching about!`
` Double tiiiiime!!"`
`First Lieutenant Yamamoto was the commanding officer in charge of the Rokkenjima garrison.`
`He was just another filthy coward trying to forget his fear with violence,`
` and would often reprimand his subordinates for slacking off at the drop of a hat.`
`Whenever he was in a good mood and started spouting off stories of his life,`
` they were all about how much of a thug he had been, ignoring the rules of society.`
`On and on about how so-and-so was a prick, so he taught him a lesson, or how everyone was so scared of him that he got special treatment.`
`...He kept on talking about what a vile human he was as though it was a badge of honor.`
`Normally, I had nothing to do with this lieutenant who I couldn't respect in any way.`
`He'd always hang around with his non-commissioned subordinates,`
` so as long as I treated him with a snappy salute, I could more or less ignore him for the time being.`
`Now that the construction project on this island has been suspended indefinitely, there's no longer any use for an engineer like me.`
`So, why did the lieutenant ask to see me specifically?`
`At that moment, I couldn't think of anything...`
`"Ah, Ushiromiya!`
` I hear you're good with foreign languages! Is that true?"`
`"I am proficient in both English and Chinese, sir."`
`The lieutenant liked to brag about his education in front of the non-commissioned officers,`
` but he held a bit of a grudge against me for being even more highly educated than him.`
`Since he also felt uncomfortable about having a subordinate who was older than him,`
` I wasn't exactly the type he'd be willing to confide in.`
`Just the fact that I knew several languages must've hurt his pride.`
`"What about Italian?"`
`"I don't speak that."`
`"So, you wouldn't be much help as an interpreter between me and an Italian person, would you?"`
`"It should be possible if they can speak English as well."`
`"...Ah, yes, very true!`
` Have you ever talked with a foreigner in English?!"`
`"I have."`
`Why on earth would he need an interpreter in a cave on an uninhabited island that even our superiors forgot about?`
`His question made it clear that some guest had arrived on Rokkenjima who would need an interpreter.`
`"Good!`
` Ushiromiya, you'll be my interpreter. That's an order!"`
`That evening, I found out exactly what he was talking about.`
`That pointless submarine dock in the cavern that had never been used...`
`was now being approached slowly by a submarine of the Italian Navy.`
`Of course, I knew that the Italians were our allies.`
`However, this was the first time I'd seen anything from their military with my own eyes.`
`"What was the Italian Navy doing here...?`
` Didn't Italy surrender in 1943?`
` What's going on...?"`
`"It was the Kingdom of Italy that surrendered.`
` ...However, those who couldn't accept that surrender joined Mussolini and formed the RSI, so that they could continue fighting."`
`"The RSI?"`
`"The Italian Social Republic.`
` Also known as the Salo Republic."`
`"You know your history.`
` ...The ignorant often call the Italians cowards, saying that they surrendered first of the Axis powers in 1943.`
` That's not true.`
` The military of the Italian Social Republic fought bravely from the outbreak of war until April 29, 1945."`
`"And Berlin fell just three days after that.`
` Far from being cowards, they gave one hell of a fight.`
` ...Still, I'm surprised the RSI Navy even had possession of a submarine that could travel all the way to Japan."`
`"...Even if they did, it's a surprise that they'd come out this far at all.`
` ...Why would they come to Japan?`
` To Rokkenjima?"`
`The submarine was both weather-worn and massive.`
`I doubt anyone had even imagined that a foreign submarine would come all the way out here,`
` ...when we never even had one of our own submarines dock.`
`All of the guards on Rokkenjima, of which there were only about 30, stood at attention as the submarine docked.`
`"...Never seen the Italian military before..."`
`"I heard a mine or some accident trashed their sub."`
`"From what I heard, it sounds like their ventilator broke down and the cabin got packed with chlorine gas."`
`"The Lieutenant was hinting about there being something veeery important in there..."`
`"You mean like a code machine or the blueprints for some new kind of engine?"`
`"I couldn't care less what they're carrying. I'm more surprised that the higher-ups still remember we exist..."`
`"Hurry up, Ushiromiya!!`
` How are you supposed to interpret from over there?!!"`
`"Yes, sir..."`
`On top of the hatch was a young Italian saluting us.`
`...Normally, this should have been the job of a commissioned officer, but his clothes looked like those of a sailor,`
` and it really didn't look like he had the dignity and composure of a ship's captain.`
`That probably meant that all of the commissioned officers in charge had died in the accident that had befallen this sub.`
`Crew members crawled out of the hatch one by one, but they all looked pale and entirely worn out.`
`I'm not sure how long ago the accident happened,`
` but being crammed together in a tiny sub filled with chlorine gas for any amount of time can't be good for your health.`
`Not only had the ventilators broken, but traveling about carelessly on the surface of the waters around Japan these days would be foolish in the extreme.`
`...It had been like a trip inside a can of poison gas.`
`Almost all of them were unable to walk without leaning on someone else.`
` It looked like a bunch of people staggering out of a hospital boat.`
`"Ushiromiya!`
` Ask them who the captain is!`
` Tell them that I'm in charge of this island!"`
`"<...Welcome to Japan.`
` Do any of you speak English?>"`
`The crew members seemed to understand that I was speaking English, but it looked as though none of them could speak it.`
`Eventually, someone who seemed to be dressed as an officer saluted.`
`"<Welcome to Japan.`
` Are you the captain?>"`
`"<I cannot speak English>...`
` <Please, wait.>"`
`The officer answered in slow, laborious English.`
`...After asking us to wait, he shouted something to his subordinates in rapid Italian.`
`It looked as though he was telling them to get someone among them who could speak English.`
`"Ushiromiya, what're they talking about?!"`
`"They've asked us to wait.`
` They might be looking for someone there who can speak English."`
`At that moment, I heard a high-pitched cough.`
`It wasn't a man's cough.`
` ...It was a woman's.`
`"<I speak English.>"`
`As she came down from the hatch, ...a woman with beautiful golden hair said this in English.`
`In this filthy cavern, `
`the appearance of one as beautiful as she was seemed like an angel descending upon us...`
`"<Welcome to Japan.`
` Is the captain there?>"`
`"<The captain is dead.`
` That man over there is the only officer left.>"`
`"<My condolences.`
` Can we do anything to assist you?>"`
`"<We'd like some fresh air and water.`
` Some of us are still having trouble breathing.`
` And we'd like a place to rest.>"`
`"<We would be happy to help.`
` Do any of the others understand English?>"`
`"<The ones who did are all dead.`
` I'm the only one left.>"`
`"Ushiromiya! What's that woman talking about?!`
` Who's the captain? That man from a second ago?!`
` Who is that woman?! Get translating already goddammit!!"`
`The lieutenant has been yelling like that for a while now.`
`...He must've been surprised to see such a beautiful woman appear from a submarine...`
`and more than a little annoyed to see all of her attention focused on me alone.`
`It was a mark...of how divinely beautiful she was.`
`"Sir, `
`it seems that she's the only one who understands English.`
` She will act as their interpreter.`
` Their captain is dead.`
` That officer seems to be acting in his place."`
`"<Who's that loud man who keeps yelling at you?`
` Don't tell me he's your superior.>"`
`"<Unfortunately, he is.`
` He probably doesn't like seeing me have such a beautiful lady all to myself.>"`
`"<Oh?`
` I didn't expect flattery from an Asian.`
` Your English is superb.`
` I imagine you've been brought up very well.`
` Unlike that rude man who keeps on shouting.`
` They should've made you the officer in charge around here.>"`
`"<Oh?`
` And I never expected flattery from a Westerner.>"`
`"<*giggle*!`
` You're an interesting man.`
` What's your name?>"`
`"<Ushiromiya...Kinzo.`
` If you don't mind, may I ask for your name as well?>"`
`"<Beatrice Castiglioni.>"`
`"<Welcome, Beatrice.`
` Welcome to Japan.>"`
`That was when I first met Beatrice, the woman who would capture my heart for the rest of my life...`
`"...So, Beatrice was an Italian."`
`"Yes.`
` She was the daughter of a high-ranking RSI official.`
` Apparently, their most important cargo was her father himself.`
` ...Sadly, he had already died by the time they reached Rokkenjima."`
`"Why would a high official like that come to Japan?`
` You're saying he went through the Suez Canal and crossed the Indian Ocean to come all the way here?"`
`"That's a good point.`
` If they wanted to reach one of their allies, Germany should have been much closer.`
` ...So, why would they make the long trip to Japan?"`
`"......It may have been part of some grand, outrageous strategy.`
` ...I don't know all the details, `
`but shortly after, I learned that this submarine's mission was far from a minor one..."`
`They said that there had been about 60 of them at the time of their departure.`
`However, only about 10 of them, including Beatrice, had survived.`
`Their submarine had apparently hit a mine or something in the nearby waters and sustained a great deal of damage.`
`They told us that it had flooded rapidly with water, which had taken out the batteries and released a large amount of chlorine gas.`
`Their sub had become completely incapable of continuing further,`
` nothing but a massive lump of metal floating by the dock.`
`Since the sub seemed to be carrying 'something of immense value',`
` the higher-ups ordered us to investigate.`
`After questioning the Italians, with Beatrice and me acting as double interpreters,`
` we concluded that this thing of immense value must have been her father himself.`
`Apparently, Beatrice's father was extremely high up in the RSI hierarchy, `
`and it was thought that he might have worked alongside Mussolini himself.`
`Though their massive voyage had apparently been part of some top-secret mission, `
`now that the man himself and all of the commissioned officers had died, their reason for coming to Japan remained a mystery.`
`And, our higher-ups were telling us to investigate, which meant that even they didn't know what it was.`
`Their ship had broken down, their mission was unknown, and the high official they had been carrying was dead.`
`And even the Japanese government didn't know why they were here.`
`...The Italians' great and perilous voyage...`
`had come to a meaningless and utterly fruitless end...`
`"<That's a relief.`
` I always assumed the seas of Japan would smell like soy sauce.>"`
`"<What a coincidence.`
` I've always thought Italians had hair made of pasta.>"`
`"<Of course we do.`
` You don't know how hard it is to get that perfect al dente texture.`
` I imagine you Japanese all wear spaghetti al nero?>"`
`"<I see you've done your homework.`
` In Japan, we use squid ink instead of shampoo.>"`
`"<Kyahaha!`
` You really are amazing, Kinzo.`
` It seems you know everything!`
` Have you ever been to Italy?>"`
`"<Never.`
` I have read a lot of books though.>"`
`"<An Asian man reading Italian books?!`
` Wow, what kinds of books?>"`
`"<Niccolo Machiavelli.`
` And Dante Alighieri.`
` So I know, of course, that you're the eternal lady.>"`
`"<Oh, what a surprise...`
` You must be quite the bookworm.`
` Does this mean you came from some Japanese noble family?>"`
`"<......Who knows?>"`
`"<You're completely different from those other savage-looking Japanese soldiers.`
` I can tell!`
` You must've come from a noble family.`
` Are the Ushiromiyas some sort of Japanese aristocrats?>"`
`"<...Of course not.`
` They just managed to strike it rich in the spinning industry in recent generations.`
` I didn't study all that as part of some noble's hobby.`
` ...I just did it because I wasn't allowed to do anything except read, `
`play around with roses, `
`and get myself drunk.>"`
`There had been no trace of malice in Beatrice's words.`
`It had just been a curious question asked to a friend from a faraway country.`
`However, ...Beatrice was from a noble family herself, so she could tell.`
`...She could see the faint gloomy look on Kinzo's face.`
`"<Forgive me, Kinzo.`
` I didn't stop to consider why a high-class person like you `
`would choose to take the position of a common soldier.>"`
`"<I...don't give a damn about my family line.`
` When I die, the name Ushiromiya will have no hold on me.`
` Then, I'll finally be free.>"`
`"<......So, you joined the army because you wanted to die?`
` You mustn't do that.`
` Your family would be so sad.>"`
`"<Family?`
` ...I have no family.>"`
`I have a wife for the sake of public appearances...and children.`
`However, I've never wanted any of them.`
`...Everything, everything...is a fleeting daydream created by those selfish, greedy elders.`
`...So, at least while I'm on this island, I can forget about all of that...and find some peace.`
`Peace...?`
`But haven't I spent each and every day complaining that I wasn't sent to the front and haven't managed to die yet...?`
`"<...I can't understand the pain you're going through, but I do realize that my thoughtless words have hurt you.`
` Forgive me, Kinzo.>"`
`Forgive me, Kinzo.`
`Yes, those words are probably what did it.`
`All of the Japanese called me Ushiromiya.`
`...It reminded me that I was the property of the Ushiromiya family every time they talked to me.`
`But she was different.`
`She...called me Kinzo.`
` Not Ushiromiya.`
`So maybe, ...just for the time I chat with her like this, `
`...I can forget that cursed family.`
`"<......Kinzo.>"`
`I hadn't meant to make Beatrice feel guilty,`
` but she seemed certain that her thoughtless words had hurt me.`
`"<Thank you.>"`
`"<Huh?>"`
`"<Since you always call me Kinzo, I finally feel like I'm my own man.`
` ...I think...that I've finally met a person who truly sees me for who I am.>"`
`"<Kinzo,`
` you may be a foreigner I met in a distant land,`
` ...but I can tell that your heart is sensitive and beautiful.`
` If we had grown up in the same neighborhood, I'm sure we would've become fast friends.`
` ...I'm happy too.`
` You always call me Beatrice.`
` Not 'the daughter of the Castiglioni family'.>"`
`We were both in the same position.`
`Her Castiglioni family must have been a rigid place as well.`
`...Though we came from different countries, we had finally found something that we both understood.`
`"<Do you have a nickname that people close to you use?>"`
`"<No.`
` They usually just called me Kinzo.>"`
`"<Well then, you should stop calling me Beatrice.`
` All of my close friends used to call me Bice.`
` I'd like you to call me that too.>"`
`"<Very well.`
` From this point onwards, allow me to call you Bice as a sign of our friendship.>"`
`"<Ah, come on.`
` Don't be all stiff like that.`
` We're already friends, okay?>"`
`A bright smile stretched across Beatrice's face...`
`"No matter how many decades pass, `
`...that smile will never fade from my memory..."`
`"...So, by meeting Beatrice, you managed to regain your sense of self."`
`"Or, as most people would put it, he cheated on his wife.`
` ...Nggyaaaahh, ggrrrrkkk..."`
`"If you plan to continue being rude, I suggest you get in the habit of covering your butt."`
`After having his butt pinched once more, Will hopped around in pathetic agony...`
`"So in your eyes, Grandfather,`
` Rokkenjima was always special because you first met Beatrice here."`
`"...Indeed.`
` ...If I had never come to this island, I would never have met her. It truly is an island of miracles..."`
`"Is there anything left of that submarine base today?"`
`"Yes, it's still there, near Kuwadorian.`
` It's in the shadows of a cove that can't be seen from the outside.`
` After all, fishermen never approach this supposedly ill-omened island.`
` It's unlikely that anyone besides me still knows of its existence."`
`"Is the two-kilometer-long underground passage between Kuwadorian and the mansion a remnant of that base?"`
`"That is correct.`
` There was some nonsense about fortifying several locations across the island and connecting them with tunnels carved out of limestone caverns.`
` I made use of that underground passage and built two mansions, `
`one at each end of the island."`
`"Two mansions, two families.`
` ...The Ushiromiya family mansion...and a mansion for the Kinzo released from the shackles of the family."`
`"......Correct.`
` ...It was something I needed.`
` ...Another place for me to escape from the cursed name of Ushiromiya."`
`"............"`
`"<Still, I do feel bad for you.`
` It must be awful to have come all the way out here and be unable to fulfill your mission.>"`
`"<I don't really know what Papa's plan was.`
` He said we needed to run far away to hide 'it' until the time came.>"`
`"<And what is 'it'?>"`
`"<I don't know.`
` ...'It' was something very important, `
`and he planned to hide it for many years until the right moment.`
` Oh, and he planned to hide himself along with it.`
` I know because he apologized to me for sending us to live a long time on foreign soil.>"`
`"<Didn't that second lieutenant of yours say that you had no cargo in particular,`
` and that you were transporting your father instead?>"`
`"<Lieutenant Angelo doesn't trust you or the others.`
` Even I know a few things he's kept hidden from you.`
` ...He might even know what Papa's goal was...and what the cargo is.>"`
`"<Whatever it is, that's a mission for the Italian military.`
` It has nothing to do with us.`
` After all, we're allies.`
` We should be able to trust each other.>"`
`"<I have no doubts that you're a good person, Kinzo.`
` I even told Lieutenant Angelo that you're a man we can trust, but...`
` ...Why is it that men always get so rigid and uptight when they're in a strange land?`
` Normally, they're all very bright and cheery people.`
` Ever since we came here, there's been this strange feeling of tension.`
` ...Lieutenant Angelo has ordered that his subordinates be armed at all times.`
` It's almost as though we're in enemy territory.>"`
`That was true.`
`The Italians were clearly the very opposite of relaxed.`
`The Japanese soldiers, watching this, began to suspect that the Italians didn't really trust them at all.`
`"<That's normal for a soldier.`
` This is precisely the time for them to straighten up their guard, so they don't embarrass themselves in front of a friendly army.>"`
`"<They have a person stand watch every time they sleep,`
` and they're still keeping a lookout to make sure none of you approach the submarine, even though it's nothing more than an unusable scrap heap now.`
` It almost feels as though they're clearly prejudiced against the Japanese, and that bothers me.>"`
`True, they had set up a constant sentry by the submarine and had refused to let any of the Japanese soldiers come near.`
`This hadn't made the Japanese particularly happy.`
`...However, submarines are treated as classified in all countries.`
`Maybe it was just natural for them to stop foreigners from approaching it without reason.`
`"<They're probably uncomfortable with being made to live in a way they aren't used to.`
` ...The boat that's supposed to take you back to the mainland is still being delayed by weather and problems up the command chain.`
` Just how long will it take before they can send you there...>"`
`We had been told that a boat was being sent for them directly from the mainland,`
` but apparently, thanks to the weather, problems up the command chain, and the recent air raids,`
` they had no ships they could spare on a forgotten island like this.`
`There may have been political issues as well.`
`...After all, the Italians' homeland had already surrendered to the Allies.`
`...I didn't know the details.`
`The only thing I knew for sure was that they'd been stuck on Rokkenjima for two whole weeks, and no one had come to get them.`
`Of course, we had some small boats on Rokkenjima.`
`There was nothing physically stopping us from taking them to a nearby island.`
`Still, Rokkenjima was technically a top-secret base, and contact with the outside world had been strictly forbidden...`
`"<Well, there's nothing we can do about it, and it isn't all that bad, really.`
` After all, if a boat did come for us, I'd probably never see you again, Kinzo.>"`
`"<...True.>"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`To me, those two weeks...were the first I'd ever truly lived.`
`The faint 20 years before all seemed to vanish in the sparkle of that pair of weeks.`
`...I realized that she'd have to leave this place eventually.`
`And yet, this single moment felt so rich and dazzling......`
`that I felt myself wishing it could last forever...`
`Then, I heard a voice calling for Beatrice in Italian.`
`"<...It's Lieutenant Angelo.`
` Looks like he wants you for something.>"`
`"<Probably to scold me.`
` These days, he keeps yapping on about how I shouldn't get too friendly with the Japanese soldiers.>"`
`The second lieutenant approached, saluting Kinzo,`
` and after glancing at Beatrice as though asking her to translate something, he began to speak in Italian.`
`Judging by his tone, it sounded like something serious.`
`"<...Lieutenant Angelo has something very important to say, so he wants to talk with your commanding officer.`
` ...He wants your help with something.`
` I don't know what.>"`
`"<Something important...?`
` Got it.`
` I'll go find Lieutenant Yamamoto.>"`
`Lieutenant Angelo had two of his subordinates with him and wore a stern expression on his face.`
`They didn't have to say anything...for us to realize that this had to be something very serious...`
`"That's it!!`
` Lift it up!!"`
`The winch creaked and the thick chains rang out with a dull clang.`
`Very, very slowly, ...'it' was lifted up out of the submarine's cargo hold.`
`"...Now I get it!`
` ...So this is why those Italians didn't want us near their sub...!"`
`The first lieutenant and the others looked up at what the winch was slowly lifting up,`
` ...all of them wearing unpleasant, forced smiles...`
`"<......Unbelievable...`
` ...So this is what Papa brought all this way...?>"`
`"<...I-Incredible...`
` ...I've never seen anything like this...>"`
`It was...a mountain of gold ingots.`
`Those carefully-piled bars were being slowly lifted out of the cargo hold, one group after another...`
`This gold had been their true cargo.`
`I don't know where they were planning to take it.`
`They might've been trying to sneak it into Japan, one of their allies,`
` ...or they might've been on their way to hide it in some remote area.`
`Was it some sort of strategy?`
` A conspiracy? Embezzlement?`
` Top-secret transportation of wealth?`
`This incomprehensible amount of gold led to all sorts of dark suspicions, but we didn't know anything about the truth.`
`All told, the gold weighed an incredible 10 tons.`
`That was the only truth we could wrap our minds around at the moment...`
`They had strongly resisted showing this to us.`
`However, the submarine could no longer make sea, and it was apparently continuing to take in water bit by bit.`
`Rokkenjima had been outfitted in an extremely slipshod way, so we had no means of repairing it.`
`Also, though we could unload the sub, there was no way we'd be able to lift it up again once it had filled with water and sunk to the bottom.`
`Now that transporting the gold away had clearly become an impossible goal,`
` ...they had apparently decided on unloading it.`
`Of course, they made no effort to explain the reason behind all this gold.`
`They just asked us to help them take it out...`
`"<Why would they take so much gold out of the country...?`
` Couldn't they have changed the course of the war with this much wealth...?>"`
`"<...Weapons change the course of war,`
` but after the war, they aren't useful for anything.`
` ...Money can also change the course,`
` but it remains just as valuable after the war.>"`
`There's no longer any way to change the course of this war.`
`The Axis powers will probably all surrender, leading to an Allied victory.`
`Anyone could tell that simply by looking at the American planes flying across the sky day after day.`
`However, gold does not lose its value after war.`
`Everyone stared upwards, dumbfounded,`
` ...as the winch slowly lifted the dully sparkling gold...`
`"Lieutenant Yamamoto,`
` the Italians don't want us to tell the mainland about this gold."`
`"...Heheh.`
` So, they don't want our country to snatch it away from them."`
`"<What did he say?>"`
`"<He's saying your group probably doesn't want it reported...because you fear that Japan will steal it away from you.>"`
`"<Lieutenant Angelo is actually more afraid of Italy itself finding out.`
` To us, our homeland's current government is a mere puppet set up by the Allied Forces.`
` If they find out, the gold will be returned to them.`
` However, that would be the same as handing the gold over to our enemies.>"`
`They'd come all this way to make sure that the gold didn't fall into enemy hands.`
`They needed to hide it from that puppet government until their homeland could be truly restored...`
`"Ushiromiya,`
` make a proposal to the Italians.`
` Tell them that we wish to offer our assistance."`
`"What sort of assistance...?"`
`"Let's see if I've got this straight.`
` They want that gold kept secret, so their homeland doesn't find out about it.`
` But they'll need to find at least a transport ship if they plan to carry it off this island.`
` If they try that though, the mainland will hear about it, which means the Italian government will too."`
`"That's right.`
` ...In other words, there's no longer any way to take that gold off Rokkenjima."`
`Their mission must have been to hide the gold in absolute secrecy until the day of their homeland's restoration.`
`Later on, several plausible rumors would circulate about how Nazi Germany also moved much of its secret wealth to certain hidden areas in South America just prior to its collapse.`
` It was a very natural conclusion to reach.`
`That submarine was their only method of transporting the gold in secrecy, and it's become completely useless.`
` They can't fully stop the water from seeping in, and it'll probably sink completely before much longer.`
`There's no longer any way for them to transport the gold in secrecy.`
`In other words, their mission has ended in failure here in the Far East.`
`So, just how is Lieutenant Yamamoto proposing that we assist them...?`
`"The Rokkenjima base is top-secret, and no one knows about it.`
` The islanders in the surrounding area think this island's ill-omened and deserted, so they never come near it.`
` ...Catch my drift, Ushiromiya?"`
`"<What did he say?>"`
`"<As we told you earlier, no one knows about this base.`
` And, as you can see, it's of no use strategically, so the higher-ups have already forgotten about it.`
` ...It sounds like Lieutenant Yamamoto's suggesting that you hide the gold on this island.>"`
`Beatrice quickly translated this and told Lieutenant Angelo.`
`He began discussing something rapidly with his subordinates.`
`They didn't look happy.`
`Japan may have been their ally, but they probably didn't want to leave the gold for reconstructing their motherland in Asian hands.`
`Still, it was hard to imagine any other option for them.`
`"<...It's a fierce debate.`
` Some say that there's no other option, while others think we should remain loyal to our homeland no matter the cost.`
` ...Lieutenant Angelo is stuck between a rock and a hard place.>"`
`The final order given to them by their fallen homeland was to hide the gold.`
`However, by now, there was no way for that order to be carried out successfully.`
`If the mainland or their own homeland found out, the gold would probably be confiscated by the wrong people, from their point of view.`
`If they really wanted to carry out their homeland's orders faithfully,`
` ...Lieutenant Yamamoto's proposal was extremely reasonable...`
`Though he couldn't understand their words, he seemed to realize how divided they were.`
`"Heheheh, if we help out, we'll be able to hide the gold in total secrecy.`
` Fortunately, there's an abandoned tunnel that stretches all the way across this island."`
`"<...He's saying that, if you hide the gold underground and bury it on this island, no one will be able to find it.>"`
`"<Our side is saying that it sounds like a realistic proposal.`
` ...However, there seems to be some resistance to accepting Japanese help.>"`
`"...It seems they're having difficulty coming to a decision."`
`"Heheh.`
` Do you really have a choice, Italians?`
` You don't think you can hide that gold without our help, do you?`
` And I doubt you want to leave it lying around on the beach for much longer."`
`"<Lieutenant Angelo wants to minimize the number of people who know about the gold.`
` ...He doesn't trust the Japanese, but it looks like he's decided that Lieutenant Yamamoto's plan is the best possible option.`
` But...he seems suspicious.>"`
`"<About what?>"`
`"<He's wondering whether they really intend to move a full 10 tons of gold and swear themselves to secrecy... without any sort of compensation...>"`
`"50%."`
`"...Sir, you can't be-"`
`"Hand over half of the gold to us.`
` With that as our work wages, we'll hide the other half nice and safe for them."`
`"<...H-He's telling you to give us half of it.>"`
`The instant Beatrice translated that sentence, Lieutenant Angelo slammed his hands on the desk and stood up.`
`Instead of flinching, Lieutenant Yamamoto, true to his boasts of once being a thug who everyone feared, `
`actually looked even more relaxed and confident than he had previously.`
`"After all, they really don't have the option of refusing.`
` We could demand 80% if we wanted.`
` I've lowered that to 50% as a sign of good faith.`
` ...Of course, we aren't the only ones with leverage here.`
` If the Italians decide to leak this to the outside, all of the gold will probably be taken by Japan or Italy.`
` We won't get even a single yen out of it.`
` This can only work if we're both partners in crime here."`
`"<He's saying we should all be partners in the crime of embezzlement.`
` ...By now, he's already moved on to speaking as an individual, not as a soldier...>"`
`"<I don't believe it...`
` So, the gold has blinded him...>"`
`Lieutenant Yamamoto was grinning.`
`It really did look as though he had been blinded by greed, just as Beatrice said...`
`"If they leave it just piled up where it is, you can be sure that it'll be noticed when the boat comes for them from the mainland.`
` If that happens, none of us will profit.`
` They ought to accept our proposal and hide the gold as soon as possible."`
`"<...It sounds like Lieutenant Angelo is dead set on the Japanese and Italian governments not finding out about this.`
` He wants to carry out his duty until the end.>"`
`"<So, what exactly does that mean?>"`
`"<He wants the gold buried deep within the island, even if he has to pay some percentage to buy your silence.`
` ...Of course, some of his subordinates object strongly.`
` They're saying that 50% is out of the question.>"`
`"Ushiromiya,`
` how are they doing?"`
`"......They also don't want any more people laying eyes on the gold.`
` ...However, they seem to object to the portions."`
`"<Lieutenant Angelo says they'll consider 10%.`
` ...Though he's also saying that he's fairly sure Lieutenant Yamamoto won't accept that.>"`
`"Ushiromiya,`
` what's the Italians' answer?"`
`"...They say they'll consider 10%."`
`This time, it was Lieutenant Yamamoto who slammed down on the desk.`
`But the Italians didn't flinch either.`
`...An incredible tension filled the small room...`
`However, despite his violent outburst a second ago, Lieutenant Yamamoto's expression still looked smug and in control.`
`He was probably confident that he now had the initiative.`
`"10%!`
` Now there's a modest proposal.`
` ...Okay, sure, I'll give up 10%.`
` We'll split it 40/60.`
` Tell them I won't go any lower than that!"`
`40% for the Japanese.`
`60% for the Italians.`
`The lieutenant was talking tough,`
` but in truth, these negotiations weren't being made on an equal footing.`
`If the Italians had just wanted the gold for themselves, there wouldn't have been much of a problem.`
`But what if...`
` What if they were true patriots...`
`and decided to return the gold for the purpose of reconstruction, even to the defeated puppet government of their homeland?`
`If so, they would probably report the existence of the gold to the Italian embassy.`
`Eventually, the Italian government would petition the Allied nations for the retrieval of their gold.`
`...It probably wouldn't all make it back to Italy, but it might be used effectively to repair and rebuild their battered towns.`
`If that happened, Lieutenant Yamamoto and his friends would only be able to sneak out a few ingots at most.`
`He was greedily planning to make this his own treasure island, so that he and his subordinates could have an enormous fortune all to themselves.`
`...If he wanted to succeed, the Italians would have to keep the presence of the gold quiet.`
`"<But there's one thing I don't get.`
` ...If Lieutenant Angelo doesn't want to let anyone have the gold, he could've just let the submarine sink.`
` Why did he have it unloaded?>"`
`"<...I'd rather not think about it,`
` ...but Lieutenant Angelo might have started planning to embezzle the gold as soon as he realized that their mission would be impossible to complete.`
` Right now, he's asking his subordinates for their opinions `
`both as soldiers and as individuals with families waiting for them back home.`
` ...The more straight-laced soldiers are furious.>"`
`The discussion between the Italians was becoming fierce and emotional.`
`Though their homeland had fallen, they had come all this way in accordance with its orders.`
`They had probably been given this mission because they were particularly faithful and duty-minded troops.`
`It seemed they couldn't just agree to a foreigner's proposal to embezzle and split up the gold...`
`Lieutenant Angelo looked like he was doing all he could to calm the unexpectedly fervent rage of his subordinates.`
`...Looks like the gold is blinding them too.`
`Everyone's mixing up their true feelings with how they want to be seen, and they can't make up their minds...`
`"How's their answer coming?!`
` Ushiromiya!!"`
`"<...Bice,`
` Lieutenant Yamamoto's asking for an answer.>"`
`"<...They're saying they want some time to think.`
` I had you to talk to, so I was able to distract myself from our current situation, but that wasn't true for the rest of them.`
` ...They lost a lot of comrades at the end of a very long journey, and now they're here, and in a tight spot.`
` They've even lost their mission, the one thing they could depend on to guide them.`
` They don't know what to do...>"`
`"Sir,`
` ...they say they'd like some time."`
`"Heheh, sure, let 'em talk it over all they want.`
` But they'd better not take too long.`
` If we're gonna hide the gold, that'll take time and effort.`
` ...Make your decision before noon tomorrow.`
` That's all, Italians!"`
`"<...He's giving you until noon tomorrow.`
` ...That bastard, he's practically threatening you.>"`
`"<Lieutenant Angelo says he'll ask for everyone's thoughts on the matter...>"`
`"<Which way do you think they'll go?>"`
`"<It'll probably be tough going.`
` ...It seems Lieutenant Angelo is willing to consider splitting it,`
` but his subordinates and the others will probably oppose that.`
` ...All of them have lost close friends on their voyage to the Far East.`
` They're firm in their desire to do their duty for our homeland.>"`
`"<...Will they refuse Lieutenant Yamamoto's proposal?>"`
`"<Even if they do, the gold will just fall into someone else's hands.`
` ...If nothing is going to be left anyway, Lieutenant Angelo suggests that they each sneak at least one ingot back with them, and some of the others seem to agree, but...`
` Men always get carried away at times like this.`
` Even I can't guess what they'll do...>"`
`"...I imagine the Italians had some complicated feelings about all this."`
`"In their eyes, the Italy that surrendered was probably little better than an enemy country.`
` Letting the gold go back there would make their entire voyage meaningless."`
`"However, `
`embezzling and divvying up the gold would also make their whole voyage meaningless..."`
`"The country they felt obligated to serve had already fallen.`
` That alone destroyed the significance of their journey.`
` Not a happy story for them."`
`"...If it's bound to be meaningless anyway,`
` wouldn't keeping hold of even just a few ingots be better than nothing?"`
`"Sure, if you want to calculate straight-up profit and loss.`
` ......But men aren't like that."`
`The Italians were gathered in a cramped room, arguing fiercely.`
`'I don't like it!`
` We must remain true to our soldier spirit until the end, for the sake of our fallen comrades!'`
`'And how do you define 'remaining true'?`
` By hiding the gold on this island?`
` By accepting the proposal of those Asians?!'`
`'We can't trust them!`
` Especially that Yamamoto person!`
` We mustn't let our guards down!'`
`'Unloading the gold and letting the Japanese see it was a huge mistake!`
` We should've let it sink with the sub!'`
`'Oh, wonderful idea, let's just sink it right inside a Japanese base!`
` It would've been pulled up eventually.`
` That wouldn't hide anything!'`
`'It doesn't matter. There's no way to get the gold off this island without anyone knowing.'`
`'If we had just taken the honorable path and scuttled the sub, none of this would've happened...!!'`
`'If we had known then that the sub would be broken beyond repair...'`
`'Why did the lieutenant commander contact the Japanese military and ask for help?`
` How was he planning to carry out our mission if they found out about the gold?'`
`'Our mission was a failure from the moment he asked them for help!'`
`'All of us have families waiting for us back home.`
` And we've more than done our part, I'd say, voyaging all the way to this island country in the Far East.`
` You might call this fair and just payment for our services.'`
`'*chatter*chatter*!`
` *chatter*chatter*chatter*!!'`
`'Lieutenant Angelo,`
` ...if the Japanese prove to be less than amicable, we need to be prepared to take extreme measures.'`
`'...And what do you mean by extreme measures, Corporal?'`
`Someone gulped.`
`A stiff tension hung over the room...`
`'The Japanese here are pushovers.`
` They're all cowards with no battle experience.'`
`'And we're the elite.`
` We know the layout of almost the entire base, along with the number of Japanese troops and how they're arranged.`
` If Lieutenant Angelo gives the order, we should be able to subdue them quickly.'`
`'Only a few of them, Yamamoto included, look like fighters.`
` The rest are just laborers attached to the military.`
` It may look like they have the advantage of numbers, but we have the greater military force.'`
`'If we kill the Japanese, what exactly are we gonna say when the boat comes to pick us up?`
` You really think that'll work?!'`
`'There should be plenty of ways to work it, as long as the corpses aren't found.'`
`'Lieutenant Angelo,`
` ...it'll be easy to subdue this base.`
` If we kill Yamamoto and the few strong fighters, the laborers will probably surrender easily.'`
`'Let's have them carry the gold and bury it.`
` ...Of course, we'll have to silence them afterwards.'`
`'Are you suggesting we massacre all of them...?'`
`'Let's do it.`
` If we kill them all, no one will know about the gold.'`
`At that moment, the supposedly locked door opened slightly,`
` and a metal object was thrown in.`
`"Granata!!!"`
`As the yell rang out, the table was kicked over to be used as a shield, and they all dropped to the floor.`
`However, in this cramped room, it probably wouldn't do them any good.`
` The Italians were all prepared for death.`
`'......?'`
`'A dud! It's a dud!!'`
`Fortunately, the shoddy grenade was a dud.`
`The door was slammed open, and three Japanese soldiers wielding pistols jumped in.`
`"Dammit, it's a dud!!`
` Kill the Italians, kill the Italians!!"`
`'Return fire!! Fire at will!!'`
`In this small room, no matter who shot where, it was bound to hit someone.`
`The exchange of bullets instantly caused a rain of blood, with casualties on both sides.`
`The three who had jumped in were covered with bullet holes and fell over, moaning and thrashing...`
`'Gggghgggghghgh...`
`gghh...`
`*cough*...`
`*cough*...'`
`'Gino!! Gino!!`
` Damn, they got his lung, we can't save him!!'`
`'We should consider ourselves lucky!`
` If that grenade had gone off, we'd all be dead!'`
`The grenade was still rolling about on the floor...`
`It had been a surprise attack.`
` ...Lieutenant Yamamoto had probably judged that the negotiations wouldn't go his way and had decided to make the first move.`
`Or, maybe he'd been planning from the beginning to put them in a position where they'd be gathered in one place to discuss his offer.`
`Rokkenjima was their island.`
` If they killed all the Italians, then not half, but all of the gold would go to the Japanese.`
`There was a chance the grenade might go off late.`
` The Italians rushed out into the corridor.`
`They heard gunfire from down the hallway.`
` It was coming from the direction of the submarine dock.`
` Clearly, the troops guarding the pile of gold were being attacked.`
`'Lieutenant Angelo!! What are your orders?!!'`
`'We have no choice!!`
` Kill the Japanese!!'`
`"L-Lieutenant!`
` These guys are good.`
` Those Italians aren't your ordinary sailors!"`
`"Heheh, I see. They needed men good enough to guard that gold, after all.`
` We have the numbers.`
` Keep your cool, surround them, and kill them!! Let's hunt some Italians!!"`
`As soon as I heard the sound of repeated gunfire, I knew.`
`I knew that something, which had been smoldering since the time the gold was unloaded, had finally burst.`
`The eyes of our soldiers looking at that gold hadn't been normal.`
` Yes, those eyes had been entranced by demons.`
`The Italians had been pushed to the limits by the heavy burden they bore.`
`Who wouldn't have snapped after being trapped in a distant land, where you can't understand the language or the writing?`
`Thinking I had to do something, I ran towards the sound of gunfire.`
`...Looking back on it, that was an extremely stupid thing to do.`
`That sound meant that there were people shooting at each other.`
` People killing each other.`
`And yet, unarmed as I was, I dashed towards the sound, as though I was trying to mediate some schoolyard fight.`
` ...It didn't take long before I learned how foolish and naive that was in the heat of battle.`
`"...H-Hiraoka?!"`
`Warrant Officer Hiraoka was lying face down, his entire body drenched in blood.`
`Judging by the trail of blood behind him, it was clear that he had somehow managed to crawl here from a different room before dying.`
`No, he was still twitching.`
` He might not be dead yet.`
`...But, on this island without a doctor...`
`...no, even if we had a doctor,`
` who could possibly...`
`save a man who had been shot this many times in the chest...`
`When I looked into the room he must have crawled out of, `
`I saw two more bloodstained Japanese corpses.`
`"A-Aaah...aaaah...`
` Th...They're d..."`
`I fell backwards pathetically on my butt, my mouth hanging open in shock...`
`...Come to think of it, that was the first time I had ever faced death in my life.`
`The entire world was at war.`
` Even though millions were dying both East and West,`
` ...this was the first time I'd met with a person's death directly.`
`Ridiculous.`
` ...Didn't I join the army hoping to die?`
`Didn't I whine about not being sent to the front lines?`
`Yeah, so rejoice, Kinzo.`
` Isn't this the death you were looking for...?!`
`Why not spread your hands and yell out loud?`
` 'Come for me, magnificent death!!'`
`Someone came running towards me.`
` It was a colleague of mine, a Japanese man.`
` Tajima-kun.`
`"R-R-R-R-Ru...!!"`
`He dashed towards me, pale-faced and out of breath.`
`His face seemed horribly contorted with terror.`
` Mine probably looked the same.`
`"Tajima-kun, ...wh-what happened...?"`
`"R-Run away...`
` W-We'll...we'll all be killed!!"`
`Someone yelled in Italian, and at the same time, Tajima-kun let out a scream...`
`Then, he grabbed onto me as he fell to the floor.`
`A red stain was spreading across his back before my eyes...`
`"Tajima...kun..."`
`"...R-`
`Run...`
`...`
`*cough*`
`..."`
`As he spat bubbles of blood, he said that one word...and died.`
`But the shock of seeing someone die right in front of me did not freeze my heart.`
`...At a fundamental level, all living things are unconcerned with the deaths of others.`
` The one thing that matters is whether they themselves die or not.`
`It was the barrel of the gun the Italian soldier was pointing that froze my heart...`
`Tajima-kun's back burst once more as he leaned against me.`
` Flesh tore, blood splattered.`
` The warm splash of it covered my face.`
`Was the Italian still trying to finish him off, even though he had stopped moving for good?`
`How foolish I've been...`
` Can I still not understand the scene in front of me?!`
`Rejoice, Kinzo!!`
` Now you'll finally get what you've wanted all this time...!!`
`The Italian hadn't fired to finish off Tajima-kun.`
` He had been aiming at the man Tajima-kun had fallen on, ...me, Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
`"Uu...uuu...uwaah...!!!"`
`I pushed his corpse aside, scrabbled against the floor, and dashed away, tumbling over myself.`
`My hands had pushed off against the floor hard enough to tear off the ring finger fingernail on my left hand.`
`When faced with death, humans truly can resist with all they've got.`
`I tumbled over and over as I ran, scraping up parts of my body.`
` It was painful, hot.`
` But that didn't matter at all!`
`I heard the yelling in Italian come from behind me over and over again.`
` It felt like they were running, chasing after me.`
`I didn't want to look back.`
` So I kept on running and running, as though the Italians were right behind me.`
`This is...death...!!`
`Didn't you want to die?`
`No, I don't want to die!!`
`Why?`
` Didn't I want to die so badly?`
`But now, I know.`
`I know how wonderful it is to be alive.`
`She taught me.`
` Bice did.`
`I can only be free when I talk with her.`
` No!`
`By talking with her, I finally came alive for the first time.`
` I was born!!`
`I want to live.`
` I want to live, I want to live, I want to live!!`
` I don't want to die!`
`I want to live and see her, right now!!`
` If I don't see her, I'll die! I'll be killed!!`
`...Stay cool, Kinzo.`
` ...She might be killed too...!`
`If you live and she dies, you might as well be dead...!!`
`Before I knew it, my face was covered in tears, snot, and saliva.`
`When I stumbled into something and fell, I was finally able to come to my senses a little.`
`"......Haah...haah...`
`......"`
`I could still hear intermittent gunfire.`
` The gunfight was still going on.`
` And, it had spread throughout the entire base.`
`...Bice.`
` ...Are you...okay...?`
`I'll find her and take her to a safe place.`
` ...The lieutenant will probably kill all the Italians to steal the gold.`
` Bice probably won't be an exception.`
`"Bice...`
` ...Bice...!"`
`I lived for the first time after meeting you.`
` I was born.`
` So if you die, I'll die again.`
`I could feel every cell in my body being reborn, not as Ushiromiya Kinzo, ...but as a completely different Kinzo.`
`...Of course, I was terrified that I might really be shot if I went back.`
`But I didn't want to die anymore.`
` To truly die.`
` So, I was able to overcome my fear.`
`"...Biiiiceeeeeeee!!"`
`'Rubens!`
` What on earth is going on?!`
` What is all this?!'`
`'There's no need for you to know.`
` Just stay hidden there.`
` Don't come out until one of your fellow countrymen calls for you!'`
`"I heard an Italian voice!!`
` He's over there!!"`
`'Damn yellow monkeys!!'`
`Rubens stood with Beatrice behind his back and neatly shot the two men rushing at him with 2 9mm bullets from his Beretta M1934.`
`However, one of the 8mm bullets from their Type 94 semi-auto pistols went straight into Rubens' chest.`
`All three of the shooters were struck in the chest and fell down in a heap.`
`'N-No!!`
` Rubens!!'`
`'...Go up to the surface...`
` You have to hide in the forest......`
`*cough*cough*!!`
` Ggh...'`
`'Rubens!!!'`
`"...Heheheh. My, my.`
` Aren't we chatty?"`
`The next person to appear...was the commanding officer of the Japanese soldiers, Yamamoto.`
`The blast of three guns had just sounded.`
`Adding on Beatrice's screams, it was hardly surprising that he had noticed the encounter.`
`"If it had to come to this anyway, we should've taken this woman as a hostage in the first place.`
` Damn annoying, that's what they are!"`
`Yamamoto spat.`
` Beatrice used that moment to snatch up Rubens' gun.`
`'Kyaa...!!!'`
`"Well look at you, reaching to pick up a gun without missing a beat!`
` Italian women sure are scary!`
` Dammit, both of you screwed up...!!"`
`He spat this last part at the two dying men who lay moaning at his feet.`
`However, what had happened to them wasn't particularly surprising.`
` It wasn't the first time it had happened either.`
`In this tiny, cramped tunnel, nearly everyone had met head on.`
` When both sides shot recklessly in such a situation, the result was two corpses.`
`So, whoever sensed another person and pulled the trigger quickest 'won'.`
` That was the only way to survive this battle without a bullet in your chest.`
`Because of this, both Japanese and Italians had killed each other without hesitation, and they sometimes even pulled the trigger on oncoming allies.`
`In the midst of all this were several Japanese men who had stumbled into the fight, wondering what was going on.`
`It didn't matter whether the other person was holding a gun or not.`
`Everyone had reflexively pulled the trigger at the sight of anyone other than themselves, trying to stay alive.`
`The entire base had been wrapped up in this slaughter...`
`There was a fierce gun battle taking place on the submarine dock.`
` And a massacre resembling a hunt was taking place inside the base.`
`Most of the non-combatants assigned to this base were killed before they knew what was going on.`
`The Italians were indeed quite seasoned troops, but their numbers began to drop bit by bit.`
`Bloodstained corpses were scattered everywhere...`
`At first, it had probably been a proper gunfight.`
`However, as their minds began to grow weary and numb,`
` it devolved into that most basic cause of wars throughout humanity, the desire to kill all foreigners you don't understand...`
`Whenever they heard words they didn't understand, they pulled the trigger.`
` By that point, the screams of foreigners sounded no different from those of man-shaped beasts.`
` After all, they couldn't understand pleading in another language.`
`So, it had long ago turned into a mere massacre...`
`As the number of dead surpassed the number of living, ...silence began to return to the base.`
`Just when it felt as though everyone had died, and you could hear the desolate sound of the wind blowing through the caves,`
` there would be a sudden scream, the crisp sound of a gun, and you'd remember that the massacre wasn't yet over.`
`This happened...over and over again,`
` ...and eventually, true silence fell.`
`...It marked the pitiful end for those led astray by gold.`
`The leader of the Italian soldiers, Angelo, had managed to survive somehow.`
`He encountered...nothing but the corpses of friend and foe.`
`All was quiet once more in the base.`
`If he was careless enough to call out, he might be shot from the shadows somewhere.`
`...So, he snuck about like a panther, breathing quietly and searching for remaining enemies...`
`There was no sign or trace of any living person.`
`...Maybe all of the people in this base had died.`
`'...Damn Japanese...'`
`The Japanese struck first, but at that time, we were also talking about killing them.`
`They simply made the first move as military men.`
`So, perhaps we should be grateful for this day.`
`Even if the boat had come to pick us up, there would've been no honor left for us.`
`We would've been mere failures in our mission, unfit to face our dead comrades.`
`Perhaps dying here in the Far East alongside my gun...is a more fitting end for a soldier.`
`I noticed the sound of shuffling feet coming from around the corner and strained to hear.`
`...Is someone seriously wounded and dragging their feet?`
` Noticing them before they notice me greatly helps my chances.`
`At this stage, there's no point in taking prisoners.`
`We must dispose of all the Japanese.`
`I'll dash around the corner, quickly check to see who they are, ...and shoot if it's a Japanese person.`
` Nothing more.`
`I've been hiding my footsteps the whole time.`
` They probably don't know I'm here.`
`Once the shuffling footsteps had come close enough, Angelo leaned around the corner and raised his gun.`
`The voice that reached him...spoke Italian.`
`'R-Run...'`
`'...?!`
` Y-You...!!'`
`"Heheheh, I've been looking for you, Lieutenant Angelo...`
` That makes all of you.`
` I've been counting Italian corpses, you see...!!"`
`'L-Lieutenant Angelo!!`
` Are you okay?!'`
`Blood poured from Angelo's chest, `
`...his gun fell to the floor, `
`then his knees, `
`and then the rest of his body crumpled...`
`and stopped moving.`
`Yamamoto's accuracy with a gun wasn't particularly stellar.`
`However, Angelo had waited until they were fairly close before jumping out, so Yamamoto had made the shot.`
`He had managed to hit, even with a short-barreled handgun in one hand...and a woman as a hostage in the other.`
`"Really, though, our Rokkenjima garrison was pathetic!`
` Am I the only one who's not dead?!`
` Trash, all of them!"`
`'Can't you fight without using a woman as a shield, you brute?!!`
` Let go!'`
`"Quiet!`
` Noisy, these Italian girls.`
` If you'd just be cooperative, I'd at least spare your life. Heheheh!"`
`It was such an obvious lie that even he wore a bitter smile.`
`The Italians were spies working for the enemy, and they all died along with the garrison in a gunfight.`
`Since this was the story Yamamoto wanted to tell, he couldn't afford to have any Italian survivors.`
`By this point, he wouldn't be able to keep the entire pile of gold,`
` but he should be able to grab as many as he could carry.`
` Even that would be worth a huge amount of money.`
`Beatrice suddenly swung her head, smashing Yamamoto's nose hard.`
`'Someone, help! Someoooooone!!!`
` ...Kya!!'`
`"...Y-You...bitch...`
` Ngaaah..."`
`She almost managed to escape.`
` However, Yamamoto quickly grabbed her leg and tripped her.`
`She fell onto her back, and Yamamoto mercilessly stomped his foot down on her stomach and pointed his gun at her.`
`"Heheheh, I don't make a hobby of taming tomboys...!`
` Die!!"`
`"Lieutenant Yamamoto, she had nothing to do with this!`
` Let go of her!"`
`Kinzo had jumped out from the shadows.`
`He was holding a gun he had stolen from one of the corpses.`
`"Hmmm? Ushiromiya?`
` Ah, so you're alive!"`
`"Let go! You're hurting her...!!"`
`"...It was you, wasn't it?`
` You tipped the Italians off."`
`"What are you talking about...?!"`
`Yamamoto didn't know that the grenade had been a dud.`
`He had been sure that the surprise attack would work, but it hadn't,`
` so he'd assumed that Kinzo must've tipped them off.`
`"It's your fault the surprise attack failed and we're stuck like this!`
` You turncoat, you traitor to your country...`
` I know you've been working with them through this woman!"`
`"Can't you see that you caused all this because you were blinded by gold?!"`
`"<Run, Kinzo!`
` This man has shot people begging for their lives!`
` He'll shoot you too!>"`
`"Don't talk, Italian!`
` If you open your mouth again, I won't hesitate to shoot."`
`"<...I-It hurts...ggaahhh...>"`
`Yamamoto ground his heel into Beatrice's gut.`
`"Stop it, stop it!!`
` She has nothing to do with this!!"`
`"Oho?`
` Are you pointing a gun at a superior officer?`
` ...Stop and think a bit, fool.`
` If we agree to keep to the same story, we can have that pile of gold all to ourselves, okay?`
` ...I could only grab a few on my own, but if we work together, we'll be able to sneak off with even more.`
` ...I don't mean this as your superior officer.`
` Let's split it equally between us as men."`
`"The last time you offered to split the gold fifty-fifty, you tried to slit their throats!"`
`"Tch.`
` Ushiromiya, `
`looks like you prefer lead to gold!!"`
`Without any hesitation, Yamamoto raised the barrel of his gun towards Kinzo and pulled the trigger.`
`It grazed Kinzo's right ear.`
`If Yamamoto's aim had been just a bit better, the bullet would've slammed into Kinzo's face.`
`"<Kinzo?!`
` H-How could you?!!>"`
`"You...gyah?!?!"`
`Not letting Yamamoto's momentary distraction go to waste,`
` Beatrice lashed out and planted her right foot in Yamamoto's crotch.`
`After moaning in pain, a demonic expression flashed across Yamamoto's face, and he stomped on her chest.`
`"<Bice!!>"`
`"You biiiiitch!! Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiee!!"`
`Beatrice shut her eyes tightly, hoping that she could withstand the coming pain.`
`No one wants to watch the moment they get shot...`
`"Y`
`...Y...`
`You`
`......"`
`*drip*, `
`...*drip*drip*...`
`...A blood splash poured out of Yamamoto's chest.`
`"Just as you took so many lives for your own personal reasons,`
` ...I'll take your life...`
`...for mine."`
`Could Yamamoto hear Kinzo's words until the end?`
`In his last moments, he seemed to grin.`
`Then, slowly, `
`...he fell backwards with a spurt of blood.`
`"<Kinzo!`
` Are you okay?!`
` I was sure you'd been shot...!`
` Uggh...ggh...>"`
`Beatrice tried to stand up, but then doubled over and started coughing.`
`"<Bice!`
` Are you hurt...?!>"`
`"<...My ribs are hurting.`
` That brute really was stomping them hard.>"`
`"<Will you be okay...?`
` I hope they aren't broken...>"`
`"<Italian women don't break so easily.`
` ...But...thanks.`
` I owe you my life.`
` If you hadn't come, it would all have ended there.`
` ...Ggh...>"`
`Yamamoto had shown no mercy.`
` ...Her ribs were probably cracked.`
`...We didn't have the option of waiting, possibly for several days, for the ship that was coming.`
`I made the decision to carry her away from the island.`
`The man who kept yelling about preserving the secrecy of the base is lying there dead.`
`...The next island over, Niijima, is close.`
` A small boat should be more than enough to get us there.`
`"<I need to take you to a hospital.`
` ...The wound might be more serious than you realize.>"`
`"<...That's interesting.`
` I never knew there was a hospital on this island.>"`
`"<There isn't.`
` A boat should get us to the next island over.`
` ...We'll get you to a hospital.`
` As for me, ...unless I cleverly cover up what happened on this island, ...I might end up getting court-martialed just for being here.>"`
`"<I have a request.`
` ...Please, don't take me to a hospital.>"`
`"<Why...?>"`
`"<If we go to a hospital and the embassy is contacted, I'll eventually be sent back to Italy.`
` ...If that happens, I'll be interrogated about all kinds of things.`
` I won't acknowledge the bastards who let Mama die.>"`
`"<............>"`
`"<There's no homeland for me to return to now.`
` This is the end for me.`
` So, there's nowhere I want to go anymore.`
` ...Lieutenant Angelo, `
`Rubens, `
`everyone who was so kind to me...`
` ...They're all dead.>"`
`"<And because of that, you want to die here too?`
` I thought you said Italian women weren't weak.`
` Live.>"`
`"<Hey, Kinzo?`
` What does it mean...to live?`
` You're the one who taught me, aren't you?`
` Living is more than just breathing.`
` ...I don't want to go back to Italy.>"`
`"<...Bice.>"`
`"<You said that you were dead until you met me.`
` But it's the same for me.`
` ...I died in that submarine.`
` My homeland fell, Mama died.`
` Even Papa died.`
` ...I prayed that our sub would just sink to the bottom of the ocean.`
` So, when we reached this place, I was actually disappointed that we'd survived.`
` ...Then, right after that, `
`Lieutenant Angelo started asking whether anyone could speak English.>"`
`When Kinzo met Beatrice, he finally forgot about dying.`
`And when Beatrice met Kinzo, ...she also forgot about dying.`
`"<Now that I've lost my homeland, my family, and my friends,`
` ...my only wish...`
`is for you to kidnap me and take me away with you.>"`
`"<...Bice...>"`
`"<But...I know that's a wish that couldn't possibly come true.`
` ...So, at the very least,`
` I want to be with you until the boat comes for us.`
` I don't care about the pain in my chest.`
` After all, when the boat comes and takes me away, ...I'll die.>"`
`Beatrice spoke this, smiling softly.`
` ...She did her best to hide the pain in her chest.`
`"<Please, Kinzo.`
` ...Just for the few days until the boat comes.`
` ...Kidnap me.>"`
`"<...That's a wish...`
`...I can't grant.>"`
`Looking apologetic, Kinzo lifted Beato up and gently sat her in the boat.`
`"<...Coward.`
` ...So, Japanese men are weak after all.>"`
`"<You're right.`
` ...I am a coward.`
` So, I can only grant you half of your wish.>"`
`With a clunk, he placed 'it', wrapped in a jacket, in the boat.`
`"<What do you mean...?>"`
`"<The part about 'until the boat comes for you'.`
` ...That's the part I can't grant.>"`
`"<...Huh?`
` What do you mean?>"`
`"<Kidnapping you.`
` ...That part, I will do.>"`
`"<...K-Kinzo...>"`
`There has to be a doctor on Niijima.`
`I'm wearing a Navy uniform.`
`I should be able to pass myself off as a survivor of a boat carrying a VIP that was sunk by enemy ships.`
`If the doctor happens to be of the greedy sort, all the better.`
`...After all, I have right here the golden magic to make people do what I say.`
`A witch...from a distant country...took my lifeless body and gave me a soul.`
`A woman came to me with the gold...and revived me with her magic.`
`"<You...are a witch.`
` ...The Golden Witch.>"`
`"<*giggle*`
` Yes, the Golden Witch.`
` Even though I use the same recipe as everyone else, only my alchemy can turn pasta into a smoking black heap.>"`
`"<Haha, hahahahahahahahaha.>"`
`"<...Just like you, I'm nothing but a corpse allowed to live just as long as you're with me.`
` ...If you go, I'll die straight away.>"`
`"<I won't let you die.>"`
`"<Really?>"`
`"<No matter what.>"`
`"<Take responsibility, okay?`
` ...After all, you're the one kidnapping me.>"`
`"...I see.`
` So, Kinzo-san told you that much."`
`"Then, ...wait, it was you?!`
` You're the Niijima doctor who Grandfather took Beatrice to see...?"`
`"Why so shocked?`
` It should've leapt to the mind ever since the words 'Niijima doctor'."`
`"All of a sudden, a soldier of the Navy appeared along with a foreign woman.`
` Of course, I was astounded.`
` ...And then, he actually told me to treat her wounds confidentially, since their presence was a military secret."`
`"Was that the first time you met Grandfather...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` That was when we first met."`
`"So, you're the greedy doctor who followed orders for the sake of gold?"`
`"That's a bit harsh...`
` He suddenly brought in a foreign woman patient, explained to me that this was a military secret,`
` promised that he'd pay the medical fees later, and handed me a gold ingot as collateral.`
` I didn't want to get involved with any funny business.`
` I was reluctant to say the least."`
`"I see your point.`
` ...But in the end, you did conceal Beatrice, didn't you?"`
`"I may not be as skilled as Kinzo, but I do have some familiarity with English.`
` I managed to overhear part of their conversation, and that was enough to convince me that they were not troublesome people."`
`"*cough*`
` ...Of course, if I were to say that the ingot didn't tempt me, that would be a lie.`
` I was much younger then, you see."`
`"What happened to her next?"`
`"I treated her for some time before a messenger from the Ushiromiya family came and said that she would be moved to Odawara.`
` They took her away."`
`"So Grandfather didn't come to get her himself?"`
`"Regardless of how Kinzo explained away the incident on Rokkenjima,`
` he probably wouldn't be able to move about freely for some time afterwards."`
`"Precisely.`
` Kinzo-san has said that deceiving the military was the greatest challenge of his life."`
`"So, Beatrice went to Odawara, and then what...?"`
`"I have heard that she hid in one of their unused villas.`
` ...After all, Kinzo already had a family at that time.`
` It must have been tricky to manage."`
`"So, leading a double life was business as usual for Kinzo, even before Kuwadorian.`
` ...Whoosh."`
`"What are you doing...?`
` Is your butt itching?"`
`"...Tch."`
`"And later on?`
` Beatrice and Grandfather continued their happy relationship in the villa from then on...?"`
`"I have heard that it was a modest, peaceful life.`
` ...Several years later, they had a child."`
`"...So, Kuwadorian's Beatrice was born."`
`"The birth...didn't go well...`
` It was truly a sad tale."`
`"You don't mean...she died?!"`
`"Don't be surprised.`
` Kinzo believed his daughter was Beatrice reborn.`
` ...You can't neglect the heart. It's possible to reason it out."`
`"...Y-You're right.`
` ...My apologies."`
`"I don't know how many years Kinzo-san spent with her in Odawara.`
` ......However, judging by the Kinzo-san we grew to know afterwards,`
` one can tell how deeply he loved her, even if they only had a few years together."`
`"......`
`...I see."`
`"And then, he made Kuwadorian for his daughter..."`
`"Kinzo-san cleverly made use of the submarine's gold to build up a fortune in a flash.`
` Then, he made use of his considerable skills in English to make connections with the GHQ, becoming immensely wealthy in a short span of time.`
` There's no need to explain this part to you, Lion-san."`
`"...Yes.`
` He used that vast wealth, ...bought Rokkenjima, and built the mansion.`
` The remaining relatives in Odawara scoffed at Grandfather, thinking he was crazy to buy an entire deserted island."`
`"If you could carry 10 tons of gold around in your pocket, Kinzo probably wouldn't have bought Rokkenjima."`
`He hid the gold somewhere in Rokkenjima,`
` built up a fortune with the ingots he'd taken out of it, ...and then bought up the whole treasure island...`
`"Exactly.`
` ......And that started the legend of the Ushiromiya gold."`
`"...What about the mark of the One-Winged Eagle that was supposedly pressed into the ingots?"`
`"The One-Winged Eagle... Or, more precisely, an eagle of which only one wing is visible."`
`"What do you mean?"`
`"You see it often in Europe, do you not?`
` A crest or coat of arms with an eagle spreading its wings on it.`
` ...The flag of the Salo Republic also had an eagle, ...or was it a hawk?`
` ...At any rate, it had some bird of that type emblazoned on it."`
`"So, the imprint was made too lightly, ...or else it was poorly done."`
`"Correct.`
` ......They used a rough, wartime press.`
` It was probably supposed to look like the crest of an eagle spreading its wings.`
` It was pressed in at a slight slant, so half of it was too light to see."`
`"So half of the eagle spreading its wings disappeared, ...making it look like a One-Winged Eagle?"`
`"Kinzo thought the seal on the gold of Beatrice, the woman who had changed his fate, looked like a One-Winged Eagle.`
` That must be why he decided to make that his own crest."`
`"...If the imprint had been made correctly, it would have been the eagle of the Salo Republic's flag,`
` ...or could it have been the two-headed..."`
`"...No, no, of course not.`
` Passing the night away with Kinzo-san in front of that massive pile of gold, drinking and wondering, was truly an enjoyable experience."`
`"However, Kinzo-san didn't want people using that seal to figure out where the gold had come from.`
` The gold he took outside was all re-pressed with the One-Winged Eagle design he had created."`
`"And all he did was show you the gold?`
` What a cheapskate."`
`"Of course, after he became immensely rich, Kinzo-san came to me once more, saying that he'd pay me in full for the overdue medical expenses.`
` The amount he came with was a bit much for medical fees.`
` Though I did make sure to give him his change."`
`"And you've been friends ever since...?"`
`"Yes.`
` Kinzo-san was extremely grateful to me for keeping his secret and concealing Beatrice."`
`"...Grandfather always says that the old relatives in Odawara were a bunch of greedy liars.`
` ...I'm sure he appreciated your strong sense of duty, Doctor Nanjo.`
` I think I understand why a person like Grandfather came to trust you."`
`"I also had some interest in foreign countries, as well as a hobby of playing chess.`
` Kinzo-san and I have gotten along well ever since.`
` It was a friendship that built up gradually, but grew strong before we knew it.`
` Yes, we have been friends a very long time..."`
`"People who deal with large amounts of money tend to be quite mindful of small amounts as well.`
` ...When you refused to accept anything more than the medical fees, that must have earned you his admiration."`
`"Ridiculous.`
` I was just frightened by the large quantity of the money.`
` I began to regret it later, ...wahahahahaha.`
` It seems I've never had real guts."`
`"No need to worry there.`
` Guts are one thing you've got no shortage of."`
`"You think so?`
` Well, I appreciate the flattery."`
`"That wasn't flattery."`
`"...?"`
`...For at least one whole year after Kinzo's death, Nanjo had taken part in hiding the secret of that death.`
`Of course, Natsuhi must have given him some hush money.`
`Still, there could be no doubt that he'd had enough guts to withstand pressure from Kinzo's children for a long time, without slipping up once...`
`"Now that's something that'd take real guts.`
` That sense of duty must be part of your personality."`
`"...Hahahah.`
` Perhaps that is my only redeeming quality..."`
`"I think Grandfather was blessed with a good friend."`
`"...I think...`
`I've learned just how much the woman called Beatrice influenced Grandfather's life."`
`"We haven't learned anything.`
` 'Who killed Beatrice?'`
` Unless we figure that out, we'll never be able to get out of here."`
`"...You're right.`
` We need to finish this quickly.`
` The funeral is already over, after all."`
`"......`
`You've got it all wrong.`
` ...This is `
`the funeral."`
`"You mean, what she's making us do...?"`
`"All of the Beatrices we've heard about so far weren't killed at all.`
` ...We're trying to understand where the word 'killed' factors in.`
` That's the real funeral, as far as Bernkastel's concerned."`
`"......No one knows about her being 'killed'.`
` And that's the truth we're trying to expose?"`
`"You're...pretty sharp, aren't you?`
` It hardly feels like I'm talking to a piece from the lower plane.`
` So, this is why I was given you as my Watson.`
` ......Ouch!"`
`"Don't call your partner a piece.`
` ...So, what next, `
`Willard Holmes?"`
`"Step one of holding an investigation is questioning witnesses, of course.`
` There's still a Beatrice we need to ask about."`
`To indicate whom they should talk to next, Will nodded in the direction of George, Jessica, and Maria.`
`Maria seemed to be lecturing the others about something.`
`"Wow.`
` Beatrice sounds pretty incredible."`
`"Yeah!`
` And then, inside an upside-down cup,`
` she made tons of candies appear out of nowhere!"`
`"Inside the overturned cup?`
` Amazing.`
` Sounds like magic to me."`
`"...Maria-chan really does love witches and magic."`
`"We could hardly avoid consulting our local authority on witches."`
`When looking for someone to ask about Beatrice, Maria rose to the top of the list.`
`The Beatrice she spoke of wasn't the real Beatrice, the one Kinzo and the others had talked about.`
`However, here and now, on the Rokkenjima of 1986, the name Beatrice probably refers to the person Maria's always talking about.`
`"...I don't see Battler anywhere."`
`Ushiromiya Battler.`
` ...The one who was forced to fight as Beatrice's opponent in many games, and the most important person in this game, ...this tale.`
`A Battler in this world would probably be the piece version,`
` but even so, it should be possible to get some vital information out of him.`
`...Will probably wanted to talk with Battler too, but he was nowhere to be seen in the cousins' group.`
`"Battler-kun did not attend this funeral.`
` It's a shame, seeing as he's the cousin closest in age to me."`
`"Are you two on good terms?"`
`"Yes, of course."`
`"...And you pinch his butt every time he says something perverted."`
`"Oh, how did you know?`
` Did your detective instincts tell you that?"`
`"Poor guy."`
`...Bernkastel said that everything we needed was gathered here.`
`Since Battler isn't here, that probably means it's possible to find out everything without asking for his side of the story.`
`Or, maybe she's intentionally hiding the core elements and making us take the long way around, `
`as part of some fickle witch's game.`
`"Since he isn't here, ...that probably means there's no need to hear his story for the time being.`
` ...Let's talk to Maria and the others.`
` ...I won't say anything perverted, so keep your hands off my ass."`
`"Then why not try choosing your words a bit more carefully?"`
`With a roguish smile, Lion pinched the air, index finger against middle.`
`"Ah, it's our Successor-sama.`
` Are you done babysitting the old geezer?`
` ...Gyaah!"`
`At least Lion was impartial.`
` No mercy, even for Jessica.`
` Will felt a bit gratified.`
`"...I see.`
` Since you're the Successor and Krauss's child, ...then Jessica is your little sister."`
`He was so used to Jessica being an only child that, though the scuffle between the two looked perfectly natural,`
` something didn't feel quite right about it.`
`"Jessica,`
` can't you talk a bit more like a little sister's supposed to?`
` And while we're at it, why not try talking more like a girl your age.`
` How many times do I have to tell you to stop calling me Successor-sama?"`
`"Sh-Shut up!`
` I'll live the way I want to!`
` I'd suffocate if I had to act all refined like you, Successor-sama...!`
` Eep?!`
` Ouch!`
` Owowowowow!!`
` Stop it, don't pinch me!`
` This is little sister abuse...`
`pervert...`
`stop it...`
`owow!"`
`"Jessica!`
` Why are you talking like that in front of a guest...?!`
` Do you want Mother to scold you again?!"`
`"...Looks like those two are close, in their own special way."`
`"Well, Lion is an excellent person to be the Successor, without any faults.`
` ...I guess I understand how Jessica-chan feels. Lion might be a bit too perfect sometimes."`
`"She gets compared to Lion no matter what she does.`
` And that made her rebel?"`
`"If Jessica-chan had been born an only child, I'm sure she would've become a composed, quiet young lady.`
` ...Ahaha, that's an interesting thought."`
`"Don't worry.`
` That wouldn't be enough to change her personality."`
`"George onii-chan, `
`...who is this person?"`
`"This is the first time we've met, right?`
` But you seem to know a lot about our family.`
` I'm George, `
`and this here is Maria.`
` Pleased to meet you."`
`"Call me Will.`
` I'm investigating Beatrice.`
` Please tell me what you know."`
`"Beatrice?! Uu-!!`
` See?!`
` Beatrice exists!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`Though Maria had looked hostile towards this unfamiliar man,`
` as soon as she heard the name of the witch she loved pass his lips, her eyes began to sparkle.`
`"Hey, Maria-chan.`
` You've got to greet our guest properly."`
`"Hello!`
` My name is Ushiromiya Maria, uu-!`
` I'm glad to meet someone who knows Beatrice.`
` Handshake, uu-!"`
`"Nn."`
`Maria suddenly stuck out her small hand, and Will reached out for it reflexively.`
`As soon as he did, ...he felt a bright light seeping out from the gap between their hands.`
`The theatergoing power that Bernkastel had given him had affected Maria.`
`"Beatrice is the witch of Rokkenjima...!`
` She plays with me every time I come here!`
` She's my best friend, and a fellow member of Mariage Sorcière! Uu-!!"`
`The light grew brighter and brighter...`
`This time, he could feel himself being drawn into Maria's world...`
`I'm Ushiromiya Maria.`
`My Mama is Rosa.`
` My Papa... I don't have a Papa.`
`I think I remember Mama showing me a picture long ago and saying 'this is your Papa'.`
`It was a picture of a man with a dark suntan, on a beach wearing a swimsuit.`
`...Later on, when I learned what 'Papa' meant,`
` I asked Mama to show me that picture again, but she said it didn't exist.`
`But it had to have existed.`
` When I drew a picture of it and showed it to Mama,`
` she got really mad and said it didn't exist, or that, if it did, she had already thrown it away.`
`Ever since then, `
`...she kept saying that I didn't have a Papa.`
`"...Did you know?`
` People say you need a Papa and a Mama to have a baby, but that's a lie."`
`"Virgin birth, is it..."`
`"'Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, `
`and they shall call his name Emmanuel'.`
` ...If I was a boy, that might've been my name."`
`"Book of Matthew, chapter 1, verse 20."`
`"No, verse 23.`
` Verse 20 is 'But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, `
`saying, Joseph, thou son of David, `
`fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: `
`for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost'."`
`"...So your father is the Holy Ghost."`
`"Everyone said that everyone has a Papa.`
` They said it was strange to not have a Papa, that I was a weird, pitiful child.`
` But when I asked Mama, she said I didn't have a Papa, that he didn't exist.`
` She got mad and hit me even though all I did was ask.`
` So...I didn't really understand who gave birth to me.`
` ...I was...an immature and misplaced creature, not a proper Human.`
` I realized I was a strange, pitiful girl, different from everyone else."`
`"It doesn't matter who your parents are or what other people say.`
` You are who you are."`
`"It must've been hard to teach that to a young, immature kid.`
` My kindergarten teacher might've said that to me when I cried after being bullied.`
` ...But even those words of encouragement couldn't fill the blank space...`
`no, the questions.`
` Those words couldn't answer the questions in my mind."`
`"And the Book is what gave you the answers?"`
`"A priest came to see me."`
`It was probably part of some lesson, to enrich the minds of children through an edifying tale.`
`To most of the children, it was just an ordinary fairy tale they might've heard from one of their teachers.`
` ...Actually, I think we were just bored because it was too hard to grasp.`
`Then, at the end, the priest said something important.`
`"That God knows everything?"`
`"Yep.`
` So I asked him.`
` ...I only have a Mama.`
` I...don't have a Papa.`
` Mama gave birth to me without a Papa.`
` Was that a strange, sad thing? ...I asked."`
`The priest taught me.`
`There's nothing strange about a child having no Papa.`
`After all, Jesus Christ was born of a virgin.`
`And the one who gave birth to him...`
`was the Virgin...Maria...?`
`I was surprised!`
`Maria, the name I was given, had been showing me the answer all along.`
`"I was so shocked, I asked the priest to say it again.`
` ...He said that the Virgin Maria gave birth to a baby by herself!`
` So, I asked him if that meant I could give birth to a baby all by myself too."`
`"And how'd he answer that?"`
`"He said the Virgin Maria was with child because of the Holy Ghost.`
` The second part of the Book of Matthew, chapter 1, verse 20.`
` 'For that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost'.`
` ...That surprised me again!`
` What do you think that means?!"`
`"...You interpreted this to mean that `
`Ushiromiya Maria had no Human father.`
` ...That your real father was the Holy Ghost."`
`Regardless of the Bible's original meaning,`
` ...this young, sad girl, whose lack of a father had caused her to lose her sense of identity,`
` had finally created a way to understand herself.`
`"Once I realized that, I knew why I was different from all the other kids!`
` The ones who made fun of me were all children of Joseph.`
` But I alone was different!`
` I wasn't worse than everyone else...!`
` I was a child of God, a child of the Holy Ghost!!`
` When I got back, I told Mama.`
` I had no Papa.`
` Mama gave birth to me thanks to the power of God."`
`It was probably painful for Rosa when Maria asked about her father.`
`Why did Maria have no Papa, when everyone else had a Papa and a Mama?`
`Every time she was asked this, Rosa flew into a rage and changed the subject.`
`...Then, for some reason and all on her own, Maria had found an answer that satisfied her.`
`She had no Papa.`
` She was the child of Mama and God.`
`It isn't too difficult to imagine that Rosa, after hearing this young girl's explanation, `
`might go along with it as though it were true...`
`"Beato said that the minimum number of people needed to create a world is two.`
` I thought she meant that you need two parents to create a child.`
` ...That's when I thought of it.`
` Beato may be a witch, but she's a witch born of a Human.`
` Beato isn't a child of the Holy Ghost."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"But I'm different.`
` I was born from Mama alone.`
` I was born of the Holy Ghost!`
` ...Beato can't create a universe without me.`
` But `
`'God is always by your side'.`
` I can make a universe all by myself, along with the Holy Ghost!"`
`"Beato called me the Witch of Origins.`
` And she also said that eventually, I might become a Creator, who could create anything alone.`
` All by myself, I can create something out of nothing!`
` Beato can take that and extend it into infinity!`
` Ange was the witches' apostle, who would spread the word far and wide!"`
`"And that was Mariage Sorcière."`
`"There's a huge difference between one and infinity.`
` That's why Beato is so great.`
` However, compared to the difference between existence and non-existence, one and infinity are nearly the same thing.`
` I am the child destined to become the best witch, ...no...`
` The greatest Creator in the world...!"`
`"Mariage Sorcière was the nest to prepare me for that!`
` I am Ushiromiya Maria!!`
` Maria, who stands by God's side!!"`
`...If we liken Maria's sense of identity to a universe, `
`...then this endless stream of words coming from her might be like the Big Bang.`
`She spent so long tormented over how to interpret her lack of a father.`
` ...Then, by chance, she saw a line in the Bible that looked like it secretly referred to her, `
`and she finally formed an understanding for herself.`
`The sad girl, who had hated herself for being different from all of her classmates, finally found a meaning for her existence.`
`At that moment, Maria's universe, which had once been nothingness, was born as a clump of ultra-hot, ultra-high pressured energy.`
`...Then, later on, she went to Rokkenjima, met the Endless Witch who called herself Beatrice,`
` ...and the clump of energy exploded in a Big Bang, giving birth to their magical compendium.`
`...That was the universe known as Mariage Sorcière.`
`"......`
`...We're jumping about a bit too fast.`
` Let's take things one at a time."`
`"Sure.`
` Where do you want to start?"`
`"After you decided that you were the child of the Holy Ghost, it's easy to imagine that you gradually became more and more interested in the occult.`
` ......And then what?`
` Once you reached that state, where did you meet Beatrice, and how did the two of you interact?"`
`"It really did happen all of a sudden, one day.`
` ...I wanted to meet the witch called Beatrice, who lived on Rokkenjima.`
` I wanted to meet her as a fellow witch."`
`"At that time, you already knew you were a witch?"`
`"I did.`
` Even then, when it came to the Bible and the occult, I already knew as much as an adult.`
` So, even though I couldn't use magic, I believed that I was a witch.`
` ...Kihihi, it's a bit funny, isn't it?`
` That's why I was only a witch apprentice."`
`"When did you meet Beatrice?"`
`"I don't really remember when.`
` But I do remember what it was like.`
` It was really, really sudden."`
`"......Huh?"`
`"So, you are...Ushiromiya Maria, I presume?"`
`It was so very sudden.`
`I was just drinking some milk tea, all alone in the rose garden arbor.`
` Mama said she had to talk about something important with Uncle Krauss, `
`...so she told me to go outside and play.`
`Suddenly, ...she was sitting right there.`
`I didn't know anyone who spoke that way.`
`I quickly realized that she was someone I didn't know at all...`
`"...Who...are you?"`
`"You're the one who wanted us to meet.`
` Here I am, welcoming the witch who came to visit my island, and yet you ask my name?`
` *cackle*cackle*."`
`"......`
`B...`
`...Beatrice...`
`...?"`
`"Precisely.`
` I am Beatrice."`
`"Yeah, that is pretty sudden."`
`"Yep. Really, really sudden.`
` ...There are witches and spirits right next to us all the time.`
` They just choose not to show themselves.`
` And, when they do show themselves, ...it's always sudden, as though they've been there the whole time.`
` ...That's what I learned that day."`
`"And then, you and Beatrice became friends?"`
`"Yeah.`
` She stayed and chatted with me the whole time, until Mama was done with her work.`
` We talked about magic...and witches.`
` And about how I was a child of the Holy Ghost."`
`"...And what was your impression of Beatrice then?"`
`"I don't like saying it,`
` but my knowledge, at least, was better than hers back then.`
` At first, I thought she wasn't a very good witch.`
` ...Well, that was just my conceit.`
` There are so many different kinds of magical compendiums.`
` Plus, mine was based on self-study.`
` I probably only viewed Beato that way because her magical compendium was different from mine.`
` It wasn't long before I came to regret that and apologized."`
`"Apologized?`
` ...Did Beatrice do something to win your respect?`
` ......I see.`
` So, she showed you magic."`
`We moved to the beach and talked lots, sitting at a table under an umbrella.`
`"Very interesting.`
` ...Maria,`
` I see you have been quite diligent in your studies.`
` At your age, to be capable of teaching a thousand-year-old witch such as myself is truly an accomplishment worthy of admiration.`
` ...So, what sort of magic can you use?"`
`"...Magic?"`
`"If you call yourself a witch, you must be able to show me some sort of magic, correct?"`
`I was stunned for a second.`
`Of course, it should have been obvious.`
`I was a child of the Holy Ghost, and since I'd studied so much of the occult, I was also a witch, not a Human.`
` Until that day, I had been so sure of both of those things.`
`So, when I was asked what sort of magic I could use, it left me in a daze...`
`"When one knows of magic and can speak of it, they finally reach the rank of apprentice.`
` ...One is only a witch if they can put such knowledge into practice and use magic, correct?"`
`"...So, ...I'm not a witch yet...?"`
`"You have studied well.`
` And, I can sense a very rare talent within you.`
` One day, you may become a witch so great that even I could not compare,`
` ...or perhaps even a Creator as you have told me.`
` However, you are still young and immature.`
` ...You are...yes.`
` You are an apprentice.`
` A witch apprentice, you might call it."`
`"So, does that mean you can use magic, Beato?"`
`"Of course.`
` I could not call myself a witch otherwise."`
`"Incredible...`
` ...Show me!`
` I wanna see your magic!!"`
`Until this day, Maria had never doubted the magic-themed idea that she was the child of the Holy Ghost.`
`...However, no one had ever proven to her that occult phenomena actually existed.`
`Maria could create a universe all by herself.`
` ...However, she wanted to share it with a second person, so that she could believe in it even more strongly.`
`"Once, I could have drawn a rainbow in the sky, `
`transformed it into seven colors of candy, and eaten them at my leisure.`
` However, my power has weakened so much that I cannot even preserve my form to my satisfaction."`
`"You told me about that.`
` You can't use your full power because of the shrine."`
`"It will take quite some time before my power returns.`
` At this moment, I cannot turn rainbows to candy.`
` ...However, perhaps I can show you a bit of that power with some simpler magic."`
`"I wanna see...!`
` I wanna see your magic...!!"`
`"Very well.`
` However, I must ask for your assistance.`
` As I have already told you, `
`no matter how pure your soul might be, all Humans are tainted and filled with the toxin that resists magic."`
`"Yeah, I remember.`
` You told me about the anti-magic toxin.`
` It wasn't in any of the books I've read.`
` You must really be incredible to know so much."`
`Beatrice lifted up an empty teacup,`
` then turned it around in front of Maria to show that there weren't any tricks or strings.`
`"Right, the magic to make candy appear inside an overturned cup."`
`"How did you know?!`
` You're incredible, Will! You even know about witch magic!"`
`"...It's...the most basic sort of witch magic, after all."`
`"It was just a normal cup, without any tricks in it.`
` I wanted to see. I wanted to see true magic."`
`There was a thing Maria desired.`
`To strengthen her belief that there was an occult side to her, she wanted to see the occult outside herself as well.`
`That's why she agreed to help Beatrice with her magic.`
`She didn't want her own toxin to ruin her chance of learning the miracles of magic.`
`"Good.`
` ...Then try looking inside that cup."`
`"......Ah.`
` ...There's candy.`
` ...There's candy...!!"`
`"As a gift to mark my meeting with a new witch, and as a sign of our friendship, I offer this to you."`
`This...was a true miracle of magic.`
`For the first time, I felt shame and embarrassment at my conceit.`
`I could feel that sense of omnipotence disappear, `
`the idea that I was the child of the Holy Ghost and the most important and special person in the world.`
`...Instead of a child of the Holy Ghost who can't actually do anything,`
` I'd rather be a witch who can use magic...!`
`Ushiromiya Maria wants to become a witch...!!`
`Starting off as a witch apprentice!!`
`I was already fascinated by Beato.`
`"I want to become a real witch too!`
` I want to be your disciple!!"`
`"How modest.`
` You already have an abundance of talent and diligence.`
` Also, though it may have been different when I was at my full power, I cannot take on a disciple in my current state."`
`"...So I can't become a witch's disciple...?"`
`"Correct.`
` You cannot become my disciple.`
` ...However, you can become my friend."`
`"Really...?!"`
`"Indeed.`
` From this point forth, we shall be friends.`
` Let us continue to discuss the deep and profound world of witches."`
`"Uu-!!!`
` Thank you, Beato!!`
` Can I eat this candy?!"`
`"No, let that be a souvenir.`
` Instead of eating it, keep it in that adorable bag of yours."`
`"Okay.`
` I'll eat it at home...!!`
` Uu-, uu-uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Maria,`
` that candy was brought into being by magic.`
` Therefore, it is fragile.`
` If you deny my existence with that toxin of yours, it will melt and fade away."`
`"Uu-...`
` No.`
` I don't want Beato's precious magic to disappear."`
`"Then be sure that you do not forget your meeting with me.`
` ...As long as you keep a little promise with me,`
` I shall be here to greet you when you return to this island."`
`"Uu-! I'll keep it.`
` What's the promise?!"`
`"Well, to start...`
` When you get home, wash your hands.`
` Then, rinse out your mouth.`
` You must not complain about this, for it is an important part of a witch apprentice's training."`
`"I'll do it!`
` Every day, when I come home, I'll wash my hands!`
` I'll rinse out my mouth!`
` If I do that, will I see you again?!"`
`"I promise it.`
` If you keep your end of the promise,`
` your body will be cleansed, and I will regain even more of my magical power.`
` ...If that happens, I will show you even more incredible magic the next time you come."`
`"Uu-!`
` I'll keep my promise! No matter what!!`
` I'll do it!`
` I'll become your friend and a witch apprentice!"`
`"Your resolve is heartening, Ushiromiya Maria.`
` I hope you will grow to become a full witch and my close friend soon."`
`"I think that was the first time I met Beatrice."`
`"And was that candy still there when you got home...?"`
`"Yep.`
` ...But I doubted a little, so it was all melty.`
` I regretted almost doubting her.`
` If I'd doubted her more, the candy would've disappeared completely.`
` I almost lost the proof of the magical miracle that had happened before my eyes."`
`"A piece of candy...melted?"`
`"I think it was more of a caramel than a normal candy.`
` It was all lumpy, just starting to melt."`
`"About what time of the year did this happen?"`
`"I'm not too sure.`
` But I remember that the milk tea had ice in it.`
` ...Why does that matter?"`
`"Never mind.`
` ...Did you tell Rosa about your meeting with Beatrice?"`
`"Yep.`
` I told everyone about it at dinner that day.`
` Uncle Krauss laughed at me.`
` Then, Mama, who was sitting next to me, got mad and told me to stop talking about it.`
` ...Uu-."`
`"Next to you...?`
` By your family's ranking system, your seat shouldn't be next to Rosa's."`
`"It wasn't a family conference.`
` It was when just Mama and I came to visit.`
` So, there was only Uncle Krauss's family, Mama, and me.`
` There were fewer people, so we didn't sit in the same spots as a family conference."`
`"......`
`...And Rosa was sitting in the seat next to you?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...Why does that matter?"`
`"......It doesn't.`
` ...Have you ever met with Beatrice outside Rokkenjima?"`
`"No.`
` After all, Beato's body is fragile, so she can't go wherever she wants.`
` I said I wouldn't mind letting her possess me,`
` but she said she couldn't, because she couldn't leave the island."`
`"And after that, you met her every time you came to Rokkenjima."`
`"Yeah.`
` We became really good friends.`
` The more I talked to Beato, the more I realized what an amazing witch she was.`
` She showed me wonderful magic every time I saw her.`
` Then, she told me about a magical compendium that was different from mine, and we both talked together about the mysteries of magic.`
` I wanted to reach her level as soon as I could.`
` I wanted to become the kind of witch Beato was."`
`"Did you ever introduce Beatrice to your mother?"`
`"Nope.`
` She said Mama's toxin was too strong, so they couldn't meet each other yet.`
` ...Almost all adults are no good when it comes to the toxin.`
` Because they're all tainted.`
` Kihihihihi."`
`"Was anyone other than you able to see Beatrice?"`
`"They couldn't at first.`
` She said her magical power was weak, so her body would crumble if even a little bit of the toxin reached her.`
` ...But she gathered magical power bit by bit, and she could eventually appear in front of other people who had small amounts of toxin."`
`"And who was that?"`
`"Hmmmmmmm...`
` ...There weren't many of them.`
` Just a few of the servants."`
`"Specifically?"`
`"All of the servants here today.`
` ...Uu-?`
` But not Gohda-san, I think."`
`"So, there were four of them: Genji, Shannon, Kanon, and Kumasawa."`
`"And Doctor Nanjo too."`
`Apparently, they would sometimes come to visit Maria and Beatrice's witch tea parties.`
`Of course, they had only come by for minor things, like bringing some more tea.`
`However, they were certainly aware of Beatrice and even talked with her.`
`"...How did the servants react to Beatrice?`
` She was a guest who shouldn't have existed.`
` Weren't they surprised?"`
`"Of course not.`
` After all, Beatrice is the other master of the mansion."`
`She said that the servants treated Beatrice as an honored guest.`
`And sometimes, they were permitted to witness new miracles of magic along with Maria.`
`"So, on the Rokkenjima of 1986, the ones who could actually meet with Beatrice were you, Nanjo, and the four servants excluding Gohda, `
`for a total of six?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Beato said she'd need to store up much more magical power before she could appear in front of anyone else."`
`"So, she intended to show herself in front of more people sometime in the future?"`
`"Yep.`
` She said the day she made all of the Humans acknowledge her...would be the day of her resurrection."`
`"............"`
`Maria, the servants, and Nanjo had acknowledged her.`
`She had probably appeared before new Humans one by one, starting with those whose anti-magic toxin was weakest.`
`Beatrice's game was to increase the number of Humans who could recognize her,`
` until she could make everyone on the island acknowledge her.`
` Of that, there can be no doubt...`
`In that case, the last person Beatrice needed to appear in front of...`
`would be Battler, the one said to have the strongest anti-magical power.`
`...Does this mean Beatrice thought Battler would be the hardest to convince...?`
`It seems true that Battler was one of Beatrice's goals.`
`...However, if we go with that chessboard thinking Battler loves so much...`
`Beatrice is trying to make people acknowledge her existence,`
` therefore you might say that she's a character who can't exist unless people acknowledge her.`
`Battler reached this idea himself as soon as the first game.`
`Yes, there's something different about the Beatrice of 1986.`
`She's different from the Italian Beatrice or the Kuwadorian Beatrice, both of whom certainly did exist.`
`The Beatrice of 1986, the one we're so familiar with in a mysterious way, yet who has no existence...`
`What does it mean to 'kill' this Beatrice who has no existence?`
`...The minimum number of people required to create a universe is two.`
`However, Maria said that even a single person could give birth to a universe.`
`And yet, Maria desired a second person.`
` A second person to nurture the world she had given birth to alone.`
`Because if it was born and not nurtured, it would die and disappear?`
`...Let's replace the word 'universe' with 'Beatrice'.`
`The minimum number of people required to create Beatrice is two.`
`However, even a single person could give birth to her.`
`And yet, that single person desired a second person.`
` A second person to acknowledge the Beatrice created by the first person.`
`That meeting with a second person is the scene Maria has just described.`
`The single person who created Beatrice looked for a second person to acknowledge Beatrice...`
`and selected Maria.`
`We don't need Furudo Erika's heartless reasoning to know that the tea cup magic was a sleight of hand.`
`Maria, believing in the story about the anti-magic toxin, would close her eyes whenever magic happened.`
`Any sleight of hand would be possible while she had her eyes closed.`
`...The caramel Maria had been given as proof of her meeting with a witch had melted a little because Maria had doubted.`
`In a season where one was likely to put ice in their tea, it was only natural for a caramel left in a bag to melt.`
`Ushiromiya Maria, the girl who's too trusting and will accept a story easily...`
`Beatrice appeared first in front of this girl, who had, in the language of witches, `
`very little of the anti-magic toxin...`
`The creation of Beatrice can be thought of as an egg being laid.`
` When a single person creates her, it's little more than a daydream.`
` She's still inside the egg.`
`If and only if a second person acknowledges her, the shell will crack, and she'll appear.`
`She'll only appear if a second person comes to warm the egg.`
`When Maria acknowledged Beatrice, she finally hatched, and the chick was born.`
`In that case, Mariage Sorcière, which nurtured Beatrice and her magical compendium, was like a nest.`
`This is Beatrice, a woman with a dignified presence, who calls herself the witch of Rokkenjima and who claims to have lived a thousand years.`
`...That sounds less like the chick Beato, who appeared in the previous game, and more like Beato the Elder.`
`So, did the meeting Maria has just recounted...mark the birth of Beato the Elder?`
`The egg itself had already been created by 'the first person'.`
`Between then and the meeting with Maria, it matured immensely inside its shell into a 'character' with the dignified presence of a thousand years.`
`Then, when Maria acknowledged it, it hatched,`
` ...and the witch of Rokkenjima finally gained a form.`
`Perhaps...that moment marks the birth of the Beatrice of 1986.`
`...The younger chick Beato was born out of love for Battler.`
`Since that birth hasn't yet occurred at this point in time, `
`the birth of Beato the Elder and the existence of Beatrice at this moment must have nothing to do with Battler.`
`.........`
`Are you enjoying this reasoning,`
` Bernkastel...?`
`If you are, let's at least have some applause from the spectators.`
`...Great, thanks a bunch.`
`"I wished for Beato to grant me a lot of things with magic.`
` That's why I'm helping with her resurrection."`
`"...What is it you wished for?"`
`"Lots and lots.`
` Kihihihihihi. Not telling."`
`"So, you wanted to protect your Mama from the black witch."`
`"How did you know that?`
` You're incredible. Uu-!"`
`"...And you're already sure that you'll never be able to get that world back `
`without a witch's help?"`
`"Yep.`
` I love Mama.`
` She's so nice.`
` I want to be with her forever.`
` For all eternity."`
`"......`
`...Now I'd like to hear about Mariage Sorcière."`
`"............"`
`"......`
`...What's wrong?"`
`"Don't wanna."`
`"...Huh?"`
`"I'm thirsty, so I'm gonna go get something to drink.`
` See you later."`
`Maria became suddenly formal, bowed her head, and left without waiting for a reply.`
`...It was a very un-Maria-like thing to do.`
`"............"`
`I see.`
` So, the Game Master has moved the piece.`
`...Apparently, she's telling me to ask about something different.`
`At some point, Lion had started chatting with the other family members.`
`Jessica seemed to be getting irritated at having her butt pinched so much, and George was trying to calm her down.`
`...Jessica and George.`
` Guess I'll hear their stories next.`
`Compared to Maria, the anti-magic toxin is very strong in these two.`
`At least at the beginning of the other games, they didn't acknowledge Beatrice.`
`Maria showed me the point of view of one who believes.`
`Now to hear from those who don't.`
`"Ah...heheh.`
` I apologize for our Successor-sama's lack of courtesy back there..."`
`"It's not going to leave a mark, is it?`
` Talk about merciless."`
`"...Did you say something, Jessica?"`
`"O-Of course not...!`
` I've already, uh, learned my lesson, okay?!"`
`Lion, who had apparently been chatting with the adult siblings, spun around with a smile and stared at Jessica.`
` ...Looks like the older sibling's firmly in control around here.`
`"...Those are some sharp ears.`
` I think I'm finally getting this Lion person."`
`"Yeah, yeah, yeah!`
` Our Successor-sama's always been weirdly sharp!`
` And the adults are always gushing about that kid!`
` And I'm always getting compared to that, both at home and at school!"`
`"Come to think of it, Lion was the student council president during both middle school and high school.`
` And the head of the badminton team too."`
`"So everywhere you go, you get compared to Lion, and it doesn't match up too well for you."`
`"I said it as soon as I got into middle school.`
` Our Successor-sama was already the vice-president of the student council.`
` I said 'if you're planning to become council president next year, that'll just put more pressure on me, so stop it!'`
` But the next year rolls around, and guess who announces their candidacy and wins by a landslide election?!`
`"Same thing again in high school!`
` I said 'please, just give it a rest this time, you're already vice-president'!`
` But when year 3 rolls around, our Successor-sama gets the council president job again!`
` Dad was oh-so-proud!`
` Mom kept saying 'now you make sure you do your best as the little sister', over and over and over again!!`
` Nngyaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!"`
`"But even so, you were still proud to be Lion's little sister, weren't you?"`
`"I-I-It's not like I ever thought of it that way!`
` Yeah, of course not, why would I...?!!"`
`"It can be tough to be compared against perfection.`
` But other people are other people, and you are you.`
` There's no point letting it get you down.`
` Live how you want to with all you've got, and you'll be fine."`
`"Of course!`
` But Mom and the others are always going on about how I need to follow in Ushiromiya Lion's footsteps as a little sister.`
` ...They keep telling me to go join the student council, to go play badminton..."`
`"You don't play in a rock band, do you?"`
`"Wh-What?!`
` Sh-Shhhhhhh!`
` That's a secret, okay...?!"`
`Apparently, she's keeping it a secret from her family.`
`Interesting.`
` ...People tend to blame things on their family and how they were raised,`
` but this Jessica girl always likes doing the same thing, even in a different world and a different family.`
`It's admirable that she has such a true and constant interest in something.`
`"I loved it.`
` That 'pettan, pettan' song.`
` That 'dokkyun, dokkyun' song."`
`"Wah, wah, wah!!`
` Shh, shh, shh!!"`
`Nothing wrong with the extraordinarily accomplished sort, like Lion, but kids who act their age do have their charms.`
`"That's the best way to go through life.`
` Enjoy your youth to the fullest."`
`"...Th-Thanks."`
`Apparently, no one had ever told Jessica that they approved of how she lived,`
` and the direct way Will had put it made her turn red and hang her head in embarrassment.`
`"I want to ask you two now."`
`"The same thing you just asked Maria-chan?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Please tell me everything you know about Beatrice."`
`"...Well, you can see how much Maria-chan loves witches and the occult.`
` For her, Beatrice is a symbol to be admired, like an anime heroine.`
` Whenever some trivial thing happens, she believes it's some witch pranking her with magic."`
`"You really are an adult.`
` And so is the fact that you'd never say that to Maria, even if you think it."`
`"Of course.`
` Childhood dreams only happen when you're a kid.`
` I think respecting that precious experience is an adult's responsibility."`
`"Looks like the two of us will get along well."`
`George's position was that Beatrice was nothing more than a fairy tale.`
`However, that phrase, ...'respecting a child's dreams is the adult thing to do'...`
` That might be worthy of further scrutiny.`
`When she got candy from Beatrice by magic, Maria probably got excited and told George and the others.`
`Then, the adults followed his lead and actively supported that story 'as adults should'.`
`However, we can conceive of a similar situation coming up besides an adult interacting with a child.`
`For example, what about a subordinate interacting with a superior?`
`...If Kinzo, tyrant of the Ushiromiya family, claimed that Beatrice existed and had revived,`
` perhaps the other members of the family would actively support that story 'as his subordinates should'.`
`Though Beatrice only appeared directly in front of a limited number of people,`
` ...it's probably safe to say that the concept of her existence penetrated deeply within the Ushiromiya family,`
` even among those who had never seen her.`
`However, no matter how deeply that concept penetrated, she was only viewed as a sort of fairy tale character.`
`It would be necessary to transform the concept of that character from an imaginary fairy tale into reality.`
`So, a person attempting to do this would need to perform acts that no one could explain without magic.`
`These acts...were the witch incidents, starting with the window-opening pranks played by Beato the Elder...`
`and ending with the closed room murders.`
`...Beato the Elder talked about this, saying that the anti-magic power filling the mansion would be weakened bit by bit the more she made her existence known.`
`Beatrice.`
`Why were you willing to go so far to make everyone besides you accept your existence?`
`Because that fiction will become the truth if everyone acknowledges it?`
`Because at that moment, the being called Beatrice will be acknowledged and will become Human?`
`In that case, until Beatrice is acknowledged by all people, she's less than Human.`
` She's furniture.`
`Why would furniture want to become Human?`
`I seem to remember this being a theme in the previous game.`
`It's because...they want to gain a right.`
`Furniture cannot ****.`
`So, they try to become Human because they want the right to ****.`
`.........`
`It's extremely simple.`
`...After all, it's directly connected to the reason chick Beato was born in the first place.`
`"......`
`...I see.`
` ...I understand, but it's complicated."`
`Yeah, ...you can't neglect the heart.`
`"I feel bad for saying this at Beatrice's funeral,`
` ...but truth be told, I don't know enough about this person called Beatrice to tell you much about her.`
` My apologies."`
`"Jessica-chan does live here, so she might know a little more than I do.`
` ...Speaking of which, have you introduced yourself to this gentleman yet, Jessica-chan?"`
`"Nah, not yet actually.`
` ...There's this idiot going around pinching people's butts, so I didn't really have the chance...ehehe..."`
`A bit late, Jessica looked embarrassed for acting rudely in front of an unfamiliar guest.`
`She cleared her throat and made a beautiful bow that didn't fit well with her normal attitude.`
` She even lifted the corners of her skirt in a curtsy.`
`"P-Pleased to meet you.`
` ...My name is Jessica.`
` Allow me to welcome you to the Ushiromiya family on this splendid day...`
`umm, I mean, please enjoy our hospitality...and..."`
`"...Willard.`
` Call me Will."`
`"Huh?`
` ......Huh?`
` ......Wah-"`
`Jessica's greeting had been of the old-fashioned sort,`
` so Will also treated her like an old-fashioned lady,`
` bending down on one knee, taking Jessica's right hand, and kissing it.`
`"Wah, wah...waah..."`
`Not expecting her greeting to be returned in such an old-fashioned and formal way, Jessica turned red and was unable to speak.`
`...However, Will had returned the greeting in what he thought was a perfectly serious way,`
` so he didn't understand what was making Jessica's face glow.`
`"Have I done something strange?"`
`"No, no, not at all...a-ahahaha..."`
`"I want to hear what you know about Beatrice.`
` ......Nn."`
`A sparkle leaked around the edges of Will's right hand, which was grasping Jessica's hand.`
`Looks like the theatergoing power is having its effect on Jessica.`
`...Didn't mean for that to happen.`
`Oh well...`
`"Beatrice, is it...?`
` Well, I can tell you, ...but will you promise me something?`
` Promise you won't laugh.`
` Thinking about it now, ...it sounds more than a little crazy."`
`"What is it you know?`
` I won't laugh.`
` Tell me."`
`"S-Sure...`
` ...Umm, where should I start..."`
`To me, the Golden Witch Beatrice is...`
`sort of like one of the 'seven mysteries' of the Ushiromiya family.`
`You've heard of those, right?`
` Almost all schools have a set of tall tales or ghost stories that get passed down.`
`Like 'on some days, the piano in the music room will start playing by itself', or 'the skeleton in the science room dances around at night'.`
`Everyone's heard of them.`
` But of course, that doesn't mean they believe in them.`
`The stories about Beatrice were the same.`
`It was just one of those strange tales about our way-too-big mansion.`
`The servants would sometimes talk about seeing things during their night patrols.`
`Sometimes, I felt a bit annoyed about them turning my home into a place for ghost stories, but I didn't pay it any more attention than that.`
` That's how little it mattered to me.`
`So, during my normal, everyday life, I would completely forget about the name 'Beatrice'.`
`Of course, when that huge portrait was first hung, it definitely felt creepy.`
`Even I tried not to meet her eyes after dark,`
` so it's no surprise that the servants found it eerie.`
`But that only lasted for a short while.`
`We all walked by the portrait every day.`
`We gradually got used to it, and eventually bored of it.`
`I didn't really care anymore about the portrait of the mistress from Grandfather's delusions.`
`"I get that.`
` I'll bet it was different for the other relatives, who only came a few times a year."`
`"Exactly.`
` That's why every time the family came for a family conference, they'd always stand in front of that portrait and talk about Beatrice.`
` So, I was reminded of it every now and then."`
`"Uu-, Beatrice!!`
` I've come to play again...!`
` I've written a new spell.`
` Take a look at it later, okay?! Uu-!"`
`"You really do like Beatrice, don't you?`
` You've been in such high spirits ever since Grandfather had this portrait hung."`
`"Huh?`
` Where's Ange?"`
`"She went back with Aunt Kyrie to take some medicine."`
`"Her body really is frail.`
` ...Totally the opposite of Battler."`
`"She's the sort that gets sick whenever she's stressed.`
` I also used to get sick on big holidays or trips."`
`"Maria's really tough by comparison.`
` ...She's been talking about Beatrice non-stop since we left Niijima.`
` ...Don't you think she's taking this a bit too far?"`
`"It's not so bad, right?`
` It's normal for kids to have an active imagination.`
` If a kid told you that she'd met Santa Claus,`
` would you tell her she's a liar?"`
`"...Well, of course I wouldn't go that far."`
`Maria kept talking to the portrait as though it was an old friend.`
`She promised to play with it later, as if she was talking to a living human.`
`George, a man, seemed to think that this behavior from a younger member of the opposite sex was cute.`
`...But, to be perfectly frank...`
`Jessica, who was the same sex as Maria, found this behavior a bit unpleasant, even though she realized that she was dealing with a younger girl.`
`At one time, even I was fascinated by anime heroines and other fictional characters.`
`However, ...Maria's behavior seems to signify something more direct than mere fascination.`
` ...It's something more definite,`
` ...more vivid.`
`Am I the only one who notices something odd about her?`
`...I'll bet the others all notice too, but try to ignore it because of that adult dignity George nii-san is always talking about.`
`"...My apologies, everyone.`
` The Head is quite busy with his noble research.`
` He wishes to eat lunch in his study today."`
`Until a second ago, Kinzo's children had been complaining that eating lunch with their father would give them indigestion.`
`But now that they knew he wasn't coming, they started grumbling about how he should at least spare the time to come down during the annual family conferences.`
`"Then let us begin lunch, everyone.`
` I, Gohda, have made use of all my talent and experience `
`to make sure that you guests, who have come from so far away, will be entirely satisfied with your meal..."`
`No one's stomach would fail to rumble after hearing that from the Great Chef Gohda.`
`By the time the splendid dishes were laid out, everyone had stopped talking about Kinzo's absence...`
`It was now Ange's absence that was being discussed.`
`Apparently, her stomachache had gotten so bad that both she and Kyrie couldn't make it to lunch.`
`"Poor thing.`
` ...Gohda,`
` make sure you talk to Kyrie-san later and have some porridge made."`
`"Thanks for the concern.`
` ...Sorry about all this.`
` It seems she just can't handle much stress."`
`"That's how it is with young'uns.`
` They're cute, at least when they're not regurgitatin'."`
`"George used to do that all the time.`
` He really was frail, way back then.`
` Right?"`
`"Let's not talk about the past...`
` It's not exactly a mealtime topic."`
`"Uu-.`
` Poor Ange.`
` So she won't get to eat this yummy food?"`
`"Yeah, poor kid.`
` Let's make sure we play with her a lot when she gets better."`
`"Uu-, no way.`
` She can't play with me."`
`"Wh-What are you talking about?`
` Why?"`
`"Because I'm gonna play with Beatrice, of course.`
` So I can't play with Ange."`
`"Play with Beatrice...`
` ...You mean you're gonna go off on your own again to mumble to yourself and read some book?"`
`Jessica slightly regretted that she hadn't been more tactful.`
`However, she couldn't wipe away that uncomfortable feeling she got every time Maria talked about Beatrice,`
` and that feeling slipped out through her words...`
`"Uu-!!`
` I don't do it on my own!`
` Beato is there too!!"`
`Maria may be young, but she does know how to read a person's tone.`
`She immediately burst out in anger, drawing the attention of everyone in the room...`
`Normally, Rosa would have stopped her at this point.`
`However, she happened to have gone to the bathroom at that moment.`
` So, there was no one to calm Maria down...`
`"Kihihihihi!!`
` Poor Jessica, you're just a clump of the toxin!`
` With Beato's weak magical power now, she'd burn to a crisp if she ever appeared in front of you!`
` But she will appear before you eventually.`
` Yes, in front of everyone else too!!`
` Kihihihi, and then the door to the Golden Land will open!!`
` But who knows if you'll be invited in?`
` Of course, she will take me there, to the Golden Land!`
` But not Jessica, not Jessica!!`
` Not someone who makes fun of Beatrice, not an unenlightened, stupid, confused, filthy, toxin-stained Human!!`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihhihhihhihhi!!"`
`"...When someone makes fun of Beatrice, it's like Maria becomes a totally different person."`
`"There was a theory about Maria having multiple personalities, wasn't there?"`
`"Multiple personalities!`
` Yeah, that probably describes it perfectly.`
` Or maybe that was Maria's idea of an ideal personality."`
`"You mean that thing about 'creating another self' the way you want to be...?"`
`"Huh? ...How'd you know my motto?"`
`"Don't think too hard on it.`
` You'll just get a headache."`
`It was something Jessica once told Kanon.`
`She had been talking about how anyone can create another 'self' in the image of the person they want to be.`
`...I think we heard those words somewhere near the beginning of the second game.`
`Now that I think about it, some very interesting stuff's been mentioned since very early on...`
`"Everyone has a 'self' they really want to become.`
` But they can't do it.`
` ...Their current self is always surrounded by their lifestyle and the limits placed on them,`
` so they have no way of changing themselves."`
`"True.`
` Changing yourself means changing your environment as well.`
` ...That's not easy to do."`
`"So, my idea was to leave 'who I am now' alone.`
` ...I'd create another self, one that I really wanted to be."`
`"You felt suffocated, forced to live the life of a rich family's daughter,`
` and you envisioned the 'self' that you wanted to be."`
`"But I couldn't do anything outlandish at home, of course.`
` Mom would just start yelling at me.`
` ...So, I made my plan.`
` At home, I'd obediently do what my parents said, `
`...but I'd also create a second 'self' to do what I wanted."`
`"At home, you did everything your parents told you to, and outside, you did what you wanted.`
` That's a good way to live.`
` You should be proud."`
`"Heheh, thanks...`
` And, well, ...if there's something you really want to be, and if you really work for it, it's easier to do than you'd think.`
` I figured Maria was pretty much the same."`
`"You think Maria's doing the same thing when she gets excited and starts talking and talking?"`
`"Sometimes, `
`I think that's the person Maria really wants to be."`
`"...As the youngest member of the family, she's adored, but not respected."`
`"Every time she learns something, there's always someone in the family who already knows it.`
` She doesn't get to show off her knowledge about anything.`
` ...Whenever she does learn something new, we try to smile and praise her,`
` ...but that might actually have hurt her."`
`"So, Maria wanted to become an authority on something?"`
`It's something that all young boys and girls think, when they want to shake off their childhood.`
`It's not a bad feeling when you learn something new and your parents praise you.`
` ...But when you realize that your parents already knew that thing, it sometimes feels like they're talking down to you.`
`When a kid learns their one-digit times table, their parents will probably praise them.`
`However, inconsiderate parents will sometimes ask mean questions, like 'then what is 11 times 11?' or 'what is 16 times 16?' or something similar.`
`If that happens, the kid will lose his feeling of accomplishment...and will start to feel as though he could never surpass his parents...`
`"So, it's easy to guess why Maria got interested in the occult, something no one else knew about,`
` and started learning more and more about it.`
` ...I think the person Maria wants to be `
`is an authority on the occult who everyone respects."`
`"And if she talked about the occult during her everyday life, Rosa would hit her.`
` ...So, like you, she's been hiding this other 'self' most of the time."`
`"That's what I think she's doing at times like this.`
` ...Maybe I should say that this is her real self slipping through the cracks to cover up her normal self.`
` Actually, I've had some experience with that myself.`
` ...I've thought at times that it'd be nice to become a frail, secluded lady, ...so I'd pretend to cough a lot, and it sort of became a bad habit."`
`"Because everyone would be nice to you if you started having coughing fits?"`
`"Haha, no... Whenever the conversation turned to something I didn't like, or something that made me feel uncomfortable, I could do that to change the subject."`
`"I see.`
` And that's another 'self' you wanted to become."`
`"Haha, I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone about that."`
`Then, ...just what is Maria's 'other self'?`
`An authority on the occult who can out-argue even adults?`
`Or else, ...does it have to do with her relationship with witches?`
`...Either way, denying Beatrice in front of Maria is clearly taboo.`
`...In her search for something more than her everyday life,`
` Maria found it in Beatrice and inside herself.`
`In that case, is going to the Golden Land with Beatrice...`
`Maria's wish?`
`............`
`"Looks like we've gone off track.`
` Anyway, Maria kept up that tantrum until Aunt Rosa got back.`
` ...I should've let her be, but I fought back."`
`"You said there was no way Beatrice could exist?"`
`"Something like that.`
` 'If she exists, then just let me see her'.`
` ...Of course, once Maria started crying, I realized I'd gone too far."`
`"And then?"`
`"At the end of the family conference, I was the only one still upset.`
` ...Maria acted as though nothing had happened.`
` Instead, she went off somewhere on her own...and came back talking happily about how she'd played with Beatrice again."`
`"Everyone, me included, decided not to contradict her.`
` By that time, it was best to just accept it and ignore it."`
`"Is that all you have to say about the family conference?"`
`"About the conference, yes.`
` What I want to talk about is what happened after the conference was over and everyone left."`
`Even after the conference ended, I still felt a bit uncomfortable.`
`If Maria had just stayed mad, `
`we would've made up with each other, and I could've put it all behind me.`
`But since Maria got over it, it felt like I was the only one unsatisfied...`
`"Oh, Milady.`
` Why the gloomy face?"`
`"...Oh, it's you.`
` It's nothing important.`
` ...Did everyone make it back okay?"`
`"If they're still on schedule, they should have reached the Niijima airport by now.`
` ...You've done your part well, Milady."`
`"I haven't done anything.`
` It's you servants who've done a great job."`
`"......`
`Are you still upset by that fight you had with Maria-sama yesterday?"`
`"Nng, ...sorta."`
`"She's just a kid, right?`
` It's not something you need to worry about, all grown up and in high school."`
`"Do you think all that...was just a kid's nonsense?"`
`"...You mean...`
`about Beatrice-sama?"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"See, even you call her '~ib~sama~ib~'."`
`Beatrice is the name of Grandfather's mistress, the person he's still infatuated with.`
` ...I realize that, as a servant, Kumasawa-san can't speak of her indiscreetly.`
`Still, ...that's now become the name of the fictitious witch who lives in this mansion,`
` ...and it's almost natural for people to call her 'sama'.`
`"Beatrice is just a ghost story created by the adults to stop us from wandering into the forest.`
` ...Maria just thought it was interesting one day and decided to act like it was true."`
`"Hohoho...`
` If you say such things, you'll end up regretting it.`
` After all, Beatrice-sama 'exists'."`
`"Again, when you say stuff like that, you're just freaking me out.`
` I may not be George nii-san, but I'm not gonna go around shouting that Santa couldn't possibly exist.`
` But that doesn't mean he actually exists."`
`"...You'll find you're wrong there, Milady."`
`"Wrong...?"`
`"Oh yes.`
` The gods dwell in all things.`
` ...In the same way, Beatrice-sama dwells in this mansion.`
` Like the gods, Beatrice-sama will do you no harm if you respect her.`
` As you say, it will be as though she doesn't exist...`
` However, if you ever fail to show proper respect, her curse will descend upon you.`
` ...Of course, this doesn't apply only to Beatrice-sama."`
`"Heh, if there's a curse, let's see it.`
` I'd just love to meet her."`
`"M-Milady...!`
` You mustn't say such things...!"`
`"Ah, Milady..."`
`"You did a fine job today..."`
`"Shannon, Gohda-san.`
` You guys know about Beatrice, right?"`
`"...Huh?"`
`"W-Well, I do know of her, of course.`
` ...Why do you ask?"`
`The two looked at each other.`
`They looked like a pair who had just heard a clueless person suddenly utter a forbidden word...`
`"Let's have it straight.`
` Does she exist?`
` That ghost?!"`
`"...If it's a question of whether she exists or not, `
`...I would have to say that she doesn't,`
` ...probably."`
`"I...`
`...I'm sure...`
`...she exists."`
`"Why?!`
` Have you ever met her?"`
`"...I-I've never met her directly, ...but..."`
`Shannon spoke in detail of how she'd sometimes feel a strange presence or see a silhouette while doing the midnight rounds.`
`And each time she started, Jessica would immediately cut her off,`
` saying she must've seen it wrong or been mistaken.`
`"You haven't met her either, right, Gohda-san?!"`
`"...O-Of course not...`
` ...However, `
`...well..."`
`He was being very evasive.`
`Even a man as big as Gohda was apparently unable to deny the existence of someone he'd never met.`
`...This really didn't sit well with Jessica.`
`She was a resident of this mansion herself.`
`They were acting as though someone else, someone she didn't know, was living here.`
` ...Of course she didn't like it.`
`"Nn, wait a sec.`
` Tell me that story one more time."`
`"Huh?`
` Which do you mean...?"`
`"Th-The story about the VIP room...?"`
`Gohda and Shannon had been recounting several ghost stories about Beatrice.`
`One of those drew a reaction from Jessica...`
`"Yeah, that one.`
` Sounds pretty cool...!"`
`Gohda and Shannon glanced at each other.`
` After all, it hadn't been a 'cool' story to either of them.`
`"You mean...`
`that you mustn't enter the VIP room `
`at 2:00 in the morning?"`
`"The one about how Beatrice-sama returns to the VIP room every morning at 2:00,`
` so you mustn't go near it?"`
`"Yeah, that's it.`
` Pretty cool.`
` All the other stories are about people saying they heard or saw something Beatrice-like, but this one isn't.`
` This one says that, if you go to the VIP room at 2:00, you can actually meet Beatrice-sama...!"`
`"W-Well, ...I-I wonder..."`
`"Milady...`
` They say that servants who speak ill of Beatrice-sama are cursed.`
` Furthermore, the VIP room is Beatrice-sama's room..."`
`"...Even you, Milady, ...should probably reconsider..."`
`"The VIP room is locked now, right?`
` Where's the key?"`
`"Was that key...in the key box...?"`
`"I-I think Genji-sama keeps that key by his own chair."`
`"The master key can unlock it too, right?`
` Let me borrow yours."`
`"B-But...I c-cannot do that...!"`
`"Milady, there's no need to approach such an ill-omened place without reason..."`
`"Hey, don't you go calling my house ill-omened.`
` Anyway, I've made up my mind.`
` If you can't give me your master key, there's still that key for the VIP room, right?`
` Let me borrow it."`
`"......M-Milady..."`
`To Jessica, the expressions worn by the pair felt more like an ill omen than anything else did.`
`In Jessica's eyes, the ill-omened thing wasn't the witch or the VIP room.`
` It was 'them', Maria and the others who believed in witches.`
`In the end, Jessica forced them to agree, and she made them bring her the key to the VIP room...`
`"So you went on a classic test of courage, to see if Beatrice would really appear in the VIP room or not."`
`"Pretty much.`
` ...Still, I wonder why I was so fixated on doing it.`
` I must still have been brooding over that fight I had with little Maria."`
`...Of course, the weather just had to be terrible on that particular night.`
`To be honest, I slightly regretted sticking my nose into something so pointless.`
`But I'd already said so much...and even borrowed the key from them.`
`I couldn't just go to Shannon the next day, have her ask me how it went, `
`and answer 'well, I gave up 'cause it was too scary, `
`tehehe...'`
`Normally, I go to sleep long before 2:00 AM.`
`If Mom found me wandering the corridors at that time of night, she'd definitely yell at me.`
`So, I waited in my room, staring at the hands of my clock as it ticked closer to 2:00.`
`Outside, the rain was incredible, and the wind strong.`
`The swaying, rustling trees were particularly eerie.`
`I'd complained to Shannon and Gohda about making up ghost stories about my house,`
` ...but I was starting to feel like those ghost stories might not be so impossible after all.`
`...The Ushiromiya mansion is huge.`
`Honestly, I can't think of the entire mansion as my own house.`
`As Mom says, the hallways of the Ushiromiya mansion should be treated like public roads.`
`In other words, my own room is part of my home, ...but the hallways and the rooms I don't usually enter are 'outside'.`
`So, while part of me felt that this VIP room ghost story was ridiculous,`
` ...another part of me was so creeped out that it kept frantically trying to convince itself that the first part of me was right.`
`Only 10 minutes left 'til 2:00.`
`If I wanna be inside the VIP room at 2:00, I need to get there before then.`
`"...Guess it's time.`
` ...Sorry, but I'm not giving up that easy."`
`Nothing's going to happen.`
` I know that.`
`It'll just be a stupid waste of time for a few minutes.`
`I touched the doorknob to the door of my room...`
`and was startled by how unpleasantly cold it was.`
`As long as I stayed in this room, I could laugh off anything.`
`After all, this was MY room.`
`But it wouldn't be like that in the hallway.`
` ...That's...outside my territory.`
`And the doorknob, the barrier between the two, is ice-cold...`
`...Idiot...`
` What are you so scared of, me?`
`You aren't taking Shannon's, Gohda-san's, ...or maybe Kumasawa-san's gossip seriously, are you...?`
`I'll prove it! There's nothing strange in the VIP room...!!`
`The corridor was only dimly lit.`
`Before 'lights out' time, the hallways were brighter.`
`But to avoid wasting energy or something like that, we kept the lights to a minimum at night.`
`So, even though I was inside my own house, `
`...it was very clearly 'the middle of the night' here.`
`...If Mom found out that I was wandering around at a time like this to do a test of courage in the VIP room, which I'm not even supposed to go in,`
` I'd get in a lot of trouble.`
`To make sure she didn't find out, I tried to hide my breathing and my footsteps.`
`...So, the silence felt unbelievably loud.`
`Even though it was so quiet, ...that eerie sound of the wind was noisy.`
`The sound of twigs rustling.`
`The sound of some pillar in this old mansion creaking.`
`What's that sound like a beak tapping against glass?`
`Though it was so quiet, ...all of the little, suspicious sounds made it seem noisy.`
`Damn, I'm an idiot.`
` Why couldn't I have brought a flashlight, at least?`
`A flashlight to use inside my own home?`
`...Hah, that's even more idiotic...`
`I mumbled this to myself, hoping it would drown out the sound of the wind just a little...`
`......Then, ...I saw it.`
`The door to the VIP room.`
`...This was the VIP room, the room for important guests.`
`However, as far as I knew, it had never been used before.`
`None of the guests who came to this mansion...were important enough to be given use of this room.`
`Though I'd been clutching that key the whole time, it didn't feel warm at all.`
`It still ruthlessly and icily tormented me.`
`Or maybe that was a warning.`
` '...If you go back to your comfortable room and hide in your bed, this night will pass like any other...'`
`"...Don't mess with me.`
` I can't give up after coming this far."`
`Even though the key was freezing in my hand, telling me to go back...`
`...It slipped into the keyhole quite easily.`
`All that's left...`
`...is to turn the knob,`
` open it,`
` ...and I'll be inside the VIP room.`
`...It's not like I've never been in there before.`
`Long ago, I explored and played hide-and-seek all the time,`
` and this room that I rarely entered seemed unusual and exciting.`
`However, I got in trouble for going in, and was told that this room was important, so one mustn't enter without reason.`
` After that, they made a rule of locking up unused rooms, and I couldn't go in anymore.`
`...So, ...it's probably been several years since I've gone into the VIP room.`
` In fact, ...it might be more than ten years since the last time.`
`The inside of the room has probably changed from how I remember it.`
`...Come to think of it, even then, I felt that there was something unsettling about it...`
`Slowly, I pushed the door open.`
`The door was light, ...and even after I let go of it, it kept opening by itself, as though beckoning me in...`
`Beyond it...was a darkness as thick and heavy as ink...`
`Even the dim light that peeked in from the corridor seemed bright in contrast.`
`...*gulp*.`
` ...I stuck my head in, feeling about for the light switch next to the doorway.`
`This was a horribly awkward and uncomfortable way to do it.`
`All I really had to do was step inside and search for the switch from there.`
`Unwilling to take even a single step into the room,`
` ...I timidly stuck just my arm into the darkness and felt along the wall...`
`"......There..."`
`*click*`
`The switch, which was hardly ever used, felt stiff and lifeless.`
`However, once the light turned on, the darkness vanished in an instant.`
`And there,`
` ...exactly as it had been,`
` ...as though not a thing had changed in all these years,`
` was the VIP room.`
`...The curtain and bed cover might have been slightly different, and maybe the chairs and the like had changed too.`
`Still, ...if I had to put it in words, I'd call it the feel.`
`...The stiff, lifeless feel of this room hadn't changed.`
`If I hang around here, someone might find me.`
` ...I'd rather not have Mom find me here.`
`I readied myself,`
` ...and though I couldn't even bring myself to enter this room when the lights were out,`
` ...I finally entered.`
`As soon as I closed the door, I felt an oppressive, suffocating sensation.`
`All right, ...I've shut myself up in the VIP room.`
` Bring it, Beatrice.`
`"...What time is it now...?"`
`I looked around the room, but I couldn't see any clock.`
`I'm not in the habit of wearing a watch around the house.`
` ...Damn.`
` Now I'm not sure what time it is.`
`Still, I know there's only a few minutes left at most.`
`I tried to suppress my desire to use 'going to get a clock' as an excuse to run away from this place...`
`...Even so, just standing around like this was boring.`
`When I looked around again, searching for something to sit on, ...I found something strange.`
`"......What's this?"`
`It had been placed on the side table next to the bed.`
`...If this room had been used often, I'd have thought it was just one of the owner's personal belongings.`
`But no one lived in this room.`
`So, ...this can't belong to the room's owner.`
`"...What is this, an offering or something?`
` ...Creepy..."`
`It really did look like an offering.`
`A small French doll was sitting on the side table.`
`The doll's hair...was gold.`
` ...It was wearing a black dress.`
`Just who managed to find this doll, and where?`
`There's no doubt that someone placed the doll here to symbolize Beatrice.`
`Does that mean...this doll is supposed to be the owner of this room, or something...?`
`And, looking like an offering to that owner, `
`...there sat a small plate with several cookies and wrapped chocolates.`
`It was all set out neatly, and there was no dust piled up on the doll.`
`...In other words, both the doll and the offering were taken care of on a regular basis by the servants,`
` kept in good condition along with the rest of the room.`
`Taken care of?`
` ...No, it's more than that.`
`It looked like an offering...no, like some sort of worship,`
` a prayer saying 'please don't curse us'...`
`...So, even though the doll was more than eerie enough by itself,`
` ...viscerally, it was even more unnerving to imagine it being been kept safe and worshiped in a place like this.`
`"Stupid.`
` ...Am I supposed to clap my hands together and say 'please don't curse me'?"`
`Jessica forced herself to look away from the bizarre doll.`
`...She couldn't bring herself to sit on a bed that wasn't hers.`
` Then again, she didn't really feel like sitting down on a chair either.`
`She had lost any desire to sit on anything in this room.`
`I wandered about aimlessly,`
` ...then peeked out the window through the gaps in the curtains to stare at the dark, rainy night.`
`...What the hell am I doing?`
`Hanging about in the VIP room this late just because that fight with Maria is still eating at me...`
` This is totally pointless...`
`Beatrice.`
`Just when did that strange witch start living in this mansion...?`
`...Grandfather's always yelling about Beatrice.`
`Since it's apparently the name of his dead mistress, people started talking about how her ghost must haunt this mansion.`
`There's that kids' horror story about the witch in the forest,`
` which might be a ghost story made by the adults to stop the kids from going in there.`
`The portrait Grandfather had hung in April was really striking.`
`And there was also that weird epitaph.`
` ...The creepy words on that, which sounded like some sort of ceremony with human sacrifices, made the name of Beatrice seem all the more unnerving.`
`At some point, those stories mixed together, and now people say that the witch, Beatrice, exists.`
`...I don't believe in Beatrice...because I know she's just a fictional person made by the fusion of a few horror stories.`
`The Beatrice who was Grandfather's mistress probably did exist.`
`But she wasn't a witch.`
`The story of the witch of the forest was made up by the adults to prevent their kids from getting lost in the woods.`
` But that was just a made-up story, not reality.`
`In fact, I've heard that the adults here once scared the kids with stories about about wolves living in the forest.`
` Apparently, the kids realized that wolves couldn't possibly be there, so it was changed to the witch.`
`When the portrait was hung, that once-vague character suddenly had a face,`
` and people acted as though she'd been around since long ago.`
`...That's right, it's all a ghost story someone made, a fiction.`
`And Maria calls Beatrice her best friend, and the servants worship her like a household shrine.`
`I just don't get it, and it creeps me out...`
`".........! ........."`
`The sudden ring of the phone made me jump so hard I thought my heart would explode.`
`There was a phone on the bedside table across from the one with the doll,`
` and it was ringing noisily.`
`However, I was only surprised by the first ring.`
`By the time it had rung three times, I'd regained my cool enough to grumble about this being a prank done by someone trying to scare me.`
`...If I rush to pick it up, I'll probably hear someone laughing at me, saying 'were you scared?'`
`I thought about ignoring it instead, ...but it kept on ringing incessantly.`
`It was a pretty loud sound to have going on and on this late at night.`
` If Mom somehow manages to hear it from her room, I'm screwed.`
`"...Okay, okay, I've got it, I've got it.`
` Might as well say 'ya scared me' or whatever..."`
`I decided to pick up the receiver.`
`I'll just say 'that surprised me, wahahaha',`
`After all, this is my victory, in a sense.`
`"......Hello?"`
`『Uu-!`
` Hi, Beatrice...!〝`
`"Huh?`
` ...M-Maria...?!"`
`I don't get it.`
`Did I hear that wrong...?`
` Why would Maria be calling here...?!`
`"H-Hello...?!"`
`『Thanks for teaching me that fun song last time.`
` In return, I'm gonna sing you a song, Beatrice.`
` I just learned this one!`
` Uu-!〝`
`The voice, the intonation, the manner of speech...all of it clearly belonged to Maria.`
`But...what's she talking about, all by herself...?`
`Maria just kept on talking happily as I stood there, stunned and unable to interrupt.`
`Eventually, Maria started singing an old, familiar kids' song that even I knew.`
`I don't...get it.`
`"...Maria? Hello...?`
` Wait a sec, stop singing...!`
` What's going on?`
` I don't get it...!`
` Hello?!`
` Ah-"`
`The voice and the lights...everything disappeared.`
`In the pitch-black, I couldn't see anything, couldn't tell what was happening.`
`I don't get it, what's going on?!`
`"What...`
`......the hell...`
`...was that...?"`
`Does being in darkness really slow us humans down so much...?`
`I know it's dark, ...but I really have absolutely no idea what just happened.`
`...What was that shuffling sound just now?`
` I-I'm not sure... I can't explain it.`
`I heard an incredible slithering sound, like someone crawling out of a bed.`
`I didn't 'think' I'd heard it.`
` It wasn't that vague.`
` I definitely heard it happen, right next to me, clearly.`
`However, there was no change to the bed.`
`No one had been sleeping there in the first place, and the sheets were still perfectly straight.`
`Someone had crawled out of the bed...`
`...and had laughed in a creepy voice before leaving the room...`
` ......That's...`
`...what it felt like.`
`Felt like?`
` I'm here, and the bed's right there.`
`I'm not only in the same room, I'm right next to it.`
` ...So, why am I so unsure about what happened just a few seconds ago?!`
`I gripped the receiver, which had gone completely silent, `
`...and waited there alone, unable to move, in a quiet room that seemed exactly identical to the one I'd entered...`
`......Huh?`
` ...What...?`
`If nothing's changed since the beginning, ...I can just pretend that the last minute or so didn't happen.`
`And yet, `
`...if something has changed, `
`...that would prove that something really did happen...`
`"...The hell?`
` ...Where'd...`
`...it go...?"`
`Did it fall to the floor...?`
` No, it's not there.`
` ...No matter where I look, from whatever angle, ...it's not there.`
`The offering plate with the cookies and chocolate is still here, `
`...but the thing they were being offered to...`
` The doll is gone.`
`"...No way......"`
`Then, ...what just happened...?`
`Is the Beatrice-sama doll supposed to have cackled out loud and left the room...?`
`No, that crawling sound was too loud to have been made by a doll.`
`It was a noisy sort of sound, like a kid playing with a blanket and using it as a cape.`
`Then, what...?`
`Is that Beatrice-sama doll...`
`supposed to have turned into a human...`
`...and then run cackling from the room...?`
`"No...way......"`
`After that, nothing happened.`
`The doll alone disappeared, ...and nothing else changed.`
`In a VIP room that had remained completely unchanged and was filled only with the sound of wind and rain,`
` ...I stood there, too shocked to move...`
`"Did you ever find that doll?"`
`"...I looked everywhere,`
` even under the bed.`
` ...But I didn't find it."`
`"Just what did you think had happened in that room?"`
`"I don't think it was actually Beatrice-sama's curse.`
` ...It might've been a prank done by the servants."`
`"A prank?"`
`"Maybe they recorded Maria's voice beforehand.`
` They then called at exactly 2:00 and pushed the play button.`
` They could've cut the power at the switchboard or something.`
` ...Then, someone who'd been hiding in the VIP room would make a creepy laugh, take the doll, and leave.`
` ......If that's how it happened, everything fits."`
`"Doesn't sound like you're really convinced."`
`"No kidding.`
` ...After all, if that was just a prank to scare me, the scale was way too large."`
`They made Maria sing beforehand and recorded it.`
`Then, someone called the VIP room and replayed that recording.`
`Then, someone waited until exactly the right time and tripped the breaker for the VIP room.`
`To turn off the power to the VIP room, you'd have to go to the basement.`
` ...There's a switchboard booth down in the boiler room.`
`There's no phone line down there, so you'd need a different person to play back Maria's tape.`
`And you'd need another person to hide in the VIP room and cackle before leaving.`
`And...just how long would this last person have to hide in the VIP room beforehand...?`
`How long would they have to hide in the pitch-black VIP room--under the bed, for example--`
`waiting to scare Jessica, who might or might not even come...?`
`"...There's no way it could be a witch's curse.`
` ...But still,`
` to me, it's even creepier to imagine `
`that many people planning everything down to the slightest detail...`
`and waiting for several hours in the darkness just to scare me..."`
`"I agree.`
` A curse would be better.`
` ...Did you ask the servants about that later on?"`
`"What's the point? They'd just play dumb, of course.`
` ...And there had to have been at least three of them...`
` On that day, Genji-san, Gohda-san, Kumasawa-san, and Shannon stayed the night.`
` So three of those four helped out with that creepy prank?`
` It doesn't make sense...!`
` That's why...I couldn't ask about it."`
`"............"`
`True, it had been a strange experience for her, but it wasn't something completely impossible for humans to do.`
`...Even so, it really must have been more unnerving to imagine a large number of people planning so carefully just to scare Jessica.`
`...It's no surprise that Jessica found this scarier than Beatrice's curse.`
`"Do you still believe the servants tricked you?"`
`"......No.`
` I was probably scared and mistook what I saw and heard.`
` The doll probably just fell somewhere, and I just had trouble finding it."`
`"Are you trying to say you imagined the whole thing...?"`
`"Other than the doll disappearing, there was no other proof that anything had changed.`
` ...Later on, I talked to Maria, and she said she didn't know anything about that song or the phone call.`
` I don't know if she was lying or not, of course.`
` ...Anyway, what happened that night...`
`...is just something I thought happened,`
` ...and there's no proof of any kind."`
`"That's ironic.`
` Even if you claimed to have met Beatrice directly, you would've been just as unable to prove it."`
`"The shock lasted for a while, ...but as time passed,`
` I began to think that lightning or something must've shut off the power for a second, `
`...and maybe one of the trees in the garden fell, which I mistook for that slithering sound."`
`"And the laugh?"`
`"Maybe some strange bird.`
` ...Anyway, I might've misheard something to get that sound...`
` ...I act tough, but you wouldn't believe how much of a coward I actually am.`
` That's why I let my imagination get ahold of me.`
` ...I tried to use that as an excuse to help me forget everything that happened that night."`
`"And everything is enshrouded in darkness..."`
`"......People are actually pretty good at forgetting things if they try.`
` ...After that night, I'd feel uncomfortable every time I heard the word 'Beatrice'.`
` But I tried hard to not let it show on my face."`
`"............"`
`"......That's all.`
` I can't tell you any more than that."`
`"It's kinda embarrassing, so please don't tell anyone.`
` ...I don't want them knowing I'm a chicken."`
`"Sure thing.`
` ...I have one last question."`
`"About the VIP room?"`
`"No.`
` About the dining hall."`
`"The dining hall?"`
`"On the day of the family conference, just before your ghost story, all of the relatives were gathered in the dining hall, right?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Except Battler hadn't come back to the family yet.`
` Everyone else was there.`
` ...Everyone except Grandfather, of course."`
`"And Ange wasn't in the room because of her stomachache.`
` ...Her seat was next to yours, wasn't it?"`
`"Yep."`
`"Was that the seat to your right?"`
`"Yeah, the seat to my right.`
` Why does it matter?`
` ......?`
` ...Hmm?`
` Wait...`
` ...That's strange, why to the...?"`
`"That's enough.`
` ...Try not to think. You'll just get a headache."`
`"What's up, Jessica?`
` Why the confused look...?"`
`"...Well, uh...`
`...right...`
`...left...`
` ......???"`
`"Hahah, you're so weird.`
` How's it going, Will?`
` Have George nii-san and Jessica told you anything useful?"`
`"A bit.`
` That ghost story about Beatrice was pretty fun."`
`"A ghost story?`
` What kind of story?"`
`"The one about Beatrice's ghost appearing in the VIP room at 2:00 in the morning.`
` It was pretty creepy."`
`"I've never heard of that.`
` ...I don't know who put that out there, but that'd be really rude, making up ghost stories about the woman our Head is indebted to."`
`"A model answer.`
` ............"`
`".........?`
` What?"`
`"Do you know about the epitaph, Lion?"`
`"Epitaph?`
` What epitaph?"`
`"That epitaph by Beatrice's portrait."`
`"...My apologies,`
` but I have no idea what you mean."`
`"'Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved hometown'."`
`"...What on earth...`
`are you talking about?"`
`"So, in your world...no, in this world,`
` the portrait exists, but not the epitaph."`
`"Of course, I know about the large portrait of Beatrice hanging in the entrance hall.`
` ...But I haven't heard of this epitaph.`
` What is it?"`
`"......`
`...That's a very interesting difference.`
` ......You've lived on Rokkenjima all your life, right?"`
`"Of course.`
` What's your point?"`
`"When you were a little kid, you were told not to go near the woods. Threatened about it."`
`"Yes.`
` They always said to stay away, since it would be dangerous if we got lost."`
`"Because a witch lives in the forest?"`
`"A witch?`
` What witch?"`
`"The Golden Witch, ruler of Rokkenjima's night.`
` Beatrice."`
`"...Beatrice is a woman to whom Grandfather owes a great debt.`
` Don't you think it's a bit rude to treat her like a witch or a ghost?"`
`"......You don't know about the witch Beatrice?"`
`"I know about the Beatrice who came here in a submarine along with the gold, and about her daughter, who was raised in the hidden mansion.`
` We just learned about those two together a short while ago, right?`
` Where does the witch come in?"`
`"......`
`I see, so that's it.`
` ...Then how did they scare you...to keep you from going into the woods?"`
`"They said that wolves lived in the forest."`
`"...Wolves, `
`...but not a witch.`
` ...I see.`
` That's interesting."`
`"Not to me.`
` What are you talking about?`
` What is this witch?"`
`"I'm just talking to myself.`
` I have one more question."`
`"Please, go ahead."`
`"During the family conference, who sits to your right at the dining table?"`
`"My little sister, Jessica, sits across from me.`
` The next in rank is Aunt Eva's son.`
` So, George nii-san is the one on my right... What's your point?"`
`"I get it.`
` ...It's all mashed together in a confusing mess.`
` But it is interesting."`
`"Well, I'm still in the dark here."`
`"So, did you figure out `
`who killed Beatrice?"`
`"Yeah.`
` More or less."`
`"You don't mean the Head, `
`do you?"`
`"Bernkastel isn't asking about the two Beatrices involved with Kinzo.`
` She's talking about who killed the Beatrice of 1986."`
`"...I'm not really sure what you mean by 'the Beatrice of this year'.`
` What's all this about a witch called Beatrice?`
` And then there's what we were just talking about, and that epitaph too.`
` Isn't it about time you explained all this to me?"`
`"All right.`
` No point stringing you along."`
`"Let's start from the beginning.`
` ...Who is this witch Beatrice?"`
`"Strictly speaking, it isn't a person.`
` It's the concept known as 'Beatrice, the Golden Witch'."`
`"You mean the ghost stories themselves?"`
`"To be more specific, even the ghost stories are only one of the elements that create the concept."`
`"You've lost me."`
`"Ghost stories are normally told in the second-person or third-person.`
` However, someone started telling those in the first person."`
`"You mean someone started claiming that they were Beatrice...?"`
`"The legend of Rokkenjima's evil spirits, and the made-up story for keeping kids out of the forest...`
` These were combined with Kinzo's constant cries of 'Beatrice, Beatrice' and gradually became the legend of the witch.`
` Ushiromiya Maria became entranced by that fictional witch and begged for a chance to meet her.`
` ...And then, someone`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~answered her call~ib~."`
`"...I'm still not following, but I'll just nod and tell you to keep going.`
` ...What do you mean by 'answered her call'?"`
`"Because of Ushiromiya Maria's unfortunate childhood history, she became obsessed with the occult.`
` ...Someone felt sympathy for her, acted the part of Beatrice, and played with her."`
`Maria tends to recognize people by their behavior, rather than their physical appearance.`
`Though Rosa is only one person, Maria calls her mother 'the black witch' when she gets violent,`
` and at these times, Maria views Rosa as a different person, separate from her mother.`
`In other words,`
` even when a person visually looks the same, she tends to view them as multiple different people depending on their attitude.`
`This fact puts the scene where Maria first met Beatrice in a new light.`
`After being chased out of the mansion by the adults, Maria decided to have some tea in the rose garden.`
`At that time, someone probably started talking to Maria.`
`Then, ...when they heard this occult-loving girl talking happily about how she wanted to meet the witch Beatrice,`
` ...this person acted as though Beatrice was possessing them.`
`On the outside, they didn't look like Beatrice.`
`However, when their manner of speech and behavior changed abruptly, Maria would recognize them as a different person.`
`That's why 'her' appearance was so sudden.`
`"We can probably view Maria's love of witches and the occult as a form of escapism.`
` ...She believed the power of witches could bring about change in her unfulfilling and incomplete life.`
` That's why she wanted to believe that witches exist.`
` She thought that believing could make her happy."`
`"...It's true that Aunt Rosa brought up Maria by herself, and that she was always busy with work.`
` I do feel sorry for Maria, but still..."`
`"Don't neglect the heart.`
` ...Maria believed for the sake of believing.`
` She believed in Beatrice's conjuring trick from the bottom of her heart.`
` That probably comforted her a lot.`
` ...And, at that moment, the witch Beatrice was born."`
`"Someone saw that Maria-chan wanted to meet a witch, so they decided to play witches with her...?"`
`"That's right."`
`This marks the birth of Beato the Elder.`
`All of that about living a thousand years and being bound to Rokkenjima...`
`That was mixed into the story of ghosts wandering the mansion at night, which was part of the legend of Rokkenjima's evil spirits.`
`As Furudo Erika guessed, the two ghost stories had fused.`
`Someone fused the two stories together and acted the part.`
`So, Beatrice held traits from both ghost stories.`
` She was the master of the mansion's night, while also fearing spiderwebs.`
`"So, when Bernkastel asks us who killed Beatrice,`
` she means who killed the kind person who acted the part of Beatrice?"`
`"That's close, but not quite.`
` She doesn't mean someone acting a part.`
` We're talking about two different people.`
` ...Just like how, in Maria's eyes, her mother and the black witch are different, separate people,`
` Beatrice and the person who played that part are also different people."`
`It was just like Mariage Sorcière.`
`One person would be the creator, and the other would acknowledge those creations, thereby nurturing the illusion.`
`The Golden Witch Beatrice was also created by one person, and then nurtured when Maria acknowledged her.`
`"So, killing the role that was being acted out...wouldn't mean the same thing as killing the kind person who was playing the part?"`
`"Even if Beatrice's vessel is lost, that isn't the same as Beatrice being killed.`
` ...It's easier to understand if we use a telephone as an example.`
` Let's say I call you on the phone.`
` From my perspective during the call, the phone is you, in the sense that it's what I talk to."`
`"But what if I break the phone?"`
`"...I see.`
` If you kill the phone, you won't be able to talk to me, but that doesn't mean you've killed me."`
`"We know Maria once offered to let Beatrice possess her, early on in their relationship.`
` That clearly shows that Beatrice didn't look like the portrait at that time."`
`"So, if the person acting the part and the witch character they play are different people, ...we're talking about killing just the witch character itself.`
` ...Is that even possible?"`
`"Only the actor can kill the character.`
` In other words, the person who killed Beatrice is the person who played the part of Beatrice."`
`"You mean that the person who played witches with Maria-chan is the culprit Bernkastel's talking about?"`
`"That's it.`
` ......But, as if that wasn't confusing enough, this chapel is now a world inside a cat box.`
` The culprit is the cat. There are now two cats existing at the same time: one alive, and one dead."`
`"...Confusing is right.`
` I'm still lost, but keep going.`
` You're saying that there are two culprits?"`
`"Right.`
` ...The human who can create and kill Beatrice...`
`...and the human who never gave birth to Beatrice in the first place, who can kill the entire concept of Beatrice.`
` Both of those humans are here."`
`"Then let me ask.`
` In this Beatrice murder case,`
` who are the two culprits?"`
`"Let's start with `
`the dead cat."`
`"Who is it?"`
`"You."`
`"...Wh-`
`What`
`...?"`
`"It's painfully easy to guess.`
` Your world is the only one where the witch Beatrice doesn't exist."`
`"I don't understand."`
`"Both Maria and Jessica told me stories about the witch Beatrice.`
` However, when they talked about the ranking system at the dining table, you weren't there."`
`"I...wasn't there...?"`
`"Maria came to visit Rokkenjima with Rosa.`
` And Rosa was sitting next to her.`
` That's impossible.`
` ...If you exist, then Lion comes after Rosa, then Jessica, then Maria."`
`There should be two people between Rosa and Maria in rank.`
`In that case, they should be sitting on opposite sides of the table and separated by one seat.`
`...In other words, in the world where Lion exists, it's impossible for Maria to be sitting next to Rosa.`
`"It was the same in Jessica's story.`
` If you were added to the ranking system, then when looking down the table towards Kinzo's seat, you should be on the left side and Jessica should be on the right.`
` After that comes George on the left side and Ange on the right.`
` ...Jessica and Ange will be sitting next to each other whether you're there or not.`
` However, which side of the table they're sitting on changes."`
`In the world where Lion exists, Ange's seat is on Jessica's left.`
`However, if Lion doesn't exist, then Ange's seat is on Jessica's right.`
`"Every time someone talked about the witch Beatrice of 1986, they were all talking about a world where you don't exist.`
` And, in your world, there are no ghost stories about a witch.`
` To you, Beatrice is either Kinzo's mistress or his benefactor, not a wandering ghost."`
`"The Head loved Beatrice deeply, did he not?`
` I can't imagine why she would be made into a ghost story."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"Exactly.`
` If you exist, the witch Beatrice doesn't.`
` Your existence `
`'kills Beatrice'."`
`"Are you saying I'm the culprit who killed Beatrice...?`
` That's...just crazy.`
` How can I be the culprit if I don't even understand her and have never met her?"`
`"Flip it around.`
` ...If you don't exist, Beatrice will be born."`
`"Flip it?`
` Are you trying to say Beatrice and I are two sides of a coin?"`
`"That's a good way to put it.`
` That's it exactly.`
` You're a coin, and Beatrice is on the other side."`
`"I don't get it at all."`
`"At first, I didn't get your existence either.`
` ...But, I've formed a theory about you, after hearing all this.`
` The key is that you're 19 years old."`
`"...I don't remember telling you my age, but you got it right.`
` ...How?"`
`"Jessica said you were already the student council vice-president when she joined your school...and that you became the president the next year.`
` That means you're one year older than Jessica."`
`Jessica is 18 years old, ...so Lion must be 19.`
`"I see...`
` And what sort of theory can you make, now that you know I'm 19?"`
`"The theory I can make...is that you aren't Ushiromiya Natsuhi's child."`
`"......`
`...How rude.`
` I don't know what game you're playing, but I won't allow you to insult both me and my mother like that."`
`"Why are you the Successor, instead of Krauss?"`
`"I will succeed the Headship when I come of age.`
` When I have a kid, I'll probably pass the title down to them when they come of age."`
`"Then why didn't Kinzo give the Headship to Krauss when he came of age?"`
`"......You heard what our Head said.`
` He was used by the cunning elders of the Ushiromiya family and suffered much.`
` That's why he decided that only young people should inherit the Headship from now-"`
`"In the world without you in it, there is no silver ring for the Successor.`
` ...That silver ring proves that Kinzo had a strong desire, which he didn't show in any other world,`
` to see that you became the next Head."`
`"...I can't deny that you may have a point there.`
` The Head always seemed to adore me particularly,`
` and I was very young when he first promised to make me the Head when I came of age.`
` He was very strict when he told me to keep up in my studies in preparation for that day."`
`"...But I don't think my father was any less talented.`
` Why did Grandfather skip over him and make me the Successor?`
` ......I've thought it strange from time to time, but since it's always been that way, I never said so aloud."`
`"Do you know why Kinzo wanted you and not Krauss to become the next Head?"`
`"How could I know?`
` ...Are you trying to tell me to stop neglecting the heart again?`
` Do you think you understand how the Head's heart works?"`
`"It's because you're the child of Kinzo and Beatrice."`
`"...Well done.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`There was a crisp applause and a mocking laugh.`
`"Bernkastel."`
`"...That was faster than I expected.`
` I thought you'd let me play a bit longer."`
`Bernkastel appeared sitting on the altar, `
`...almost as though it had become her own personal chair.`
`"When did you realize that Lion shared Beatrice's blood?"`
`"As soon as I realized that Lion was 19.`
` ...It was the same number as 'the baby from 19 years ago', the hint that appeared in the 5th game."`
`"...Didn't that baby fall off a cliff?"`
`"Lion is the baby who was accepted by Natsuhi and didn't fall off the cliff.`
` In other words, if Natsuhi rejects the baby, Lion doesn't exist."`
`"You're saying...I'm not Mom's child...?!`
` That's insane...`
`......"`
`"You say that, but you don't look too sure.`
` ...*giggle*`
` That's right.`
` Ushiromiya Lion is not Natsuhi's child.`
` This is the grown-up version of the baby Kinzo got from somewhere 19 years ago."`
`"Not 'somewhere'.`
` ...Lion clearly shares Beatrice's blood.`
` The proof is the silver ring, which is only ever given to Lion across all of the many worlds."`
`"Why does the ring prove that I share Beatrice's blood?"`
`"In all of the many worlds, you are the only one who receives it.`
` That means that, in all worlds, you are the most important person to Kinzo, second only to Beatrice.`
` And his love for you is clearly greater than it is for his son, Krauss, or his granddaughter, Jessica.`
` And you are 19 years old.`
` ...In other words, if we look back to see what happened 19 years ago, it can lead to a certain theory."`
`"19 years ago?`
` What's supposed to have happened at the time I was born?"`
`"...You heard it too, didn't you?`
` You even heard it today.`
` And Will was with you, right?"`
`"......`
`...You don't mean...Aunt Rosa's story?!"`
`"That's right.`
` Rosa's story came out in the 3rd game, and when the age of the baby in the 5th game matched that date, a certain theory became possible.`
` The fact that Kinzo brought a baby from somewhere and tried to add it to his family...`
`proves that the baby was somehow important to him."`
`"And I'm...`
`the child...`
`...of the Kuwadorian Beatrice..."`
`"The Kuwadorian Beatrice was the daughter of the Beatrice who arrived in that submarine.`
` ...But Kinzo didn't think of her as a daughter.`
` He believed she was the same person, Beatrice reborn.`
` ...When that 'reborn Beatrice' reached the same age as the first Beatrice, and truly looked like Beatrice's double...`
` Kinzo made a terrible mistake."`
`"...I-I don't want to hear it!"`
`"That's how it is.`
` Kinzo got Beatrice pregnant with Beatrice, `
`and then he got that Beatrice pregnant with you.`
` ...So, you're both Kinzo's child and Beatrice's grandchild."`
`".........!"`
`"If we consider Kinzo's heart, this is the inevitable theory we reach for explaining why he treated you so specially.`
` He regretted his mistake so much that he tried to make you his proper grandchild."`
`"...In almost all cases, Natsuhi's pride is brutally hurt, and she refuses to raise Lion.`
` Because of that, you almost always fall from the cliff and disappear."`
`"...I-I heard...`
`...that I was the child they were finally blessed with after so long...`
`and that Jessica was born the next year..."`
`"If you really never suspected that Natsuhi wasn't your mother,`
` ...then you should thank her in this world.`
` The reason you never realized the truth is because she's shown as much affection to you as she did to Jessica."`
`"...There's no need to thank her.`
` ...After all, it took a dizzying span of time just to find a Fragment with you in it.`
` Mathematically speaking, `
`there's actually a 2,578,916/2,578,917 chance of her refusing to raise you.`
` You should probably be thanking me for creating this miracle, not Natsuhi.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Enough with your stupid probability games."`
`"Oh, I'm sorry."`
`"............"`
`"No matter whose blood you bear, that doesn't change the debt you owe to the family that raised you."`
`"I realize that.`
` ...Still, I would like some time to calm down and think things through.`
` ...That is, if you'll refrain from ignoring my heart."`
`"...Sure."`
`Lion took a deep breath and looked upwards.`
`...Anyone would be shocked to find that their parents weren't who they believed them to be.`
`Still, Lion should be grateful.`
` Grateful towards the family that raised a child who wanted for nothing...`
`"It is pretty interesting.`
` ...Hard to believe that the Golden Witch Beatrice might've lived such an ordinary life, `
`even at such absurdly low probabilities."`
`"Isn't it?`
` I think moments like this are hilarious..."`
`Will had said it plainly.`
`Ushiromiya Lion...is how the Golden Witch Beatrice appears in a different world.`
`The baby Natsuhi rejected 19 years previous...`
`If she'd accepted that child, this is the future that would have occurred...`
`However, if she doesn't accept that child, ...the witch will be born.`
`The baby whose birth was not celebrated becomes a witch...`
`"Lion is the dead cat.`
` ...However, Lion's existence has nothing to do with what you're interested in, the Rokkenjima Serial Murders.`
` ...In other words, Lion is the cat that disappears when you open the cat box."`
`"...*giggle* Exactly.`
` Lion is just a disappearing cat.`
` But this was pretty fun for a side-trip, don't you think?"`
`"You're the only one having fun.`
` ...If I wasn't trapped here, I wouldn't even worry about reasoning this out."`
`"......`
`...I think I know why I was chosen to be your partner in this strange detective game.`
` ...It seems this Bernkastel witch `
`enjoys toying with people's fates and sneering at them."`
`"Wow, incredible.`
` ...It's rare for someone to understand me on the day we meet.`
` ...*giggle*."`
`"Apparently, ...I become something that gets called a witch in another world.`
` And, apparently, I'm the cause of some sort of crime.`
` Is that my sin?"`
`"It's no sin of yours.`
` You are you.`
` How things would be if the coin were flipped the other way isn't your problem."`
`"Thank you.`
` Even so, I don't think anyone would be pleased to hear `
`that they caused some sort of trouble in a world of a different fate.`
` ...Please, tell me.`
` What do I do in that other world?"`
`"......Bernkastel?"`
`"Should we show the Fragments to this kid?"`
`"............"`
`Will opened his hand...`
`and something that looked like a pale-blue, glowing shard of a crystal appeared there.`
`It was a memory...no, a game record...of all the games so far.`
`"...Touch this.`
` You'll be able to see your fate in other worlds."`
`"...Your face is telling me...`
`that I'd be happier if I didn't touch it."`
`"Of course.`
` ...You've probably guessed, but the story here isn't a happy one."`
`"Even so...`
` ...Even if it is another world, ...it's still about me."`
`"...You have both the right to know and the right not to know.`
` If you can convince yourself that the one similar to yet different from you is a separate person, ...then touch it."`
`"Don't you want to know...?`
` About the fate you might've reached?"`
`"......I ask this as your partner.`
` Would you show that to me?"`
`"As your partner, I'd say 'look'.`
` ...But as a friend, I'd say 'don't'."`
`"Unfortunately,`
` I'm not your friend."`
`"Then, as a partner, I have one last question."`
`"What?"`
`"Are you...`
`...a boy or a girl?"`
`"...Well, that was abrupt."`
`"I could see you as a fairly slender boy.`
` But then again, I could also see you as a no-nonsense sort of girl.`
` ...Even Bernkastel has been intentionally keeping it a secret.`
` She made Jessica call you 'our Successor-sama' all the time, instead of Nii-san or Nee-san."`
`"...*giggle*`
` You are quick."`
`"People often ask me about my gender.`
` So, I always give the same irritated response.`
` ...Which do I look like to you?"`
`"...In the 5th game, you're supposed to be a boy.`
` But in many other games, you're thought of as a girl.`
` ...In the sixth game, when Ushiromiya Battler was the Master, two demons of different sexes appeared, but we didn't know which was which.`
` ...In fact, strictly speaking, it started all the way back in the very first game.`
` ......Your gender is one of the hidden mysteries that exists outside the games themselves."`
`"I'd hate to give you an answer so easily, so I won't.`
` We're partners, right?`
` Does it really matter if I'm not the gender you'd prefer?"`
`"......`
`...You're right.`
` If we're working together on this, I don't care what your gender is."`
`"Thank you.`
` ...I've developed a bit of a complex about it, so I'm glad to hear you say that."`
`"I'm all for gender equality.`
` ......If someone's a waste of space, I'll smack 'em no matter who they are."`
`"And of course, I'll pinch rude people no matter which gender they are."`
`Slowly, ...Lion reached out and touched the Fragment.`
`A moment later, Lion seemed to undergo a violent bout of dizziness...`
`and silently slumped over like a puppet with its strings cut.`
`It was no surprise.`
` When people who don't understand parallel universes have many different fates jammed into their heads,`
` they tend to feel like their brains are swelling and their sense of self is melting away.`
`...Lion seemed to have lost consciousness.`
`"So, ...Lion had what it took to learn everything."`
`"A perfect piece to be your partner, wouldn't you say?"`
`"I'll continue my reasoning.`
` ...I've talked about the dead cat."`
`"Very true.`
` Next up is the living cat."`
`"The only one who can kill the Beatrice of 1986 is the one who created her."`
`"There are tons of hints.`
` If you think about it, they've been coming since back when Beatrice was running the games."`
`"That's true.`
` ...In the 4th game between Beatrice and Battler, Beatrice's origin became clear.`
` And, at that point, I learned who Beatrice was, and about that person's heart."`
`"What do you mean by heart?"`
`"...The motive.`
` ...The reason why Beatrice had to commit a game-like crime on October 5th, 1986, `
`putting even her own fate on the line."`
`"Impressive.`
` So, you figured out the 'who dunnit' and the 'why dunnit' as early as the 4th game.`
` ...Then what about the 'how dunnit'?"`
`"Once you know who the culprit is, theorizing about the 'how dunnit' isn't impossible.`
` ...Those linked closed rooms in the third game were a pretty nice job. Almost made me feel like applauding."`
`"And the 'who aaam I?', `
`from the end of the 4th game...?"`
`"The 'culprit' who can kill everyone at 24:00 on October 5th, no matter where they are.`
` By that moment, it's possible to form a certain sort of hypothesis.`
` ...You might call that the other treasure of the Golden Land."`
`"...Ooh?`
` So, you say you can reach all of the answers by the 4th game?`
` In other words, with just Beatrice's games?"`
`"It's possible.`
` ...After that, Lambdadelta's game and Battler's game were filled with even more hints.`
` ...As is this game of yours."`
`"*giggle*giggle*...`
` ...Well now, why don't you stop stalling for time, and just tell me?`
` ...Who iiis...`
`At that moment, ...though there hadn't been anyone but them in the chapel, small footsteps rang out.`
`That silhouette slowly walked up to Will and Bernkastel...and gave a small bow.`
`"......So, you've come."`
`"Did you call this person here?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...'Who dunnit'.`
` 'How dunnit'.`
` And 'why dunnit'.`
` ...I've understood this person's motive."`
`"...And are 'you' going to give up just because he's found out your motive...?`
` There's no concrete evidence, right?`
` You could make a flashy fight of it, with red and blue."`
`"That's not what this person wants anymore."`
`They nodded slightly.`
`Their wish...was to be noticed.`
`Once that happened, they had no need for trivial excuses or pointless word games...`
`"I believe that I understand your motive,`
` ...your heart.`
` ...I'm going to describe it now.`
` I called you here...`
`to listen...`
`and correct me in your own words if I've gotten anything wrong."`
`"............"`
`The two of them nodded to each other once more.`
`"In your four games, I found your message.`
` ...And in the three games with different Masters, I was able to picture the strange sort of fate that must have toyed with your life.`
` ...It left me speechless.`
` ...In every game, you die, without revealing that truth to anyone."`
`Having this person confess in this empty chapel might be pointless.`
`However, even so, ...I believe it will give her some sort of salvation.`
`People are only saved when someone understands them.`
`No one understood this pitiful witch even after her death, even years later, and including the man she wanted to understand her most.`
` ......It's about time someone forgave her.`
`At the end of the 5th game, Battler finally understood.`
`...However, `
`...it took him so long,`
` ...and he didn't make it in time.`
`So, even though she's alive here and now, Battler cannot save her.`
`So, Battler isn't here at Beatrice's funeral. He won't come.`
` ...He won't make it in time.`
`"...This is Beatrice's funeral.`
` You will confess,`
` ...the divine Master will hear,`
` ...and I will forgive you.`
` ...That's supposed to be Battler's job, but he didn't make it in time.`
` So, you'll have to settle for me."`
`"...And Beato gave Battler so many hints, too.`
` Lambda also gave that idiot a ton of hints.`
` ...I even got a good laugh in at Battler's game of repentance for missing so much.`
` ...But I won't make anyone laugh.`
` I'll just dispassionately...carry out your funeral."`
`"No more talking from you.`
` That's my job."`
`"......*giggle*."`
`"If you're ready, let's begin.`
` ...No one will rush you.`
` ......Bernkastel has closed off time for eternity until your funeral ends.`
` You have as much time as you need to prepare yourself emotionally..."`
`The silhouette slowly shook its head.`
`It had come here because it was already prepared.`
`Will nodded to show he understood.`
`...Then, the two looked into Bernkastel's eyes,`
` ...and Will spoke out clearly.`
`"This is the culprit."`
`"......Listen.`
` I am one yet many.`
` What I speak is our tale.`
` However, this is a small world, sealed by glass and cork, with no one to hear.`
` None shall lay eyes upon it, and my entire tale shall be sealed away,`
` set adrift in the sea of my heart until it disappears amongst the seaweed..."`
`"Ah, where is this place?!`
` And who am I?!"`
`"Then let me ask!`
` Where do you want it to be? Who do you want to be?!"`
`"Any place, so long as it will wrap itself around me gently!`
` Anyone, so long as I am treated kindly!"`
`"Yes, for us...!"`
`"For us...!"`
`""Where and who we are hardly matter!!""`
`"Correct.`
` For us, it's such a trivial matter.`
` At least until that day comes to pass.`
` Why must we be thrown in the path of a new fate?`
` Fate's pronouncement was sudden and abrupt."`
`"It wasn't the fate I'd wished for."`
`"But it did make your heart pound...!"`
`"Where will the new fate take me?!"`
`"It doesn't matter where!"`
`""So long as that place is kind to us...!!""`
`"When we were brought to the temporary dwelling where sad, parentless children gather,`
` was that a sign of God's salvation, or a lure into the demon's game where the new fate would torment us?`
` We have no way of knowing."`
`"And yet, we want to believe.`
` We want to believe it was God's salvation sent to us, a sign of 'fukuin', the good news, the Gospel."`
`"But why me?`
` I have no religion!"`
`"Then it wasn't the Gospel, but a demon's lure!"`
`"And yet, we cannot go against fate.`
` Oh, I am one yet many.`
` I pray that the new fate brings us blessings.`
` The time is 1976 AD, in April.`
` At a time still too cool to be called spring.`
` In a strange new land, we were tormented by the same stale air and drafts..."`
`"Chapter 1:`
` A New Life."`
`"Those are the family rules.`
` They may be strict, but I believe that the discipline you learn in this house will serve you well in the future."`
`"""Yes, Madam."""`
`The servants who would start working this April all called out in unison.`
`The rules of the Ushiromiya family are no more or less strict than those of the Fukuin House.`
`However, we get paid a lot of money here.`
`They also give us a lot of help in finding our next job.`
`We work for the Ushiromiya family, store up money, use their influence to get a job at a good company, and start on a new, happy life.`
`...That was the dream, and it was a very realistic one, held by all of us at the Fukuin House.`
`However, not everyone can become an Ushiromiya family servant.`
`Only kids with a record of exemplary conduct and good grades are recommended.`
`So, all of the kids who want to be sure of leaving the Fukuin House to live a happy life are feverishly devoted to their studies...`
`"That's enough for today.`
` Tomorrow, you start early.`
` Make sure the lights are all out at the appropriate time.`
` That is all."`
`"""Yes, Madam.`
` Thank you very much."""`
`After bowing until Natsuhi was no longer in sight,`
` the new servants all followed the lead of one of the more experienced servants and raised their heads.`
`"Okay, we're done for the day.`
` Starting tomorrow, you'll be following your shift schedule.`
` The Madam is very strict about time.`
` If any of you sleep in, it'll be my responsibility.`
` So if you do, I'll kick you awake.`
` Got it?!"`
`Of course, this experienced servant was one of the older girls from the Fukuin House.`
`She's been here for two years, apparently.`
`That's probably why all the other new servants, who are older than me, seem to know her well.`
`'That Madam looks so strict.' 'Dang, I'm tired.' '*giggle*giggle*.'`
`"...By the way, who exactly is this kid?`
` Why were you chosen to be a servant?"`
`The older servant pointed at me and asked the room at large, a dubious look on her face.`
`It's no surprise, really.`
`Most of us become servants when we graduate middle school or high school.`
`But I'm just starting elementary school.`
`The others will be working as servants every day of the week, according to their standard shift schedule.`
`However, on weekdays, I was going to go to the elementary school on Niijima with Milady,`
` only working on weekends and when I had free time.`
`It was an exception among exceptions, something that had never happened before.`
`...It was clear at a glance that the others, who had obtained their positions after a rigorous selection process,`
` didn't like the fact that I was here too.`
`"...Both Madam and Genji-sama have told me that you are to put your studies first.`
` But you're still getting paid.`
` Doesn't make any sense."`
`If you're going to talk behind someone's back, at least do it behind them.`
` She didn't even try to hide her discontent.`
`"Is this kid really that smart?`
` A child prodigy, or something?"`
`"I never heard anything about that."`
`"Well, that kid supposedly gets sick easily and is kept isolated most of the time. A total outsider to the rest of us, even back at the House."`
`"...Now that you're here, you're part of the collective responsibility system.`
` If you screw up, it's the same as everyone from the Fukuin House screwing up.`
` Make sure you don't, okay?"`
`I nodded weakly.`
` ...I'd never been threatened by someone this much older than me, and I was very frightened.`
`"Don't worry.`
` I'll be there with you.`
` Let's give it our all together,`
` okay?"`
`Shannon smiled at me as she spoke...`
`"Isn't Shannon scared too?`
` This house looks pretty strict...!"`
`"Nah, there's nothing scary about it.`
` You just thought it was scary, so it got scary."`
`"Then if I thought it was fun, would it get fun?!"`
`"Yeah, it would.`
` So here too, let's give it our all with a smile."`
`"...Shannon was my only friend in the Fukuin House.`
` She was confident and popular.`
` The complete opposite of me.`
` I was embarrassingly dull-witted, and no one wanted to be my friend."`
`"I would never have made it through those days in the Fukuin House had it not been for her encouragement.`
` ...So, I would probably make it through here too, with her by my side."`
`"Well, isn't it about time we got ready for bed?`
` I've got work early tomorrow morning, but you have a different job."`
`"That's right. Unlike everyone else, I have to go to school.`
` When I spend the night on Rokkenjima, I have to get ready for school and wait for Milady at the dock."`
`"Milady looks like an energetic person.`
` I hope you get along well!"`
`"D-Do you think I will...?`
` I'm so scared of school, so nervous...!"`
`"...I had grown used to life in the Fukuin House, so the more relaxed rules at school made life easy.`
` But until I grew used to it, everything was new, and everything made me nervous."`
`My new life on Rokkenjima probably deserves an explanation.`
`It was completely different from the comfortable yet stagnant life I'd lived at the Fukuin House.`
`In addition to the time I spent as a servant to the Ushiromiya family on Rokkenjima,`
` I also traveled to the elementary school on Niijima on school days.`
`It was the start of a time that was both rushed and busy, with hardly a moment to relax.`
`Unlike the time I spent at the Fukuin House, I didn't get to sleep in the same bed every day.`
`Half of the week, I slept in the servant waiting room in the Rokkenjima mansion.`
`I would return from school with Milady, go to the mansion, and work there as a servant.`
` I would then stay the night and go to school with Milady again the next day.`
`When I didn't have work, I would return to the dormitory on Niijima, where I could have some time to myself in the room that I was assigned to.`
`There was an adult dorm mother who strictly controlled mealtimes and lights-out,`
` but I was already used to that sort of life, so it wasn't hard for me.`
`The rooms were slightly larger than average and housed three people each.`
`However, either because of the number of people or some lucky chance, I was not given a three-person room.`
`"Looks like we'll share a dorm room too."`
`With Shannon by my side, I felt like I'd be able to manage well enough...`
`"Correct.`
` Every year, new servants came from the Fukuin House, replacing some of the old ones."`
`"It was something Father worked out with the House all on his own.`
` The rest of us weren't allowed to meddle."`
`"And after all, our family would strictly discipline these children without families and support them on their path to adulthood,`
` which I always viewed as the rich Ushiromiya family fulfilling its obligations to society."`
`"What sort of kids came to serve the Ushiromiya family?"`
`"I'm sure they were serious, `
`cute kids of irreproachable conduct!"`
`"It seemed to me that there were a lot of glaring hyenas among them."`
`"Let us say they had high ambitions.`
` They were pitiable children without families.`
` All were determined to use this rare opportunity to launch their careers, so that they could take control of their lives."`
`"Did all of them have to balance school and servant work?"`
`"That must be tough!`
` You wouldn't be able to get much work done!"`
`"Before that child, there were no cases of a servant going to school while they worked."`
`"To be honest, I was fairly surprised when that kid first came to greet me.`
` So obviously young.`
` The others were all around 16 or 18 years old, but that kid alone looked 10 years younger."`
`"That one extraordinarily young servant came to the family mainly for experience,`
` so not much was expected of that child's ability as a servant."`
`"Indeed.`
` You certainly couldn't rely on that kid as much as you could an adult, seasoned servant."`
`"To think that we would accept a child who hadn't even started school...`
` No knowledge of housework, no practical experience, and not even finished with mandatory education.`
` I don't know what Father was thinking, but I always thought there was something clearly odd about it."`
`"I spoke to Father about it.`
` I asked if it might be better to wait for this servant to graduate middle school before starting here."`
`"And what did Kinzo say?"`
`"Come on, we all know what he said."`
`""Oooooh, Beatriiiiice!!""`
`"Hahaha...`
` By that time, he was already a complete shut-in inside his study, obsessed with the occult.`
` If you tried to talk to him when he didn't want you to, he'd yell and tell you to stop interrupting 'the journey of his mind'."`
`"And Father's decisions are absolute.`
` ...However, the case of this particular child just didn't make sense."`
`"I even asked the Fukuin House about it.`
` They said to ask Genji-san.`
` I then asked Genji-san, and he said to ask the Master."`
`"And then you asked the Master, and he said 'Beatriiiiice'!"`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` No one knows the truth!"`
`"Jessica was the only child on the island.`
` The servants would often play with my daughter, but she wanted a friend of her own age.`
` Someone she could play with at home, as well as at school."`
`"...I began to think that Father employed this servant out of pity for Jessica.`
` ...But if that were the case, why wouldn't he talk to us about it beforehand?`
` We should be the ones to decide which friends are suitable for our daughter."`
`"Scaaary! Ahahahahaha!"`
`"Natsuhi must've really hated taking her kid out in public!"`
`"We should probably view this as an arrangement planned by Genji."`
`"...Probably.`
` ...Genji-san knew that the 'me' in this world carried Grandfather's blood,`
` so he probably arranged for that 'me' to be summoned to Rokkenjima."`
`"Are you feeling okay now?"`
`"...It was a really big shock, that's all.`
` ...I just feel a bit dizzy now."`
`"In this world, you're the Successor.`
` But if we move to a different world, you're a servant...or maybe a witch.`
` ...You do have a troubled fate."`
`"No kidding...`
` I don't regret learning about it, but if I could forget it now, I would."`
`"*giggle* Isn't it interesting?`
` Even though you're a servant, you're actually an illegitimate child of the Head...`
` Isn't that romantic, like some fairy tale?"`
`"...Romantic?`
` ...Considering how Mom must have felt, I'm not sure what to think."`
`"Heheheh, true.`
` In Natsuhi's eyes, the Lion of this world is nothing more than the baby she hated and was forced to raise.`
` And in this world, she rejected that child.`
` ...Natsuhi must adore her natural child Jessica a bunch more.`
` A baby that doesn't share your blood is nothing more than a dirty, lukewarm sack of filth."`
`"Have some decency.`
` Next time, I'll be the one pinching your butt."`
`"...Thank you, Will.`
` ...I think I understand, more or less.`
` And that's exactly why I need to be grateful to my mother.`
` She's raised me fairly all these years."`
`"Though at a probability so low it'd take a miracle to happen.`
` ...Animals are always brutal towards children that don't carry their blood.`
` Lions do that too, don't they? ...*giggle*giggle*."`
`"We can probably sketch out Genji's line of thinking.`
` ...The Lion of this world is a true, blood-related member of the Ushiromiya Family.`
` He must have wanted to let that child live on Rokkenjima somehow.`
` However, it wasn't as though he could just suddenly show up with Lion and tell everyone who this was."`
`"...Yeah.`
` Maybe he wanted me to live on the island until I was used to it, and then reveal everything when the chance presented itself."`
`"However, the Lion of this world was not given special treatment.`
` The silver ring doesn't actually exist."`
`"I wonder if that means Grandfather never heard about me."`
`"That might mean that Genji never found a good opportunity `
`to reveal the truth..."`
`"Genji must have wanted to tell the truth one day, `
`to tell that the orphan of Kinzo's beloved Beatrice was still alive.`
` However, that was not an easy thing to say."`
`"Why wasn't it easy?!"`
`"Dummy, what would happen if Natsuhi found out?!"`
`"Oh, right, if Lion suddenly appeared, Jessica wouldn't be the Successor anymore!"`
`Strictly speaking, Jessica wasn't the Successor, but since she'd be able to select the future Successor, it all came to the same thing.`
`"The more one learns, the less simple this tale becomes.`
` There were some who celebrated my birth, and some who did not.`
` ...Genji could only wait in silence for the proper day to reveal it all."`
`"Was it a tale hidden only within Genji's heart?"`
`"Lion and Kinzo and Natsuhi and Krauss and Jessica and everyone else!`
` None of them knew this tale!"`
`"Thus, the curtains slowly rise on this curious tale in the year 1976.`
` Oh, I am one yet many.`
` Why must fate abandon us and continue on its merry way...?"`
`People only found the young servant strange for the first month.`
`Natsuhi and Krauss's protests came to naught.`
`After all, there was no actual harm in it.`
`So why not indulge Kinzo's whim...?`
`Eventually, everyone grew accustomed...and began to accept this slightly abnormal everyday life.`
`"However, it was not so for the other Fukuin servants, who were always close by and who believed that everyone should be treated equally.`
` Their small bits of discontent over my special treatment began to accumulate as time went on..."`
`"Nice work, Sawachii.`
` How'd it go today?"`
`"Madam was really pissed off.`
` She was, like, running her finger across the windowsills!"`
`"Yeah, and getting on Tadacchi's case for cleaning slow.`
` Come on, give us a break!"`
`All of the kids in the Fukuin House are supposed to treat each other as family.`
`Because of this, everyone hides their original names and uses their new 'blessed names'.`
`Maybe because the 音 character is in the word 'Fukuin',`
` that character is almost always combined with at least one character from the child's original name to make their new name.`
`...Still, just giving a person a new name doesn't mean they'll accept it so easily.`
`Boys and girls, who have lived in isolation and through various trials, sometimes feel as though their real first and last names are a bond that's worth holding on to.`
`So, most of the Fukuin children hate their '音' names, calling each other by nicknames based on their original names.`
`Of course, that's only done privately.`
` When in the presence of the House Director or other important people, only the 'blessed names' are used.`
`On the job, the 'blessed names' are used.`
` And off the job, informal nicknames are used.`
`Everyone's very used to living with two names like this, so they're all comfortable with how the system works.`
`"Whoo, you stink.`
` Go take a shower."`
`"Dang, why's it so cramped in here?`
` Can't they get a bigger dorm if they have that huge mansion?"`
`"Hey, Garashi-saaan.`
` Why's Yasu the only one who isn't in a three-person room?"`
`By 'Yasu', they probably mean me.`
`I can't remember my parents at all, since they were gone as far back as my memory goes, ...but I was given the last name 'Yasuda' (安田).`
`And, apparently, my nickname comes from that.`
`"How should I know? Genji-sama's the one who decides the rooms.`
` I don't like it either."`
`"Yes, seriously!`
` Wouldn't it normally go 2 and 2?!"`
`"I mean, who exactly is Yasu anyway?"`
`"It looks like that kid's job is going to school with Milady or something.`
` ...So what, is being a school friend a profession now?`
` Doesn't make any sense."`
`...Of course, on days when I am given work, `
`I return to the mansion right after school and work alongside all the others.`
`I help out with caring for the garden and cleaning up the mansion.`
`I can't do any jobs on my own, so I'm always just helping out.`
`...Maybe because I'm young, the adult servants are always kind to me.`
`My fellow Fukuin servants don't seem too happy about that though.`
`"Don't you think Kumasawa-san's obviously soft on Yasu?`
` It's like she's mistaken Yasu for her own grandchild or something!"`
`"And why on earth does that kid get paid the same as the rest of us?`
` I don't get it!"`
`"...I realize that you have school to worry about,`
` but don't forget that you're a servant too, okay?`
` You need to stop being a helper and learn to do work by yourself like the rest of us.`
` We aren't going to let you take it easy forever, okay?"`
`............`
`I have been trying my best.`
`However, I'm not very strong yet, so I can't carry heavy things.`
` I can't carry a lot of things, either.`
`I can't fold clothes right, and I'm not good at using a dustpan.`
`I just can't do it as well as everyone else...`
`As my face turned red,`
` ...I spotted Shannon, who was watching from the sidelines and not joining in.`
`...Shannon is my only ally.`
`Unlike me, she can do everything well.`
`However, she'll never pamper me.`
`She'll show me how things are done, but she'll never steal my jobs from me.`
`She really is incredible.`
`I really want to be like Shannon, as soon as I can.`
`...She never talks behind people's backs, and no one talks behind her back.`
` She's kind, and she gets along with everyone.`
`I want to be like her.`
` And she's always kindly watching over my efforts to become like her.`
`"...Why...did I end up here?"`
`"I don't know."`
`Though I'd just been muttering to the ceiling,`
` Shannon gave me an honest answer.`
`"I guess there's no way to say it, except that it's part of God's plan."`
`"Is this another test from God...?"`
`"Yep.`
` Think of it as a test to help you grow into a wonderful human being.`
` After all, you're a special, chosen person."`
`"...Am I...`
`...special?"`
`"Of course you are.`
` After all, everyone else here is huge, but you were the only one special enough to be chosen young."`
`"Why am I the only one who's little?`
` I can't do any jobs by myself."`
`Everyone complains that I'm just there to play with Milady.`
`And yet, Madam made it clear that I am not to think of Milady as a friend or speak to her in a casual manner.`
`"You may be ten years younger than everyone else,`
` but that means, if you keep it up until you're the same age as the others,`
` you'll be much more experienced than the new people who come later.`
` Even Genji-sama will acknowledge your talents, and you'll become a leader who can teach the new kids who come from the Fukuin House."`
`"And then, I'm sure that everyone will respect you.`
` By that time, even Madam, the Master, and Krauss-sama will acknowledge your skills.`
` That's your future."`
`"...You mean like the ugly duckling becoming a swan?"`
`"That might be it.`
` After all, it was very unusual for you to be chosen as an Ushiromiya family servant.`
` ...In fact, that rumor might be true, `
`and you might be the secret child of someone in the Ushiromiya family.`
` *giggle*."`
`Shannon laughed, saying 'Wouldn't that be cool' and 'Then you'd be super-rich too'.`
`But that didn't seem quite right to me.`
`After all, ...if that was the case, why have I had to live all alone, here in the Fukuin House?`
`Shannon and people like the House Director are the only ones who will play with me.`
`I don't have any other friends to play with, ...and I've spent all my time by myself, in my isolated room.`
`Maybe it's because I'm frail and always sleep a lot, ...but it has been lonely.`
`"Hey, Genji!`
` Exactly how much did you know?"`
`"You never talk about anything, but you've known everything since the beginning, haven't you?"`
`"............"`
`"19 years ago,`
` you heard from Natsuhi that a servant had fallen from a cliff holding a baby."`
`"You went to the bottom of that cliff and realized that the baby was still alive, didn't you?"`
`"...I was not qualified `
`to determine whether it was alive or dead."`
`"Then who was?"`
`"The doctor, of course!"`
`""What do you say, Doctor Nanjo?!!""`
`"......`
`...Are you certain?`
` ...Is it all right for me to speak?"`
`"...If you are willing to tell the story yourself, `
`...then I ask it of you."`
`"......`
`Very well."`
`...I was contacted by Genji-san immediately after the accident...and asked to conduct an examination in secrecy.`
`"In secrecy?"`
`"Why?"`
`"...Both the Beatrice of Kuwadorian and her child were unregistered people who weren't supposed to exist.`
` It would lead to various problems if it went public..."`
`"I had started the procedures to have the baby registered, but they were not complete at that time.`
` ...It was a very unfortunate time for the baby to die."`
`"So, the servant who fell was treated as having died alone in an accident?"`
`"Natsuhi wouldn't talk to anyone.`
` It would've been easy to set up!"`
`"But that baby was alive, wasn't it?"`
`"Correct.`
` ...Of course, the child was gravely injured.`
` It was a miracle that it survived that wound.`
` If the angle had been slightly different,`
` or if Genji-san had been any slower in carrying the baby to me...`
` That baby only managed to survive thanks to a series of miracles."`
`"......I had given up.`
` I didn't believe the baby could have survived that."`
`"But it did."`
`"How strong and resilient is life!"`
`"No, this is fate."`
`"Fate!`
` So the baby was fated to live on and eventually accomplish something great?!"`
`"............`
`...Yes,`
` I did think it was fate.`
` I thought the blood of the Kuwadorian Beatrice-sama, whose life ended on Rokkenjima, `
`must have imparted something onto this child to make it survive."`
`"However, Genji did not tell his master, Kinzo, that the child had survived.`
` He simply said that it had fallen to its death in an unfortunate accident.`
`"Ooh, Beatrice, why have you run away from me once more?!"`
`"Why, even though I swore I'd never make the same mistake again, why?!!"`
`"There was one matter in which Genji did not trust the master he so respected.`
` That matter was whether Kinzo would be capable of accepting Beatrice's grandchild as her grandchild."`
`"Genji had served the Kuwadorian Beatrice for many years as well.`
` He was very aware of what she had felt.`
` He knew that she had accepted the favor Kinzo had bestowed on her and respected him as a father."`
`"However, her love was not the same as Kinzo's love.`
` Kinzo thought her to be Beatrice reborn...`
`and tried to use her to satisfy the many feelings he had felt for the late Beatrice.`
` Of course, the Kuwadorian Beatrice could not accept those feelings.`
` In the end, she had her chastity stolen `
`by the one she thought of as her only family and respected as a father..."`
`"She thought he was her father, and he thought she was his wife!"`
`"Oh, what irreconcilable, forbidden love!"`
`"...This is not to say that I was incapable of understanding how Kinzo-sama felt.`
` At the moment of her birth, even he did not plan on taking advantage of her...`
`due to her resemblance to the late Beatrice-sama."`
`"He...even spoke to me about it a few times when we were drinking.`
` I always thought he was just joking."`
`"Was he surprised to find that the daughter grew to look more and more like the mother?"`
`"As the daughter grew, did he suffer from a forbidden emotion he couldn't suppress?"`
`"...I thought...`
`...that he might commit the same mistake again.`
` ...That was my view."`
`"............"`
`"Beatrice-sama suffered much.`
` And yet, she never truly understood the difference between her feelings and Kinzo's.`
` ...Beatrice-sama consulted me many times, laying bare her deepest feelings.`
` However, I was unable to tell her."`
`"That would be hard to say!"`
`"Imagine telling her that the one she respects as a father wants to use her as a replacement for her dead mother!"`
`"...Let me say this for the sake of Kinzo-san's honor.`
` He also suffered greatly.`
` It pained him when he found that he could no longer think of his daughter as a daughter.`
` ...I told him to love her as a father.`
` I think Kinzo-san followed his logic and his conscience...and fought for quite some time..."`
`"Kinzo loved her.`
` He poured his affection onto the daughter that Beatrice had left behind.`
` He did so as a father.`
` And yet, if so, why did he give the daughter the same name as the mother?"`
`"Yes, Kinzo's sin started from the moment she received life.`
` She was born, and Beatrice died.`
` ...He passed the name down from mother to daughter.`
` From the moment of her birth, Kinzo had already decided that she was Beatrice reborn..."`
`"So, then we get Lion.`
` ...Kinzo, trying to atone for his sin,`
` tried to make Lion a proper member of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"...Exactly.`
` I get the feeling I'll get my butt pinched if I talk about other Fragments, `
`...but what if there was a Fragment...`
`...where Lion is accepted...`
`and Kinzo commits the same sin again?`
` Wanna see if we can find one of those?`
` *giggle*giggle*..."`
`"Who would want to see something like that?!`
` ...Is this your job, mixing up the worst possible delusions and possibilities for every part of a person's life and sneering at them?!"`
`"Unfortunately, that's the sort of demon she is."`
`"How rude. I'm a witch.`
` *giggle*..."`
`"......Genji foresaw that worst of all possible futures, and, trying to secure a better future, he intentionally lied about the baby being dead."`
`"Right.`
` Kinzo was a man so impulsive that he used his own daughter.`
` Genji, who knew Beatrice's feelings and felt sympathy for her, couldn't trust Kinzo so easily."`
`"Even Genji, Kinzo's most devoted servant?"`
`"Genji draws a clear line between the professional and the personal.`
` While he served Kinzo faithfully, he also felt that the mistake Kinzo had made with his daughter was not one to be forgiven easily."`
`"...Could be.`
` And to make sure that Lion wouldn't be found out easily, Genji lied about the kid's age, lowering it by three years."`
`"That's a good point.`
` In this world, I'm just entering elementary school in 1976.`
` I was actually supposed to become a 4th year then."`
`"If your frailness wasn't the reason, ...then Genji must have been careful to disguise the year of your birth.`
` Not only Kinzo, but also Natsuhi, ...wouldn't easily forget the baby from 19 years ago.`
` If a suspiciously young servant of that age came to the island, Natsuhi's woman's intuition would definitely have picked up on it."`
`Had the child been too sick to go to school for three years?`
`Or had the age been faked, so that Natsuhi wouldn't figure everything out?`
`"Either way, we know that your age has been lowered by three in this world."`
`"...Correct.`
` The age of this world's Lion has been altered by three.`
` ...This is a small, feeble kid we're talking about.`
` An underdeveloped kid.`
` It would've been more possible to pull off than you'd think."`
`"Genji decided to wait and see.`
` In the end, would Kinzo be able to accept Beatrice's child as an actual child, or not?`
` He had the child live in the Fukuin House until a suitable age, and then summoned the child to the island as a servant.`
` Both father and child had no clue who the other was.`
` Genji had an idea:`
` if Kinzo truly felt affection as a parent,`
` he would notice traces of that deceased mother and daughter in this child."`
`"That way, they would surely regain their parent-child relationship, without anyone having to expose the truth to them.`
` That's what he thought.`
` ...Or, perhaps, the time might come naturally.`
` When that happened, he could tell the truth to both father and child.`
` Believing that this day would eventually come, Genji told nothing of this to anyone.`
` ...He watched over Beatrice's child, waiting for the fated day..."`
`And time continued to pass.`
`Days slid by as he quietly watched over Beatrice's child...`
`"Yasu,`
` what'd you do with the small broom?"`
`"...Didn't you use it to clean the window frames?"`
`Ah, ......`
`The small broom is a little, thin broom that looks like a large paintbrush.`
`We use it to clear out the dust in small corners, like window frames.`
`It's one of the cleaning tools I was put in charge of...`
`"Come on, that's your responsibility!`
` What have you been doing, idiot?!"`
`"Quickly, go and find it...`
` You have to do it before Madam finds out..."`
`"What's up?"`
`"Yasu lost the small broom again.`
` The kid must be some sort of genius at losing things!"`
`"That's why I'm always telling you, never give things to Yasu.`
` Yasu's always careless and losing things."`
`"Don't say that. Can't you see that this kid's working hard...?`
` Go on, hurry and find it.`
` I'll wait for you."`
`O-Okay...`
`Not wanting to hear my fellow servants complain even more, I spun around and headed off.`
`If you lose a tool, you get in trouble.`
` If no one knows who did it, we all get yelled at,`
` so one of them will probably tell Madam that it was my fault.`
`Still, it really is my fault that I lost it in the first place.`
`I wonder when I lost it.`
`When, when...`
`We cleaned out the entire chapel today.`
`The chapel is a large building behind the mansion.`
` However, no one ever goes near it normally.`
`Even so, we are ordered to clean it a few times each year.`
`Kinzo calls it a sacred building, so Natsuhi is very strict about it...`
`We'd cleaned every little nook and cranny, from top to bottom.`
`It had taken all day.`
`I had been in charge of cleaning the window frames, but I had also been given many smaller tasks.`
`While those small jobs were keeping me busy, I completely forgot about the small broom,`
` and I must've left it lying around somewhere.`
`...I began to hate myself for it.`
`This isn't the first time this has happened.`
`It happens all the time.`
`Every time I set something down, it always disappears.`
`It goes somewhere else. Vanishes.`
`I thought it was probably the witch, Beatrice, pranking me.`
`The ghost of the witch gained power from Rokkenjima's evil spirits and was reborn.`
`Until Kumasawa-san told me, I never knew the meaning of the shrine on the rocks by the sea......`
`"Kumasawa told an old, old tale, passed down among the local fishermen.`
` Rokkenjima used to be known as Akujikishima,`
` and terrible evil spirits who ate human souls lived there..."`
`"Hey, Kumasawa!`
` Let us hear too!"`
`"Tell us the scary, scary tale of Rokkenjima's evil spirits!"`
`"Hohoho, very well, very well.`
` Rokkenjima was once called Azukishima.`
` However, even deeper in the distant past, it was known as Akujikishima.`
` It was rumored that sailors who went too near the island were dragged down to the bottom of the sea and had their souls eaten.`
` ...Yes, frightening spirits such as those do exist on this island.`
` Hohohoho."`
`"It was Kumasawa's favorite ghost story.`
` Every new servant who came to the island heard about it.`
` ......Such stories are usually laughed off,`
` but when stormy nights visited Rokkenjima, bringing an eerie howling to that lonely island where nothing exists except the Ushiromiya mansion, everyone would listen meekly."`
`"The shrine by the coast was there to seal the evil spirits away!"`
`"And the Master had that creepy occult hobby!"`
`"And the mansion was so spooky, it was easy to picture something hiding in the shadows!"`
`"Hohohoho.`
` True, true.`
` The traveling shugenja monk was only barely able to suppress those spirits.`
` The seal just managed to hold them, but to this very day, they wander through the mansion, night after night, searching for a victim.`
` Hohohoho..."`
`"Have you seen the Master's study?!"`
`"I have!`
` It's like some kind of demon laboratory!"`
`"There's that rumor about the Master researching demons!"`
`"They also say he's researching how to revive his mistress, Beatrice!"`
`"Didn't they say he was gathering children to be sacrifices for his magic experiments?!"`
`"Waah, scary!`
` What'd you do if the Master asked you to come into the study alone?!"`
`"I heard that, long ago, one kid went into the study and never came out!"`
`"That must've been a victim of an experiment to give Beatrice's ghost a new body!"`
`"Hohoho.`
` Very true. Beatrice-sama has become a ghost...and wanders around searching for a body.`
` The VIP room on the second floor is where Beatrice-sama dwells...`
` You must always be respectful when cleaning that room...`
` If you aren't...`
`...uhihihihihhihhiii!"`
`"In the eyes of teenage boys and girls, with their powerful imaginations, the ghost story was both terrifying and fascinating.`
` It gave them a sense of solidarity, since they all got to experience the same tale.`
` Then, that sharing became an obligation,`
` and accepting the story became a rite of passage for joining the community.`
` This was something that had been passed on since long ago."`
`"That's right.`
` Back when I first started work at Rokkenjima, `
`I heard that story from Kumasawa-san and the older servants."`
`"I heard about it too, mostly from Nee-san."`
`"I heard it too.`
` From Kumasawa-san, mainly."`
`"So, not only the timid-looking Shannon,`
` but a boy, Kanon, and a big adult, Gohda, believed in the ghost story?"`
`"Well, I didn't really..."`
`"There are tales of ghost stories and jinxes in all jobs.`
` There were several stories of the sort at the hotel I once worked at."`
`"So, you thought it was silly, and you didn't mind it at all?"`
`"...I think there was a need to blend with the community."`
`"That's it.`
` Ghost stories and jinxes are the local rules of your workplace.`
` If a newcomer breaks those rules, they can't expect to be welcomed in."`
`"Exactly.`
` ...If I said witches couldn't possibly exist, that the whole idea was ridiculous, then I'd get into a fight with Nee-san.`
` It was easier if I just appeared to go along with it."`
`"Come on. If you think that way, you'll be cursed...`
` There was one servant who got seriously injured..."`
`"Hahaha, all workplaces have stories like that.`
` No matter how incredible the ghost stories and tales about the company founder are, you accept and believe them.`
` That's what it means to blend in with your new workplace."`
`""Wow!`
` Everyone's so mature!""`
`I went to each window around the chapel in the order I had cleaned them, `
`searching carefully in all the places I might have left it.`
`I had been cleaning the windows with it, so it had probably been set down near one of those.`
`When did I leave it behind, I wonder...`
`Now that I think about it, I don't think I had it anymore when I reached the last window,`
` so I must've completely forgotten to clean that window frame.`
`"......Ah."`
`Through the window, I could see the others leaving one after another.`
`Shannon turned around and glanced up, looking worried.`
`...I don't want to be responsible for making everyone wait, so I'm actually glad they're leaving without me...`
`If I said I wanted them to wait for me, I'd be relying on them too much...`
`The sun's beginning to set, and the chapel's getting darker and darker.`
`I don't want to hang around in a place like this all by myself.`
`I'd better find the small broom fast.`
`No, that's not all.`
` I also need to clean the window frames I forgot.`
`Madam is strict.`
` She'll probably check all of the windows carefully.`
`If she does, I'll be the one who gets in trouble tomorrow.`
`But really, where did I lose it?`
` Why did I lose it?`
`The darkness grew and grew.`
`...When it became dark enough that I would need a light before long, I began to panic.`
`I dashed around and around the chapel, tears streaming down my face...`
`As I stumbled about pathetically,`
` I could feel the presence of a prankster witch, giggling at me from the crack of the door and gaps in the ceiling.`
`The ghost of Beatrice, the Master's mistress, wanders about in search of a body to this very day.`
`As she absorbs the power of Rokkenjima's evil spirits, her strength steadily grows, and she waits for the day of her resurrection.`
`And, ...for some reason, she's peeking out at me,`
` and if I ever take my eyes off something for a second, she snatches it away and hides it.`
`This isn't the first time this has happened.`
`Whenever I look away, ...keys, handkerchiefs, pencils, erasers...`
`all of them vanish almost right away.`
`Even though I was planning to use them later, or just wanted to put them in their proper place,`
` they disappear as soon as I turn around.`
`It isn't someone hiding them as a prank.`
`It's happened many times when I'm the only person around.`
`...Everyone always says I'm too careless and forgetful, and they laugh at me, ...get mad at me.`
`I do try to be alert, `
`but like some kind of bad joke, I lose things easily when I forget about them for just a short while.`
`So, sometimes, I think 'this eraser is gonna disappear sooner or later', and I stare at it.`
` But at those times alone, it doesn't disappear.`
` Nothing disappears when I'm alert.`
`But as soon as I think I'm safe, and the tension relaxes just a bit, then something else will disappear...!`
` Why is it always me...?!`
`*giggle*giggle*, `
`...hehehehehahahaha...`
`...Yeah, I hear you.`
`I can tell that the witch is laughing at me as I lamely run around in circles...`
`*giggle*giggle*, `
`...hehehehahahaha...`
` Ahahahahahahahahahaha...`
`Listening to that voiceless laugh, I finally slammed my hands against the wall, crying tears of frustration.`
`"Please, just stop it...!!`
` Why do you always hide my things and get me in trouble?!"`
`And, the witch answered.`
`Fool.`
` ...Isn't it obvious?`
`Why else, except to entertain myself by watching you wander about pointlessly?`
` *cackle*cackle*, hyahhahahahahahahahhahhahha...!!`
`I couldn't bear it.`
` Even though I knew what she said was true, hearing it said directly was incredibly annoying.`
`I understand.`
`That small broom probably is somewhere in this chapel.`
`No, that's not quite it.`
` I'm sure that the moment before I reached this window, it was right there on the windowsill.`
`That's right, I'm sure I put it by this window.`
`But the prankster witch Beatrice used her magic,`
` and just before I reached this spot, she instantly teleported the small broom to the next window over.`
`The instant I approached that window,`
` a hole appeared beneath the small broom, swallowing it up.`
`And it came out by the next window after that.`
`It landed right inside it, as though it had been there the whole time.`
`And this happened over and over again!`
`As I ran up to that window, the small broom fell into a magic hole and went to the next window.`
` And when I went to that window, it went to the next window...!`
`And I realized that she was just making fun of me!`
`So no matter how much I searched, it would be useless.`
`But if I stop searching, it'll be just sitting there by one window or another.`
`So, this isn't a search.`
` It's a test of endurance.`
`I kept chasing after the small broom,`
` and Beatrice kept making it escape to the next window over, trying to make me give up.`
`This is an eternal chase...that'll end only when one of us gives up...!`
`So, I kept going around and around, even to windows that I knew I'd already searched.`
`If it's not by this one, then try the next one, and the next one.`
`And the witch kept moving the small broom to the next window, and the next...!`
`"Just give it a rest...!!`
` How long are you going to make fun of me?`
` This isn't the only time... You always do this!!"`
`*giggle*, `
`heh`
`heh`
`hah`
`hahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
`The shrill, voiceless laugh of the formless witch continued to mock my sobbing.`
`The witch is right beside me, laughing at me.`
`As I dash around the chapel, she's following along with me, taunting me.`
`Then...`
`she must be...`
`there.`
`She's right behind me, just over my shoulder,`
` still cackling away.`
`I know that turning around won't help, since she has no form.`
`I can try to look, but I mustn't look with my eyes.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`Once my eyes tell me there's nothing there, I won't be able to '~ib~see~ib~' anymore.`
`I learned that from the Director of the Fukuin House.`
` ...You mustn't try to see with your eyes.`
` ...You must 'see' with the eyes of your heart.`
`The whole world is filled with God's love.`
` In the many blessings of everyday life, one can see God, angels, and the Holy Ghost.`
`If you try to look with your eyes, you won't see them, so you won't be able to 'see' them.`
` So you won't be able to feel them or understand them.`
`With the eyes of the heart, you will quietly understand.`
`You don't look at their image.`
` You 'see'...and draw them with your heart.`
`In this way, I learned how to recognize beings not of this world at the Fukuin House.`
`...It doesn't just mean being able to 'see' God.`
`This power lets one 'see' all of those not of this world.`
`"...Please, stop it now.`
` Stop this prank."`
`"......Hoh.`
` ...So, you can speak to me?"`
`"I'm clumsy, bad at my job, ...and I do put things down and forget about them a lot.`
` ...But I know which things were my fault, and which things were because of your pranks."`
`"How amusing...`
` Not only can you perceive me in my formless state, but you even understand my little game.`
` ......It seems you're a more interesting creature than I thought,`
` Yasu."`
`...I'm usually called Yasu when one of the older servants is laughing behind my back at some mistake I've made.`
`So, when I hear that name, it feels bad.`
`She called me, not by the blessed name given to me by the Fukuin House, `
`but by that unblessed name.`
`Upsetting the heart is a classic move that evil beings make.`
`They do it to make it harder for people to notice their presence.`
`To beings like witches, being understood is like shoving them out into the light of day.`
`"...It won't work.`
` In the Fukuin House, I learned how to perceive those not of this world.`
` So, I'm already able to understand you."`
`"Very interesting.`
` ......You've taken me, a being so faint that I'd fly away if you blew on me, and trapped me, perceived me.`
` ...You're an interesting kid, Yasu!"`
`"It won't work.`
` I've now understood and perceived you.`
` No matter how many unpleasant things you say, you'll just expose the ugliness of your heart."`
`Without turning around, ...I slowly let my range of vision fill the entire chapel.`
`It was as though the viewpoint of my soul was floating out from the shell of my head.`
`...See?`
` ...Inch by inch, `
`...my range of vision is floating out of my head...`
`...and drifting upwards.`
`As I looked down at myself, standing there with head hanging and eyes tightly shut...`
`!s0`
`...very slowly...`
`...rose up to the ceiling of the chapel.`
`And when I looked down from there...`
`I saw myself, standing in the center of the chapel, ...and the witch standing behind me.`
`...Apparently, the witch realized that I could 'see' her.`
`She turned around...`
`...and raised her eyes to look at the eyes of my heart, floating by the ceiling...`
`...At last, `
`I could see the witch Beatrice...`
`...with the eyes of my heart...`
`"A mere Human...`
`...that can perceive my form...?"`
`The demonic lips...twisted in an ugly curve.`
`It was clearly a challenging, repulsive...demon's smile...`
`She wore a blood-red dress and hat.`
` The design was completely different from anything Humans wore.`
`Her hair was blonde.`
` It had countless beautiful curls, like a princess from a picture book,`
` ...but there was no trace of cuteness about her.`
`"...I did think you were a bit different from the other Humans,`
` but it seems I was mistaken."`
`"............"`
`"Forget just 'a bit', you're nothing like those other Humans.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"You sad witch, who can be seen by no one, heard by no one.`
` ...Have you been pulling these pranks all the time just to catch the attention of Humans...?"`
`"I use what little magic I have to interfere when Humans aren't looking, but no matter what I do, none of them think it's magic.`
` ...They decide that they just made a little mistake,`
` and blow my existence away like the candles on a cake."`
`"If so, then I've just saved you.`
` Because I understand you...and have perceived you."`
`"...Saved me?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` To me, this meeting with you is nothing more than a new way to kill time."`
`"It's getting dark.`
` I don't have time to play with you anymore."`
`"Oho.`
` My apologies. I was so engrossed that I didn't notice the time."`
`"...Please give it back.`
` My cleaning tool."`
`"That small broom, or whatever you call it?`
` It's right there, by the next window."`
`"But as soon as I get close, you'll move it to the next window over."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` My form is elusive, as is my magic.`
` With a snap of my fingers, I can do anything...!"`
`The witch snapped her fingers, and various things throughout the chapel were sucked into a black pitfall beneath them, disappearing.`
`No, they didn't disappear.`
` The instant they vanished into the dark holes, other dark holes appeared in completely different parts of the chapel, and the vanished objects fell out of those.`
`Chairs, musical scores, clocks, and vases started appearing and disappearing all across the room.`
`It made it feel as though countless tools were flying about the chapel...`
`"I can do things like this, but don't.`
` After all, this would be a bit beyond a mere prank, don't you think...?"`
`I wonder what the difference between a prank and magic is to a witch.`
`When she snapped her fingers again, all of the loud, flying objects returned to their original spots,`
` and silence fell.`
`"I've taken a liking to you.`
` ...You've perceived and captured me?`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` It works the same in reverse.`
` I've perceived and captured you."`
`"............"`
`The Fukuin Director told me not to try and 'see' evil beings.`
`If you 'see' them, they will possess you.`
`Now that I understood this witch, a bond had been formed between us.`
`"That is correct.`
` Now that you have acknowledged my existence, I have formed a bond with you.`
` ...After all the years I've spent in boredom, it will be nice to have a young kid like you to talk to."`
`"I'll talk to you from time to time.`
` So, will you stop pulling pranks like this?"`
`"No, I'm not here to talk to you, but to play with you!`
` *cackle*cackle* And if we're playing, pranks are just part of the game, right?"`
`"............"`
`"Heheh.`
` ...Very well.`
` I've had enough fun for one day.`
` The sun has sunk and the moon is full.`
` I'm a bit tired after appearing in front of you for so long.`
` Let us call it a night.`
` Look how much fun we had with just a single broom...!"`
`"Please, give it back."`
`"No way.`
` I'll keep this as a token of our meeting.`
` Got a problem with that?"`
`"...If I said I did, would you give it back to me?"`
`"I never listen to Humans!`
` ...However, I might lend an ear to a friend."`
`"...If you give it back, ...I'll acknowledge you as a friend."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!`
` Foolish Human, did you actually think that alone would make me want to deal...?!`
` ...If you want to make a deal with me, try drawing a mysterious magic circle or two!`
` ...And yet, I might consider your proposal."`
`"What do you mean, you might...?"`
`"I'll take my time in deciding whether you're worthy to be my friend.`
` ...After all, to be a witch is to be a contrarian, an amanojaku!`
` If you ask us for an answer, we'll never give one right away.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"...Understood.`
` Then, ...I'll leave the small broom with you.`
` Please give it back when you decide to become my friend."`
`"Very well.`
` Will this broom become a bridge of friendship between us, or not?`
` ...I will hang onto it for now, making my decision in my own good time."`
`When the witch snapped her fingers, the broom for which I had searched so long fell out of a hole in the air,`
` landing between the fingers she had just snapped...`
`"This is goodbye.`
` ...This game with you was far from boring.`
` Let us play again sometime."`
`"If you're my friend, that is."`
`"When a cat toys with a mouse, does it try to become friends with it first?`
` *cackle*cackle*, ahahahahahahahahahaa!!"`
`The witch faded away...`
`As she did, the eyes of my heart shut themselves...`
`When I returned to my body, I felt suddenly tired and let out the breath I'd been holding.`
`...Of course, when I turned around, there was no one to be seen.`
`I couldn't feel the witch's presence anywhere anymore.`
`It had gotten very dark by this time.`
`I decided to leave the chapel.`
`There's no point in searching for the small broom any longer.`
`...Not until the witch decides to give it back.`
`I went out of the chapel.`
`The chapel key had been left in the lock.`
` I used it to lock the door.`
`...What am I going to do about the small broom?`
`There's nothing I can do.`
` I can't even blame the witch.`
`I must acknowledge that I'm responsible for giving the witch a chance...`
`"......Nn-"`
`When I happened to glance downwards, ...I saw a small broom lying there by my feet.`
`It was the broom I had been searching for all this time.`
`...Don't tell me...`
`that it'll be swallowed up by a dark hole the instant I bend over to pick it up...?`
`No.`
`This is...a sign from the witch.`
`A sign that she acknowledges me as a friend.`
`I picked it up.`
`Oh, I am one yet many.`
`"The first friend I made after coming to the island was apparently not a Human at all.`
` However, when I think back on it, it was only natural.`
` What other sort of friend would you expect to make on a witch's island?`
` This was the first meeting between me and Beatrice."`
`"...However, as some of you listeners may have noticed, this was not a meeting with the real Beatrice.`
` The witch I then called Beatrice would later be known by another name."`
`"...However, she was clearly not human.`
` And being bonded with one who is not human means being bonded with their world.`
` I still had no way of knowing the varied fates that waited for me on Rokkenjima..."`
`End of Chapter 2: The First Friend.`
`"Yeah, seriously.`
` Not only was Yasu slow-witted, that kid also lost stuff all the time."`
`"But even so, Yasu always had this look, like someone else had taken whatever it was away.`
` It really pissed me off!"`
`"That kid just didn't know how to concentrate.`
` If you always act in that dreamy way without thinking, it's no surprise that you'll do bad work."`
`"But it was only like that in the beginning, right...?`
` After some time, that kid started concentrating, and all of that bad stuff stopped happening..."`
`"Hmm, really?`
` Well, it was all stuff that anyone should be able to do anyway."`
`"Learning to do things that everyone can do is part of growing up.`
` I doubt the rest of you were so clever about everything when you first started, yes?"`
`"...Are you kidding?`
` If we weren't clever, we'd never have been selected to work for the Ushiromiya family."`
`"We're supposed to be the elite!!`
` The fact that Yasu was young was no excuse."`
`"That's right.`
` ...If Yasu is supposed to learn cleverness by growing up, then that should've been done before coming to work for the Ushiromiyas."`
`"Come on...`
` That kid worked really hard to balance school and work...`
` I think you're all being too harsh..."`
`"We were selected because we made it through a harsh process, right?`
` There's no need for us to pamper Yasu."`
`"I'm sick of this.`
` I don't get why someone as dull-witted as Yasu was chosen!"`
`"Being selected as an Ushiromiya family servant was an achievement that all Fukuin children respected.`
` The older servants had achieved glory by making it through the strict selection process.`
` Yasu was so clumsy that they all wondered why that child had been chosen."`
`"...Of course, Yasu was working very hard for a child of that age.`
` However, before long, `
`the unsatisfied older servants started being mean to Yasu whenever they got the chance.`
` Even after getting used to life on Rokkenjima, Yasu didn't manage to make a single friend.`
` At least, not any Human friends..."`
`"Chapter 3:`
` Days Enraptured."`
`"Hohohohoho.`
` Yes, that can sometimes happen, and always when you're busy.`
` Perhaps a fairy is pulling pranks on you."`
`"...It's a witch pulling pranks on me.`
` I mean, I knew I'd put it right there, and when I looked away for just a second, ...it had disappeared..."`
`The witch had pranked me again.`
`I left my master key behind, `
`Madam found out, and I got in a lot of trouble.`
`...But I always put my master key in my pocket after I use it...`
` ...Why was it in a place like that...?`
`And this is the third time it's happened.`
`The last two times, I realized that it wasn't in my pocket and managed to find it before anyone found out.`
`But the third time, Madam found it.`
`I was really mad and frustrated with that witch in the red dress.`
`"Hohoho, Beatrice-sama's pranks can be quite troublesome.`
` But if you're dealing with a witch, shouldn't a ritual of some sort do the trick?"`
`"A ritual...?"`
`Kumasawa-san started fishing through the kitchen cupboards, saying 'now where did that get to'.`
`The thing she finally found and brought to me...was a kite string.`
`She stretched it out for me to see, then used a knife to cut off a 50 cm piece.`
`"Try tying this end to the key...`
` Then tie the other end to your pocket button or some other place that doesn't stick out.`
` ...This charm represents the ritual of the spiderweb."`
`"A spiderweb?`
` Like the ones the evil spirits of Rokkenjima fear?"`
`"Good, I'm glad you remember.`
` It is said that the spiderwebs on this island are imbued with magical power, and that they can be quite effective at repelling evil.`
` See? If you stretch it out like this, it looks like a spiderweb, doesn't it?`
` Hohoho, this way, that spiderweb-hating Beatrice won't be able to prank you anymore."`
`That...does make sense.`
`It really does look like a spiderweb when pulled tight.`
` ......Since Kumasawa-san says so, it must have some pretty strong evil-repelling power.`
`I can just ask her to make several of these kite strings for me, `
`and then I can tie them to everything I don't want to lose.`
`...But, of course, that wouldn't be very practical.`
`I'd have strings all over me.`
`"What about things I can't keep tied to me,`
` ...like pencils and erasers?"`
`"Hohoho, for times like that, there's a different ritual.`
` All you have to do is make a house for Mr. Pencil and Mr. Eraser."`
`Make a house...?`
`...You mean, build a roof and a bed and stuff??`
`"You aren't actually building a house, you're giving them one.`
` ...For example, take the knife I cut the string with.`
` 'I wanna go hooome!'`
` Heheheh, he's such a lonely kid that he wants to go home the moment he steps outside.`
` So, if you leave him anywhere else, he'll get lost and start crying."`
`"...See, we just left Mr. Knife lying there, so he got lonely and started crying."`
`"...Poor thing.`
` We have to get Mr. Knife home..."`
`"Mr. Knife's house is right here.`
` See, his whole family of knives is waiting for him.`
` 'Mama-, I'm hooome.' 'Welcome baaack.' See?"`
`Kumasawa-san returned the knife to the knife-holder under the sink.`
`Even though she had done something so ordinary, I felt slightly moved, `
`as though the lost little knife had finished his adventure and finally returned home.`
`Once he slid into the spot he was supposed to be in,`
` all the knives would be together and could have a party...`
`Then, Kumasawa-san said we should give them their privacy, and shut the door...`
`"The poor things hidden by the witch must get lonely easily.`
` So, when the witch tells them she'll take them somewhere fun, they're happy to go along with her.`
` How can you stop them from doing this?"`
`"Take them home right away..."`
`"Exactly.`
` They're lonely, naughty kids, so they'll go with the witch if they get the chance.`
` So, you must always take them home quickly."`
`"...Look at that Mr. Key you just tied to a string.`
` He's sitting there all alone, crying and asking you to put him in his home in your pocket."`
`*sob*sob*...`
` I'm lonely.`
`The voice of the lonely master key finally reached my ears.`
`I hurried to pick it up, took the other end of the string and tied it to my pocket button,`
` and put the key in my pocket.`
`"See, 'I'm hooome'.`
` Mr. Key gets lonely so easily, so let's take him home right after we use him, okay?`
` If you keep making little friends like this, even Beatrice-sama won't be able to prank you much longer..."`
`*clink*!!`
`When break time was over and I stood up to see what I should help with next,`
` I felt a tug, and the key ring with the master key fell to the floor.`
`...Once again, I had left the master key on the side of the sofa and forgotten it was there.`
`The instant I stood up, the string pulled on it and it fell to the floor.`
`Without Kumasawa-san's spiderweb charm,`
` I would probably have left that master key lying here again.`
`The master key left all alone would have been led away by the witch and disappeared...`
`Whew, that was close...`
`And, once again, I heard the master key, who had almost been left on its own,`
` cry and tell me that it wanted to go home...`
`"...I'm sorry.`
` Come on, let's go back home to my pocket..."`
`Yay, I'm home!`
`............`
`...Thank goodness.`
` ...I almost got pranked by the witch again...`
`"Oh, what's this...?!`
` What an amusing notion, using string like that!"`
`All of a sudden, I heard a wild, shocked voice from over my shoulder.`
`It was a voiceless voice.`
` A witch's voice, the kind you can't hear unless you try.`
`"...Beatrice...?"`
`"That's me, my friend.`
` You forgot about your key again, and just when I was about to tease you a bit..."`
`"It's a spiderweb charm that Kumasawa-san showed me.`
` Apparently, it does its job well."`
`"Indeed.`
` I hate to admit it, but it does.`
` I certainly wouldn't want to touch that.`
` After all, you wouldn't want to put your finger on a razor and slide it across, would you?"`
`"...Uwa, ...that's a scary example...`
` My finger hurts just thinking about it..."`
`"But good for you.`
` You didn't have to get yelled at by Natsuhi for losing your key again.`
` *cackle*cackle* You should be thanking me!"`
`"Why?"`
`"Because I annoyed you, you learned of that ritual, correct?`
` Thanks to that, you've managed to avoid the screw-up of forgetting where you'd left your key once again.`
` In other words, it is all thanks to me.`
` Wahahahaha, don't I deserve some gratitude?"`
`"Nng, ...nnnnn..."`
`I really don't like it, but she does have a point.`
`Because of all the trouble Beatrice caused me, I talked to Kumasawa-san and learned the ritual from her.`
`Even without the witch's pranking,`
` ...if I didn't have that ritual, I would've gone to my next job and left the master key here.`
`If that happened, ...then surely, I wouldn't have been able to find the key, and it would've been a big mess.`
`"We call this 'punishment to make an example'.`
` By magnifying your mistakes, I've shown you what they are, as a friend!`
` Don't you see how much you've grown?"`
`"...Nng, nnnn...`
` I get the feeling that Kumasawa-san is the one I should be thanking, not you."`
`"My, my.`
` What a thankless job we witches have.`
` *cackle*."`
`"Anyway,`
` I win this time.`
` Okay, I need to get back to work now."`
`"Very well, my friend.`
` We'll call this your victory."`
`"However, I'm bad at giving up.`
` I'll keep watching you, even more closely now, until I can even the score.`
` Prepare yourself.`
` There are still several small items that a person like you is likely to forget.`
` You can't attach strings to all of them.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"The spiderweb ritual isn't the only one I have.`
` ...I also learned the 'take them home' ritual.`
` I won't let you have your way anymore."`
`"Hmph.`
` Let's see how well you actually do.`
` Even so,`
` that's quite the bright smile you've got there.`
` When a witch appears, it should be time to cry, not laugh.`
` Your break time is over.`
` See if you can manage to do your job today without slowing down the older servants."`
`"Sure. Today is Sunday, and the weather is wonderful.`
` I'd better do my best."`
`"Indeed, go to it with all you can manage.`
` Oh, that's right. Sanon's been in a bad mood all morning.`
` You'd better try and avoid eye contact with her.`
` Also, your fortune for the day is 'water hazard'.`
` Make sure you take care when standing near buckets of water.`
` ...This is you we're talking about.`
` I'll be waiting for you to knock over a bucket and get scolded just like usual."`
`"*giggle*`
` ...Thank you, Beatrice."`
`Back when I still couldn't 'see' her...`
`I simply hated this prank-loving witch.`
`But now that I could talk with her, ...it felt as though she wasn't all bad.`
`Of course, there was no need for me to be grateful to her.`
`To the witch called Beatrice, who despises boredom, mocking the misfortune of others is like what eating food is to us.`
`Humans and witches are different.`
` Incompatible beings.`
`And yet, ...it felt as though we could become friends.`
`Of course, she's still a witch.`
` I mustn't get careless.`
`And yet, not being careless is a good thing.`
`Thanks to the tricks and rituals I use to keep her at bay, I'm able to concentrate.`
` That could hardly be a bad thing.`
`Those things will be useful for my job and my life, even when I don't have to worry about the witch's pranks.`
`I see, so this witch called Beatrice really is like a demon.`
`Apparently, it's possible to build up a friendship even while speaking hostilely to each other...`
`"Ever since then, there was an incredible change in that kid."`
`"Because of all the rituals?!"`
`"Hohohoho.`
` That's right.`
` That child was quite faithful when it came to obeying rules...`
`and flawlessly followed all of the rituals I taught."`
`"You mean, by attaching strings to everything?`
` And by doing that 'going hooome' thing all the time?"`
`"Yes.`
` That kid would sometimes say it out loud.`
` It was really cute, like watching someone play house with a bunch of tools."`
`"Just like a kid!"`
`"But they were a kid, right?"`
`""Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!""`
`"With adults, you can say something one way and all of them will understand.`
` However, there really are many different types of kids, and you need many different ways to teach them things.`
` If you can find just the right way, they learn quite easily."`
`"Some kids learn better when they're punished, and some learn better when they're praised."`
`"I used to scare a neighborhood kid and tell him that a fairy would take his things if he didn't keep good track of them.`
` Hohoho, this was the same, except the fairy became a witch..."`
`"Still, doesn't that sound like fate?!"`
`"After all, you knew this kid was Beatrice's child, didn't you?"`
`"Yes, I did know."`
`"It must have been strange...`
`to tell Beatrice's child that the witch Beatrice would play pranks on you unless you put your stuff away neatly."`
`"Hohohoho...`
` When the child came and told me that a witch was stealing things and pulling pranks, it made me think."`
`"I took it as a sign that the late Beatrice-sama had become a witch...`
`and was coming to teach her child to keep track of things.`
` ...That's why I thought this the best way to teach that child."`
`"That kid started out with a bad reputation for forgetting and losing things,`
` but got a lot more cheery after overcoming those bad habits."`
`"By surpassing weaknesses, those weaknesses become strengths,`
` and that is how people gain confidence and grow up.`
` ...Those small spurts of growth `
`made me feel as though this was my own grandchild."`
`"""Thank you, Genji-sama."""`
`"...Good work with the big cleanup today.`
` We never know when an important guest might come and borrow one of the rarely used rooms.`
` It is important that you do not slack off in your cleaning."`
`"Of course.`
` All of us are fully aware of this fact."`
`"...I hope that is the case.`
` When I looked around, I found this.`
` Whose is it?"`
`Genji took a master key ring out of his pocket.`
`...Apparently, someone had dropped their master key.`
`All of the servants swung around to look at me, the usual offender.`
`"Come on. Yasu again?"`
`"Y-You shouldn't be so quick to judge."`
`"I have mine, of course.`
` There's no way I'd drop something that important.`
` And the rest of you?!"`
`"I have mine..."`
`"Got it!"`
`"So, it was you, Yasu!`
` Do you still not get it, even after that scolding Madam gave you?!`
` You're just so...!"`
`"...Normally, `
`I would cower and apologize under their glares, whether I was guilty or not.`
` However, I've changed.`
` So, I proudly held up the key with the string still attached..."`
`"......Hoh.`
` ...A device to keep yourself from dropping it?`
` A commendable precaution."`
`Genji-sama's face was as expressionless as ever.`
` However, those were unmistakably words of praise.`
`"*giggle* That's right.`
` You won't drop them anymore.`
` After all, you have your ritual now."`
`...That's right.`
`"I nodded proudly, a huge smile on my face.`
` The proud experience of that day, of that moment,`
` would be engraved into an unforgettable page in the memory of my young life...`
` So, whose key did Genji find...?"`
`"......!"`
`There was only one servant who hadn't raised their key.`
`As she muttered 'It has to be Yasu's key, not mine' and fished in her pocket,`
` her face went pale...`
`"You mustn't slack off, even when doing your everyday tasks.`
` But everyone makes mistakes from time to time.`
` I will not press the point, but blaming your teammate instead of reflecting on your own actions is not something I would consider praiseworthy."`
`"M-`
`My...`
`apologies..."`
`The older servant turned red and hung her head.`
`Behind her, ...though no one else could see it, was the witch.`
`"*cackle*!`
` My friend will not make the same mistake again.`
` After all, even though I've always got my eyes on this kid, I can never find a chance to try anything!`
` But it's a shame.`
` If this girl here has lost her key, I should've tried pranking her long ago...!"`
`"Please don't prank people other than me."`
`"Huh?`
` Did you say something?"`
`"N-No, nothing..."`
`"I tried not to feel vindictive, `
`but after being called dull-witted for so long, I was finally able to hold my head up high.`
` On that day, for the first time, I truly felt as though I'd gotten used to life as a servant of the Ushiromiya family..."`
`"When people compliment you, it feels like they've acknowledged you!"`
`"It's very important.`
` People can't grow without it."`
`"And what happens when people grow?"`
`"First, it becomes possible for them to find some leeway.`
` Jobs that used to make them scared, that made them worry about whether they were doing things the right way or not, can then be carried out with confidence."`
`"That's right!`
` Once things become easy, that gives you some latitude!"`
`"And what happens next?"`
`"It gives you a chance to enjoy your time more.`
` As Genji might say it, it gives you time to relax your mind."`
`"If you're tense all the time, that just wears you out!`
` It's good to take it easy for a bit, if you can!"`
`"You mean, you learn so much that you can start slacking off on the job?"`
`"It sounds bad when you put it that way.`
` However, there's nothing wrong with cleverly carrying out your tasks quickly and using your free time to enjoy yourself.`
` Times like that are what enriches a human's life."`
`"Come to think of it, Gohda plays crosswords a lot between jobs!"`
`"He also invents dishes with the leftover ingredients!"`
`"Playing a bit and refreshing yourself can also be good for your efficiency.`
` You might say that inventing dishes combines work and play."`
`"Even Genji slacks off when no one's looking.`
` He'll watch TV or swipe some of his master's drink.`
` And he reads complicated books."`
`""Even Genjiiiiiii?!""`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` In short, it's all about cleverly using the gaps between jobs to play.`
` If it goes too far, it can turn to laziness.`
` However, people only become mature when they learn to balance work with pleasure.`
` Simply put, if all you care about is work all the time, you're not fully mature."`
`"So, that kid learned how to play between jobs?"`
`"It's hard to imagine that overly serious kid slacking off at work!"`
`"It started with learning how to interact with people.`
` That kid formed a relationship with Kumasawa, the person who was always kind,`
` and started borrowing books from her and talking together about them."`
`"Even I had friends at school, but because of my work, there was no chance to deepen our friendship.`
` Jessica was always kind and modest, but there was Natsuhi's stern order to think of, so we couldn't play together very much."`
`"...So, at that time, Kumasawa, the one who was always as kind as a mother to me, was the person I felt closest to."`
`"Kumasawa was old enough to have grandchildren.`
` They couldn't exactly run around and play together.`
` You developed an interest in Kumasawa's hobby."`
`"And what's Kumasawa's hobby?!"`
`"Books.`
` It might be hard to believe, but Kumasawa was a huge mystery novel fan."`
`"So, the kid wanted to find out what sorts of books they were and started reading them?"`
`"That's right.`
` The nice thing about mystery novels is that you can talk about them while you read them.`
` Even Kumasawa, who already knew the answer,`
` must have enjoyed listening in and hearing what sorts of theories a young intellect could create."`
`"Of course, I didn't start right away with the complicated books Kumasawa read.`
` First, I asked for her recommendations and got books from the school library.`
` I would even bring them into the servant room and read a bit during every break."`
`"Every time a new theory popped into my head, I told Kumasawa about it,`
` and she, who already knew the answer, would nod at my theory and grin.`
` ...That was a lot of fun for me."`
`"Are you going to take a bath?`
` Bath time's almost over."`
`"...Yeah, ...just a bit more...`
` Another one of the Indian figures just disappeared..."`
`"*giggle*`
` You've become a total mystery nut.`
` If you get too excited reading, you won't be able to sleep again."`
`"......According to Kumasawa-san, the culprit has already appeared...`
` But I don't have a clue who it is..."`
`"What's that book called?"`
`"It's by Agatha Christie.`
` 'And Then There Were None'.`
` ...It's really interesting.`
` Almost like it's a crime happening on Rokkenjima."`
`"That's a really famous mystery novel, isn't it?`
` Wasn't that one a perfect crime, at least until the culprit confesses to the truth in a message bottle at the end?`
` An incredible book."`
`"Shhh,`
` shhh!`
` I'm enjoying myself, so don't spoil me!`
` Go take a bath now, I'll go by myself later...!"`
`"Okay, okay.`
` ...See you later then.`
` Don't forget to take a bath, okay?"`
`Holding a change of clothes, Shannon smiled amusedly as she left the room.`
`I probably won't be able to read the whole thing tonight.`
`Even though I know that, I just keep turning the pages, unable to find a good place to stop.`
`My new joy, the mystery genre.`
`The mental game of thinking and theorizing.`
`And also talking about it with Kumasawa-san.`
`...All of that left me enraptured.`
`"It would seem you've become a complete bookworm.`
` Well, if you do stay up and get sleepy, that just makes my job easier."`
`"We can't have that.`
` I'd better find a place to stop soon."`
`"*cackle*`
` ......In the ancient times I was born in, pleasures such as mystery novels didn't exist.`
` I've been reading over your shoulder, and this truly is a captivating read."`
`"Beato, who do you think is the culprit?"`
`"In 'And Then There Were None'?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Who is this U. N. Owen, I wonder..."`
`"The culprit who lured the victims to the island, of course."`
`"There are no more than ten people on this island.`
` And U. N. Owen doesn't exist."`
`"Someone must have stranded them on the island and waited somewhere far away for them to die of starvation."`
`"No, that's not right.`
` He or she is on the island.`
` They're one of the ten people.`
` I just don't know who..."`
`"How do you know that there are only ten people on the island?"`
`"...That's just how it is."`
`Since, if you doubt that, you're stuck, or it's just a standard rule of the mystery genre, ...or...hmmm...`
`"The culprit owns the island, correct?`
` They may be hiding in some hidden room.`
` Or perhaps they're like me!`
` They may be a thousand-year-old witch!`
` No, no, if they went to such lengths to kill a mere ten people, they couldn't be a thousand years old.`
` 495 years old at best, I'd say. *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Closed rooms do appear a lot in mystery novels.`
` And books often use the phrase 'it could only conceivably have been done with magic'.`
` ...And here I am, with a witch right before my eyes.`
` It's a complicated feeling."`
`"Pft, *cackle*cackle*!`
` Very entertaining, these closed room murders.`
` ...Once you read the answer, it becomes a tale of humans, or a mystery novel.`
` But, if you take out the part that reveals the answer,`
` it becomes a tale of witches, or a fantasy novel."`
`"...Hmmm?`
` That's an interesting way to look at it.`
` So, there's only a tiny difference between human novels and fantasy novels?"`
`"If a trick exists, it becomes a human novel.`
` If there isn't one, it's a witch novel.`
` Simply take out the last few pages of that book you're reading,`
` and you might think of Lady U. N. Owen as a witch on the same level as myself...!"`
`"...That might be surprisingly wise, coming from you.`
` ...So, the culprit of an answerless detective novel is a witch."`
`"All of the dark places in this world belong to us witches.`
` So, I could reign as the culprit for all detective novels across the world."`
`"Except, if you reason it out right and find the true answer, then the witch is done for."`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` These detective novels can be quite intriguing, it seems.`
` This looks to be a truly entertaining thinking game."`
`"That's right.`
` This is a thinking game.`
` You fight against the book, make a theory, and then compete against friends who have also read the book."`
`"Perhaps, but it's also a fight between humans and witches.`
` Will you allow for or deny the magic of my closed room murders?`
` Call it a chess match of mystery!"`
`"......`
`...So, it isn't a book I'm reading, but a challenge against you?"`
`"Indeed!`
` As Shannon said a short while ago,`
` this story apparently has the truth revealed by a message bottle at the end.`
` So, if you can't expose the truth of the tale before that point, you lose."`
`"After all, the message bottle just happened to drift somewhere that it could be seen.`
` If it got smashed and sank before anyone saw it, this would be a perfect crime,`
` or in other words, a witch's crime that's impossible for humans."`
`"...That's a fun way to look at it.`
` A fight between me and the witch.`
` ......Yeah.`
` I really like thinking of it that way."`
`"*cackle*!`
` Starting now, and until you finish reading,`
` I am Lady Owen, the 495-year-old witch!`
` Can you see through my deserted island murder tricks?`
` Ahihhyahahahaha!"`
`"...I do have one theory:`
` you want to play with me, don't you?`
` I've been reading books so much, you've gotten lonely."`
`"That too!"`
`"Pft-"`
`""Hahahahahahahahahahaha...""`
`...Incidentally.`
`The game Beato and I played around 'And Then There Were None' ended with my defeat.`
`In the end, I wasn't able to build a satisfying theory, and I had to learn the truth from the message bottle.`
`Luckily, it did manage to drift into human hands.`
` If it had sunk to the bottom of the ocean, as Beato had suggested, I would've had no way of knowing the truth.`
`In other words, I was forced to acknowledge U. N. Owen as a witch.`
`Mystery.`
` I once thought it was just a genre for novels.`
`To think that it can so easily become a fight between witches and humans, truth and fantasy.`
`I was instantly enraptured by this new 'game'.`
`As the months passed by, I read through all of the mystery novels in the school library...`
`and started to read mystery novels for adults.`
`I discussed them with Kumasawa.`
` I discussed them with Shannon.`
`I played my game of theory chess, the fight between witches and the truth.`
`Those days...were so much fun...`
`Oh, I am one yet many.`
`Here's to the fun game of the mind that enraptured me...`
`Chapter 4:`
` New Days.`
`The months and years slid by.`
`In my new, more colorful life, I smiled at the spring sunshine peeking through the trees, gazed up at the column of summer clouds,`
` enjoyed the piles of fallen leaves in autumn, and played in the winter snow the few times it did fall.`
`As these days passed one after another, there was a considerable change to my environment.`
`The servants coming from the Fukuin House had switched.`
`There weren't specific grades like in school, so there was no rule saying how long a servant could work before quitting.`
`Each servant made their own decision about when they would 'graduate' from Rokkenjima.`
`Some of those who couldn't stand the environment would quit in as little as three days.`
`After all, life on Rokkenjima was strict.`
`It was also strict in the Fukuin House, of course, but there were a lot of Rokkenjima-only rules,`
` and Natsuhi, the one who supervised the servants, was also very authoritarian.`
` It was probably easy to feel trapped.`
`That trapped feeling and the money sat on opposite sides of the scale that they used to decide the time of their graduation.`
`And sometimes, someone from the Ushiromiya family would use their influence to secure someone a new job, encouraging them to spread their wings and start a new life.`
`The cycle usually lasted two or three years.`
`No one decided this, but it was one of the goals most servants shot for, an unspoken rule.`
`However, I was an exception to that rule.`
`I continued to go to school on Niijima while still living as a servant...`
`That year, all of the Fukuin House servants quit at once.`
`It wasn't at all rare for friends to quit at the same time as each other.`
`All of my fellow servants from the Fukuin House graduated from the island at once, leaving only me behind...`
`Of course, I wasn't on particularly good terms with them.`
`On the contrary, it was annoying to be treated like a kid and called Yasu all the time.`
`Though some new servants had come after me,`
` the older ones had already gotten them believing that 'Yasu loses things all the time',`
` so it wasn't really any more pleasant to have new comrades.`
`Those unpleasant older servants, as well as the ones who started at the same time or after I did, all quit at once.`
`The Ushiromiya family made no effort to stop them from leaving.`
`Adult servants were easier to handle in the first place.`
`The Fukuin House servants were only accepted so that they could be trained.`
`And so, all of the servants besides me left, and no one tried to stop them...`
`"Later, Yasu.`
` Don't go losing stuff again."`
`"...I don't lose things anymore."`
`"Hmph, later.`
` Make sure you listen to what Madam says.`
` Don't you go troubling the next group of servants."`
`"...You know, it's still a mystery.`
` Why was Yasu recommended for this job?"`
`"It's even more surprising that Madam let Yasu stay this long."`
`"It must've taken some guts to not give up and run away.`
` Keep it up, Yasu."`
`"I-I...hate being called Yasu..."`
`At the very end, ...I finally said the one thing I'd always wanted to say to them.`
`However, they basically ignored me, and just picked up their things and left...`
`"............"`
`"...I guess you never got a chance to become friends with them."`
`"I didn't even want to."`
`"Yeah.`
` I'm sure they feel the same way, so you're even.`
` Let's just forget about those people.`
` They no longer have anything to do with us.`
` So, there's no reason to think about them."`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...You're right."`
`I felt just a bit disappointed.`
`I never got a chance to prove to them that I could take care of myself.`
`"It's hard for people to throw off their first impressions.`
` ...That's just how it is.`
` No matter how wonderfully you grow,`
` those people would've probably always called you Yasu and made fun of you.`
` There's no reason for you to want their admiration."`
`"...Yes.`
` Yeah, you're right, Shannon.`
` I'll completely forget about those people."`
`"Good.`
` You have two great friends, Kumasawa-san and me.`
` And if you want to prove that you can take care of yourself, prove it to the new servants who are coming."`
`Shannon was exactly right.`
`Ever since that day when I held the key with the spiderweb charm up high, I'd regained my confidence and pride.`
`...I am now the most experienced Fukuin servant.`
`The new servants who come will still probably be older than me,`
` but I need to teach them the ropes as the more experienced servant.`
`Genji-sama even told me to lead the newer servants as a senpai...`
`Okay.`
` ...I'll give it my all.`
`"That's the right attitude.`
` Let's give it our all together."`
`"Yeah!"`
`"My name is Asne (明日音).`
` Pleased to meet you."`
`"My name is Belne (靘音).`
` Pleased to meet you."`
`......`
`The newly arrived servants looked...a bit superficial.`
`When I first joined the Ushiromiya family, I was incredibly nervous.`
`However, I couldn't see any trace of that nervousness on these girls...`
`"That's right.`
` Usually, kids with good grades and behavior were selected."`
`"How were they selected?`
` Who did it?"`
`"The board of directors came and interviewed them.`
` And they were judged on other things, like their everyday conduct..."`
`"So! As long as they acted like good kids in front of the adults, they could pass?"`
`"...Well, `
`ummm, `
`...there were times that they passed because the adults watching them decided they would do fine..."`
`"All of the children who came from the Fukuin House were highly individualistic.`
` They polished that attitude while they worked as servants,`
` and eventually grew to be servants who would not shame the Ushiromiya family."`
`"However, encouraging this behavior was the role of the more experienced servants.`
` ...Since I was the only one with experience, it was my responsibility to guide them."`
`"What were the new kids like?"`
`"They were the elite, of course!`
` Of irreproachable conduct!"`
`"...I think they were like that when Madam and Genji-sama were around.`
` However,`
` ...when their superiors weren't around,`
` ...well, they didn't take things quite as seriously..."`
`"Asne-san,`
` ...make sure you put your tools on the cart when you're done using them."`
`"Kyahhahahahaha!`
` ...Huh?`
` Suuure. Sooorry."`
`I also have to be alert as a more experienced servant.`
`"And Belne-san, you shouldn't set your key down in a place like that.`
` You'll lose it."`
`"I'm not gonna lose it.`
` I never forget where I put things."`
`When I first arrived here, the older servants would often tell me off just as I had done now.`
`They would probably have been mean and obnoxious about it.`
`I had hated that, so I tried to be more gentle when admonishing them, but they wouldn't take me seriously...`
`"L-Listen up.`
` You know there's a witch living in the mansion, don't you...?"`
`"Oooh, Beatriiice!"`
`"Kyahahahaha! That sounded just like him!"`
`"Don't tell me `
`you believe in that too, Shannon-chan?"`
`"Y-Yes, she really exists...`
` If you leave things lying around, the witch will prank you and hide them..."`
`"It's true.`
` I've gotten into trouble many times because of it..."`
`"A witch hiding things?"`
`"That's totally impossible."`
`"After all-"`
`"There's no way witches could exist!`
` Kyahhahahahaha!"`
`"There's no way they could exist.`
` ...Witches."`
`"...I thought they were just pranks.`
` No, ...it was just easier to think of it that way."`
`"Do you think the witch Beatrice actually existed...?"`
`"I don't believe it."`
`"...I don't know if it was Beatrice, `
`but I do think that something inhuman...`
`really did exist in that mansion."`
`"Do you think there's a chance that this nonhuman thing was Beatrice...?"`
`"Ridiculous."`
`"...I wish I could say it was ridiculous."`
`"That must've been a prank of Yasu's. No, not a prank, revenge."`
`"I did think that at first, but..."`
`"Did something happen that couldn't be explained away as a prank...?"`
`"...It was persistent.`
` ...And creepy."`
`"What kinds of things happened, specifically?"`
`"Things I set down would disappear as soon as I looked away for a second."`
`"Didn't Yasu just hide them?"`
`"I thought so at first.`
` It was only natural to think that.`
` But I started getting this feeling that something wasn't right.`
` I kept thinking...could such a timid kid really get away with something so obnoxious?"`
`"Can you tell us what happened?"`
`"...When my key ring disappeared, it was easy to think that Yasu snatched it when I wasn't looking.`
` ...But when a single key disappeared off my key ring and reappeared somewhere completely different, `
`I couldn't think of it that way."`
`"Maybe Yasu just pulled that one key off while you weren't looking...?"`
`"Is that even possible?! Practically speaking?!`
` Hiding the whole ring is one thing,`
` but if you really think about it, taking a single key off the key ring isn't that easy!`
` The keys would clatter together.`
` I was standing right next to them, just facing the other way, get it?`
` If you took your time removing a key when I was that close, even an idiot like me would've noticed!"`
`"But a single key just vanished without a sound.`
` ...At that moment, I finally realized.`
` This wasn't Yasu trying to get back at me,`
` ...it was something...`
`...worse..."`
`"And where did you find this disappearing key?"`
`"It was...`
`...in my locker."`
`"Well, you can be pretty absent-minded, Belne...`
` Are you sure you didn't just take that key off and put it in your locker...?"`
`"Why would I take that key off the ring?!`
` Have you ever taken a key off or put a key on your key ring, Asne?!`
` I tried doing it myself.`
` It's really stiff!`
` I'd never go to all that trouble.`
` There'd be no point!`
` Am I a sleepwalker or something?!`
` How could I not remember something I've done?!"`
`"I may be stupid, but I'm not that stupid!`
` I don't forget about things I do that easily!!`
` And anyway, I know I had my key with me when I entered the room!`
` Otherwise, how could I have unlocked the door?!"`
`"...Okay then...`
` Yasu, careful not to make any sound, `
`slipped the key off...`
`and hid it in your locker.`
` That has to be it..."`
`"That's what I thought at first!`
` I jumped at Yasu, telling that kid not to mess with me!`
` But even as I said it, I realized.`
` Isn't there something completely wrong here?!"`
`"After all, on that day, we were cleaning that room with Yasu the whole time, right?!`
` There wouldn't have been time for Yasu to noisily remove a key!`
` It was impossible for Yasu!`
` In fact, it should've been impossible for anyone!!"`
`"M-Maybe the ring was missing a master key when you got it..."`
`"I already told you!!`
` The key really was there in the beginning!`
` I was the one who unlocked that room!`
` So it must have been there!`
` ...And then, I went into the room!`
` I'm stupid, and since I hate having the keys clattering around, I placed the ring on the bed...!"`
`"Then, when we finished cleaning, I picked up the ring, tried to lock the door, and it was gone!`
` I may have turned my back on the ring, but it was right next to me!`
` So, if someone tried to pull a prank by removing just one key, I'd have heard the clinking!`
` And yet, just the key for that room vanished and appeared again in my locker!!"`
`"...So okay, let's say that Yasu managed to sneak it away.`
` It's easier to think of that way.`
` ...But still!`
` How could Yasu have put it in my locker?!`
` Yasu and I were together the whole time, right?!`
` When I started yelling about it being gone and ran all over the place looking for it, Yasu was with me until the moment I found it in my locker, get it?!"`
`"I'm telling you it's impossible!!`
` Even as I jumped at Yasu, I began to feel it.`
` I mean, Yasu's eyes seemed to be saying it silently.`
` ...According to Yasu, the reason things used to go missing all the time wasn't because Yasu was forgetful, as everyone said, ...but actually...`
`it was because...`
`impossible things would suddenly happen, just like they had to me,`
` ...and...and...!"`
`"...Yasu was with you the whole time, so there was no chance for Yasu to put the key in the locker?"`
`"Did other strange things like that happen?"`
`"Yeah, they did.`
` Afterwards, other things happened...and not just things disappearing... Over and over...`
` ...Of course, I started getting nervous and made sure not to put things down in places like that, ...but that didn't help."`
`"...At first, I was angry at Yasu,`
` ...but at some point, I began to realize that I was mistaken.`
` One time, a key even disappeared from a ring that I'd left in my pocket!`
` Then, I realized.`
` ...These weren't Yasu's pranks.`
` The same thing that happened to Yasu was now happening to me...!"`
`"C-Calm down a bit...`
` I think some of those were Yasu's fault, `
`and the others were just you being clumsy.`
` ...It's true that the mansion's always dark and eerie,`
` ...and it does feel like the sort of place you'd find a curse.`
` I'm sure that's what made you scared like that..."`
`"You saw it too, didn't you?!`
` Remember that vanishing white shadow we saw in the VIP room that rainy day?!"`
`"...Y-Yes, I saw,`
` but couldn't that just have been Madam or Milady wearing something white...?"`
`"What do you mean, something white?!`
` Have you ever seen either of them wearing something like that?!`
` And besides, that VIP room is always locked!`
` They don't have keys to it!`
` That had to have been some kind of ghost...`
`...no, the silhouette of the witch!"`
`"......`
`...Ha...hahaha...`
` So, basically, ...Belne started acting like this.`
` Totally scared.`
` ...I've got more street smarts than her,`
` so the more scared she was, the more I thought that witches were stupid and couldn't exist."`
`"...Still, I had to be careful about what I said.`
` ...I mean, I realized that this wasn't something I should talk about carelessly.`
` ...All ghost stories and curses sound stupid to outsiders.`
` ...But to the people who believe in them, it's absolutely not a joking matter.`
` It really was...no joke."`
`"...Asne didn't believe a word of what I said.`
` So, I eventually stopped telling her about it...and confessed to Yasu instead.`
` I told Yasu 'I thought you were the culprit, but it couldn't have been you'.`
` I said that something...`
`...strange...was happening to me...!"`
`"...And what was that kid's answer?"`
`"Yasu said that the same thing had happened many times already, but no one else believed any of it...!`
` In the first place, the older servants always made fun of Yasu, but that kid clearly wasn't as clumsy or stupid as they said.`
` I hated having a younger person tell me what to do, so I always resisted, but Yasu always got our work done flawlessly.`
` I've always thought it strange that people made fun of Yasu for losing things...!"`
`"I was sure then.`
` It 'existed'!`
` Some strange, inhuman thing 'existed' in this mansion!"`
`"And that thing was the witch, Beatrice...?"`
`"If that's what you want to call it, I'll believe it.`
` Anyway, something that couldn't be explained away by human actions definitely 'existed' there!`
` People who didn't understand kept calling Yasu and me forgetful!`
` They didn't get it... They just didn't get it!!"`
`"...St-Still,`
` ...it did freak you out for a while, but then you got a lot better...`
` After that, all that fuss about you losing things went away, right...?`
` So it must've been your imagination all the time..."`
`"You're wrong!!`
` I talked to Yasu, to Shannon, and Kumasawa-san and the others about it!`
` And they said that the witch really did exist..."`
`"The old servants all made sure to respect her!`
` They said I'd been cursed because I'd stupidly gone around saying that Beatrice didn't exist...!`
` So I reformed!`
` Yasu taught me how to give offerings to the doll in the VIP room!`
` I asked Genji-sama for permission and prayed at the shrine by the sea!`
` And then it all stopped, all at once!!`
` You were okay, Asne, since you stopped making fun of the witch partway through,`
` but if you'd cluelessly gone on making fun of her, you'd surely have been cursed next!`
` Yes, I guarantee it! You definitely would've been cursed...!!"`
`"...I guess...`
`even I was creeped out by you two...`
` I never said it out loud, but..."`
`"You just don't get it!`
` You really don't!!`
` So, I made sure to teach all the newer servants well!`
` A witch called Beatrice-sama lives in this mansion...!`
` If you make fun of her, you really will be cursed...!!"`
`"......Belne..."`
`"When...things disappeared, that was a sign that the witch was close by and watching us...`
` If you said it was a prank, or that witches couldn't exist,`
` you'd be cursed even more...!!`
` It was like that for both Yasu and me!`
` When the key disappeared,`
` ...that was a sign that the witch had appeared...!!"`
`Belne-san carelessly tossed her key ring on the bed again, humming as she started to clean...`
`No matter how much I warn her, she doesn't change her ways.`
` She's always making fun of me and calling me Yasu, so she won't listen to what I tell her...`
`Why won't she listen to what I say...?`
`You mustn't leave things lying carelessly about.`
` If you lower your guard, the witch will prank you...`
`"...Ahyahhyahhya!`
` Look at that delicious key ring..."`
`"St-Stop it, please...!`
` That's Belne-san's key!`
` Keep your pranking to me alone.`
` Let the others be...!"`
`"With how cautious you've grown, you're no fun anymore.`
` ...*cackle*cackle* Just kidding."`
`"Still, how unpleasant these people are, refusing to listen to my friend's kindly advice.`
` Any insult to my friend I take as an insult to myself...!"`
`"...Are you planning to steal Belne-san's key...?`
` Please, don't do it...!`
` She'll think I hid it again...!"`
`"She thinks my magic is naught but the scheme of a child like you...?!`
` *cackle*cackle* Very well then.`
` Let's just show her something that would be impossible for a Human...!"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"Let's show her my magic!!`
` Foolish Belne!`
` I'll make you regret not listening to my friend's advice!`
` This flimsy body is not enough! I'm borrowing yours!!`
` It's been too long since I've shown you real magic!`
` Let my body return to the land of the living for just a moment!"`
`"Huh?`
` Ah, ......!"`
`A shiver ran up my whole body like an electric shock.`
`From that moment onwards, ...I couldn't move any part of my body by my own will.`
`Like a moment of shock after a blackout,`
` I could do nothing but accept the fact that I had lost control over myself...`
`All of the cells throughout my body felt tingly.`
` ...It felt as though my body had been transformed into someone else's.`
`...I realized that the witch Beatrice was using my body as a vessel to revive for a short period of time...`
`"...Hmm, very nice.`
` That ticklish feeling of the air on my skin... Having a body is simply wonderful!"`
`...Wh-What are you trying to do?!`
` Please, don't do anything mean...`
`This time, everything was backwards.`
` My words were spoken inside my heart.`
` And the witch's voice was coming out of my mouth...!`
`"Fear not.`
` I'll give your body back soon enough.`
` I just need to teach her a lesson with a little prank.`
` I won't do anything foolish that might earn you her suspicion...!`
` Come, try and remember.`
` Where have you been sleeping?!"`
`Everything went completely white, and my mind stopped.`
`Once again, that tingling sensation slid up my body.`
`I could feel it all gather in the fingers of both of my hands...and come out the tips of my fingers.`
`It was an unfathomable, `
`indescribable, `
`...unknown sensation.`
`My head went blank, and I couldn't think at all.`
`I could do nothing but abandon my soul to the sensation.`
`I finally understood.`
`!s0`
`what it's like...`
`to use magic...`
`"Come, try and remember.`
` Where have you been sleeping...?"`
`My finger was moved like a puppet's...and danced around as though I was conducting music.`
`I never knew that having my body move without my control could be so exciting...`
`When Beato lifted my finger as if a string was attached to it,`
` the key ring lying on the bed stood on end.`
`...Belne-san...didn't notice.`
` ...Neither did Asne-san.`
`They were fully occupied by their happy chat as they cleaned the room...`
`I doubt that either of them would have dreamed that a witch was right behind them, readying herself to use magic.`
`They probably couldn't even imagine the key ring doing a little dance right behind their backs.`
`It was like a cartoon fairy tale I'd seen once as a kid.`
`The happy way the keys danced and spun made it look as though they had a will of their own.`
`I could feel the fun of making those keys dance with my fingers wash over me...`
`Yes, this is...pleasure...`
`As I powerlessly watched the witch control me, `
`...I couldn't help but surrender myself to this new joy called magic...`
`"Whoops, that won't do.`
` If the whole ring disappears, my friend will be suspected again.`
` ...All we need...`
`yes, we just need the key to this room to disappear."`
`Beato controlled my fingers, controlling the magic.`
` ...And thereby controlling the keys.`
`The key ring slumped down on the bed, `
`...and then just the mansion's master key stood on end.`
`"Well now, what shall I do with this?`
` ...Merely erasing it would be quite boring.`
` So, ......*cackle*cackle*!`
` Why don't I throw it into her locker?!`
` That will give my friend, who's been working here with her the whole time, a splendid alibi!"`
`"Come, try and remember.`
` Where have you been sleeping?!`
` Yes, it was a warm, dark place..."`
`"The inside of Belne's locker!!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`When Beato snapped her fingers, the key burst and became a gold butterfly.`
`...A gold butterfly...?`
`I see, it's gold because she's the Golden Witch, who gave the Master all of his gold.`
`And butterflies are scared of spiderwebs.`
` ...So, it's a gold...butterfly.`
`The minions of the witch Beatrice...are gold butterflies...`
`After flitting into the air, it burst into a shower of gold sparks and disappeared.`
`And then, the vanished key...was in Belne-san's locker...`
`Though it was far away, in a changing room locker, I could tell exactly how it had happened.`
`It wasn't by sight or by touch.`
`It was by some other sense inside my heart, which couldn't be explained by the five senses.`
`A completely new sensation that I'd never felt before.`
`It was the completely alien concept...called magic.`
`A completely unknown pleasure that left me in a trance.`
`"...That's enough, my friend.`
` I'll give this body back to you..."`
`Nng, ......ah...`
`"............"`
`It felt as though I had been spinning through space until gravity suddenly came back and threw me to the ground.`
`Like when you're having a great dream, but you wake up suddenly,`
` ...and all you remember about the dream was that it was fun.`
` ...That sort of lonely feeling.`
`Though Beato had been borrowing my body, it was my own body that used magic.`
`I could still feel that sensation in my hands.`
`The key ring over there had danced along with the movements of my fingers.`
`No, that's not quite it.`
` The key ring and my fingers had danced together.`
`That fun, that excitement...`
`...still tingled slightly in my hands...`
`"Whoops, that was close."`
`Saying this, Belne-san suddenly turned around and picked up the key ring she had thrown down on the bed.`
`She must have realized that I was staring at it.`
`"Almost had Yasu complain that I shouldn't leave keys lying about like this.`
` I'd never put something down and forget about it."`
`With a grin, she put the key back into her pocket.`
`However, she still hadn't noticed.`
`She probably couldn't even imagine that just a single key had vanished while her back was turned for a second...`
`It's not easy for a Human to do things like that.`
`...But, with magic...`
`With just a little dance of the keys and a butterfly popping, ...it had disappeared.`
`"Okay, fingertip inspection!`
` Bed, okay.`
` Curtains, okay!"`
`"Tools, okay.`
` And keys too!`
` See?`
` Nothing wrong, right?"`
`"Y-Yes, that's good...`
` Then let's go on to the next room.`
` ...Ah, ...Belne-san,`
` ...could you lock up this room for me?"`
`"Hmm?`
` Suuure."`
`...Did Belne-san's key...`
`...really disappear by magic?`
`Was that fun magic just a daydream I had...?`
`I was so scared of that being true...that I tested it.`
`"......`
`......Huh...?"`
`"What's wrong?`
` Why're you taking so long?"`
`"...Huh?`
` ...Huh? Huh??`
` ...Wait, are you kidding me?"`
`"What's wrong...?"`
`"...It's not this one.`
` ...And it isn't this one.`
` ...Huh?`
` What the...?"`
`"What is it?`
` Do you want me to lock it?"`
`"I-I don't get it.`
` What's going on?`
` ...My master key's gone.`
` Just my master key is gone.`
` Wh-Why...?!`
` This ring's so stiff... There's no way it'd come off...!"`
`I could faintly feel that tingling sensation run across my fingers again...`
`That night.`
`...As I gazed at the ceiling from the bed in my dorm room, `
`...I looked at my hands.`
`I couldn't sleep.`
`The excitement from the time those keys danced was still there in my fingers...`
`Is this...`
`how Beatrice...`
`how witches...`
`always feel?`
`...I have a friend who's a witch, called Beatrice.`
`She always used to pull pranks on me with her strange magic.`
`Because I saw this all the time, `
`......I thought I knew what magic was.`
`But today...`
`...She had possessed my body and used magic with it.`
`The sensation of magic that I finally felt at that time...still held my heart entranced.`
`It was a completely unknown pleasure.`
`After all...`
`By moving my fingertips, `
`......I could make the key dance as I wished.`
`It was a strange, strange miracle of magic, something Humans could not do.`
`I still couldn't let go of that excitement...`
`............`
`"......Shannon,`
` ......are you awake...?"`
`"......`
`...What is it?"`
`Shannon was still awake.`
`Shannon is always early to bed, early to rise.`
` By getting to bed early, all of her weariness disappears by the next day.`
`...She lives a model life, one that all servants should respect and admire.`
`...If I want to become a loved, respected servant like Shannon, `
`...I'll need to act that way too.`
`However, ...I wasn't confident that I could do that anymore.`
`"I guess...`
`...I can't become like you after all."`
`"...What do you mean?`
` This is a bit abrupt."`
`"You were my ideal.`
` Always."`
`"...Yeah."`
`"Everyone in the Fukuin House loves you and is kind to you.`
` ...Since you always played with me, you're the only friend I've ever had.`
` And you're also a wonderful servant, who can carry out any task in the Ushiromiya mansion both flawlessly and gracefully.`
` You were the target I longed to reach.`
` ...That's...what you were to me."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...Let's give it our all together.`
` As they say, perseverance prevails.`
` Everyone will grow to acknowledge you more and more.`
` So let's aim to become wonderful servants together."`
`"......`
`...I'm...gonna stop being a servant."`
`"...Huh?"`
`"Instead of a servant, `
`...I'd rather be a witch."`
`"Wh-What do you mean `
`by witch...?"`
`"I did...and still do...`
`wish I could be a servant loved and relied upon by everybody.`
` ...But right now, `
`I want to be a witch...`
`even more."`
`"Well, that's...`
`...ummm...`
`...huh...?"`
`Shannon was confused.`
`It was hardly surprising.`
` ...All this about quitting as a servant was at least understandable.`
`But she didn't know how to answer after hearing that her roommate wanted to become a witch...`
`"A witch.`
` Beatrice.`
` ...You see, today, Beatrice possessed me and used my body to do magic.`
` That unknown world felt so...thrilling.`
` It was much more thrilling when I learned that I'd been selected as an Ushiromiya family servant.`
` It was like learning about a new world.`
` ...As though I'd been living in a world of darkness all my life and thought I knew what the world was like,`
` then finally learned what light was and saw the world for the first time.`
` It was...joy.`
` ...Excitement."`
`Beato had only used my fingers, made a key ring dance,`
` and turned a key into a butterfly before hiding it in a locker.`
`But I'd understood it with my body.`
`If I'd moved my fingers a different way, the ring could've flown into the air instead of just dancing,`
` and I could've turned it into a scurrying lizard instead of a butterfly.`
` ...I could've done anything.`
`True, Beatrice's magical power was still weak.`
`It had all happened in the little world behind the backs of the servants, who were filled with anti-magic toxin.`
`However, inside that tiny, short-lived world, I could do anything at all.`
`Beato just happened to settle on making them dance and turning the key into a butterfly.`
`But if she'd wanted to, she could've done anything else!`
`The endless sensation of that free, unrestricted power...`
`I could still feel it in my fingertips.`
`Could it be that, along with that sensation, a fragment of that magical power might also remain...?`
`I can tell.`
` It's still there.`
` ...There's still just a bit of it there, along with that sensation.`
`I can do it.`
` ...I can still...do it...`
`"......Ah..."`
`A single spot of golden light suddenly lit up in this dark room.`
`It was right between my clasped hands.`
`When I slowly opened them,`
` ...I could see a single dot that sparkled gold.`
`"What...`
`...is...`
`...?"`
`Shannon didn't know what the light meant.`
`How could light appear from the palm of my hands?`
`And yet, even with this miracle right in front of her, `
`...she couldn't understand what it was.`
`She just sat there with her mouth open in disbelief.`
`However, to me, `
`...this was just the return of that bit of sensation in my fingertips.`
`The golden dot...`
`spread out...`
`...and became a small, gold butterfly.`
`It flapped its wings and scattered gold sparks about like a cartoon fairy.`
`To Shannon, it probably just looked as though a gold butterfly was flapping its wings.`
`...Of course, that alone was a miracle that she could hardly grasp.`
`But to me, it was like a remote-control plane in the shape of a butterfly.`
`I could control that gold butterfly however I wanted.`
`Not clumsily with threads.`
`...I could make it flap, dance, play through the air as I wished.`
`I was taking a walk through the air as that little butterfly.`
`The golden glint of it pierced the darkness of the small room as it danced about freely.`
` ...It was an entrancing pleasure.`
`...However, that sensation in my fingers began to weaken.`
`I could tell that the few magic butterfly scales left in my fingers were going away.`
`Finally, the gold butterfly flashed and turned to dust like a firework run out of juice,`
` falling down and disappearing without a trace...`
`"Wh-What on earth just happened...?"`
`"This is magic.`
` ...It's really fun."`
`"...M-Magic......"`
`"Yeah.`
` Magic.`
` ...There was still some magic left in my fingers, so I was able to use it.`
` ...But if I became a real witch, ...I'll be able to use it whenever and however I want...to do anything.`
` Now that I've learned how fun this can be,`
` I don't want to go back to being Human.`
` Being a servant is just too boring.`
` So, ...I'm going to become a witch."`
`"B-Become a witch...?`
` ...W-Wait...!"`
`"I've already made my decision, Shannon.`
` It's been fun.`
` I'll give you this room.`
` You can use it by yourself.`
` Later.`
` Goodbye."`
`"W-Wait...!!"`
`As Shannon called out repeatedly for me to wait, ...a massive planetarium swallowed me up.`
`In the sea of the pitch-black starry sky, I was alone.`
`I...we...are alone here.`
`"I'm done acting the part of the servant.`
` ......I'm going to...modify this world."`
`"...Indeed.`
` Understood.`
` In that case, what will you do?"`
`"Being a wonderful servant like Shannon wouldn't be bad.`
` ...But now that I know how fun it is to be a witch, that feels like a boring dream.`
` I can't go back anymore."`
`"What will happen to Shannon?"`
`"...Shannon can just be Shannon, and stay as a respected servant.`
` She'll stay the same.`
` But from now on, it won't be the two of us together, but her alone."`
`"Farewells are sudden, is that not the phrase?`
` ...Very well.`
` Being fickle makes life more entertaining.`
` And what of you?"`
`"I want to become a witch.`
` I want to become Beato."`
`"But I am already Beatrice."`
`"You'll still be a witch and my friend.`
` I'm modifying the world so that Beato is me."`
`"So, I'll be a witch who is a friend of Beatrice?"`
`"Pretty much.`
` So, from now on, you're a different witch."`
`"I understand.`
` Then, what will be my new name?"`
`"......`
`I'll put that on hold until I can think of one.`
` You'll be nameless for a while.`
` Sorry about the trouble."`
`"Not at all, not at all.`
` This is my precious name we're talking about.`
` You had better take your time and think carefully about it.`
` *cackle*."`
`"You've been Beatrice's friend since she was young and couldn't use magic yet.`
` When we first met each other, you'd always hide my things and make fun of me."`
`"I see.`
` And when Beatrice finally learns the ways of magic, I become a friend on an equal footing with her.`
` Perhaps that would make me a sort of big sister to you."`
`"Yeah, that sounds nice.`
` ...What are we going to do about how we talk?"`
`"Beatrice's voice is that of a woman of high station.`
` Shall I give that to you as well?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I'll inherit the way she talks."`
`"Indeed, I comprehend.`
` ...Or perhaps I shouldn't say it like that.`
` ...I'll need to find a good way to sound like Beatrice's big sister-like witch friend."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...Or should it be...`
`...indeed."`
`"Heheheheheh.`
` Now there's a nice, dignified voice."`
`"Okay, then how about...no, wait.`
` Then what of my appearance?"`
`"Good point.`
` I've got a sort of blood-red witch look.`
` Why not choose a different color for yourself?"`
`"...When Beatrice wanders the mansion at night, she is often seen dressed in white."`
`"Yes, I suppose ghosts are classically white."`
`"A witch...`
`...in a white dress...`
` ...Let's try putting it all together."`
`I need a different look than the witch in the demon-red dress.`
`A white, noble witch.`
`...Unlike the time with the red witch, I'm thinking about my own look now,`
` ...so I'd like to make it beautiful and cute if I can.`
`A white dress.`
` A noble look.`
`Like one of noble blood, but with a dark, sarcastic streak...`
`No, she's like a tomboy princess, so her voice is a mix of formality and rudeness.`
`Then the dress should be the exact opposite, to make a nice contrast...`
`"......`
`...Then what of this form?"`
`"Is this the form of the new Beatrice?!"`
`"How beautiful!`
` Just like a noble princess!"`
`"Hmmm...`
` ...I've taken a liking to this form.`
` This will be quite satisfactory."`
`"...Not bad.`
` You look great, Beato."`
`"Hmm. I like it.`
` I truly do like this form..."`
`"Now, if you can keep this up and give me a wonderful name, that'd be great.`
` If I have to go around nameless for too long, I'll get all sulky."`
`"Fear not, I shall find you a splendid name!`
` But first, there is something I must consider. What shall be the form of my magic?!"`
`"Hiding objects and transporting them instantaneously is your theme.`
` So, I must think of my own particular theme of magic.`
` ...When I use magic, gold butterflies will flit about.`
` I'm not backing down on that part...!"`
`"*giggle* Perfect.`
` That really would make you a Golden Witch.`
` ...Then the weaknesses such as spiderwebs and the sacred mirror in the shrine will also go to you?"`
`"Indeed.`
` Even an all-powerful witch needs a few small weaknesses to keep things interesting.`
` Then let us do it like so.`
` If I touch a spiderweb, it will burn me."`
`Silently, a silvery spider dropped down vertically.`
`Beato, now in her new form, lightly touched the silver spiderweb that trailed out behind it.`
`As she did, ...there was a faint sound of flesh burning, and a thin burn was left across her fingers.`
`Beatrice can't stand spiderwebs.`
`That was one of the weaknesses of the evil spirits Kumasawa-san spoke of.`
`Since the witch Beatrice had revived thanks to the power of those evil spirits,`
` she had also inherited their weaknesses.`
`Therefore, sacred mirrors are another one of my weaknesses.`
`...However, that sacred mirror in the shrine isn't too likely to appear in front of me often.`
`That's not so fun.`
`"...Then, while mirrors with sacred power will obviously be a weakness, let us make mirrors themselves a weakness too."`
`"You often hear that mirrors have magical powers.`
` Isn't that nice?`
` Sounds just like a witch."`
`"If I look at a mirror, it feels as though my magical power is being sucked out, so I shall try to avoid them.`
` Indeed, that could be quite amusing."`
`...If I really think about it,`
` I'm bad with mirrors whether I make that rule or not.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`No matter who I want or strive to be, `
`...the only face that will ever show in a mirror...`
`is the heartlessly pathetic and realistic face of ~ib~Yasu~ib~.`
`Mirrors, which always force me to face my shabby reality, are something I always want to avoid.`
`That's right.`
` ...I hate mirrors.`
`...I don't want `
`to see `
`my pitiful self.`
`"You don't need to decide everything at once.`
` It's fun to build up a world one little bit at a time."`
`"True.`
` I understand.`
` I shall enjoy life as a witch as I slowly expand my world."`
`"That tiny, dark room is no place for you to sleep now."`
`"Indeed.`
` I am the Golden Witch!`
` I am the ruler of Rokkenjima's night, and the nighttime mansion belongs to me.`
` That is where I should make my home, is it not?"`
`"A room for Beatrice?`
` Haha, isn't it obvious?!"`
`"Yeah, that's right!`
` That wonderful room on the second floor of the mansion..."`
`"The VIP room of the witch just has to be Beatrice's room!"`
`"Oh, that's right.`
` From this evening forward, that room in the nighttime mansion shall be my dwelling place...!`
` Why didn't I think of that myself, hahaha, hehahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`"Then let's go, Beato.`
` If we're going to drink tea together, we'll need a much better room than that cramped one."`
`"Indeed.`
` That room is too crude for entertaining friends and serving tea.`
` We shall change rooms.`
` Let us go, my friend...!"`
`"...So, this is goodbye to Shannon."`
`When I looked at my feet, ...I could see my own dorm room far beneath me.`
`I could see Shannon, who had dashed up to the bed I lay on and had been saying 'wait' at the moment time froze.`
` She was as rigid as a doll.`
`Looking down at it from this height, it really did look like a small dollhouse...`
`"So long, Shannon.`
` ...The days I spent as a Human, with you as a goal and a constant comfort, were truly fun.`
` ...If I had never learned the joys of magic and awakened as a witch,`
` everything would doubtless have remained as it was."`
`...I was your only close friend too, wasn't I?`
`Please forgive me for erasing that friend so suddenly.`
`As a parting gift, ...I will erase 'me' from your world.`
`Starting now, this will not be a two-person room.`
`It will be a single-person room, with just you in it.`
`I hope you continue to strive for your ideal and try to become a kind, reliable servant loved by everyone.`
`Yasu, the stupid, clumsy servant who lost things all the time, ...doesn't exist anymore.`
`So long, Shannon.`
`When I mature as the witch Beatrice and stride through the nighttime mansion where I will,`
` ...I may bump into you as you do your nighttime rounds.`
`However, when I meet you again,`
` it will not be a reunion.`
`It will be our first meeting.`
`After all, though you have heard the rumors of the witch Beatrice, you have never met her...`
`So long, Shannon.`
`Let us meet again sometime and spin up some fun tale......`
`"Wait...!!`
` Wai...`
`...t...`
`...`
` ............"`
`............`
`......What...`
`was I doing...?`
`Was I...talking in my sleep...?`
`Apparently, I had gotten out of bed, stretched my hand out towards it,`
` ...and said 'wait'.`
`This isn't the first time I've woken up to find myself saying something strange, but...`
`...I don't remember ever waking up to find myself out of bed and standing up.`
`Could this be what they call...sleepwalking...?`
`Am I just tired...?`
`...Gotta sleep.`
` Gotta get back to sleep.`
`I turned around to face my bed.`
`............?`
`My bed wasn't there.`
`There was no bed in this room except the one I had just turned my back on.`
`If I'm the only one in this room, and the only bed is the one behind me,`
` ...that must mean it's my bed.`
`...That feels wrong, for some reason.`
`The bed sheets are all disarranged, as though someone had slipped out of them.`
`Who did...?`
`This is a single-person room with me in it, right?`
`So, that there is my bed, and the traces of someone crawling out...`
`mean that I was just sleeping there until a second ago...?`
`...But, for some reason...`
`that bed...`
`doesn't feel like my bed.`
`However, though all the other kids shared rooms, I, Shannon, was given a single-person room.`
`So, there's only one bed.`
`And it must be mine.`
`............`
`"...Am I just...`
`...tired?"`
` ...I wonder.`
`I must just be half-asleep.`
`School starts early tomorrow morning.`
`And, when school ends, I want to go to the mansion, help out with some work,`
` and talk to Kumasawa-san about the mystery novel I just read.`
`"Time to sleep.`
` I'm probably just so worn out that I'm imagining things.`
` ...Goodnight, Shannon.`
` Just crawl in bed and close your eyes, `
`...and you won't have to think about anything complicated..."`
`I went back into my bed.`
`It felt a bit uncomfortable to crawl into a bed that wasn't mine.`
`Still, it might just be because I'm getting so sleepy, but it's starting to feel as though this is my bed after all.`
`...I'm just half-asleep...`
`I am...Shannon.`
`A lonely servant.`
`I mess up from time to time, `
`...but I want to become a kind servant whom everyone loves...`
`......Goodnight, `
`...me...`
`Oh, I am one yet many.`
`I've had enough of playing the servant.`
` I've had enough of being Human!`
`From this night forth, I am Beatrice!`
`The Golden Witch Beatrice, who has lived for a thousand years!`
`Praise me, servants.`
` Have fear when you are chosen for the night shift!`
`In the nighttime mansion, everything is mine, for that is my time...!`
`Oh, I am one yet many!`
`Yes, let our world swallow up everything.`
` It is like the raging seas!`
`Well now, let us drink the mysterious moon dry tonight, with this Human book as a side dish!`
`You call this a mystery?`
` You call this a closed room?`
` You call this 'a crime impossible for Humans'?`
`Don't make me laugh!`
` With all these holes and weak points, you call this a crime impossible for Humans?!`
`Is there no splendid closed room magic that can do my name justice?`
`No, not here, not here, not there, not there either...all of them pathetic!`
`It's enough to make one giggle, but now I'm not sure which is the side dish, the moon or the book!`
`If I get tired of mystery, I can change myself into a butterfly!`
` I can flit about the island, the mansion, the vast forest at will.`
`I'll follow those cowardly servants as they do their nighttime rounds,`
` and when they check to see that a window is locked, `
`they'll see me laughing at them in the reflection on the glass!`
`I can be fickle, and do as I please!`
`Pranks at night should be a lot of fun.`
`Okay, I've decided. Let's play like that starting tonight!`
`*cackle*cackle* How amusing!`
` What amusement this night shall bring!`
`In the world of witches, the only limits to your fun are the limits of your imagination!`
`My imagination shall become the source of my magical power!`
`Splendid, it shall all be so fun!`
` I shall expand it infinitely.`
` And let it swallow the whole island.`
` The island's night will be all mine!!`
`Oh, how refined and pleasant are the days of a witch!`
`Oh, I am one yet many!`
`Kihahahahahahhha, hyahhaha!!`
`Here's to the wonderful world of witches!!`
`Chapter 5: `
`A New Element.`
`"Did you check the bathroom amenities?"`
`"Yep, went down the whole list."`
`"Did you make sure they were facing the right way when you set them down?"`
`"Yes, of course.`
` Everything's as the list says."`
`"*giggle* Thanks.`
` Genji-sama, the guest rooms are ready now."`
`"Good work.`
` Make sure you check over everything with your own eyes, Shannon.`
` Also, Madam has ordered us to change the tablecloth in the dining hall again."`
`"My, my. Why again, when we all worked so hard to change it earlier today...?"`
`"The color of that tablecloth simply does not fit.`
` Once I saw it against the backdrop of the room, I could see that it matched terribly.`
` We should use a different tablecloth."`
`"Oh, and did you make sure to clean the chandelier in the parlor?`
` I don't want Eva-san looking up and saying `
`'Oh, is that dust? And even a spiderweb?' again...!"`
`"Do not worry.`
` It has already been carefully cleaned and checked.`
` I will now perform a final check on everything myself."`
`"Is that so? Very well.`
` I will also check everything over at the very end.`
` Shannon, take the young servants and prepare a new tablecloth.`
` Try to find something white, with a bit more of a clean feeling."`
`"Y-Yes, as you wish."`
`Natsuhi was even more high-strung than normal and walked about barking orders here and there.`
`Even though the sky was beginning to get dark, the servants moved hurriedly about.`
`Tomorrow is the annual family conference.`
`It isn't particularly rare for each of the individual families to visit the island, but this is the only time that they all come together.`
`It was the most important day of the year for both the Ushiromiya family and Rokkenjima.`
`Natsuhi, who was short-tempered on top of being high-strung,`
` kept ordering that the servants redo this or that, since it really didn't look good after all.`
` This would keep them going until late into the night.`
`Now that Shannon had many years of experience and Natsuhi had put her in a position of responsibility, `
`she was called over many times to have strict orders showered on her...`
`So, when Shannon finished her shower and lay down on the bed in the servant waiting room, she fell asleep almost immediately...`
`...I can hear the sound of wind...coming from somewhere far away.`
`...It's a bit different from the sound wind outside a room would make.`
`It's almost as though...I'm sitting in a deck chair in the rose garden,`
` turning over in my sleep, ...with the feel of the wind in my hair.`
`That's right, the feel.`
` ...This isn't a sound, it's a feeling.`
`Then is this...`
`a dream...?`
`Just as I was about to accept this theory, ...I thought I heard someone talking to me.`
`——My, my.`
` It seems the work of a servant is just as boring as it ever was.`
`Not only boring, but difficult, strict, constraining, joyless...`
`All you get in return for your years of service is some level of respect from the newer servants.`
`And even that is far from sufficient to repay you for all the hard work you've done...`
`"Why do you not tire `
`of this life?"`
`Huh? ...Who...?`
`She wasn't just imagining someone talking to her.`
` ...She was shocked to find that it was real.`
`When Shannon opened her eyes, ...she gulped.`
`"...Th-`
`This place......"`
`She couldn't say any more.`
` ...She was literally stunned silent.`
`Shannon, who had been sleeping on a bed, ...was somehow in a rose garden.`
`However, though this rose garden somehow resembled the rose garden on Rokkenjima, it was also completely different.`
`After all, ...the roses were golden.`
`And it wasn't just the flowers, but the dancing butterflies too.`
`It was a golden rose garden of mysterious beauty.`
`Somehow, Shannon was sitting in a chair under the arbor.`
`It was as though she'd taken a nap there and woken up from a dream.`
`...But it felt strange.`
`Is this golden rose garden a dream?`
`For some strange reason, it felt as though my entire life up to this point had been a dream, and that I had finally awakened here...`
`"Welcome, Shannon.`
` Welcome to my golden rose garden..."`
`There was that voice again.`
`Shannon looked around to find who it was.`
`As she did, a golden butterfly landed on the seat across from her and instantly created a human form...`
`"It has been quite some time, Shannon.`
` Have you been well...?`
` Of course, I know you have been.`
` After all, I have been watching all of you, every day."`
`This woman laughed as though she was an old friend of Shannon's.`
`However, Shannon obviously didn't remember this strange gold rose garden, and she didn't remember this person's face either...`
`"Indeed.`
` You no longer remember me, do you?"`
`"......Have I forgotten about you...?`
` If so, please forgive me..."`
`"There is no need to apologize.`
` I made you that way, so it is no sin of yours.`
` ...Let me introduce myself.`
` I am the Golden Witch, Beatrice."`
`"...B-Beatrice...sama...?`
` Th-The benefactor of the Ushiromiya family, whom the Master always speaks of...?"`
`"Not that Beatrice.`
` I am the Golden Witch, the one who rules over Rokkenjima's night.`
` ...I am the other master of the mansion, the one you always pay homage to."`
`"Y-`
`You are...`
`Beatrice...`
`sama..."`
`"Hahaha...`
` You need not fear.`
` The two of us used to be friends...no, roommates, did we not?`
` At one time, I idolized you and tried to be the best servant I could."`
`"...I've always had a single-person room, so I couldn't have had a..."`
`"When we last parted, I stole away your memory.`
` However, I have not forgotten that we were once roommates.`
` ...I also remember that I was the one who destroyed our friendship and left."`
`"So as to not leave you alone in sadness,`
` I erased all of your memories and the very world of our days together."`
`"............"`
`"You do not need to understand...`
` But believe this.`
` I have not called you here to do you harm."`
`"I-Isn't this inside one of my dreams...?"`
`"You may think of it that way.`
` Strictly speaking, I beckoned your soul to my garden while you were sleeping.`
` To invite you to be a resident of this world."`
`Beatrice snapped her fingers,`
` and a storm of gold butterflies all rose up around the rose garden.`
`As the cloud of butterflies danced over the table, a gorgeous tea set appeared.`
`There were tea cups and a tea pot, more elegant even than those used by the Ushiromiya family.`
`The tea was filled to the brim and had a sweet rose scent, one which Shannon had never smelled before.`
`Before there was even time to be amazed by that scent,`
` butterflies started gathering one by one on the table, and a tea stand sprouted right out of it.`
`It was like watching a magical mushroom from a fairy tale kingdom grow out of the ground.`
`It was a many-layered tea stand, filled with beautiful cakes, like edible jewels.`
`Of course, there were also several lovely, light-brown scones.`
` The honey truly was golden honey, with bits of gold leaf dancing through it...`
`"It seems the Ushiromiya family holds tea parties from time to time, but those cannot compare to mine."`
`"...I-Incredible...`
` I've never seen anything like this..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` Even if you did, it would only have been as a waitress.`
` You are my friend.`
` I need no waitress.`
` After all, I am a witch.`
` That is more than enough.`
` Come, do not be shy.`
` Stuff yourself to your heart's content."`
`"Th...`
`...Thank you...`
`very much..."`
`That was all Shannon managed to say.`
` ...It would be hard for anyone to say much more after being suddenly invited to such a beautiful witch tea party.`
`"Let us begin with black tea.`
` The milk is fresh, and the sugar is so delectable that you'd almost want to eat it raw.`
` But I recommend you try your tea straight first.`
` With nothing more than a single rose petal floating on the top,`
` it will surely be so delicious that you'll be unable to drink the black tea of the human world ever again...!"`
`Laughing happily, Beatrice opened, not a sugar pot, but a rose petal pot,`
` picked up a single crimson petal, and floated it on her tea after relishing its scent.`
`Shannon did the same, picking up a single petal and smelling its aroma.`
`"...It smells so wonderful...`
` ...Is this...really the scent of the roses in this world?"`
`"I am glad you enjoy it.`
` I bred this rose simply for the purpose of using the petals with black tea.`
` If you crush them, they're also splendid for making jam!`
` That goes better with scones than anything else imaginable.`
` Do you want to try?"`
`"Uh, ah...sure, just a bit."`
`Shannon had been invited to this witch tea party suddenly.`
`However, the witch seemed so truly innocent, and her smile as she played the hostess was so happy that it made Shannon want to smile too.`
`The tension in Shannon's heart gradually faded, and she started to enjoy her chat with this witch...`
`"Servant work really is tiring.`
` I remember it well.`
` Particularly cleaning the windowsills in the chapel."`
`"How surprising.`
` So, you worked as a servant once too?"`
`"For a short time.`
` You probably don't remember, but I worked alongside you.`
` I was a clumsy fool who always lost things.`
` You were my idea of a perfect servant, and the person I looked up to."`
`"...That makes me even more sorry that I can't remember."`
`"There is no need for apologies.`
` Here, you are not a servant, but my friend and guest.`
` There are no inconveniences here, no trials nor boredom.`
` I can give you anything you desire.`
` That is how much power I currently possess.`
` ...I wanted to let you know that I have now reached that level."`
`"...I'm truly grateful to you `
`for welcoming one with so few redeeming features in such an extravagant way."`
`"*cackle*!`
` Think of it as a reward for all of the painful days you have withstood.`
` Come, gold butterflies!`
` Don't let my friend get bored! Show her a little dance!`
` When you have tired of that, allow me to call the band to perform any song you would like.`
` When you have tired of that, my refined familiars will show you some conjuring tricks.`
` Fear not, for time is endless here.`
` And I can grant your wishes endlessly.`
` My tea party has no end...!"`
`In a truly good mood, the witch told Shannon several strange stories.`
`They were all stories Shannon had never heard before.`
` Very interesting stories.`
` And, they were all odd, bizarre fairy tales.`
`Shannon felt as though she had become Alice in Wonderland.`
` The time she spent at this tea party was strange, pleasant, and relaxed.`
`No,`
` the clocks have no hands at this tea party.`
`So, the time passed like a Sunday morning, when you can wrap yourself in your blanket for as long as you want...`
`"...I can't express how grateful I am to you for this."`
`"There is no need for thanks.`
` In the human world, words of thanks go along with words of farewell, do they not?`
` There will be no end to this tea party.`
` So, there is no need for thanks either."`
`"*giggle*`
` I'll still thank you.`
` Thank you so much, Beatrice-sama, for this wonderful tea party.`
` ...But all dreams must end, and so must this one."`
`"Hoh.`
` And why must they end?"`
`"Because, ...I start early tomorrow.`
` If I stay here talking too long, I'll sleep in, `
`and Madam will give me a good scolding..."`
`"Pft, hahhahhahahahhaahahahahaha!`
` Why are you so anxious to return to the world of that short-tempered Natsuhi?`
` Really, now.`
` Are you truly saying you want to return to the Human world, where it's all work and no rewards?"`
`"But I am Human.`
` I can't impose myself on you forever."`
`"Shannon,`
` it seems that you do not understand.`
` I invited you here, but I have no desire to chase you away again."`
`"Here, time is eternal.`
` You are not obligated to say farewell, not ever.`
` I will never tire of enjoying tea with you.`
` On the contrary, it is quite agreeable to have you here to talk to."`
`"I'm grateful for your words, but I am Human.`
` I must return to my own world."`
`"Why do you want to return to that colorless world, `
`where you waste all your time with school and your job and the family works you to the bone?"`
`"Despite all that, ...it's still my world."`
`"Shannon,`
` does that sort of world really need to be yours?`
` Let me be honest with you.`
` ...Shannon,`
` I didn't just invite you here.`
` I came to take you home."`
`"Take me home...?"`
`"Once, I tried to become a good servant like you.`
` ...Then, I became fascinated by witches `
`and became one myself, learning all the pleasures of magic.`
` ...And now, I have come to take you home."`
`Beatrice spoke quietly and slowly rose from her seat.`
`"Shannon,`
` ...the world of witches truly is more fun than being a servant.`
` This tea party is nothing more than a mere welcoming party for an old friend.`
` We can hold as many fun festivities as we desire.`
` That is the endless, the eternal."`
`"...Now that this golden rose garden has been completed, I have reached my goal.`
` This place is paradise.`
` Yes, let us call it the Golden Paradise.`
` Now that it has been completed, I have come to welcome you in.`
` There's no need for any inconveniences, any perseverance or hard work.`
` Here, you and I can enjoy ourselves for all eternity.`
` It will be like a never-ending fairy tale..."`
`"...I'm truly grateful for your splendid proposal.`
` ...However, I need to go back to my original world."`
`"Why?"`
`"Because this isn't my world."`
`"I acknowledge it.`
` This is not the world you have lived in until now.`
` That's why I have invited you here!`
` From this point forth, this will be our world.`
` You are no longer a guest.`
` You are the second master of this world.`
` You need show no restraint for my sake.`
` We'll just live in this endless world like we once lived as roommates..."`
`"I regret that I have no memory of that time.`
` ...However, I'll have to turn down your invitation."`
`"Why?`
` ...What responsibility forces you to return `
`to the world of Humans?"`
`True, the world of Humans, or the world of servants, is busy all the time.`
`Madam is strict, high-strung, and has a short temper.`
`It'd be a lie if I said the everyday chores weren't a pain, and having to balance work with school makes it even harder.`
`Beatrice had watched over Shannon's painful days the whole time.`
`She had seen those constantly tired shoulders heave in a sigh over and over.`
`That was why she had invited Shannon here.`
` To this Golden Paradise.`
`She had tried to give Shannon a perfect welcome, to truly make her happy.`
`...So why had Shannon selected her original world over this one?`
`Beatrice was overcome with shock and completely unable to understand.`
`"I have given you the perfect welcome to this paradise.`
` And the days to follow will be even more fun."`
`"...So, since you still choose the Human world over all of that, do you find something there that is even more fun than the pleasures of witches?"`
`"...That's right.`
` There are things in the Human world that are even more fun than magic."`
`"Absurd... That cannot be...!"`
`"...Yes,`
` it's true."`
`Shannon's expression was soft.`
`However, her words were firm.`
`There was something wonderfully fascinating in the Human world.`
`And, that something was apparently not in this paradise, where everything was supposedly just as they wanted it...`
`"......Absurd...`
` ...I don't...`
`understand..."`
`As Beatrice muttered, she shifted restlessly several times.`
`However, no matter how often she said it, Shannon's smile didn't falter, and Beatrice couldn't think of an answer...`
`"In that case, ...it's time for me to leave.`
` Your tea was delicious."`
`"......I don't...understand.`
` ...I am the great Golden Witch, the one who can have anything endlessly.`
` You tell me that I cannot give you what you want?"`
`"......Yes."`
`"I want to know.`
` I believed I had everything, so tell me what it is I lack...!"`
`"I think...that you already know.`
` Isn't that why you invited me here...?"`
`"...Are you trying to speak in riddles to a witch?`
` ...Heh, ...*cackle*."`
`"That's all for now then...`
` I can't live here, but I would be glad to come over whenever you invite me for tea."`
`"I won't call for you again...`
` Have no fear of that."`
`Beatrice snapped her fingers, and Shannon popped out of existence.`
`Shannon's soul had returned to the dream of her original self.`
`While humans have many dreams in a night, they can remember none of them.`
`The tea party in this paradise mixed in with many other dreams and vanished.`
`The next morning, Shannon would not remember this tea party.`
`However, Shannon's cup remained here.`
`The witch who had lost her guest and was standing alone looked all the more lonely...`
`"............"`
`The witch dug her fingernails into the tablecloth.`
`That grimace as she bit her lower lip made it clear that she still hadn't solved the puzzle Shannon had left behind.`
`"Riiche,`
` there's no need to worry about it."`
`A black hole opened above Shannon's empty seat, and the owner of that voice fell out of it.`
`"...I do worry.`
` Ah, come on, how could she say it with such certainty..."`
`"Maybe she just wanted to get back to sleep quickly, since dawn is coming soon."`
`"...What pleasure could Shannon know that I do not?!`
` What is this 'something' that can be found in the Human world but not in my paradise?!`
` I don't understand!`
` ...I want to know!"`
`"Thinking about complicated stuff will just fuel your headache.`
` I can be of service in Shannon's place.`
` Let's enjoy a tea party together."`
`"I don't feel like it anymore.`
` ...I'm bored of having tea parties with you."`
`"...Aw, she's cranky."`
`The witch shrugged and laughed, then took a bite out of a scone.`
`She then blew into it, and it swelled up like a balloon before finally popping.`
`Golden ribbons and butterflies flew out, but Beatrice didn't appear to notice...`
`"...Just what is it that I do not possess?`
` ...What...?"`
`"Watch your step there."`
`"Thank you, captain.`
` Make sure you take good care of yourself."`
`"I've got a friend who sells this stuff that's supposed to be great for stiff shoulders.`
` I'll bring you a sample next time...!"`
`"Oh, no need to trouble yourself... But thanks for caring."`
`"Hey, brats!`
` How long are you gonna mess around up there?`
` Let's go."`
`"Hey, Maria.`
` Come down off the boat with Mama..."`
`Maria, who Rosa led by the hand, was still too young for kindergarten.`
`However, she seemed to notice that her cousins, whom she rarely ever saw, were playing all around her,`
` and she was very excited.`
`Battler and George had the energy of middle-school or nearly middle-school kids.`
`Those two, along with Jessica, who had met them on Niijima, were clambering about on the boat.`
`"You okay, Asumu?`
` ...You really don't like riding things, do you..."`
`Rudolf lent an arm to his wife, Asumu...`
`"...Welcome to Rokkenjima.`
` Thank you for making such a long journey."`
`The whole family had gathered for the conference.`
`At this point in time, Rudolf's wife was still Asumu, and Ange hadn't been born.`
`Gohda and Kanon hadn't yet been employed by the Ushiromiya family,`
` and the witch's epitaph, which would toy with the family's fate, hadn't appeared yet.`
`They probably couldn't even imagine the bizarre crime that they would encounter several years later...`
`"Krauss-sama, Madam.`
` The family has arrived."`
`"Good...`
` Should I call for Father?"`
`"Please do.`
` I will go welcome everyone.`
` ...Oh, Shannon.`
` Who cleaned this window frame?!`
` It still has dust on it...!`
` Quickly, wipe it off!"`
`"A-As you wish, Madam."`
`...Oh, come on.`
` Natsuhi's making her work so hard again.`
`Just what good does she find in such a limited, ulcer-inducing life?`
`I wanted to know.`
`...Shannon,`
` what is it that you found?`
`And what did you mean when you said I already knew what I was missing?`
`Shannon,`
` is this something I must learn by learning about you...?`
`"What's different about the day of the family conference on Rokkenjima?!"`
`"It's gotta be the noise!`
` There's never this many kids around!"`
`"...It may have been a tension-filled day for the adults, `
`but to us kids, it was a wonderful day, the only time we got to see all of the cousins we loved."`
`"In the summer, we'd play with our cousins on the beach, and even in the winter, there were plenty of games we could play!`
` The family conferences were tons of fun for us."`
`"Same here.`
` Mom was always yelling about how there must be no mistakes,`
` but to me, it was just the day I got to play with all my cousins.`
` After all, there's usually nothing at all to do on Rokkenjima."`
`"Back when I was still a little brat, `
`I was always jealous of Jessica, getting to live in this huge mansion with a private beach.`
` But now that I try putting myself in her shoes, it must've been a pretty constricting place to live."`
`"Probably...`
` There's hardly anything on Rokkenjima.`
` No friends' houses, no next door neighbors, no neighborhood.`
` If you think of how Jessica must have felt, you have to feel a little sad for her."`
`"That's why the family conference was so special to me.`
` Jumping around, messing around!`
` It felt like I was at a festival.`
` We played tricks on each other all the time."`
`"If the adults always talked about adult things and told you to go play somewhere else..."`
`"Then you were three cousins at about the same age.`
` Of course you'd horse around!"`
`"No, not the three of us.`
` The four of us."`
`"But I thought Ange wasn't born yet, and Maria was still too young to play with you?"`
`"You've got it wrong, Furfur.`
` The cousins weren't the only ones at the same age."`
`"Shannon-chan was the fourth.`
` She was about the same age as the rest of us."`
`"Mom was always going on about not talking with the servant kids, `
`but Shannon and I started to get close.`
` After all, she was the girl closest to me in age on Rokkenjima."`
`"All four of us played together.`
` We played at every family conference.`
` Right, Shannon?"`
`"...Right.`
` I knew that Madam would scold me if she found out, but..."`
`"I wouldn't have let her!`
` You were always the one close friend I had who could understand me...!"`
`"Thank you for your words, ...Milady..."`
`I simply could not hide my shock.`
`How had she formed a relationship with the children of the family, despite being only a servant?`
`Natsuhi had probably been very careful to prevent such a relationship.`
`However, it's no surprise that Jessica, all alone on this island,`
` would want to be friends with a kid her age.`
`And Shannon was also alone on this island, without any friends her age.`
`Though they both understood their relationship as master and servant, they somehow managed to strike up a friendship...`
`Then, at the family conference, Jessica had introduced Shannon to George and Battler.`
`All of the adults had their hands full with their complicated discussion in the mansion.`
`During that time, Shannon was able to set aside her role as a servant for a little bit,`
` acting her age with Jessica, George, and Battler.`
`I didn't even know that Shannon had constructed this new world so quickly.`
`As a butterfly hiding in the shadows,`
` ...I observed this new world of Shannon's.`
`"That day, we ran all around the rose garden and the beach."`
`"Just running around and playing was a blast."`
`"Yep.`
` Those were the only times that Shannon-chan smiled like a girl her age."`
`"I might have...gotten a bit carried away.`
` It's embarrassing..."`
`"Battler's insanely huge now, but back then, Shannon and I were both taller and stronger than him."`
`"I just grew slowly back then."`
`"*giggle*`
` They say that those who start late end up the tallest."`
`"Ihihi!`
` Yeah, totally!`
` Back then, your chest was nothing like this, right?"`
`"That's not true...`
` Shannon already had plenty of womanly charm back then. Right?"`
`"U, ah...wh-who knows..."`
`"What the hell do you mean by 'womanly charm', you perv?!"`
`"Well, I was still pretty cute back then myself.`
` That bra strap you could see through the shoulder of her summer clothing set off the lightning of youth in me...!`
` I remember whispering with George-aniki that night about how big her tits might be! Ihihi!"`
`"I-Is this true, George-sama...?!"`
`"*cough*, *cough*cough*!!`
` I believe there has been some sort of misunderstanding...!`
`A-All I remember was lecturing him, as the older and more knowledgeable cousin, about the differences between how boys and girls grow, *cough*cough*!!`
`And so, rather than dirty talk between cousins late at night, it was, instead, a sign of healthy growth and, umm..."`
`"...Yeah, I remember all of us cousins talking about stuff like that until midnight...`
` ...About how apparently, someone in the next class had kissed someone else,`
` or how you held hands with a girl you liked at summer camp...`
` And about so-and-so who you thought probably liked you, stuff like that...!`
`...Dammit, it's so embarrassing it makes me shiver...!"`
`"Isn't that nice!`
` Another sweet page in the book of adolescence!"`
`"The most pure love comes when boys and girls first start noticing each other!"`
`"That simple, pure desire just to be around someone of the opposite sex,`
` the noble first loves."`
`"Just wonderful...`
` A bunch of kids thinking and talking about the world of love...!"`
`"D...`
`...Did that sort of thing...`
`r-`
`really happen...?"`
`"Ihihi!`
` Don't play dumb!`
` You were the most absorbed and curious of all of us, sitting there 'til even your ears turned red, ihihi!"`
`"I-I was not curious...!`
` I-I was just...`
`s-`
`surprised...`
`at how much everyone knew...`
`and..."`
`"That's right.`
` Shannon always played dumb the most, even though she was the most interested.`
` She was the biggest pervert there. Ihihihi."`
`"Th-That's not true,`
` that's not true,`
` I hate you, Milady!"`
`"Hahahahahahahahahaha...`
` Yeah, it was always like this.`
` In the day, we'd run around like kids, and at night, we'd hug our pillows and talk about secret stuff.`
` Looking back on all of it now, ...it really brings back some fond memories."`
`"We'd be whispering about something dirty, and whenever we heard the footsteps of the adults coming by, we'd jump under the covers and pretend to be sleeping!"`
`"Yeah, I remember that!`
` Like some school field trip!"`
`"Those times we all dove under the covers at once.`
` It felt like some sort of unspoken rule, like a strange sense of unity.`
` I really liked that feeling."`
`"Well, anyway,`
` that's not all we talked about.`
` There was a lot more than that.`
` We really did enjoy our youth to the fullest."`
`"And what...is this?"`
`Shannon,`
` ...is this that 'fun thing' of the Human world?`
`Is this incomprehensible messing around the thing that you found?`
`"A bunch of kids gathered together, playing stupid games and talking about trivial matters.`
` ...Is this the Human pleasure you found that surpasses the pleasures of witches?"`
`"...Yes.`
` Doesn't it look fun to you?"`
`"I won't call it boring.`
` However, I cannot see how such a vulgar game can compare to my paradise, `
`where all wishes can be granted."`
`"Interacting with people...is a lot of fun.`
` Of course, I also think your world is fun.`
` But even so, ...I choose this world."`
`"...I don't understand.`
` ...I don't understand at all..."`
`Beatrice held her head as though she was having a headache.`
`But no matter how much she grimaced, she couldn't think of an answer.`
`"...Tell me.`
` ......What is it you found within this vulgar playing?"`
`"......`
`Do you want to know...?"`
`"I do!"`
`"Love."`
`"Lo...ve...?"`
`"Here.`
` It's the Queen book I promised."`
`"Th-Thank you very much.`
` I'd be happy to borrow it."`
`"That's okay. You can keep it, Shannon-chan.`
` I've already read it."`
`"B-But...`
` I can't accept this...`
` It was probably expensive."`
`"It's just something I got for a few hundred yen at a bazaar.`
` Don't worry about it.`
` I'd rather if you read it quickly so we can talk about it.`
` It's fun to talk about this sort of stuff with you, Shannon-chan."`
`"Yes,`
` it's fun for me too.`
` It's much more fun to read mystery novels with two people instead of alone."`
`"I like talking about it and imagining all kinds of things.`
` With mystery novels, reading's only half the fun.`
` My theory's that you can only really enjoy it when you talk with other people who've read it too."`
`Our relationship began when we realized that we both read mystery novels.`
`We were both surprised and very interested to find that the other not only read tons of mystery novels, `
`but read them very thoroughly.`
`Ever since then, it's been like this.`
`Separate from the games we played with all the cousins, the two of us met together for some time alone...`
`At first, it was like a sort of contest to see who knew more than the other.`
`However, eventually, this turned into respect for how much the other had read and how deeply they were able to think about it.`
`Respect.`
` Trust.`
`Those emotions made our friendship even stronger.`
`Of course, all of that had still fallen within the category of 'friendship'...`
`...But we were still slightly aware of the fact that the other was of the opposite sex,`
` making for a relationship that was charming, or youthful, ...or maybe you could call it exciting.`
`However, we were still at the age where calling us 'young men and women' would probably be a bit too gracious.`
`Of course, we didn't know a thing about love.`
`So, we couldn't understand that exciting feeling in our chests, both bitter and sweet, that we only felt when we were alone together.`
`However, we realized that there was some unknown emotion hidden behind that feeling, `
`...and as our hearts raced, `
`we had our hands upon the door.`
` That was the exciting age we were at.`
`So.`
`At some point, our discussions about mystery novels became just an excuse for us meeting alone...`
`"There aren't many mystery novels that care much about the 'why dunnit'."`
`"The 'why dunnit'?`
` You mean the culprit's motive...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` There are three points you need to figure out in mystery novels: the 'who dunnit', the 'how dunnit', and the 'why dunnit'.`
` A lot of mysteries deal with the first two, but surprisingly few worry about the final one."`
`"Well, I know about many works that take great care to have the culprit confess his motive after he's been found out..."`
`"But it has to be something you can reason out before the culprit confesses, or it doesn't count.`
` Personally, I think it's unfair for a person who supposedly didn't have a motive to commit the crime, `
`unless it's possible to reason his or her motive out."`
`'Who dunnit'.`
` Who's the culprit?`
`'How dunnit'.`
` How did he commit the crime?`
`'Why dunnit'.`
` Why did he commit the crime?`
`"There are a ton of works that ask about who the culprit is, `
`and what tricks they used.`
` In fact, almost all are like that.`
` However, I don't think there are many novels that ask you to figure out the motive."`
`"Good point.`
` That might be the most neglected of the three."`
`"Mysteries that don't take the 'why dunnit' seriously don't really feel complete to me.`
` ...No, I'm not saying they're boring.`
` ...It's more like...they're missing the most important part."`
`"The most important part...is missing...?"`
`"The heart.`
` The heart is missing."`
`"...The heart..."`
`"I think the human heart is a really important thing.`
` If a person's gonna decide to commit murder, plan it out, get everything ready, and actually carry it out,`
` you'd need an incredibly strong force of the heart.`
` The heart is what moves people."`
`...In other words,`
` only the heart can kill a person.`
`When an emotional upheaval grows strong enough to make a person want to kill, the result is the tragedy called murder.`
`If we turn it around, does that mean that the true way to close in on the crime is by searching for the heart that brings about the tragedy of murder?`
`Only the heart can kill a person.`
`So, if a person has been killed, you must search for that heart.`
`That's what he's saying.`
`"That's why `
`I can't really enjoy novels where the culprit is `
`just a homicidal maniac who kills for fun."`
`"...Then you like novels that show a strong enough movement of the heart to lead to murder?"`
`"That's right.`
` And my favorite ones are the novels that let you reason that out."`
`As he spoke, he looked back at me and smiled.`
`...Before today, I used to like novels that focused on exposing tricks.`
`However, I decided to look for novels like the ones he recommended in the future.`
`"I don't like neglecting the heart.`
` ......The heart is what makes people move."`
`"...Yeah.`
` I think you're right..."`
`This isn't limited to the mystery genre.`
`All humans are moved by their hearts all the time.`
`Being able to notice the heart is what allows for interactions between people...`
`...no, interactions between hearts.`
`None of us humans can live on our own.`
`And yet, we have no way of peeking into the hearts of others.`
`That's why every meeting between people...is a mystery of the heart.`
`Finding those, reasoning about them, and understanding each other is the key to interactions between people and hearts.`
`The two of us are here, all alone, talking together about mysteries.`
`And through that...`
`We are searching out each other's hearts, speaking of the heart's mysteries...`
`I want you to feel about me...`
`...the way I feel about you.`
`We're both searching, `
`trying to figure out the depths of the other's heart...`
`in this mystery of love.`
`"Nng, ...look how late it's gotten.`
` I wonder if Aniki and the others are waiting for us."`
`"Yes, we should probably go back soon..."`
`"...Time seems to fly by when I'm talking with you, Shannon-chan."`
`He seemed to be speaking the words of my heart.`
`We were thinking the same thing, so the same words came out.`
`"I wish we could talk together like this forever...`
` I hate clocks."`
`"Same here.`
` Talking about this stuff with you is the most fun part of coming to Rokkenjima."`
`When I saw that his smiling eyes were looking right at me, ...I turned away.`
`I couldn't let him see my suddenly red face.`
`"If only I could leave this place,`
` ...I'd be able to read so much more..."`
`"............"`
`The bookshop on Niijima that I go to and the bookshop he goes to in the city are on completely different scales.`
`The book exchange between the two of us had become completely one-sided, with him giving me all the books.`
`"How long do you plan to be a servant, Shannon-chan?"`
`"...I don't know."`
`"If, someday,`
` you decide to quit..."`
`"If I do...?"`
`"Come over to my place."`
`He said it almost carelessly.`
`Maybe he was a bit embarrassed, since he laughed weakly and blushed a little.`
`"And then,`
` ...we won't need to worry about time running out anymore."`
`"...That's right.`
` ...We could be together...as long as we wanted..."`
`The little secret dates on this island only happened a few times a year,`
` ...and even when they did happen, it was only for a short, uncertain period of time.`
`It wouldn't work over the phone or with letters.`
`We can only talk about our mystery when we're standing together like this.`
`"I know that day'll come someday."`
`"...You think it will...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I'm certain of it."`
`Certain?`
` Why is he certain...?`
`"When that day comes,`
` ...I'll come for you, riding a white horse."`
`"...Wha...?"`
`After saying this, he turned away.`
`He was probably too proud to show me his blushing cheeks.`
`But even without seeing, I knew what his face looked like.`
`To come riding on a white horse...`
`...umm, isn't that...`
`Uhh, isn't that like a prince riding a white horse...?`
`So, what exactly does that mean...`
`umm...`
`ummmmm...`
`Does it mean...you're going to be my prince...?`
`...My mind was going blank, so I just couldn't reason out his mystery of love, even though it was all plain and simple...`
`"...I-`
`I wonder...`
`when that day will come..."`
`"Anytime you're ready."`
`"Huh......?!"`
`My heart skipped a beat...`
`It was so sweet, ...yet it hurt...`
`"Anytime's good for me.`
` This is your life we're talking about, Shannon-chan.`
` You should think about it carefully before you decide.`
` ...And once you've made up your mind, I'll respect your decision, no matter when you make it."`
`"...O-`
`Okay..."`
`"I'll keep on waiting until that day comes."`
`"Nng, ...ah..."`
`If only I had been a bit more foolish...and courageous.`
`I could have said then and there that I was already prepared, and asked him to take me away from this island right away...`
`But I couldn't say it.`
`I had to think carefully about my future, for both of our sakes...`
`My head was filled with pointless, senseless thoughts...`
`"...I-`
`I'm glad...`
` ...Thank you..."`
`"Heheh..."`
`With his back still to me, he scratched his head and laughed.`
`I knew he was doing this out of embarrassment, so I could clearly tell what his expression must have been.`
`In the same way...`
`He must have realized what my face looked like.`
`We're both puzzle-solvers of love.`
`We theorize about each other's love, solving each other's mysteries...`
`"...Thanks for giving me time."`
`"You have all the time in the world."`
`"No.`
` ...I'd feel bad `
`if I kept you waiting too long."`
`"Hahaha."`
`"So, I've decided.`
` ...No, I should say that I will decide.`
` ...I don't mean that I'll quit my job today, right now.`
` ...Yes, ...one year.`
` ...One year from now."`
`...If, a year after now, you still feel like coming for me on a white horse...`
`And me too.`
`If I still like you a year from now...`
`I'd like to dedicate the rest of my life to you...`
`"One year from now, right here,`
` ...I'd like to make my decision."`
`"...A year, huh?`
` That sounds good.`
` Spring, summer, autumn, winter.`
` ...That's a good amount of time to look honestly into your heart."`
`"...S-`
`So, `
`...next year..."`
`Please,`
` ...come for me, okay...?`
`"Yep."`
`He responded to my cowardly determination with a quick, strong answer...`
`"I'll be waiting for that day to come."`
`"Yes.`
` ...I'll be waiting too...`
` ...Make sure...you come, okay...?"`
`"Yeah."`
`"...Don't forget.`
` Come here next year, okay?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I'll come, that's for certain.`
` I'll meet you here."`
`That's for certain.`
`......I see.`
`So, `
`...this emotion that feels like sweet suffocation...`
`is love...?`
`It is an emotion I do not know.`
` One I do not have.`
`Though my magic can grant any wish.`
`Though my paradise can grant any wish.`
`That thing I cannot have,`
` ...that incomprehensible emotion...`
`...that burns like fire, and yet, madly, one wants to hold it close...`
`All I know is that no matter how great a witch I might become, I cannot create this emotion.`
`It must be given by another person.`
`For the first time, I realized that I wasn't all powerful.`
`And, I knew what Shannon had discovered in the world of Humans...`
`"...This emotion,`
` ...it's just too much...`
` ...Once you've felt it, `
`...there's no forgetting it, is there...?"`
`...Shannon,`
` ...you win.`
`Love, ...is it?`
`It may be the most important element...and the one that I lack...`
`...Shannon.`
`I'll watch and see how your love develops.`
`So please, ...teach me more and more about this new emotion......`
`"............"`
`"...This form is..."`
`"I'm lending it to you.`
` After all, I hate idiots.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*`
` Call yourself Clair, as a temporary name.`
` Or would you prefer Beato?"`
`"......`
`...You have my gratitude.`
` This way, I won't have to expose my pitiful form."`
`Bernkastel had given Clair a fake form.`
`It was a temporary form, for the person acting the part of Beatrice.`
`A fake to fool those who still hadn't discovered Beatrice's true form...`
`"...Then...`
`is this a tale...`
`about me in another world?"`
`"Lion,`
` ...this is indeed a tale of you in another world, and also my tale.`
` ...The tale of a world where I live as a witch, not a Human..."`
`"......I am capable of imagining 'what if' scenarios for my own life.`
` ...However,`
` the tale you tell...`
`...is beyond `
`anything I can imagine..."`
`"Even so,`
` ...it's the life that another 'you' has led."`
`"But still!`
` That doesn't mean I can accept it easily."`
`Lion suddenly yelled and looked at the floor.`
`Lion already knew.`
`Because of the Fragments lent by Bernkastel, Lion knew.`
`There was a different world, where Lion lived as the Golden Witch Beatrice.`
`And, in this world, ...eventually,`
` ......on the day of the 1986 October family conference,`
` ...she would be the ringleader of a terrible crime.`
`"...Even if it is a different world,`
` ...you're saying that I get my entire family and all of the servants involved in a terrible crime that I'm the mastermind of!`
` How am I supposed to deal with that?!"`
`"......Be quiet, listen, and figure it out."`
`"In a different life, I end up as a servant!`
` And if that wasn't enough, I suddenly become a witch!`
` And then, I eventually carry out several terrifying murders...!`
` How am I supposed to understand that?!"`
`"............"`
`"Yeah, I see where you're coming from.`
` ...I doubt anyone could understand.`
` ...This person here thought that no one would ever understand.`
` That's why you're here.`
` ...That's why Bernkastel brought you two, two people who never should have met, together like this."`
`"......It's not like I had any deep reason for it.`
` It was just a whim."`
`"This is a motive that no one else can understand, Lion, so you need to be the one to understand it.`
` I'm not the main character in this tale.`
` You are.`
` ...I'm just here to help you understand."`
`"You said that you understand the culprit's motive."`
`"...Yes."`
`"Is that motive...`
`a satisfying explanation for why I'd kill my entire family...?!"`
`"Who knows.`
` That's for you to decide.`
` Even if I say it's satisfying, that doesn't mean it'll satisfy you.`
` ...You have to decide that for yourself."`
`"I really don't have a clue what's going on...!`
` I've seen several crimes called game boards that Beatrice supposedly carried out.`
` And now, I'm hearing another me talk about a different life from mine.`
` But there's no connection between that and the crime!`
` I don't understand!!"`
`"......At this point in the tale, ...even I...`
`could not have dreamed that I would eventually carry out such terrible crimes.`
` In fact, even if I had been able to dream of it,`
` ...I did not have the power to commit those crimes at that time."`
`"Probably.`
` ...Your misfortune probably came...`
`when you solved the epitaph's riddle."`
`"......Huh?`
` You mean that epitaph about the hidden gold, which Grandfather supposedly wrote...?!"`
`"There exists a system for gaining different accomplices for each crime.`
` ...Reasoning can lead us to the possibility that the culprit possessed a vast amount of money.`
` We can also envision another system,`
` ...which involves inviting all to the Golden Land...`
`...and making all loves bear fruit."`
`"...So, it wasn't just the motive.`
` You've already seen that far as well."`
`"That's the answer to the final riddle from the 4th game.`
` ...Your greatest misfortune was solving the epitaph,`
` ...reviving as the Golden Witch in the truest sense, and gaining magical power."`
`"...Looking back, ...was that really misfortune after all?`
` ...I do not know.`
` However, as long as the fact that Battler-san returns in 1986 remains unchanged,`
` ...some sort of tragedy would certainly have occurred."`
`"That's right.`
` ...If Battler had returned a year earlier or later,`
` ...that incident might not have occurred."`
`No, some small incident probably would have occurred.`
`And it would surely have been a mysterious, impossible incident, which no one could have explained.`
`But even so, compared to the Rokkenjima serial murders, it would have been a tiny thing...`
`"...If Battler-kun...`
`...had returned a year earlier or later, `
`...then what?"`
`"......`
`...Fate can be so filled with irony.`
` ...It made me walk the path of a witch, ...and when I solved the epitaph, I became a true witch.`
` ...Then, six years passed, and I learned of his return.`
` ...If all of that was fate,`
` ...then this crime must have been inevitable and inescapable for me."`
`"In 1980,`
` Battler was resentful because of the death of his mother, Asumu, and his father's remarriage that came too soon, so he left the Ushiromiya family.`
` For six whole years, he had no direct contact with them."`
`He convinced his grandparents on his mother's side to help him and went by his mother's maiden name.`
`Then, when those grandparents passed away, he finally made up with Rudolf...and returned to the Ushiromiya family again in 1986...`
`"That bad luck...gave birth to your motive for the crime."`
`"...I did wonder.`
` ...Why, after six whole years,`
` ...did he finally come back?"`
`"I understand.`
` In a way, ...it would have been better for you if he had never come back."`
`"Of course, my suffering would have continued.`
` ...However, I may not have tainted myself with the unforgivable crime of mass murder."`
`"......How could Battler-kun leaving `
`create a motive?"`
`"You've got it backwards."`
`"...Backwards?"`
`"The crime didn't occur because Battler left.`
` ...It happened because Battler came back."`
`"......`
`...The more I think about it,`
` ...Ushiromiya Battler...`
`was quite a disagreeable man.`
` More than anything else, because he never realized that the outbreak of the crime was his fault."`
`"He did remember, in the end.`
` ...However, that was long after you gave up and disappeared."`
`"...If that is so,`
` ...then it would give my heart some peace..."`
`"I don't have a clue what you two are talking about anymore.`
` ...But I'd like to ask you bluntly.`
` I want to know.`
` ...What on earth happened to you that made you decide to commit a crime?"`
`"Yes.`
` That's the most important part.`
` ...It's just like how Ushiromiya Battler respected the 'why dunnit' in mystery novels.`
` ......That's where the answers to all the riddles are hidden, ...both in the tale of the Golden Witch and in the game."`
`"In that case,`
` ......allow me to continue.`
` ...1980.`
` ...Six years before I resolved myself to committing the crime."`
`Chapter 6: `
`Days of Trials.`
`"...Battler-sama...`
`...has left the Ushiromiya family...?"`
`"That's what Krauss-sama and Rudolf-sama were saying!`
` What a shock!"`
`"I have no intention of criticizing your way of life or your family situation.`
` However, Father is in a towering rage.`
` Disinheriting a son is one thing, `
`but I've never even heard of a child becoming fed up and leaving the family on his own."`
`"...That Battler can be surprisingly stubborn.`
` Sort of like someone else I know."`
`"If you are unable to understand Battler-kun's feelings, one might question your right to be a father."`
`"Enough, Natsuhi.`
` I'm sure Rudolf was just trying to show how dedicated he was to raising Kyrie-san's child, in his own way."`
`"I would have nothing to say if this were happening next year.`
` ...But why this year?`
` He's still in his period of mourning.`
` ...If you consider the timing of this pregnancy, one must acknowledge that Rudolf-san has acted disgracefully."`
`"...Come on, don't be so harsh.`
` ...This is my way of atoning for what I've done..."`
`"Battler-kun's trying to protest against you on the behalf of his departed mother, Asumu-san.`
` ...I deeply understand how he feels.`
` If he were here, I would want to hold him and cry along with him."`
`Natsuhi's words were sharp.`
` They pierced Rudolf mercilessly.`
`Rudolf had no retort.`
`His relationship with Kyrie had been adulterous, plain and simple.`
`...According to Rudolf, he had been close to Kyrie longer than Asumu.`
`And, even after his marriage to Asumu, that relationship had not disappeared...`
`What the hell does that mean?!`
` You old bastard!!`
`So, you've just been betraying Mom from the start!!`
`Sure, I know Kyrie-san.`
` You've told me that she was your business partner and a friend whose advice you could always rely on!`
`If you're trying to say after all this time that she was more than that, then why should I give a damn?!!`
`After Mom's death, you could've done whatever you wanted!`
` I'm right there with you, saying that you should live life as you please!`
`But just when did Kyrie-san get pregnant?!`
` Back when Mom was still alive, right?!`
`Yeah, now I finally see!`
` So this is why you always make me want to vomit!`
`Are you glad that Mom's finally dead now? You are, aren't you?!`
`I'm sure it would've been so hard on you, keeping your infidelity and even a kid secret while Mom was still alive!!`
`But now that Mom conveniently kicked it, you get to marry Kyrie-san, and I get a new little brother or sister?!!`
`You can bet that Mom's crying in heaven!!`
` You bastard, you're embarrassing!!`
`I'm embarrassed!!`
` So embarrassed I can't stand to have the same last name as you!!`
`The kid is completely guiltless.`
` It'd be too sad if he or she doesn't have both parents together.`
` Go ahead, build a new family and raise that kid to have a happy life!!`
`But I'll never forgive you!!`
`Mom isn't here to hate you anymore!!`
` So I'll hate you in her place!!`
` With all of my body and soul!!`
`So long, old bastard!!`
`"............"`
`"That is enough, Natsuhi.`
` ...Rudolf hasn't lost the affection he feels for Battler-kun.`
` ...It may take some time, but he wants to fix their relationship one day."`
`"As any father should.`
` ...If it were some complete stranger, that would be one thing, but this is your own flesh and blood son.`
` It's clearly your responsibility."`
`"...Go ahead.`
` Despise me all you want.`
` I won't argue.`
` ...That's the only way I can atone."`
`"At the very least, make sure you give the new child a happy life."`
`"...The kid who's going to be born...and Battler.`
` ...They're both my kids."`
`"Wedding Kyrie-san after Asumu-san's death may have been painful for Battler-kun,`
` ...but it was the best choice you could make for the coming child.`
` ...I understand why you did it."`
`"And I understand why Battler-kun felt like telling you that you were happy Asumu-san is dead."`
`"Stop, Natsuhi.`
` ...Rudolf has already been scolded enough by the person most fit to do so."`
`"...Now then, how about some black tea?`
` Could you go ask someone in the kitchen to make us some?"`
`"......Understood."`
`Natsuhi took this as a signal to leave the room and did so.`
`Once she left, Krauss relaxed slightly.`
`"......I feel bad for Asumu-san,`
` ...but if we consider the timing of that soon-to-be-born child, this might have been quite the coincidence."`
`"Almost as though...`
`...Asumu knew that, and stepped down from the stage of her own choosing.`
` ...Did I kill Asumu...?`
` ...If so, ...how long has it been since I started killing her..."`
`"If you still treasure Asumu-san's memory,`
` ...then no matter how many years it takes, you must fix your relationship with Battler-kun."`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...I know."`
`"And be sure to pour just as much affection on Kyrie-san and the new child that is to be born.`
` ...While also bearing Asumu-san's cross."`
`"......`
`...If they have reserved seating in hell..."`
`"...Hmm?"`
`"If they do, `
`...I'd like to reserve myself a VIP spot..."`
`"............"`
`The news that Battler had abandoned the Ushiromiya name swept across the family.`
`"And poor Battler-san, too...`
` I do believe that he'll make up with them eventually, but..."`
`"...This is a matter for the family.`
` It is not something servants need concern themselves with.`
` Instead, we should focus on memorizing the face of the newest member of the Ushiromiya family, Kyrie-sama."`
`"Yes, that's true.`
` She will be coming to the family conference this year..."`
`If the person who just joined the Ushiromiya family would be coming to the conference...`
`...Then what about the person who just left the family...?`
`"That means Battler isn't coming, right?"`
`"That seems the most probable outcome.`
` How lonely is the loss of a single, noisy man."`
`Though most people felt a bit lonely to see Battler leave the Ushiromiya family, they didn't think any more about it than that.`
`However, ...what about Shannon?`
`Wasn't Battler supposed to come for her on a white horse...?`
`I was surprised at first.`
`I thought that, since he had left the family, he might not be coming to this island anymore.`
`...If we consider Battler-san's feelings, this is only natural, I guess.`
`I understand painfully well why he wanted to leave his family...`
`But...does that really mean he won't come to Rokkenjima anymore...?`
`What on earth is going on?`
`Will he really never return?`
`Unable to ask him this directly, I was forced to live each day fretfully...`
`...Battler-san.`
`I understand how you feel...`
`But......`
`......To say that you'll never return because you've abandoned your family...`
` ...That's a lie, right...?`
`I was so confused that the world seemed to be spinning around me...`
`I had a tight feeling in my chest...and couldn't think about anything.`
`When I happened to touch my cheek, `
`...I was surprised to find it hot and wet.`
`...While wearing a truly miserable expression on my face, `
`I was...`
`crying...`
`Shannon,`
` ......Shannon......`
`From far away, ...I could hear someone calling to me.`
`But it was a very strange sort of distance.`
`Though it felt very far away, ...the voice also seemed to be coming from right beside me.`
`"...Shannon,`
` I know...your heart..."`
`"It's okay.`
` ...It's just a fight between a boy and his father.`
` And I'm sure the rumors blow everything out of proportion.`
` Everything's just being exaggerated."`
`"Indeed.`
` There are none who can say with certainty that Battler will not return to this island.`
` You would do well to remain strong."`
`...Where...is this place...?`
`I seem to remember it somehow.`
`I think it reminds me of the scenery from a strange dream I once had.`
`...Then...this must be another dream...`
`I was there, under an arbor surrounded by a golden rose garden,`
` and two witches in white and red dresses were showering words of encouragement upon me...`
`"You can be sure that those rumor-mongering young servants are embellishing the story however they please.`
` So, he has changed his name, they say?!`
` Surely, this can be nothing more than a family quarrel."`
`".........`
`...Thank you.`
` ...I wish I could believe that..."`
`"Of course it's true.`
` He's a boy, after all.`
` You can hardly be surprised that he's had a few arguments with his dad."`
`"Precisely, as you say.`
` Clearly, they will make it up to each other once they cool their heads."`
`"When men argue, it's always fiery at first, but they burn out quickly."`
`"In contrast, an argument between women burns like a steady flame, but the fuel never goes dry.`
` Men's arguments are fierce but short!`
` Quick and easy."`
`"...You're right.`
` ...I hope Battler-san and Rudolf-sama...`
`...make up soon..."`
`"Oh, they will!`
` Haven't you heard Battler mentioning it all the time?`
` He always fights with his father!`
` This is just another of those fights.`
` The death of his mother and his father's remarriage have merely upset him."`
`"It sounds as though he's gone to live with his mother's parents, but after he's cooled his head for a few days, he'll come back.`
` It's like a kid running away from home, see?"`
`The two witches kept saying that Battler's fight hadn't been anything huge.`
`...If it had been a mere family quarrel, the rumors wouldn't have started in the first place.`
` Taking an optimistic view here isn't likely to prove useful...`
`"Either way,`
` this is a problem between Battler and his father.`
` If you're patient, time will heal all wounds!`
` There's no point in you feeling bad over it."`
`"Just because Battler happened to be absent today doesn't mean we can be sure he'll never come back.`
` All this means is that Rudolf came alone today."`
`"True.`
` Of course, he will be at the next family conference, as energetic as ever!`
` By then, Rudolf will probably bring that Kyrie here too.`
` Battler may be sulky about it, but I am certain that he will come as well!"`
`"...You're right.`
` ...Yeah.`
` ...I'm sure...you're right."`
`How nice would it be if they were right...`
`In fact, if I could, I'd like to flip through the calendar until autumn right now and check to see whether he does come to the next conference.`
`If he does, then all of my fears are groundless.`
`It would mean the rumor-mongering family members and servants have just blown things out of proportion...`
`If Battler-san was right here, I'd want to question him right away...`
` ...Hey, it isn't true that you'll never come to Rokkenjima again, right...?`
`And then, if he said that of course he would come again, ...it would be such a relief...`
`I don't know the phone number for Rudolf-sama's house, but I could probably look it up if I tried.`
`However, as a servant of the family, I have no excuse for making such a call.`
`And anyway, I have no way of knowing the phone number for Battler's grandparents' house...`
`I can't do anything except wait for Rudolf-sama's family to come visit and hope that my fears are groundless...`
`However, will I be able to make it through the day feeling like this...?`
`No way.`
` I doubt I'll sleep a wink tonight.`
`Just waiting around, feeling like this, ...when I don't know when my next chance will come...`
` I can't do that...`
`Will it be next month?`
` Or the month after?`
`...In the worst case, I might have to wait until the next family conference.`
`And I have to wait that long...while holding back this suffocating feeling...`
`...I can't bear it...`
`"Hey, Shannon.`
` Sorry to ask this out of the blue,`
` ...but when you made up your mind to do something by the next year, that something wasn't just quitting work as a servant on this island, right?"`
`"...Uh, ...that...`
`......"`
`I...made the decision to start a new life.`
`I didn't want keep on being a servant by force of habit.`
`I made the decision to step into a new life...and to leave my old life as a servant behind.`
`"And Battler promised that he'd come here on the day of your decision, right...?"`
`"...Ummm, `
`...yes..."`
`"Tact is not one of my strong points, so I shall speak frankly.`
` You made the decision and resolved yourself to starting a new life with Battler, correct...?"`
`"...A new life...`
`...with...Battler-san..."`
`"You are afraid that Battler will not come for you on the day of your decision.`
` However, there is more to that day of decision than just Battler coming to see you."`
`"It's also the day for you to show that you're determined to spend the rest of your life with him."`
`"This determination is something you must create for yourself.`
` It won't bear fruit simply because Battler shows up."`
`"...Shannon,`
` do you now have the determination to spend the rest of your life with him?`
` You decided to put it off until the next family conference because you didn't have that determination last time, right?"`
`"What does it mean to live life with Battler?`
` Have you ever thought seriously about it in detail?"`
`"Well, ...uh..."`
`As long as I'm working as a servant on Rokkenjima, my opportunities for meeting him are limited.`
`We're both underage, so it's too early to talk about...umm...marriage.`
`However, if I quit working as a servant, I should have many more opportunities to meet him.`
`Once I quit work here, ...I'll return to the Fukuin House.`
`I have my wages from serving the family, so I should have more than enough to travel to Battler-san's house to play.`
`And when I graduate from school, I can rent an apartment near Battler-san's house.`
`Then, well, ...I can work while going to school.`
`That life would be a lot more difficult than I first thought.`
`...However, I'd be able to see Battler-san much, much more often.`
`If not every day, then every week.`
`I won't be a servant anymore, so there won't be any difference in class.`
` ...I can call him whenever I want.`
`And I'm already doing both school and work.`
`Thanks to my experience here, I know more than enough to do simple housework...`
`"...Doesn't that sound like a fun life?`
` You can rent a humble abode, and once you've built up your own home, you can invite Battler over."`
`"And then, the time you spend together, the world the two of you make, will begin.`
` Doesn't that sound wonderful?"`
`"...Y-`
`Yes.`
` ...It does sound a bit...`
`...wonderful..."`
`This was the first time I had ever imagined that future clearly.`
`My love for him, and my honest desire to live my life with him.`
` ...Earlier, I was able to consider both of these deeply.`
`However, now that I'm clearly imagining the future I plan to choose, I finally understand.`
`I must be aware of how much determination will be needed to reach that future.`
`"You dream of marriage `
`eventually, don't you?"`
`"Hoh! Hoh!`
` Girls these days, dating with marriage in mind at such a young age...!"`
`"W-Well, that's a bit, umm...!"`
`"Don't deny your dreams, okay?`
` There's no point in taking a first step if your eyes are closed and you don't look to the future."`
`"If a girl's in love with a man, there's nothing wrong with thinking 'I wanna marry him'!`
` That's a young girl's natural right."`
`My face had turned bright red.`
`Earlier, I thought that considering marriage really was a bit premature, `
`so I tried as best I could not to think about it.`
`...However, when the witches encouraged me to imagine it, that image was both exciting and vivid.`
`I felt an indescribable feeling of refreshment and awakening,`
` ...like the gentle breeze that washes over you when you go outside during a brief spot of sunshine on a rainy day.`
`That's right, I didn't actually have the determination to go that far.`
`I need to strengthen my determination by the time the next family conference comes around.`
`If I can't do that, then sticking around as a servant on this island is no more than I deserve.`
`"And at the same time, this is also a trial."`
`"True.`
` A trial to be overcome."`
`"...A trial...?`
` Why is that...?"`
`"Fool.`
` Battler promised that he would come for you at the next family conference, did he not?"`
`"He said he'd come on a white horse, right?"`
`"...Y-Yes..."`
`"You're thinking that Battler will not come anymore.`
` In other words, you have no faith in Battler's promise."`
`"That's why this is a trial.`
` To pass through this trial, you'll have to show that you can trust him and wait."`
`"......A trial..."`
`I hadn't thought of it that way.`
`Since he promised to come for me in a year...`
`Then I need to believe that he'll come for me in a year.`
`...If I doubt that, I don't have the right to wait for him in the first place.`
`............`
`"In fact, `
`Battler might have left the Ushiromiya family because he's set his sights on a future with you."`
`"Oh, why would that be?"`
`"If he knows that you will live together and eventually exchange marriage vows,`
` having the name Ushiromiya would cause problems, since Shannon is a servant of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"Ah, I see!`
` He realizes that there'll be all kinds of trouble if he decides to marry a servant girl, so he's abandoned the Ushiromiya name beforehand...!"`
`"What do you think, Shannon?!`
` That way, everything makes sense!`
` Battler has abandoned the Ushiromiya name for your sake!`
` This sudden argument with Rudolf was just an excuse."`
`"What splendid reasoning!`
` Nice going, Riiche!"`
`"Wahahahahahahahahaha...!`
` What do you say, Shannon?`
` There's no reason to feel down!`
` On the contrary, it's as though Battler has shown his determination first!"`
`"...*giggle*`
` ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*..."`
`A smile had finally returned to my face.`
`Of course, I hadn't taken the witches seriously and let myself be reassured.`
`It was closer to the opposite.`
` It was almost funny that they could think up such ridiculously convenient explanations for everything.`
`However, they had made all of those ridiculous theories to cheer me up.`
`...The witches are right when they say that I must trust Battler-san...`
`and that there's no point moping about just because I've heard a few rumors.`
`Until the next family conference, I intend to strengthen my resolve.`
`And, ...I believe that he'll accept my feelings and come for me.`
`The idea that Battler left the family so that he could be married to me some day...`
`...was laughable, of course.`
`But right now, I should try and feel confident enough to accept even crazy ideas like that.`
`"...Thanks so much.`
` ...I feel a little better now."`
`"That is well.`
` I cannot stand watching you cry yourself to sleep."`
`"Thanks for coming into my dreams to encourage me."`
`"Indeed.`
` ...It will be morning soon.`
` This is all a dream.`
` You won't remember any of it when you wake.`
` However, your heart will be at peace."`
`"......Yes.`
` ...I'll believe in him...and wait.`
` ...So, I won't listen to every little rumor."`
`"Very good.`
` Wait until the next conference while improving yourself.`
` If you think of it as training to become a wife, all of your everyday chores will grow more meaningful!"`
`"*giggle*`
` ...Thanks a lot."`
`"...Riiche,`
` it'll be morning soon."`
`"Is that so?`
` Then so long, Shannon.`
` ...You may not remember me,`
` but I will always be by your side, watching over you..."`
`"Thank you...`
` ...Yes, thank you..."`
`"...The next family conference will be here in a flash.`
` ...Wait for it at your leisure...`
` Battler will certainly keep his promise..."`
`"Pleased to meet you.`
` ...My name is Kyrie.`
` I hope we can all become quick friends."`
`"I've known your name longer than I've known Asumu-san's.`
` I hear you're Rudolf's old girlfriend."`
`"*giggle*`
` Yes, we've known each other for quite a long time..."`
`"...Welcome to the Ushiromiya family.`
` I hope you find it easy to grow comfortable here."`
`"Yes.`
` I'd like to grow comfortable quickly, so that I can support my husband."`
`"But look at how cute that little girl is.`
` What's her name...?!"`
`"This is Ange-chan.`
` What a cute name."`
`"......So, you two couldn't make up after all."`
`"I thought this would be the perfect chance to bring him back, but...`
` ...He's as stubborn as Dad."`
`"Will Battler-kun ever come back...?`
` I'll miss him."`
`"Nothing wrong with a man havin' enough backbone to find his own way in the world.`
` I'm sure he'll have made it big by the time he comes back...!"`
`"You think so?`
` Right now, Battler-kun's home isn't home for him.`
` The place he comes home to is somewhere else now."`
`"...Enough.`
` This concerns Rudolf's family only.`
` It is not our place to meddle."`
`"Thank you, Krauss nii-san.`
` ...This is an issue for our family alone.`
` However, I intend to do all I can to see that Battler-kun and Rudolf-san can live together again someday.`
` After all, he's Ange's one and only big brother."`
`"...Yep.`
` When that kid gets stuck on something, anything you say to him will have the opposite effect.`
` ...Asumu's father has a bit of a short temper.`
` Looks like he's been adding fuel to the fire."`
`"It'll be okay.`
` I'm sure he'll understand your feelings before too long."`
`"We can't do anything except cheer you on.`
` ...Even if he doesn't come back, we're all prayin' that the two of you will make up quickly."`
`"...It's a bit boring without Battler."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...I hope he and Uncle Rudolf can make up soon."`
`"...Thinking about how Battler-sama feels, ...it must have hurt."`
`"His family basically got swapped around.`
` ...It probably doesn't feel comfortable at home anymore."`
`"All men need to go out on their own one day or another.`
` It might just be that Battler-kun's time has come."`
`"Do you think so...?"`
`"I do.`
` It's not cool for a guy to hang around at his parents' for too long.`
` You've got to leave the nest in a flurry and make your name in the world.`
` ...I planned to do that eventually, but it looks like he's gone and done it first."`
`"A-And when he makes his name in the world and becomes a great man, ...will he come back?"`
`"It may be...that he never comes back.`
` After all, this might be leaving the nest to him."`
`"...Leaving the nest......"`
`"Battler didn't come, did he..."`
`"Oh, how terrible.`
` And I kept telling Shannon that he was sure to come.`
` ...I'm sure she's very upset over Battler's absence.`
` And it's all because I got her hopes up...!"`
`"She's been looking forward to this day...`
` It pains me to think of how she must feel."`
`"......Thanks, you two.`
` ...I'm...okay."`
`I had been reunited with the witches once again in that dream world.`
`...Though I could never remember anything during the day, now that I was in the dream world, I somehow knew that this was a reunion.`
`The witches both looked apologetic.`
`Though they had tried to cheer me up by saying that Battler would come today,`
` now that he hadn't come, it was like they'd been lying, and they seemed to regret it heavily.`
`"Shannon, `
`...umm...`
`...well..."`
`"...Thanks for your concern.`
` I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sad,`
` ...but I'll be okay."`
`"A-Are you sure?`
` Really sure?`
` ...That would be splendid, but..."`
`"Clearly, Battler's fight was so over-the-top that he couldn't bring himself to back down so soon.`
` Men are so stubborn."`
`"Y-Yes, that is true...!`
` He tried to act tough before running away, so his stubbornness is preventing him from taking back what he said so easily!`
` He'll probably regret not coming today.`
` Yes, that must be it...!"`
`For some reason, ...they seemed nearly desperate in their attempts to encourage me.`
`It was almost funny to watch.`
` ...I couldn't help but giggle.`
`"Thanks a lot, both of you.`
` After all, ...you're the ones who told me in the first place.`
` That this is a test, ...a trial to be overcome."`
`The truth was, I couldn't really fool myself so easily.`
`When will he come back?`
`When will he come for me?`
`When...isn't the question.`
` ...Will he come for me, ever?`
`If I start moping right now, the uncertainty and sadness will probably tear me apart.`
`But they've taught me.`
`This is...a trial to see whether I really believe in him or not.`
`The very fact that I feel uncertain and anxious is a betrayal of my resolve...`
`and of his promise to come for me someday.`
`"George-sama said something about it.`
` ...He said this might be the same as leaving the nest for Battler-san."`
`"That's right.`
` This is his chance to leave behind the Ushiromiya name and spread his wings as his own man."`
`"If you really think about it, ...we're still very young.`
` Even if we want to be tied together, we're still lacking many years of social experience and trust.`
` If Battler-san is really and truly taking this seriously, ...then it's too soon for him to come for me now."`
`"Well done.`
` Yes, that's the right attitude...!`
` You have done well to reach this understanding."`
`"...I haven't reached anything...`
` ...However, I've decided to think of it that way for now.`
` This is a trial...to see whether I trust Battler-san or not."`
`If he had come today,`
` ...then today, I would have had to tell Madam that I wanted to quit my job as a servant.`
`However, was I really prepared to do that?`
`Last night, I kept worrying about whether Battler-san would come or not.`
`Thanks to that, not only did I not have the resolve to quit my job, I hadn't even started on the paperwork to do so.`
`...In short, I still don't have the 'determination' that I promised him that day.`
`I'm sure that God knew that.`
`Battler will come for me when I've found my determination.`
`I wasn't determined, so it's only natural that he didn't come today...`
`............`
`...Yeah.`
` ...It all makes sense now.`
`"So,`
` ...I'm sure Battler-san didn't come today...because I wasn't determined enough.`
` It's only natural, since I couldn't even truly believe that he would come..."`
`"I'm sure Battler was the same way.`
` He did not yet have the determination and resolve to come for you."`
`"...God is not heartless.`
` When your feelings truly do draw close, I'm sure they'll bring the two of you together."`
`"Just like Orihime and Hikoboshi...!"`
`"Yes, it's as though the weather just happened to be bad during this year's Tanabata, keeping those lovers apart for another year...`
` ...That's how I'd like to think about what happened today."`
`That's how...I'd like to think about it.`
`...I have no other choice.`
`............`
`...Battler-san...`
`"But Battler-kun didn't come back for..."`
`"Six years.`
` ...Still a long way to go until then."`
`"...So, you had to wait six whole years feeling like that...?"`
`"When one waits every year for something to happen the next, and then the same thing the next year and the next,`
` ...it becomes the same as waiting for an eternity."`
`"...Pretty pathetic, don't you think?`
` After all, this promise you thought you made with Battler seems to be something he knew nothing about, right?"`
`"Battler-kun does tend to use melodramatic phrases, just like Uncle Rudolf.`
` ...His roundabout way of putting things might have led to a misunderstanding..."`
`"Some girl's gonna stab Battler in the back someday.`
` ...Well, I guess that's more or less what this tale is."`
`"...When words can mean different things, they can turn a person's life upside-down.`
` ...There are times when careless talk costs lives."`
`"............"`
`Chapter 7: `
`Sprout of Love, Root of Love.`
`"Seriously!`
` Why do guys turn into total morons when they get together?!"`
`Jessica's room was filled with laughter.`
`"It was one hell of a reality check...!`
` I thought this guy was a bit cool, a bit adult-like.`
` And then I see him with some of the other guys in our class, talking about dirty stuff with this creepy laugh!"`
`"It's true that boys always act like little kids when they're together."`
`"Well, it's not like girls are any different!"`
`""Ahhahahahahahaha!!""`
`The fun chat between girls continued without end.`
`Tonight, Krauss and Natsuhi were out late at a meeting on Niijima.`
`Most of the time, Natsuhi was always watching, so Jessica would always make sure to be curt with the young servants,`
` but when Natsuhi wasn't around, Jessica never did that.`
`She had invited the servants of similar age to her room, and they were chatting away noisily...`
`At that age, everyone wants to know about love.`
`Thanks to the rigid and constricting way Jessica had been brought up, she enjoyed talking about it all the more...`
`"But you're pretty incredible, Milady. And you're that age!`
` Aren't there any boys you're interested in?"`
`"W-Well, I'd like to fall in love, but there really aren't any...g-good ones around...!"`
`"I think you should be a bit more proactive about it.`
` You can act all relaxed now, but that's not gonna last long, okay?`
` Once one of your friends starts going out with someone, it'll turn your world upside down."`
`"Th-There's no way that'll happen...`
` None of my friends are traitors...`
` I-I think."`
`"Ah, no, no, no!`
` The outbreak of love is the one time you can't rely on friendship between girls!`
` If you met someone you liked, you'd betray your friends and go out with the guy without a second thought, wouldn't you?!"`
`"A-Ahahahahahahahahahahaha...`
` Wh-What about you, Shannon...?!`
` It's not fair if I'm the only one who has to talk!"`
`"I, umm, ...don't have anyone like that around..."`
`...Not around.`
`He's far, far away, ...and like Orihime and Hikiboshi, I don't get to see him very often.`
`In fact, ...I don't even know when I'll be able to see him again.`
`...However, I believe that he'll come for me someday.`
` ...I believe it.`
`"Don't you betray me, okay, Shannon?!`
` If we get boyfriends, we'll get them together, you got that?!`
` Right? Right? We promised, right?!"`
`"Well, you might not believe it,`
` but it's not at all rare for girls just like Shannon-chan to get a head start!`
` *giggle*giggle*!"`
`"Shannon, confess!!`
` You aren't going out with anyone, are you?!`
` You aren't, right?!"`
`"I-I'm not. Really..."`
`"Really?!"`
`"R-Really..."`
`"We'll get boyfriends together, okay?`
` No matter what happens, okay?!`
` Anyone who lies has to eat porcupinefish!!"`
`"Y-Yes...`
` I promise..."`
`"Now there's the face of a liar!`
` I'm willing to bet Shannon-chan beats everyone else in this room!`
` I can tell.`
` It's always the quiet ones that go first...!"`
`"Shannon, how could you?!`
` Confess, confess!!"`
`"P-Please stop, Milady...!`
` Th-That tickles...!`
` A-Ahahahahaha...!!"`
`...And so, another Sunday afternoon passed by.`
`I worked my way out of the fight and looked up at the sky through the window.`
`...Is Battler-san happily chatting away with his friends somewhere right now, just like I am?`
`As I think of you like this,`
` ...are you thinking of me...?`
`But if I ask that, it's the same as admitting that I don't trust you.`
`......I'll wait.`
`And, when you do come for me, I'll announce then and there that I'm quitting my job.`
`I've already prepared myself to do so.`
`...But...you haven't come yet.`
`That isn't because you won't come, ...but because I'm not determined enough yet, right?`
`It's because I haven't clearly envisioned a future with you, right?`
`I'll wait.`
` ...No matter how long.`
`...Until you come for me, riding a white horse...`
`I will always treasure our promise.`
`The promise of our precious resolve...`
`"Never make a promise with a guy.`
` You can't count on them!"`
`Thinking that she had read my mind, I spun around.`
`Of course, she hadn't, but...`
`"Well, for stuff like that,`
` I think guys and girls have different ideas of what's important."`
`"No, that's not it. You've got it all wrong.`
` On the whole, girls tend to be dreamers, and guys just do stuff without thinking."`
`"I guess understanding between the sexes is pretty much impossible after all."`
`"At least, I think it's pretty hard.`
` Girls often have the bad habit of thinking they know exactly what the guy is thinking right away.`
` They search for hidden meanings behind words that guys say for no reason in particular,`
` and just get the wrong idea."`
`"Ah, yeah, I've known girls like that.`
` Those girls who hear something that anyone else could tell them was trivial, but think it means the guy is totally into them.`
` Yeah, I see it all the time."`
`"It's a bit sad when a girl gets the wrong idea for no reason."`
`Ahhahahahahahahaha.`
` The pair of them laughed together.`
`...When a girl...gets the wrong idea.`
`Could that be...me...?`
`No, that can't be.`
`After all, Battler-san clearly made a promise.`
`He said he'd come for me riding a white horse.`
`...I mustn't...doubt.`
`I'm sure this conversation I'm hearing is just another one of God's trials.`
`So, I won't listen.`
` I won't care about it.`
`"If there's one thing I never want to be, it's one of those poor girls who thinks a guy's heart is linked to hers for no reason."`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha."`
`Those demonic sneers tormented me and tried to lead me astray.`
`...I'm sure he'll come to the next family conference...`
`But Battler-san didn't appear at the 1982 conference either...`
`Bit by bit, things were changing from the way they'd been at the last family conference he'd come to.`
`Everyone had gotten completely used to Kyrie-sama, Rudolf-sama's new wife,`
` ...and she came down off the boat with a familiar stride.`
`Her daughter, Ange-sama, was growing well, and all of the family focused their attention on her.`
`Even Maria-sama, though she was still tiny, was already five years old.`
` She was full of energy and old enough to enjoy playing with George-sama.`
`Jessica-sama and George-sama had already stopped talking about Battler-san's absence.`
`It was the same with the other relatives too.`
` ...No one touched on the subject, as though they had forgotten that Battler-san was missing.`
`Maria-sama had only been three when she'd last seen Battler-san.`
`It was doubtful whether she even remembered him.`
`...In just two years...`
`All trace of your existence...has been erased from the Ushiromiya family conference.`
`That made me sad.`
` And so...`
`"...So, it looks like Battler-san didn't come back this year either."`
`"True.`
` ...Feeling a bit lonely?"`
`"Well, ...umm..."`
`"Uncle Rudolf and Aunt Kyrie don't even bring him up anymore.`
` ...It looks like Battler-kun was much more serious about it than we thought."`
`"I wonder if he really will stay away forever."`
`"It looks like that was him leaving the nest after all.`
` He's spread his wings and left for a new stage of life.`
` Don't you think so?"`
`"...He's always been crazy and reckless.`
` Well, what more'd you expect from a guy?"`
`"Well, we know Battler-kun.`
` I'm sure he's adapted to his new life and is enjoying himself.`
` So, I don't think there's any reason to worry."`
`When George-sama said that with a smile, I felt a bit uncertain.`
`What does he mean by 'there's no reason to worry, I'm sure he's enjoying himself'...?`
`"This is Battler we're talking about, so you can bet he's forgotten all about us and is having a great time."`
`"Yeah, I'll bet he is.`
` And I think that's for the best.`
` Thinking for himself, his family, and his late mother, Battler-kun decided on his own to find a new life.`
` So, I hope he lives that new life to the fullest.`
` If he forgets about the Ushiromiya family, that's just perfect."`
`George-sama smiled at me, as though expecting me to agree.`
`...After a moment of shock, I smoothed my expression over and found the expression he was expecting.`
`Is Battler-san...living happily, `
`...having forgotten about the family, about me, about our promise...?`
`That can't be true. It just can't be.`
`Battler-san must be looking forward to that day of decision just like me.`
`I'm not mistaken about that.`
`He promised me.`
`He said he'd come riding a white horse.`
`I never asked him to say that.`
`He said he'd come for me on the day I resolved myself to live life for his sake.`
`He made that promise himself.`
`For two years,`
` I've believed that.`
`I've done all I could to make it through God's trials and the whisperings of demons that tried to throw me from my path.`
`And yet, ...the things both George-sama and Jessica-sama are saying...are so cruel.`
`Battler-san has forgotten about us and has started a new life?`
`Why are they telling such lies...?`
`But that night...`
`I dreamed of Battler-san for the first time in a long while.`
`The Battler-san in my dream...wasn't the Battler-san I believed in.`
`...It was the Battler-san that George-sama and Jessica-sama had spoken of,`
` ...the one who had forgotten everything and started a new life.`
`Morning.`
`I woke up with a tear-stained face.`
`The face I saw in the mirror...cried and told me it couldn't wait any longer.`
`If I've managed to wait this long, why can't I wait any longer...?`
`This is a trial.`
` ...So, we must believe in him and wait.`
`But the me in the mirror spoke.`
` ...It was sharper than a fragment of glass.`
`...I talk about this promise with him, ...but did we ever really make such a promise...?`
`Wasn't Jessica-sama talking about it?`
` That some girls are dreamers who get the wrong idea?`
`And wasn't George-sama talking about it too?`
` ...He said that Battler-san had gotten used to his new life and had forgotten about the Ushiromiya family.`
`...And by now, he isn't the only one who's forgotten.`
`Unless I ask about it, everyone on this island has forgotten his name.`
`Even Rudolf-sama doesn't say his name anymore.`
`If I weren't here to remember his face,`
` ...perhaps his existence would have been erased from everyone's hearts.`
`...I don't believe it.`
` So, I won't doubt.`
`Battler-san must still remember his promise.`
`We're both waiting for the day of decision, the day we'll be together.`
`......Battler-san.`
`I've firmly made up my mind.`
`Does the fact that you're not here mean that, after all, I'm not determined enough?`
`No.`
` ...It's because you and God are testing me, isn't it?`
`In that case, I will endure.`
`Until that promised day inevitably comes.`
`...So, ...please.`
`Battler-san.`
`I want some proof...that you haven't forgotten me...`
`It was the crack that ran across my ceramic-like heart.`
`I had to acknowledge it now.`
`...It may be...that I'm pretending not to notice something terrifying and sad.`
`Battler-san...makes me yearn for him.`
`Battler-san...makes me sad.`
`Battler-san...makes it hurt...`
`Battler-san.`
`...Do you still remember me, now...?`
`And then...came the third family conference since Battler-san left.`
`If the number of beds was going to increase, we would've been told about that when setting up.`
`The fact that nothing has changed in particular...means that he probably won't be here this year either.`
`Clinging to a final bit of hope, I stood by the docks, watching the boat draw closer.`
`"Hey, Shannon-chan.`
` You're looking as pretty as ever."`
`"Careful, Ange.`
` Watch your step."`
`"Hey, Shannon. Ah, I really do love Rokkenjima...!`
` I can't wait for Uncle Krauss to turn it into a resort."`
`"There's no need for that.`
` It'd be such a waste."`
`"Heheheh, you've got a point there.`
` How have you been, Shannon-chan?`
` I think you've gotten a bit taller since last time."`
`"...Thank you very much."`
`"And the weather's good again this year...!`
` It's so great, havin' every single member of the family together all nice and cheerful."`
`"Please allow me to guide you to the mansion..."`
`So, after all, ...Battler-san has been so thoroughly forgotten that he might not have existed in the first place.`
`I'm sure the sadness will show on my face.`
`Not wanting anyone to see it, ...I turned my back to the family and led the way up to the mansion by myself.`
`Then, ...suddenly, someone mentioned Battler-san's name, and I jumped.`
`"What, you saw Battler-kun?"`
`"How's he doing...?!"`
`"Yeah. `
`He's doing very well.`
` I took Ange and had some tea with him the other day."`
`I was surprised.`
` ...So, Kyrie-sama was in touch with Battler-san.`
`According to her, both Battler-san and Rudolf-sama had long since calmed down after their fight,`
` but both were so stubborn that they hadn't found a good chance to make up.`
`And, since Battler-san had gotten used to living with his grandparents and going to school there,`
` and considering that those grandparents might make things even more difficult, going to convince Battler-san to come home wouldn't be easy.`
`"...It's just too bad.`
` I think Asumu-san's parents were even more angry than Battler-kun was.`
` This isn't just an issue between Battler-kun and Rudolf-san anymore."`
`"Then will Battler be coming back sometime soon?"`
`"He will make up with Rudolf-san, but it looks like he doesn't intend to return to the Ushiromiya family.`
` ...Such a shame.`
` Though I do understand how he feels."`
`It was a bit of a relief to hear that some of the bad feeling had died down in these three years.`
`If we take Asumu-sama's parents into account, it's no surprise that things haven't gone as well as they could.`
`But if Battler-san doesn't hate Rudolf-sama anymore, ...then someday...`
`...Surely he'll come back.`
`He'll have grown so much.`
`My resolve will not waver anymore.`
`For some nights these past three years, I've felt sad and resentful.`
`But now, ...it feels as though those three years were something I needed.`
`After all, ...the seeds of love, the faint feelings I once had for you...`
`have budded powerfully, waiting for the day that we'll be reunited.`
`This is how honest my feelings for you are now.`
`...I...love you.`
`I want to see you again as soon as I can.`
`Until that time, ...I'll keep that bud of love warm and growing for you...`
`I won't doubt the coming of that day anymore.`
`Just as I think of you, under the same sky...`
`I believe that you are thinking of me.`
`...I'm sure this news about him is a sign that God is cheering me on.`
`So, I asked God one more time, inside my heart.`
`Since my feelings for Battler-san have not wavered for a day these past three years...`
`Let me know that he feels the same way.`
`I know that asking for that is a sin.`
`However, now that we've reached a three-year turning point,`
` ...I want some gift from God, any gift, to show that I have not waited in vain.`
`That is what I prayed.`
`"Oh, that's right.`
` It's been so long since Battler-kun last saw you all, right?`
` I thought you might be feeling lonely, so I told him to write you letters.`
` Here they are."`
`......Huh...?`
`Did God...really hear my prayers?`
`I felt as though my heart was going to leap out of my chest.`
`"A letter from Battler?`
` Awesome!`
` What'd he write?!"`
`"Did he say anything about how he's been doing lately?`
` I can't wait to read it."`
`Kyrie-sama pulled a brown envelope out of her bag and handed it to George-sama.`
`Just one?`
`When George-sama opened it, several folded letters came out.`
`"Looks like this one's addressed to me.`
` ...They all have different names on them.`
` Here, this one's yours, Jessica-chan."`
`"Thanks!"`
`"And this one's for Maria-chan.`
` Can she read yet...?"`
`"I'll read it to her later.`
` Thank you."`
`"There's even one for Ange-chan.`
` Now of course she can't read."`
`"*giggle*`
` I'll give it to her when she does learn."`
`"He says he's doing great and having a blast...!`
` Good for him."`
`"...Umm, `
`...is that...`
`all of them...?"`
`"Yep.`
` Looks like that's all of them.`
` Thanks a lot."`
`George-sama handed me the empty envelope.`
`...Apparently, he thanked me because he thought I was offering to throw it away for him.`
`And, clearly, ...there was nothing inside it.`
`There was no letter for me...`
`"Whoa.`
` The more I read, the more fun it looks like Battler-kun's been having.`
` Living every day to the fullest."`
`"That's what it looks like in mine, too.`
` If he's happy, then I guess that's what counts."`
`"*giggle*`
` That's so mean of Battler-kun.`
` It sounds like he forgot about us until you told him to write those letters, Kyrie-san."`
`"Well, you know what he's like.`
` It sounds like he was living life to the fullest.`
` And I hear he's popular with the ladies at school, too."`
`"Wow...!`
` That's incredible!"`
`"There should be plenty of girls who like those hilarious, melodramatic lines of his.`
` Makes sense to me."`
`"I wonder if he really does plan not to return to the Ushiromiya Family."`
`"It looks like it.`
` In mine, it says he doesn't think he'll return to Rokkenjima again."`
`I knew that all of these letters were trials from God.`
`The fact that there was no letter for me...and the fact that he was enjoying life and had forgotten about Rokkenjima...`
`were just more trials.`
`He is...`
`God is...`
`...testing me.`
`The fact that there was no letter for me alone is proof of that...`
`......That's...`
`...what I want to think...`
`...But...`
`...now it's just...`
`Too much......`
`"...It might've been an important promise to you,`
` ...but it looks like it wasn't for Battler."`
`"............"`
`"...No way.`
` ...Then, that promise about him coming for you was..."`
`"I was a dreamer. It was just an illusion I created..."`
`"To Battler, they were probably just meaningless words to make him sound cool."`
`...To anyone but her, it would have been such a funny story to hear.`
`That promise with Battler might have been an illusion the whole time.`
`In the first place, we don't know if they both felt the same way about each other at all.`
`Love is an illusion.`
`However, if both sides are seeing the same illusion, that love becomes true.`
`However, when the feelings of each side are different, ...then it's nothing more than a joke.`
`"This is Battler's sin."`
`"...Making Shannon think...that it was a promise."`
`"Wrong."`
`"...Huh?"`
`"...It's that he didn't even remember."`
`"If he simply broke his promise, ...I could have taken him to task for it.`
` I could have regretted my mistake, or I could have won him back.`
` ...However, you can't question someone about something they don't even remember."`
`"............"`
`"I am unable to hate Battler-san.`
` ...After all, Battler-san didn't even break his promise."`
`"There just wasn't...any promise to start with."`
`"...It was nothing more than a sad...joke."`
`...I kept on crying and crying.`
`I dug my fingernails into my pillow, soaking it with my tears.`
`How much easier it would be to hate something...`
`But I can't hate anything.`
`I just couldn't get over my miserable arrogance, `
`which had led me to believe for three whole years that he felt the same as I did.`
`"...I am to blame for this.`
` ...My irresponsible words led you to believe that Battler made a promise..."`
`"No......`
` This isn't anyone's fault.`
` ...It's all because I assumed that he felt the same way I did..."`
`"Battler made no promise.`
` And yet, his feelings were surely sincere!`
` Though there might have been a difference in degree when compared to yours,`
` it is true that he liked you!`
` Of that, there can be no doubt."`
`"...Please, ...just stop it...`
` ...I've believed that he liked me the way I liked him, without ever doubting that.`
` ...Please don't try to cheer me up.`
` ...I'd rather...that you mocked me..."`
`Before I knew it, `
`...a dull, inescapable pain had pierced my chest.`
`When I pressed my hand against my chest, I realized what that pain was.`
`It was the bud of love, whose seeds I had sown and nurtured in my heart.`
`Its roots had spread all the way across my chest,`
` ...tormenting me like a metal wire wrapped around my heart.`
`They looked less like roots...and more like fissures running through my heart.`
`I can only hold back the pain by tearing out the root of love.`
`But no matter how much I scratch at it, I'm only scratching at my chest.`
` ...The root of love doesn't move at all.`
`If I started hating Battler-san, without any lingering interest or regrets,`
` ...I'd be able to pull this root out easily.`
`Once I did, it would probably leave a hole behind, but at least it wouldn't hurt me anymore.`
`But I can't pull it out.`
` ...Even though it hurts so much, those roots of love are still stuck in my heart.`
`"...Shannon......"`
`"I...`
` ...Even now,`
` I...`
`...love Battler-san.`
` ...I want to see him.`
` I want him to come back...`
` I believe he will come back someday,`
` and I want to wait for him...`
` ...But right now...`
`it's just...`
`too much..."`
`As I sobbed, the tightness in my chest grew even stronger.`
`As long as I like Battler-san, that pain will always continue.`
`Because I like him, I want to hold onto that pain forever.`
`But, ...it was written right there in the letters for George-sama and the others.`
`Battler doesn't plan on returning to the Ushiromiya family.`
`He's forgotten about me and Rokkenjima...`
`and has started a new life with a different name.`
`I must wait for him for all eternity, `
`...despite how painful, aching, excruciating this is...`
`"Is this another trial...?`
` Is God telling me...`
`to wait for him forever...?`
` I can't do that...`
` I...`
`...want to be with Battler-san.`
` But if this is the trial...`
`that I must go through for that,`
` ...then it's just `
`too painful..."`
`"............"`
`Beatrice hung her head in shame.`
`If she hadn't encouraged Shannon so much, it probably wouldn't have been this painful.`
`Shannon may have been the one to sow the seed of love in her heart.`
`However, Beatrice had irresponsibly watered it and told Shannon not to give up.`
`...Beatrice scratched at her chest, trying to share Shannon's pain...`
`"......This is...my fault."`
`Beatrice mumbled to herself.`
`"...What's your fault?"`
`"For three years, I tortured you with the illusion of a promise that never happened.`
` ...If I had not nourished the bud of love within you, you would not have suffered so."`
`"............"`
`"Shannon,`
` this may sound harsh, ...but listen."`
`"...What is it...?"`
`"Forget Battler.`
` ...There was no bud of love in the first place."`
`"...No.`
` I'm the one who nourished it.`
` ...No matter how painful it is, I can't forget it."`
`"But you cannot bear that pain any longer, can you...?"`
`"............"`
`Wordlessly, Shannon held her chest and hung her head.`
`I...love Battler.`
`That feeling burns inside me, `
`...so that I still cannot let it go no matter how much it hurts.`
`And, I've spent three years pretending that I didn't feel that pain.`
`Now, I know that I feel it.`
`And since I know, ...I can't bear it...`
`"So, you cannot throw away your bud of love for Battler?"`
`"......Yes."`
`"However, at this rate, the bud...`
`...the root...will kill you."`
`"............"`
`"People need a universe to survive.`
` ...And one person cannot create that universe alone.`
` Two are needed."`
`"...A universe..."`
`"Together with Battler, you created the universe of that bud of love.`
` ...Now that one half of that pair is gone, your universe has crumbled.`
` ...People cannot...complete a universe on their own."`
`"However, `
`...Battler-san, the other person who creates my universe, `
`...won't come back..."`
`"Then you must create a new universe with someone else."`
`"...You mean, ...create one with someone other than Battler-san?"`
`"I will give you such a person."`
`"...Which...person...?"`
`"A creature to bury the pain in your heart and heal you.`
` ...He will not betray you.`
` ...Yes, ...let it be a sibling.`
` ...I will give you a little brother."`
`"A little brother......"`
`"A boy you have always been close to at the Fukuin House, whom you love as if he were your real brother.`
` ...That, I shall give to you.`
` ...Together with him, you will create a new universe."`
`"...Will that little brother...make me forget about the pain of my love for Battler-san...?"`
`"Correct.`
` ...You need a universe."`
`"Then, ...what will happen...`
`to the bud of love in my heart?`
` ...My feelings for Battler-san won't change.`
` ...I can't make them wither."`
`"......`
`...I shall...`
`accept that bud and those roots in your place."`
`"...You will......?"`
`"You can forget the pain of love and create a new universe.`
` ...I will accept the bud of love in your place.`
` ...It means that I will accept the pain as well, `
`...but I will learn of the single element I do not possess, love."`
`Beatrice...wanted to know love.`
`She wanted to feel what Shannon had felt in the world of humans.`
`"...And,`
` if Battler ever does return,`
` if the bud still has not withered and you still desire it,`
` I shall return it to you.`
` ...What do you think of that?"`
`"............"`
`Still hanging her head, ...Shannon gave a small nod, but said nothing.`
`It would mean release from this unbearable pain.`
`And, it would mean giving the bud of love to the witch, to hold in her place...`
`Shannon spread the hands that she had held to her chest.`
`As she did, a faint light popped out of her chest and floated in the air,`
` ...gradually swallowing everything with its brightness.`
`As the brilliant light began to fade away, Shannon and Beatrice, still facing each other,`
` were now inside a vast, starry sphere, like a planetarium.`
`They were the only ones in this pitch-black starry sea.`
`...Shannon felt as though she'd seen this place once before, but she couldn't remember.`
`Then, I made another announcement.`
`"Modify this world.`
` ...Let the bud of love travel from Shannon to Beatrice."`
`This way, Shannon won't be tormented by the bud of love anymore.`
`And, furthermore, she will be given a little brother, ...with whom she can create a new universe.`
`The design for the little brother will be a younger boy at the Fukuin House, with whom Shannon was close.`
`For a name, ...let there be the 音 character, as the Fukuin House rules state.`
`......Yeah, I've decided.`
`...That's a perfect name to go with Shannon's.`
`He'll be...a quiet, reticent boy.`
`He'll come to Rokkenjima as a new servant.`
`There, he'll open his heart to Shannon.`
`As a duty-minded boy who loves Shannon like a big sister, he'll always be there for her...`
`Let's have him be a special servant like Genji, who is permitted to serve Kinzo directly.`
`...Yeah.`
` That sounds kinda cool.`
`Then, Beatrice.`
`From now on, you will carry the bud of love.`
`In other words, ...the role of being infatuated with Battler and waiting for his return will go to you.`
`While you are still the witch who reigns over Rokkenjima's night...`
`You have also been waiting for Ushiromiya Battler, ever since that day three years ago.`
`Along with this change in setting, I'll give you a new form as well...`
`He did tell us what his ideal woman would look like once, remember?`
`...A woman with a good figure and long, golden hair, like a foreign model.`
`Golden hair.`
`Long hair.`
`A good figure.`
`...Yeah.`
` Something like that.`
`That's what the new Beatrice will look like.`
`Come now, hold that bud of love in your heart as you wait for Battler.`
`...This way, you will learn of love, in exchange for earning pain.`
`Yes, this will be the setting for my new world.`
`For Shannon, a new servant like a little brother will come.`
`He will be a silent, reticent boy.`
` A duty-minded kid who loves Shannon as a sister.`
`And the bud of love that has tortured Shannon...will go to the witch, Beatrice.`
`She will just be holding onto the bud of love for the time being.`
`However, while she holds onto it, she will be a maiden in love with Battler.`
`For that time, you will be able to learn what love is...`
`Come, let the world be modified.`
`Oh, I am one yet many.`
`Awaken, us.`
`And stretch your wings in this new world...`
`...Slowly, ...I opened my eyes to the gentle rays of the morning sun.`
`............`
`How long has it been since I last saw such a pleasant morning.`
`...The face in my mirror is tear-stained and pathetic.`
`However, ...my heart is as clear as the morning sun.`
`I could still clearly remember that strange dream.`
`However, I can feel myself forgetting it rapidly...`
`The place I was in my dreams...had been such a strange place.`
`A peaceful, calm place.`
`...There, ...I had left behind the pain I had carried in my chest until yesterday.`
`So this morning, my heart was at peace...`
`"Good morning, me..."`
`My tear-stained face really is pathetic.`
`However, my expression is bright and cheery.`
`Even now,`
` I...`
`like Battler-san.`
`But, ...for some reason,`
` ...I've calmed down.`
`It feels like I've put something precious safely away in the place it belongs.`
`......Battler-san.`
` When will you come back, I wonder...`
`When you do, I'd like to talk about mystery novels again.`
`...Oh, I almost forgot.`
`A new boy servant will be coming today, right?`
`One of the rare servants who will serve the Master directly.`
`What kind of kid will he be?`
` I hope we get along well...`
`What was his name again?`
`I'm pretty sure it was, umm...`
`Men in work clothes were spreading a tarp over a section of the hall.`
`From the way they measured the wall and set out tools, it could be seen that they were planning some sort of construction project.`
`"This is of the utmost importance to the Master.`
` Be sure that you do not damage it."`
`The president of the construction company nodded his head several times to show that he understood.`
`Then, six young workers carried in a large rectangular object wrapped in a white sheet...`
`"Oookay, careful there!`
` Set 'er down gently... I said gently."`
`"Is this the spot?"`
`"Great, let's get started."`
`Apparently, they were putting something large onto the wall of the hall...`
`"...He plans to hang that thing there?"`
`"That's what he wants.`
` After all, this mansion is little more than one of Father's toys."`
`Natsuhi took a deep breath.`
`Though this was a whim of Kinzo's, a man she greatly respected,`
` ...she seemed to resist the idea of hanging it right here in the entrance hall, the face of the mansion.`
`When the white sheet was pulled off, a Western woman wearing a beautiful dress came into view...`
`It was a massive portrait of a woman...`
`"Is it proceeding well?"`
`"Yes.`
` They will be finished by this evening."`
`"I would like to see it hanging there for all to see as soon as possible.`
` I want you overseeing this, my friend."`
`"Leave it to me."`
`"...Father,`
` it seems a splendid portrait."`
`"Indeed.`
` Quite exceptional quality.`
` I am satisfied."`
`"...This is your benefactor, the woman who gave you the gold, right?"`
`"Indeed.`
` ...If I had not met Beatrice, I would not be here, nor would the Ushiromiya family, nor would, of course, this mansion.`
` It's only natural that her portrait be displayed in the best possible location."`
`Now that he had said it this bluntly, there would be no contradicting him.`
`Krauss and Natsuhi could only shrug.`
`"...Master,`
` the epitaph plate is here.`
` Would you please check to see that all is in order?"`
`"Indeed.`
` Each and every word must be correct..."`
`Epitaph...?`
` Krauss and Natsuhi crooked their heads and followed Kinzo.`
`The leader of the workers set down a plate wrapped in a sheet.`
`The others thought that the picture's name and description might be on it,`
` but it seemed to have quite a lot of words for that...`
`"......Father,`
` what is this...?"`
`"Behold...`
`...the sweetfish river running through my hometown...?"`
`"Heh.`
` ...Heheheheheheh.`
` Read and interpret it as you like."`
`"...So, we finally reach the appearance of the epitaph and the portrait."`
`"I don't know much about this epitaph.`
` It doesn't exist in my world."`
`"Probably not.`
` In your world, there's already a clear successor: you.`
` But not in this world."`
`"In other words, ...this epitaph was set up to choose Grandfather's successor after all...?"`
`"Most likely.`
` Or, he might have wanted to believe in the chance of a miracle."`
`A difficult riddle, made so that no one would be able to solve it.`
`If someone actually could solve it, ...they themselves would be a miracle.`
`Perhaps that miracle...would guide the person Kinzo most wanted to solve it...`
`"In short, this epitaph really does depict a ceremony to revive the witch, Beatrice, just as everyone thought...?"`
`"...That does seem to be the obvious interpretation.`
` A mysterious ceremony, sacrificing 13 people to revive the witch.`
` ...However, the true ceremony wasn't that.`
` ...It lies in wait for someone to miraculously solve it.`
` That is the true ceremony.`
` However, fate does have its irony."`
`"Genji already knew.`
` ...Maybe Kinzo set this up in the first place because he guessed that Genji knew everything."`
`"...Was that fate a coincidence, or something planned?`
` I do not know.`
` ...However, with this epitaph, the witch Beatrice will revive in the truest sense."`
`"Chapter 8: `
`Journey to the Golden Land."`
`"...This is...`
`...Beatrice..."`
`My soul was captured by the woman shown in that massive portrait.`
`That might have been literally true.`
`Or, rather than captured, perhaps it would be better to say that my soul had returned to a more fitting place, the place it belonged.`
`The beautiful blonde hair was the same as mine, but tied up.`
`The dress she wore was a deep black, making that golden hair stand out all the more.`
`...This is the witch, ...Beatrice.`
`My...true form...`
`"?`
` ......What is this?"`
`There was a plate with too many words for it to be the title of the picture.`
`Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved hometown...`
`You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key.`
`"...The Golden Land...`
` ...I see,`
` ...so my world...`
`...is the Golden Land..."`
`I have always called my own, personal world a Paradise.`
`But tonight, I shall change that.`
`From now on, my world shall be the Golden Land.`
`I am the master of the Golden Land, Beatrice...`
`...And then, there is the brutal ceremony of sacrifices, starting on the first twilight.`
`On the ninth twilight, the witch shall revive, and none shall be left alive...`
`"If I carry out this ceremony, ...will I revive in the truest sense...?"`
`Then, on the tenth twilight, at journey's end, you shall attain to the power of the Golden Land's treasures, once and for the last time...`
`The witch shall praise the wise and bestow four treasures.`
`One shall be all the gold from the Golden Land.`
`...Kinzo received a massive amount of gold from Beatrice, and rumor has it that it still lies hidden somewhere.`
`Is this, as the family members and servants are all whispering, a code showing the location of Kinzo's hidden gold?`
`"......If a Human solves it, they will obtain a great quantity of gold.`
` ......However, if I do, it will mean my own resurrection..."`
`............`
`...Kinzo, you aging magician.`
`Just when I was mocking the shortness of the time left to you, you start a game like this.`
`How interesting.`
` ...I'll definitely solve it.`
`Then, I will revive as the real Beatrice.`
`When that happens, I will use my great magical power to rule over object and man, day and night, and all of Rokkenjima...`
`"Everyone says that epitaph is a guide to finding hidden treasure...!"`
`"The rumors tell that the Master has 10 tons of gold hidden away...!"`
`"...Yes, and Beatrice supposedly gave it to him.`
` I've heard that one too."`
`"10 tons of gold... That would be incredible.`
` I can hardly even imagine it."`
`"If you had all that, what would you use it for...?!`
` I'd like to touch it, just once...!"`
`"Hohohohohohohoho!`
` Forget touching it, I'd like to spend it all."`
`"But why would he go out of his way to display this epitaph, this code showing the hiding place of the gold..."`
`"That's obvious.`
` He's laughing at everyone, since he thinks no one can solve it."`
`"It's a challenge to the rest of us, isn't it?`
` He wants to know if there's anyone here wise enough to solve it..."`
`"It seems that the Master doesn't intend to let Krauss-sama take the Headship easily.`
` ...Perhaps the one who solves this will become his successor?"`
`"Genji-san, what is this?!`
` Could this be a portrait of...Beatrice? The Beatrice?"`
`"...Correct.`
` This is Beatrice-sama."`
`"What on earth?`
` There's a strange little poem-like thing over here."`
`"......`
`...What's this all about?`
` ...It's almost like...a pirate code that shows the way to hidden treasure.`
` ...Genji-san,`
` what does this mean?!"`
`"The Master said to read and interpret it as you wish.`
` ...That the riddle applies equally to all who can see the epitaph."`
`"You said riddle just now, didn't you?!`
` That means this can be solved.`
` ...Yes, that's it.`
` Father doesn't want Nii-san to succeed him...!"`
`"So, whoever solves this will become the Successor...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*, *giggle*giggle*...!!!`
` Finally...`
` The tables have finally turned, `
`...and I now have a real chance...to become the Head...!!"`
`"What do you think, Kyrie?"`
`"...I think it's extremely likely that this epitaph points to the location of the hidden gold."`
`"It looks like Aneki thinks the one who solves it will be chosen as the Successor."`
`"That's another theory that might fit.`
` ...Father certainly doesn't view Krauss nii-san as an ideal Successor.`
` This might be a huge trick he's set up now that he's reaching the end of his years."`
`"So, if you really solve this riddle, you stand to gain 10 tons of gold and the position of Successor."`
`"On the surface, perhaps.`
` ...However, I'm sensing some malice, as though he doesn't think anyone capable of solving it.`
` I doubt he made it to be solved easily."`
`"True.`
` ...Heheh.`
` Guess we won't have trouble looking for something to do over a drink for a while now."`
`"...Ridiculous.`
` How could anyone solve this?"`
`Rosa tossed aside a notepad with the epitaph written on it and flopped over onto the sofa.`
`Solving this means 10 tons of gold.`
`With that much, I'd never need to worry about schemes for cash again.`
`...If I had money, I could pay off my debts, ...and that man might come back to me...`
`"...I know where Father's beloved hometown is.`
` And the sweetfish river?`
` There are many rivers there.`
` What's the village supposed to be?`
` Aah, I don't have a clue...!"`
`"...Uu-.`
` What's wrong, Mama...?"`
`Maria looked concerned.`
`Kids are really good at riddles, so maybe...`
`"Hey, Maria.`
` Do you think you know the answer to this riddle?"`
`"............"`
`Maria gazed at the paper with the epitaph on it as though she was trying to bore through it with her eyes.`
`Her eyes opened wider and wider...`
`"What do you think, Maria...?`
` I guess it might be a bit too hard for you."`
`"Kihi.`
` Kihihihihihihihihi!`
` This is a witch's ceremony, a resurrection ceremony for Beato...!`
` Where'd you get this?!`
` Hey, Mama, where'd you get this?!`
` I'm gonna ask Beato!!`
` I'm sure this ceremony will let Beato regain her full power!`
` She'll be able to appear in front of everyone and do miracles of magic, without having to worry about the anti-magic toxin anymore...!!`
` Kihihahaha, hahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"...And the epitaph?"`
`"It seems the family members are all competing to solve the riddle."`
`"Hmph...`
` Good.`
` Let everyone try.`
` And none will solve it.`
` Except for the one blessed by a miracle.`
` ...If I let my guard down, even I might forget the process.`
` That is how difficult it is."`
`"...Because it is difficult, solving it will bring about a miracle..."`
`"Precisely.`
` ...This miracle shall be the last one I desire in my life.`
` My final bit of magic.`
` ...When a miracle comes and allows one to solve that complicated epitaph, ...it will surely mean Beatrice's resurrection.`
` ...Oooh, Beatrice...`
` I just want to see your face one more time...`
` I don't need wealth or honor anymore.`
` If I could only meet you one more time...!"`
`This would be the last bit of magic that Kinzo, who realized he was facing his last years, would ever use.`
`He was betting everything that Beatrice had given him, `
`hoping to meet her just one more time...after being separated by death through two generations.`
`His meeting with Beatrice that day had been the true beginning of his life.`
`And even with them gone, Kinzo had remained there alone on the stage that had gone dark.`
`The aged monarch had obtained everything, accomplished everything, but this was the one element that had always slipped through his fingers, no matter how much he struggled.`
`If he could just have that element, ...he would need nothing else in life.`
`In the end, perhaps his whole life was just a journey to learn...that one single element makes up all that it means to be human.`
`"My friend,`
` ...will my life's final bit of magic show me a miracle...?"`
`"............"`
`For a while, Genji was silent.`
`He wasn't at a loss for words or struggling to find an answer.`
`...During that silence, something had passed between the two men, who had known each other for so long that their friendship surpassed that of master and servant.`
`"...No, that will do.`
` ...No one will solve it.`
` That's why a miracle will occur."`
`"Master,`
` ...please, tell me one thing."`
`"Hmm, ...what is it?"`
`"If, I ask you.`
` ......If a miracle does occur..."`
`"Nn..."`
`It may have been different during his youth, but in his old age, Genji rarely spoke of dreams and 'what ifs'.`
`When Genji said 'if'...`
`...Kinzo quietly waited for the words of the man he called a friend.`
`"If a miracle does occur,`
` if your magic comes true...`
`and Beatrice-sama does revive, `
`what will you do...?"`
`As the one closest to Kinzo, Genji obviously knew of the crazed feelings with which Kinzo had searched for Beatrice in the past.`
`...And yet, Genji was asking what Kinzo would do if Beatrice did revive.`
`"............"`
`"...Master, at one time in the past,`
` you experienced the miracle of Beatrice-sama being reborn.`
` If that miracle happened again,`
` ...what would you do?"`
`"......My friend.`
` So, after all, ...you do blame me."`
`"...I have no way of knowing everything in your heart and Beatrice-sama's.`
` ...However, I believe I do understand at least part...`
`of the way in which Beatrice-sama adored you."`
`"......`
`...I lament the fact.`
` You may not believe it, ...but as I have aged, I have come to regret all of it."`
`"............"`
`"If a miracle does occur...`
`and Beatrice revives,`
` ...then, of course, I do not care if she knows nothing of the time she spent with me in the past.`
` ...No, as long as she is Beatrice, I don't care who it is!`
` ...I just...want to apologize...!"`
`"......Is that truly how you feel?"`
`"Yes, my friend.`
` ...I regret it.`
` How deeply I regret those mistakes made in youth!`
` ...You have aged as well, so you must know.`
` ...One cannot feel guilt for the sins of their youth when one is still young.`
` However, like deep thorns, they began to fester, ...torturing me.`
` ...I, Ushiromiya Kinzo, no longer care how I die!"`
`"However, ...this thorn...this regret...is the one account I must settle...`
` I will return everything to Beatrice.`
` And, I will ask her to forgive me for my sins...!`
` For that is... That is my only and final wish...`
` ...Ooh, `
`oooooohhhh...`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh...!!"`
`Kinzo covered his eyes and sobbed.`
`The aged monarch, who had built up great wealth in a single generation, was reaching the end of his life,`
` ...and he could do nothing but sob because he wanted someone to apologize to...`
`"...Wasn't the epitaph a trial Grandfather made to choose the Successor?"`
`"......`
`I thought that too at first, ...but it looks like the situation's a bit different."`
`"At this point in time, I also thought it was a trial.`
` That it was a game for selecting the Successor, which Ushiromiya Kinzo decided upon on a whim."`
`"And it wasn't?"`
`"...This epitaph......meant something for Ushiromiya Kinzo and Ronoue Genji `
`that only the two of them could understand.`
` So, this was not the workings of fate.`
` It was inevitable.`
` ...I was no more than a Cinderella, with the pumpkin carriage and glass slippers all prepared beforehand."`
`"...I get it.`
` ...So, ...this was a farce that Kinzo and Genji set up."`
`"Kinzo did understand.`
` And Genji realized that this was a message."`
`"I-I don't have a clue what you mean...`
` ...What did Grandfather understand?`
` And what does Genji-san have to do with this epitaph...?"`
`"The epitaph wasn't solved.`
` Someone was made to solve it."`
`"...And then, Beatrice truly revived.`
` ...If that revival had never happened..."`
`"...Then 1986 would still have come, ...but the incident might've been completely different."`
`"And so, ...since the time of my birth, I have been trapped by the crossroads of fate,`
` ...never given the right to make any decisions of my own will."`
`Oh, I am one yet many.`
`And yet, we have never been able to resist fate.`
`We are little more than leaves caught in a whirlpool.`
`No matter how we dance, we must eventually be sucked in and disappear...`
`"Gaap's the one who specializes in instant movement!!`
` She's the 33rd in rank of the great demons...!`
` You must really be incredible to have a friend like that, Beato, uu-!"`
`"I see, the great demon Gaap.`
` ...Very well, my friend, you will now be Gaap.`
` You may call yourself by that name!"`
`"Oh, wonderful.`
` So, you've finally given me a name.`
` It's a relief after being nameless so long."`
`"In that case, I would be honored to receive a name as well.`
` Being nothing more than the head furniture lacks flavor, does it not?"`
`"Maria,`
` I need a name for this guy too.`
` He is also a great demon, and serves as my butler.`
` He is a subordinate whom I can trust."`
`"Uu-...`
` Ronove, I guess.`
` The 27th ranked of the great demons...!`
` It's said he'll give you reliable underlings!"`
`"My, what a coincidence.`
` ...The family name of my double, Genji, is Ronoue."`
`"Hoh, that truly is a coincidence!`
` I see, it seems this is the best possible name for you.`
` Very well, you shall now be known as Ronove...!"`
`"Oh, how pleasant it is to be called by one's name.`
` I thank you for this wonderful name, Lady MARIA."`
`"Just as a form can be a vessel, a name can be a powerful vessel too.`
` For unknown creatures of the other world, simply gaining a name can greatly increase their magical power...!!`
` That's why names are important.`
` Uu-!"`
`"True, names are important and wonderful.`
` Right, Lia?!`
` You can call me Gaap now, okay...?!"`
`"Gaap.`
` A splendid name, I will remember it.`
` ...And I'll ask you to stop shortening my precious name...!"`
`"Pu ku ku ku...!`
` So, you're Virgilia, the one who guides travelers to Beatrice?`
` That is also a splendid name.`
` Perfect for Milady's teacher."`
`"Yes, I do like it a lot.`
` A name is a life."`
`"Maria, thanks to you, my friends have found names.`
` I am deeply grateful...!"`
`"Uu-uu-!`
` Now it's your turn, Beato!`
` Draw pictures of my bunny friends!`
` Like you did for Sakutaro!"`
`"Hmmm, very well.`
` Lend me that grimoire."`
`"Uryu-!`
` Beato's drawings are really great. I can't wait to see!"`
`"What'll it be like? What'll it be like?`
` I can't wait to see the bunnies!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"They were in a forest band, were they not?`
` ...A band, a band...`
` ...Hmm.`
` Yes, something like..."`
`All of a sudden, Maria was no longer a little girl who did nothing but follow her mother around, laughing or crying.`
`Though she is still young, she already has a powerful self-image...`
`and possesses enough knowledge of the magical world to surprise even me.`
`Together, we called ourselves Mariage Sorcière and made each other's magical worlds deeper and richer...`
`"So, a name can become a powerful vessel.`
` ...How profound."`
`"It's very important to have a form for a vessel, but a name is just as important."`
`"Indeed.`
` Those with names leave a greater impression than those without."`
`"It's not just about forms and names.`
` By knowing more and more about them, you can make them exist much more strongly.`
` So, I'll think up lots of stuff for you."`
`"Did you do this for Sakutarou as well?"`
`"Yep.`
` Sakutaro isn't just a name.`
` There's a lot more to him than that."`
`"He is a lion cub, correct?"`
`"Sakutaro's a vegeta-lion, so he doesn't eat meat.`
` But everyone else thinks he does, and they're scared of him.`
` But Sakutaro's also a scaredy-cat, so he's just as scared as the others.`
` Ahahahaha, Sakutaro's such a coward."`
`"Uryu-.`
` I don't eat meat.`
` I'm not a scary lion."`
`"Oh, look, a flesh-eating sparrow...!!`
` *flap*flap*flap*."`
`"Uryu-!!`
` Sparrows are scary!`
` Whoosh."`
`"Wahaha, sparrows don't eat meat."`
`"Sakutaro's a coward, so he thinks they do.`
` Kihihihihi."`
`"D-Did the sparrow go away...?`
` Uryu-..."`
`"You're such a scaredy-cat, Sakutaro.`
` If you keep this up, Sakusuke and Sakukichi will start making fun of you again, right?"`
`"Uryu...!`
` I'm not a scaredy-cat!"`
`"Ah, the sparrow's back!`
` *flap*flap*flap*!"`
`"Nooo, I'll be eaten!!`
` Whoosh."`
`"Hahahaha.`
` Sakutaro is quite entertaining.`
` Then, are Sakusuke and Sakukichi his siblings?"`
`"Yep.`
` They're his little brothers, waiting for him at home!`
` Sakusuke's a lot more reliable than Sakutaro, and Sakukichi is so skillful, he can do anything.`
` But they're all really good friends...!`
` They all play together on my bed."`
`"Your bed must be covered with lions."`
`"Yep.`
` So I call my bed Lion Land!`
` But there's lots of other animals too!`
` Uu-!"`
`"Lion Land, is it?`
` It sounds like fun."`
`"...By interacting together, all of MARIA's friends can reinforce their own existence.`
` It's a magnificent world."`
`"I guess that means we should work on deepening our relationships as well.`
` By strengthening our bonds, our existence and magical power will grow stronger and stronger..."`
`"Let's expand our world more and more!`
` From what I've heard, Maria's world has far more than just Sakutarou and the bunnies!`
` We can't let her beat us!"`
`"My, my.`
` In that case, shall we find more minions for ourselves?"`
`"It's no fun with just the gold butterflies.`
` After all, they cannot speak...!`
` I'd like some chatty minions who can talk, jump around, and fight with each other."`
`"True, of course it'll be better to spice things up around here."`
`"Here in Mariage Sorcière, we have learned how to expand our worlds and create new minions.`
` By now, you may create new minions as often as your imagination allows..."`
`"Milady, what about those?`
` Could you make vessels of those dark tools you found when cleaning out Goldsmith's storage room?"`
`"Oh, perfect!`
` Minions created from dark-looking vessels like that will surely be fitting for me...!`
` There will be more and more of us, and it will get very lively here...!"`
`"Uu-!`
` We'll get more and more new friends...!`
` That's my magic!`
` And Beato can take my friends and give them a form.`
` You can make them grow...!"`
`"You create them, and I grow them.`
` ...Indeed.`
` That's Mariage Sorcière for you!`
` ...Hmmm, still, bunny ears are pretty hard...!`
` It might take some time before the bunnies manifest themselves."`
`"Be sure you make them cute."`
`"But of course.`
` This is where I get to show my skill...!"`
`Create a creature, give it a name, give it a form.`
`Doing that is no different from giving birth to new life.`
`When a Human gives birth to a child, they give it a form, give it a name to identify it by, and deepen its character by raising it in the world.`
`Mariage Sorcière is doing exactly the same thing.`
`In our world, we can create whatever creatures we think of, give them forms, give them names, and make them friends we can interact with.`
`We were engrossed with our game in this world called Mariage Sorcière.`
`At least, Maria was engrossed.`
`She would badger me to play this game every time she came.`
`And, of course, I was too.`
`However, when Maria started happily writing something and I just sat there for a while,`
` ...I must admit that I sighed and looked up at the sky, making sure she didn't notice...`
`...It's fun to increase the numbers of our minions.`
`They make things lively, so I do not tire of it.`
`I may have tired of my minions alone, but even that problem goes away when I can interact with Maria's as well.`
`It takes two people to create a universe.`
`I now have that second person, so I am satisfied.`
`............`
`...I think...I am satisfied.`
`And yet, one little part of me...is not.`
`It truly is a tiny part.`
`After all, it's so much fun playing with Maria that time seems to fly on by.`
`But even so, ...when I look up at the sky,`
` ...during those short moments, I feel an empty feeling I can't describe...`
`I know...`
`My universe is not complete.`
`My apologies to Maria,`
` ...but she is not the second person I want to create a universe with.`
`...No matter how much I nurture my world with her, ...the roots of love in my heart leave gaps.`
`......Four years have already passed since that day.`
`He left saying he'd come for me riding a white horse, ...and I was the only one without a letter.`
`And he even said that he probably wouldn't be returning to Rokkenjima...`
`"............"`
`Is this......love?`
`...I always believed that love was so much sweeter, so much more intoxicating.`
`But now, I don't know anymore.`
`Though I long for him so much it's maddening, ...I can sometimes feel hatred underneath.`
`However, even that hatred is wrapped in adoration.`
`The roots of love have remained in the corners of my heart all this time.`
`At some point, ...I gave up hoping that Battler would return.`
`However, the roots of love stayed right where they were.`
`...In other words, ...even four years later, I still believe.`
`He will come back someday.`
`The flower of my love has curled up and withered as though against the winter cold.`
`However, the root is still alive.`
`...And, it is always, always waiting for him to return,`
` waiting for a chance to bloom beautifully again.`
`I'm grateful to Maria.`
`Mariage Sorcière has eased the burden on my heart so much.`
`If we hadn't met like this, ...I may have withered away along with that root.`
`...Even this incomplete universe is necessary for me to remain alive now.`
`I must live on...until I can create my complete universe.`
`Until that day...I will not be complete.`
`Though I have a form and a name, ...no matter how deep my world grows, ...I will not be complete.`
`"...I am not...complete."`
`"......Beato...?"`
`I accidentally muttered what I had been thinking.`
` Maria stopped talking to Sakutaro.`
`I regretted that my slip of the tongue had ruined this fun time, `
`but there was a long silence before I could smooth it over...`
`I laughed, but it probably sounded hollow.`
`Maria, not knowing why my face had suddenly changed like this, looked taken aback.`
`"...Though my minions will each deepen this world and their own existences, becoming full,`
` ...I alone will never be complete."`
`"............"`
`"...I know why I will not be complete."`
`"It's because you don't have enough magical power."`
`Maria answered instantly.`
`Beatrice has lost her magical power and is unable to regain the strength she once had.`
`That's how the story goes.`
` So, Maria's answer was correct.`
`......That's right.`
`I may be incomplete because I have lost my magical power.`
`In that case, if my power becomes complete, ...and I revive in the truest sense,`
` ...will my world become complete as well?`
`Does that mean......that the person I want to nourish a universe with will come back?`
`...If, as I claim, I really was able to control miracles at will in the past with my magic...`
`Then if I succeed in reviving, would that miracle definitely occur?`
`If such a thing were possible, ...I'd want true magical power...to use for my resurrection.`
`"...That's right.`
` It's because I do not possess enough magical power."`
`"Poor Beato.`
` ...It must be pretty inconvenient with your magical power still weak."`
`"I want to get it back...quickly.`
` ...My old power."`
`"I guess you'll have to do 'that' then."`
`"...What do you mean by 'that'...?"`
`"The ceremony of resurrection.`
` ...The ceremony of the portrait's epitaph."`
`".................."`
`If you read that epitaph literally, it does sound like a witch's resurrection ceremony.`
`To Maria, who believes in witches, that epitaph must be a ceremony in itself.`
`Unlike the other family members, it seems that she's not very interested in the location of the hidden gold.`
`"...If that epitaph's riddle is solved, one might learn the location where Kinzo hid all the gold I once gave him."`
`"That's the gold you created with magic, right?"`
`"Indeed.`
` A crystallization of the great magic I possessed in those days."`
`"In that case, ...if you get that gold back, your magical power will go back to normal."`
`"...Perhaps."`
`"It will. Uu-!`
` It's got to be your resurrection ceremony...!`
` I'll help, so let's solve it together.`
` Then you'll revive!`
` And when you do, you'll take me to your Golden Land...!"`
`"That's right.`
` I did promise that I would take you to the Golden Land."`
`"You said that all wishes are granted there...!`
` There's no black witch there, just a nice Mama...!`
` And I might even meet the Papa I've never seen before...!`
` Of course, there won't be any school, or homework, or bullying friends, and we can live happily ever after...!`
` Hey, Sakutaro, doesn't that sound fun!`
` Uryu-!"`
`......The epitaph of the portrait.`
`So, must I face the epitaph's riddle after all?`
`If Kinzo's children struggled uselessly over it,`
` ...how could a complete stranger like me solve it...?`
`...If I did happen to solve it, ...that would surely be a miracle.`
`Will doing that bring about another miracle and return my miraculous power to me...?`
`Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved hometown.`
`You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key...`
`"......So, am I to travel down a river in Kinzo's homeland in search of a key?"`
`As you travel down the river, you will see a village.`
`In that village, look for the shore the two will tell you of.`
`There sleeps the key to the Golden Land.`
`"...There may be villages if you go down a river,`
` but what is this shore the two will tell you of?"`
`The one who obtains the key must then travel to the Golden Land in accordance with these rules...`
`...So, those who do not have the key need not read the rest?`
`I do not understand it, but that's how this riddle is.`
`...It's practically unsolvable, so solving it would be a miracle.`
` That much makes sense...`
`"......Nn."`
`I felt a stabbing pain in my body.`
` The anti-magic toxin had burned my skin.`
`Some Human is probably approaching.`
` I erased my form.`
`Multiple sets of footsteps approached.`
`It was Genji, Shannon, ...and Kanon too.`
`"...It seems everyone is engrossed with solving the epitaph's riddle."`
`"Yes.`
` I hear that even some of the servants have copied it down and taken it home with them."`
`"...If you solve this riddle, will you really find 10 tons of gold?"`
`"Indeed.`
` There can be no doubt of that."`
`"I don't understand.`
` ...The puzzle may be a tough one, `
`but why is the Master showing the location of his precious gold in a place where everyone can see?"`
`"...That is the Master's magic, and also a bet.`
` The Master believes that the one who solves this difficult riddle will contain Beatrice-sama's soul within them."`
`"......That's a strange bet...uh, magic..."`
`"Hmph, looks like he's taken his occult fanaticism as far as it could possibly go."`
`"Shh.`
` You shouldn't say that..."`
`"...All are allowed to try and solve the epitaph's riddle.`
` Of course, the servants are no exceptions.`
` ...Will you try to solve it?"`
`"N-No...`
` ...I could never solve such a hard riddle...`
` And anyway..."`
`"...And?"`
`"Even if I had 10 tons of gold, I can't think of anything in particular I'd want to use it for...`
` I'd be more than happy if these peaceful days continued forever."`
`"Looks like you and George-sama have been pretty close these days.`
` I just hope being distracted doesn't make you even more of a klutz."`
`"Th-That won't happen."`
`With a backward glance at this conversation, Genji walked up to the portrait...`
`...and looked up at the witch.`
`"............"`
`When they saw what Genji was doing, Shannon and Kanon immediately went silent.`
`...Genji, who was the head of the servants, ...the closest in age to Kinzo, and the one whom Kinzo called a friend,`
` probably understood Kinzo's heart better than anyone else.`
`What did he think when he looked at this portrait...?`
`Neither Shannon nor Kanon could tell.`
`"...Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved hometown."`
`Suddenly, Genji started reciting the epitaph.`
`Shannon quickly nodded to show that she was listening, but it wasn't clear whether he was talking to her at all.`
`Genji, his back still to them, continued.`
`"The Master would not describe Odawara as his beloved hometown."`
`"...I've heard that he lived far away."`
`"Th-Though we don't know where it was..."`
`"Taiwan."`
`Genji turned around and spoke that single word.`
`"...O-`
`Oh, `
`is that so...?"`
`"I see, so that explains what Krauss-sama always used to say.`
` Remember him talking about how the Master liked areca nuts?"`
`"...Come to think of it, `
`Krauss-sama said that those were a luxury item, like tobacco, that was popular in Taiwan...`
` So that's why the Master..."`
`In the half-century before the war, Taiwan was under the rule of Japan.`
`Many Japanese had moved there, seeking a new frontier.`
`Kinzo's family was a branch family of the Ushiromiyas.`
`Apparently, they were only distantly related to the Head Family, so they were able to form a new life and a new future, without being constrained by the Head Family in Odawara...`
`Shannon and Kanon nodded their understanding, but they didn't know why Genji had suddenly broached this subject.`
`"...So, ...there was a river with sweetfish in it in the Master's hometown in Taiwan, and the key is there?"`
`"Don't be so stupid.`
` There has to be several rivers with sweetfish in the area."`
`"W-We don't know that for sure, right...?`
` I don't know where the Master lived in Taiwan, ...but there might have been only one river there.`
` If so, that must be the place."`
`"You're too optimistic.`
` There's no way the riddle could be solved that easily."`
`"...The Master says his magical ceremony will gain more power if more people try to solve the riddle.`
` You must try as well.`
` Everyone has been given the same chance."`
`"...Y-Yes."`
`"As if we had a chance.`
` This is pointless..."`
`Genji spun around.`
` Shannon and Kanon hurried to follow after him.`
`When his footsteps receded and silence returned, a gold butterfly flitted out from among the shadows.`
`"......Taiwan, is it?`
` ...Hoh, so he lived quite far away."`
`Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved hometown.`
`In other words, a sweetfish river running through Taiwan...?`
`"...There are many rivers in Taiwan.`
` Kanon was right.`
` How ridiculous."`
`............`
`However, the word 'Taiwan' interests me.`
`That taciturn Genji muttered it without anyone asking, so is it even possible that it means nothing?`
`Clearly, Genji's saying it has something to do with the epitaph's riddle.`
`It's almost as though that was a hint for solving it...`
`"...Though I do find it stupid,`
` ...very well, Genji.`
` Why don't I play along with your farce for a while?"`
`Taiwan...`
`I have traveled the world at times during these past thousand years, but I know nothing of the place.`
`"...To counter my ignorance, I shall need a crystallization of knowledge.`
` That which is smoothed out and pressed into many sheets, what is called a book."`
`Where might I find a book about Taiwan?`
`Kinzo's study is the first place that comes to mind if one is looking for books.`
`But that won't work.`
` The charm on that room prevents me from entering.`
`So, the library, is it?`
`Kinzo's vast collection of books grows each year.`
`The books that don't fit in his study are stored in a book storage room that we usually call the library.`
`...Of course, there are countless books just in this place.`
`The library has everything from valuable books to apparently worthless books,`
` all packed together like an antique shop.`
`...There was a golden glint in the keyhole of the library's door, and a gold butterfly flitted out.`
`"Stinky as ever, I see.`
` ...Dust, mold.`
` I see, so this is the stench of knowledge."`
`...Well now, how can I find a book on Taiwan amongst all this?`
` The prospect is almost dizzying.`
`However, I realized right away.`
`If I wanted to quickly find out about Taiwanese rivers, I didn't want a book on Taiwan.`
`"...An atlas.`
` ...There must be one of those somewhere around here.`
` ...Search, my butterfly minions...!!`
` Find the book I seek in this dusty, noble graveyard of knowledge!"`
`A cloud of countless gold butterflies appeared at my feet.`
`They swayed, blew like the wind, and coiled themselves around the library.`
`Eventually, the cloud of butterflies selected a single book.`
` It seems that this is the one.`
`"Well done.`
` ......Hmm, a world atlas, Asia volume.`
` Perfect."`
`It was a grand, thick, illustrated encyclopedia of maps, several volumes long.`
`There was even a thick section on Taiwan.`
` This should be plenty useful.`
`"...Taiwan.`
` ...394 kilometers north to south, 144 kilometers east to west.`
` An area of roughly 36,000 square kilometers.`
` ...Hohoh, that's pretty large."`
`By area, that's about the same size as Kyushu in Japan.`
`...This led Beato to a very natural question.`
`"Just where on this massive island did Kinzo live?`
` ...Genji mentioned Taiwan, but that's all.`
` How careless I've been..."`
`Beato had vaguely assumed that the riddle would be solved in a flash if she could just look at a map of Taiwan.`
`However, Taiwan is no small place.`
`Just which part of this large island did Kinzo call his beloved hometown?`
`...I kept looking through books in this dusty library, sometimes having to cough,`
` and I was not happy with being stuck in a place like this.`
`"So, the largest city is Taipei.`
` ...It says here that Japanese people used to live in a spot called Taishou.`
` ...So, is that where Kinzo lived?`
` No, it's too early to be sure of that without proof."`
`I'll skip to the next part before I settle on anything more specific than just Taiwan itself.`
`A sweetfish river running through the hometown.`
`What's this...?`
` There are 129 rivers in Taiwan?`
`"Gah...`
` 129 rivers...!`
` And how many of those have sweetfish swimming in them...?!`
` Just thinking about it is dizzying!"`
`This was quickly becoming ridiculous.`
`Genji must have been muttering nonsense to himself after all.`
`I only thought he was giving out a hint about the epitaph...`
`"So, the reward for the fool blinded by gold is dust.`
` *cackle*cackle* Nice one, Genji."`
`I tossed the book aside, used magic to turn a bookshelf into a sofa, and plopped down on top of it.`
`For a while, I grumbled about getting tricked and looked up at the ceiling.`
`I was annoyed, so I felt like gathering all this room's dust, packing it into a ball, and tossing it into Genji's teacup, `
`so I glanced down at the floor.`
`The book I had thrown away lay open on the ground.`
`A gold butterfly was resting on that open page.`
`...Tossing a book at random and reading an oracle from the page it happens to open to is a kind of ritual.`
`I see, ...so that page might have some sort of hint.`
`Not entirely convinced, I picked the book up...`
`The opened page was probably very near the one I had been reading.`
`Apparently, it was a page explaining Taiwan's geography.`
`Oddly enough, it was a page about rivers and lakes...`
`"......I already know that there are 129 rivers.`
` Is there something else you're trying to tell me?"`
`There were six major rivers listed.`
`Zhuoshui River.`
` Kaoping River.`
` Danshui River.`
` Dajia River.`
` Zengwun River.`
` Dadu River.`
`"Hoh.`
` Now then, which of these rivers might have sweetfish in them?"`
`An idea came to me then.`
`Sweetfish are freshwater fish.`
` And you don't find ocean water in rivers.`
`...Unless it's extremely dirty or blocked by a dam,`
` any river might have sweetfish in it.`
`"How foolish.`
` All rivers have freshwater in them.`
` What's stopping sweetfish from living in any river?`
` ......Come to think of it, what a foolish name this Danshui River has.`
` Freshwater River? What sort of river isn't a freshwater river?`
` It would only make sense to name a river after what's in it if it were literally anything else."`
`Danshui River flows from Taipei to the harbor town of Danshui.`
`I see, it isn't called that because of the water in it, but because of the town at its mouth.`
`......As you travel down the river, you will see a village.`
`In that village, look for the shore the two will tell you of.`
`"............"`
`I realize that this is stupid.`
`And yet, there's something about this town...`
`Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved hometown.`
`That line should be talking about one of the 129 rivers.`
`...Sweetfish...are freshwater fish.`
`And here's this 'Freshwater River', flowing down to a town called 'Freshwater'.`
`It's like a strange, trivial word game.`
` ...Or could it be some kind of code...?`
`...I've been looking for books here so long that the dust is piling up on me.`
`If I give up now, it will all have been a waste of time.`
`......Very well.`
`Why don't I test my luck, and see if the random page the book opened to contains an oracle.`
`I turned to the next page, trying to search in even greater detail...`
`"To me, solving this riddle was like a game.`
` One that all of the servants were engrossed in."`
`"I was just trying to be one of that group.`
` ...For quite some time, I had suffered from a lack of books I could find particularly absorbing, and I was very bored. So, I took that book back with me to my own room...and looked through it every night."`
`"...There's a hint for the epitaph's riddle in an atlas?"`
`"In the third game, Eva solved the riddle after reading a book in the book archive.`
` Then, in the fifth game, Furudo Erika looked for an atlas in that room before solving the riddle herself."`
`"Then there really is some secret in a map of Taiwan..."`
`"...I believed that the sweetfish river part was a code for Danshui River.`
` Every day, I researched the surrounding geography in detail.`
` ...Of course, I also looked up several small streams that might have sweetfish in them.`
` However, ...that didn't get me anywhere."`
`"According to some information from a previous game, ...we aren't looking for an actual river.`
` But it is something that flows.`
` That's how Eva interpreted it."`
`"So, it isn't a river...?"`
`"Correct.`
` In the end, Danshui River had nothing to do with it.`
` ...However, now that I think about it, it must have been an oracle after all.`
` The river itself was unrelated, ...but it was still a great hint."`
`"The river was unrelated, ...but it was still a hint?"`
`"Calm down and think.`
` Think of something that flows but isn't a river."`
`"......So, something other than water that flows...?"`
`"What can you think of?`
` ...Try and think outside the box."`
`"............"`
`"...Will,`
` I'm tired of all this puzzle-solving.`
` ...Stop being annoying and give us the answer.`
` ...You solved the epitaph, right?"`
`"......`
`...Probably."`
`"...Something other than water that flows...`
` ...Something...`
` ...Some...thing...?`
` ...Methods of transportation...?`
` Like a road or a highway?"`
`"Correct.`
` It took me so long to realize that the sweetfish river did not refer to water itself..."`
`"That's right.`
` There's something other than a river with the name Danshui.`
` Something that both people and things flow up and down."`
`"...Up...and down...?`
` You mean..."`
`"That's it.`
` Railroads."`
`The Danshui Line.`
`It's a railway that goes from Taipei to Danshui Harbor.`
`It was constructed in 1901 while Taiwan was under Japanese rule.`
`Afterwards, the number of stations continued to grow, and it became a major artery into Taipei.`
`This railroad was used after the war as well and is still in common use as the Danshui Line of the Taipei Rapid Transit System.`
`Its route begins at Taipei Station and continues on until the town of Danshui...`
`坰北 Station.`
`長安 Station (formerly 大正街 Station).`
`坌連 Station.`
`大坌公坸 Station.`
`円山 Station.`
`剣潭 Station (formerly 宮ノ下 Station).`
`士林 Station.`
`石碑 (formerly......`
`"......What did the epitaph say you'd see if you went down the river?"`
`"A-A village."`
`"There's only one station on the Danshui Line with 里, the character for village, in its name. And it's this 石碑 Station."`
`"H-How do you read this...?"`
`"The Japanese pronounce it 'Kirigan'.`
` Its name was changed to 石碑 (Sekihai) Station after the war, but when Kinzo lived there, it was Kirigan Station."`
`"As you travel down the river, you will see a village...a '里'...`
` In that village, look for the shore the two will tell you of..."`
`"...*giggle*`
` 里 isn't the only one. You can also see a 岸, the character for shore..."`
`"In the end, it took me quite a long time to work out that this station was the one referred to.`
` ...It has the character for village and the character for shore.`
` It felt like a kids' riddle, playing with letters..."`
`"The first character in Kirigan has a 坣, the character for mouth.`
` And 其, the other half of that first character, means the word 'that', right...?!`
` 'That village's shore', and the mouth is 'telling of' it...!`
` ...Ah, ...but I don't get what 'the two' means..."`
`The three characters of Kirigan can be split into a mouth (坣), a 'that' (其), a village (里), and a shore (岸).`
`Those are all words that appear in the epitaph.`
`'In *that* *village*, look for the *shore* the two will *tell* you of.'`
`You can read it as a code for the name of the station.`
`However, I don't understand the part about 'the two'...`
`"...I was also stuck on that part.`
` However, by then, I was very confident that this station was what the epitaph referred to."`
`"If the station was once known by a different name, ...then could some local spot also have had its name changed?"`
`"That's right.`
` Kirigan Station was named after a nearby location, after all.`
` And though the name of that area was also Kirigan, it's written differently."`
`"Ah, ...there are...two mouths...!"`
`"It didn't take much investigation before it was clear.`
` ...The epitaph must have been referring to this place called Kirigan."`
`"Then, is this where the key to the Golden Land rests...?"`
`"That would be the obvious answer.`
` However, I couldn't make the long trip to Taiwan to check.`
` And, of course, the place known as Kirigan is quite large itself.`
` If a tiny key was hidden somewhere there, I'd never find it.`
` I was at a loss..."`
`"But you didn't give up."`
`"I was certain that I had found the answer, at least to the first five lines of the epitaph.`
` ...In my eyes, it truly was an entertaining game...no, a mystery."`
`I almost gave up then.`
`However, there was no doubt that I had the key in my hand.`
`So, I decided to travel to the Golden Land in accordance with the epitaph.`
`"...On the first twilight, offer the six chosen by the key as sacrifices..."`
`"We can tell by this line that the key refers to six things.`
` ...Reasoning makes it possible to see that this couldn't refer to a physical key."`
`"Six things...?"`
`"Yes.`
` Six things.`
` ...I was merely a thick-headed human.`
` ...I decided to look through books for anything related to the number six.`
` Six.`
` Six, six, six.`
` The location of the key called Kirigan was hidden by a word game.`
` That meant the six things were surely connected to some sort of word game too.`
` Six.`
` Six, six, six.`
` I kept searching for six."`
`"...Is there some way to split up the characters in Kirigan to get six...?"`
`"A good idea.`
` Still, no matter how much you stare at those three characters, you won't get an answer.`
` The problem here is that 'Kirigan' is just the Japanese reading of the name."`
`"Then how did they pronounce it there?"`
`"...It's pronounced 'Qilian'.`
` When written in Roman characters, that's six letters long."`
`"Six letters...!`
` Then it is a word game after all...!"`
`"This is what it means by 'the six chosen by the key'."`
`"...I-I get it..."`
`Talking about it like this, it sounds like a line of reasoning that can be reached in a second.`
`...However, it took a long, long time before I reached this spot on my own.`
`A dizzying number of nights passed from the time Genji uttered that single word to the time I got this far.`
`"So, what does it mean to offer these six letters as sacrifices?"`
`"On the second twilight, we start hearing about 'those who remain'.`
` ...Reasoning opens up the possibility that the six letters of the key...are being removed from an even larger set of letters."`
`"However, what could the six letters be removed from?`
` That puzzle worried me for a long time.`
` It's like the start of an entirely new riddle.`
` This time, I would have to solve it all by myself, without any assistance."`
`"...In a previous game, ...`
`I'm pretty sure Aunt Rosa formed some sort of theory about the first twilight."`
`"Right, that theory about a ten-day journey ending at the tenth twilight.`
` 'On the tenth twilight, at journey's end, you shall attain to the power of the Golden Land's treasures, once and for the last time.' She took that section to be a literal trip that ends when you 'attain to', or reach, the treasures of the Golden Land."`
`"What meaning was there in those words?`
` Realizing that there was something to be found...and then realizing what that something actually was...took another long stretch of time."`
`"By Rosa's reasoning, `
`'attain to' meant reaching some physical location represented by the four treasures.`
` ...It was a good try, but not quite right.`
` It's not the treasures we're supposed to reach, but their power."`
`"...What does it even mean to 'reach' the power of something like that...?`
` Hmm..."`
`"Don't overthink it.`
` What else can the word 'power' mean?"`
`"...You reach...`
`or rather, raise yourself to the power of the 'four' treasures.`
` Starting at twilight number 'ten'.`
` And this is done 'once and for the last time'."`
`"Oh, so it's an exponent, like a math problem...!"`
`"...Here, I had a home-field advantage, since I lived on Rokkenjima.`
` There was a hint there that made it easier to think of a certain large number.`
` In fact, you might say that I actually found the answer before I knew what the question was."`
`"If you keep making it so complicated, Lion's gonna get a headache.`
` Let's get back to the point.`
` ......10 to the 4th power is ten thousand. If you reach ten thousand on the tenth twilight, how far have you gotten by the first twilight?"`
`"Well, that's just one tenth of ten thousand.`
` A thousand, right?"`
`"Right.`
` But while that gives us a single word, it has nowhere near enough letters, and it doesn't match the key at all."`
`"However, the end of the line says 'you will attain to the power once and for the last time'. If we interpret this as raising 10 to the 4th power once, and then doing the same thing one final time, we end up with ten quadrillion."`
`"That's ten quadrillion at the tenth twilight, or 'quadrillion' at the first twilight.`
` ...As Battler guessed in the fifth game, it has 11 letters.`
` Or should I say...as you guessed?"`
`"......*giggle*."`
`"Strangely enough, `
`both words begin with 'q'.`
` I felt that this just had to be right."`
`Lion took a notepad from a pocket and spelled out Quadrillion and Qilian.`
`The two words even looked similar at a glance.`
`"......`
`...That's right.`
` ...It's true that the six letters chosen by the key are right there inside quadrillion...!`
` So, what happens if we take them out...?!"`
`We're left with five meaningless letters.`
`However, the important thing is the number five.`
`After all, in the next part of the epitaph, the word 'kill' appears five times,`
` and then, on the ninth twilight, 'none shall be left alive'.`
`In other words, there should be five letters left.`
`"On top of that, just as Battler-san guessed in the fifth game,`
` two of these letters are close to each other.`
` The 'd' and the 'r'!`
` Those must be the two who are close!"`
`"...Once you reach this spot, the riddle has been practically solved."`
`"Or, put another way, this is as far as you can go with the epitaph alone.`
` You might be able to figure out the answer with a little more word play, but you won't be able to activate the device."`
`"That's right.`
` ...Once you know this much, all that remains is to gouge and kill."`
`"You had a good idea of where the place was, even before you got this far, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...Some people suspected that the gold was hidden there even before the epitaph appeared.`
` And, because of the mysterious phrase that appeared there, it's only natural that I thought the place concealed some secret..."`
`"...What do you mean by 'the place'...?"`
`"The place with the device that opens the door to the Golden Land.`
` ...A quick-witted person should be able to figure out where 'the first twilight' is by now."`
`"Huh?`
` I thought the first twilight was 'quadrillion', not a place..."`
`"It's the place where 'quadrillion' is written.`
` ...You should know it.`
` Or did you blindly follow Kinzo's orders and never go near it...?"`
`Chapter 9: `
`The Day the Witch Revived.`
`Quadrillion.`
`There's only one place you'll find that word on Rokkenjima.`
`Gold butterflies flitted from shadow to shadow, dodging raindrops.`
`"...Unless my memory is mistaken, this is probably the place."`
`It was...the chapel.`
`That mysterious building, one of the oldest on Rokkenjima, which had been built at the same time as the mansion.`
`It was called the chapel, but not once had Kinzo used it for worship, and the members of the family had never been allowed inside.`
`There were strict orders that none approach it without reason, and its purpose has always been a mystery.`
`However, all of these mysteries got boring after several decades.`
`At some point,`
` everyone forgot the chapel even existed,`
` and that splendid building passed from the thoughts of Rokkenjima's residents...`
`Of course, this had been true for Beato as well.`
`Beato, who hated boredom, had no desire to approach places that humans never went.`
`Her last memory was of the time she went in there to taunt Shannon as she tried to clean.`
`"...There can be no doubt.`
` That is it.`
` ...Quadrillion."`
`Beato looked up...above the door of the chapel.`
`There was a relief displayed over an arch.`
`English words were written there.`
`"'You will be blessed only at a probability of a quadrillion to one'.`
` ...Heheh.`
` So, you thought that was the probability of someone solving this riddle...?"`
`This chapel was built long ago.`
`If there is a device like the one I imagine,`
` ...Kinzo must have prepared that epitaph riddle many decades ago.`
`He must have been planning to use it as a ceremony for choosing a fitting successor all that time.`
`...However, that ceremony is now a ceremony to open the door to the Golden Land and to my resurrection.`
`When I snapped my fingers, `
`the ground bulged, and several snake-like dead trees sprouted up.`
`They twisted around each other to form a ladder, which leaned itself against the door.`
`"If my guess is right, ...there's some sort of device in that relief."`
`I slowly climbed the ladder.`
`Because of the size of the door, the relief was very high up.`
`This close up, it looks much bigger than it did from the ground.`
`"......Come to think of it, whenever we cleaned the chapel,`
` ...this relief was the only thing that Genji always made sure he polished himself.`
` ...I always wondered why he didn't leave something so trivial to the younger servants."`
`I thought it strange, but nothing more.`
`The Master treasured this relief, so the head servant cared for it himself.`
` ...I always accepted that excuse.`
`But now, I understand.`
`There must be something in this relief.`
`And Genji polished it himself to make sure than no one else accidentally found out...`
`"So, am I to sacrifice the six letters chosen by the key from quadrillion...?"`
`The tips of my fingers touched the 'q'.`
`My fingertips were soon covered with dust.`
` However, I quickly realized that there was something strange about it.`
`"...Don't tell me this letter...`
` ...No, ...it had to be like this.`
` There would be no other way to offer up sacrifices..."`
`Beato grabbed the letter 'q', and after lightly playing around with it in various ways, `
`...she pulled it out with a slight clunk.`
`"Just...as I thought..."`
`Here's the 'q' I pulled out.`
` And this part's a wedge...no.`
` It's a key.`
`A key was attached to the back of the 'q'...and had been stuck into a key hole in the relief.`
`"...I see...`
` In that case, I know what to do next.`
` ...Very good, this 'q' key is a wrong answer.`
` Enough with you."`
`Beato carelessly tossed the 'q' key aside.`
`This was the first sacrifice.`
`She kept on pulling out the keys for the six letters representing 'the key'.`
`"...So, 'a' will also be sacrificed.`
` ...And both 'i's.`
` ...And then the 'n' at the end."`
`"Now, I only sacrifice one 'l', ...but unfortunately, there are two 'l's here."`
`There were two 'l's.`
` I didn't know which I should sacrifice.`
`I tried pulling both out, but the keys were of different shapes.`
`So, one is a right answer, and one is a wrong answer.`
`"Well, there are only two.`
` ...If I make a mistake, I can just try the other one."`
`Unless messing up sets off a trap that blows up the island, of course.`
`Thinking it a waste of time to sit here worrying, I decided on the rightmost 'l' and pulled it out.`
`Five letters remained in the word.`
`"And now, the first twilight is over.`
` ...On to the second twilight."`
`On the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close.`
`"The 'd' and 'r' are close.`
` What does it mean to tear them apart...?`
` Do I pull them out?"`
`But if I do, there will only be three letters left.`
`By this point, I was able to make a good guess at what the 'gouge and kill' lines meant.`
`"Gouge and kill probably means to turn the keys and take them out.`
` In that case, the parts about going from head to leg must mean starting at the left and going right."`
`If that's the case, there must be five characters left on the board.`
`In other words, 'tear apart' doesn't mean kill.`
`"If so, then we can read 'tear apart' to mean putting a gap between the 'd' and the 'r'.`
` ...But how?`
` Once again, there are two ways to do it..."`
`Do I remove the 'd' and move it to the left?`
`Do I remove the 'r' and move it to the right?`
`...After pondering this for some time, I realized that both choices were wrong.`
`"No.`
` That's not right.`
` I've had it wrong ever since I removed that 'l'."`
`A short while ago, I removed the right of the two 'l's.`
`However, if I had removed the left one...`
`...It would look like this.`
`If you line it up this way, it's easy to see the next step.`
`The 'r' gets shifted to the right.`
`This way, all of the letters are spread out evenly.`
`This must be it.`
`"And this next part...is another tough one.`
` ...Praise my name...?"`
`It's already clear that this is a word game.`
`Those who remain shall praise my noble name.`
`Just what are the remaining five letters supposed to do?`
` Probably change their order to form a word.`
`"...'u', 'd', 'r', 'l', 'o'...`
` ...What should be done about these five letters?"`
`Praise...my name.`
`"Heh.`
` ...How can I get stuck after coming so far...?`
` How are these five letters supposed to praise a name...?!"`
`That man's name is Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
`Is the 'u' part of Ushiromiya...?`
`No, several letters don't match, and there aren't nearly enough letters to make Ushiromiya...`
`"One thing is certain... 'My name' must refer to Kinzo.`
` ...Then, does the 'u' stand for Ushiromiya after all?`
` Like an initial.`
` ...Then what do the 'd', 'r', 'l', and 'o' stand for?`
` They can't mean Kinzo.`
` Do the 'r' and 'o'...stand for Rokkenjima...?`
` The master of Rokkenjima, Kinzo...`
` ...Hmm, not nearly enough letters..."`
`This riddle left me totally confused.`
`However, there were only five letters left.`
`There can't be too many possible combinations of those letters.`
` I could use process of elimination.`
`Thinking I'd play around with it, I pulled out the 'u'.`
`...There were four letters left.`
` 'd', 'r', 'l', and 'o'.`
`"............"`
`My idea that the 'u' stood for Ushiromiya was like a heavenly oracle.`
`When I removed the 'u', I thought of making a word with the remaining four letters.`
`'d', 'r', 'l', and 'o'.`
`Those four letters spun around in my head, changing their orders,`
` ...and latched upon a single English word that would serve to 'praise' Kinzo...`
`"It's lord.`
` ...Lord...!"`
`I had absolutely no basis for it.`
` ...However, it was like a flash of inspiration.`
`I quickly changed the letters around before that flash faded from my mind.`
`"'l', 'o', 'r', 'd'!`
` Lord!`
` 'u'!`
` Ushiromiya!`
` ...Lord Ushiromiya?!"`
`"On the fourth twilight, ...gouge the head...`
`...oho?!"`
`It was a key, so it wouldn't have turned if it was the wrong one.`
`But it did turn.`
` I managed to gouge it...!`
`I gouged the first letter, the 'l', with a click, ...and then pulled it out.`
`"Next, the fifth twilight...?`
` Gouge the chest...and kill...!"`
`The 'o' was gouged and pulled out easily.`
`Then, the 'r'.`
` Next, the 'd'.`
` And finally, the 'u'.`
`When I turned the key of the 'u', I could feel a resistance, as though some device had been activated.`
`I waited for something to change, ...but nothing did.`
`However, I had felt something happen.`
`A secret door must have opened up somewhere around here.`
`...Waiting around won't accomplish anything.`
`I've probably done everything I can here...`
`All the letters in quadrillion have been removed.`
`"On the ninth twilight, ...the witch shall revive, and none shall be left alive..."`
`So, this way, has the witch...have I...revived...?`
`The tenth twilight.`
`At journey's end, you shall attain to the power of the Golden Land's treasures, once and for the last time...`
`When I stepped down off the ladder and looked around,`
` ...I immediately noticed a small change.`
`"...That lion statue......"`
`At some point, the lion statue in front of the chapel had turned to face a different direction.`
`...How did that work?`
`Did Kinzo plan up this extravagant device back when he first started building on this island...?`
`I walked up to the lion statue and stared at it.`
`Other than the fact that it was pointing a different direction, nothing had changed.`
`In that case, is the lion looking at something in particular now...?`
`I followed its line of sight...and saw another lion statue.`
`And that lion statue had also changed its direction.`
`"Interesting...`
` So, follow the lion guideposts.`
` ...As intricate as ever, I see, Kinzo."`
`I wasn't complaining anymore.`
`...I felt a bit of respect and awe at Kinzo for setting up such an intricate device and having it go undiscovered for all these years.`
`There were lion statues standing like guardian deities at the entrance and the corners of the chapel.`
`The direction they faced had changed, pointing around to the back of the chapel.`
`There was something there.`
`"......`
`...Hoh..."`
`It was no longer a surprise.`
`This was after the contraption with the letters.`
` After being guided by the lions.`
`So, when a gaping open secret passageway appeared, with stairs leading down to the darkness below, ...it wasn't surprising to me anymore.`
`"So, ...is this the entrance to the Golden Land, Kinzo...?!!"`
`"...Did you find it...?`
` Grandfather's...gold...?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...It took ages and ages, but I had reached...the Golden Land."`
`"According to the previous games, there was an underground VIP room there, along with 10 tons of gold, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` After going down a rough stairway, ...there was a door at the end of a passage.`
` Inside, it was beautifully furnished, a true VIP room."`
`"...And was the gold all you found there?"`
`"Yes, at the time...`
` It would be a lie to say that I was not dizzied by the sight of all that gold stacked high..."`
`"...Is this...`
`...real...?"`
`I lightly touched the pile of gold with my finger.`
`It was hard...and cold.`
`I must have imagined that it would crumble like a sand castle if I touched it.`
`Now, there could be no doubt.`
`This certainly was...a ten-ton pile of gold ingots.`
`"...Haha, `
`......ha..."`
`Considering the amount of gold I had just found, I figured I ought to be crying out in delight.`
`...I didn't really feel like laughing, but I thought it only good manners to do so in a situation like this, so I forced it out.`
`Because of this, only a few feeble laughs slipped from my mouth.`
`At that moment, even stronger than any delight was a feeling as though I'd entered a place I wasn't supposed to be...`
`I couldn't think of what I should do next, now that the epitaph's riddle had been completed.`
`Then, I heard approaching footsteps.`
`It was coming from the stairway I had entered by.`
`Someone was coming.`
` Could it be...Kinzo?`
`If he finds out I've been in a place like this, will I get scolded harshly...?`
`I thought about hiding and forgetting this ever happened, but my legs wouldn't move.`
`I kept standing there, stunned, in front of the pile of gold...`
`...as the footsteps drew closer and closer...`
`"............!"`
`The door opened, ...and I saw who it was.`
`...It...wasn't Kinzo.`
`"............"`
`"...You..."`
`"...Did you reach this place by your power alone?"`
`"...I-Indeed..."`
`"............"`
`For some time, Genji stared at Beato in silence, as though he was calculating something.`
`Then, he slowly clapped his hands together.`
` ...He did it again, over and over.`
`It took quite a long time before I realized that he was applauding me...`
`"The Master has said that he will hand over the gold and the Headship to the first person who solves the epitaph.`
` ...And, he believed that this person would be Beatrice..."`
`"...Beatrice...`
` ...Me...?"`
`"This is fate.`
` ...It is fate that brought you to this day."`
`"............"`
`I didn't really understand what Genji was saying.`
`Surely, the shock of seeing the gold still had me paralyzed...`
`"...Come this way."`
`"O-Okay..."`
`Genji opened a closet.`
`Inside it was a torso wearing a beautiful dress made of black cloth and golden stitching.`
`When I saw it, I understood immediately.`
`...It was the witch's dress.`
`The black dress worn by the Beatrice in the portrait...`
`"Change into this."`
`"...This is..."`
`"It is...something you once wore."`
`I've never worn a dress like this.`
` However, I understood what Genji meant.`
`This dress was one that Beatrice once wore.`
`And, the one who displays a miracle by solving the epitaph is Beatrice.`
`By reaching this room, ...I succeeded the position of the real Beatrice,`
` the one in the portrait.`
`Why do I call myself Beatrice?`
`Because the name of the Golden Witch, who rules over Rokkenjima's night, is Beatrice.`
`...That's right.`
` I wasn't the real Beatrice.`
`I was a different witch, stealing the name of the witch from Kinzo's delusions.`
`And now, ...I have succeeded the real Beatrice...`
`By solving the epitaph's riddle, my resurrection will be complete.`
`...I was the one who decided on that rule.`
`However, ...this really was...a ceremony to resurrect Beatrice...`
`In the past, I believed that I could create my own fate with my magic.`
`How ironic that one who could control magic at will...would be guided by fate to this place...`
`At that moment, I had no choice but to truly accept and believe in this word called 'fate'...`
`"And after I put this on......?"`
`"...You will go to the Master.`
` Ready yourself."`
`"...Wait here."`
`"...O-Okay."`
`"Master,`
` it is Genji."`
`After Genji knocked, the sound of the study's door unlocking could be heard.`
`After a single glance telling me to wait, Genji entered alone.`
`"I cannot believe that this day has come...`
` Fate can be such a strange thing..."`
`Kumasawa was with us too.`
`I thought this dress, which didn't really suit me, would lead to a lot of jokes, ...but she didn't laugh at me at all.`
`On the contrary, when she saw me, ...her expression had turned stern, as though a long-awaited day had finally come.`
`...My heart raced.`
`Supposedly, anyone should have been able to solve the epitaph.`
` There shouldn't be anything strange about me solving it...`
`Genji and the others kept wearing serious expressions, ...and that, along with everything else, made this feel like some sort of grand ceremony.`
`The suffocating silence continued.`
`Eventually, the door opened, and Genji peeked out.`
`"......Enter,`
` ...Beatrice-sama."`
`He was saying those words to me, ...but not to the person I had been until a short while ago.`
`"............"`
`"Go ahead, `
`...Beatrice-sama..."`
`Kumasawa also urged me forward with a respectful bow.`
`Kinzo was probably waiting for me inside.`
`What expression should I wear as I go in...?`
` How should I greet him...?`
`I don't have a clue...`
`As the two of them motioned me forward, it was all I could do to avoid tripping over my dress as I walked.`
`"...Kinzo-san,`
` she is here."`
`Kinzo was crouched on the ground, as though kneeling before the portrait of Beatrice.`
`At Nanjo's words, he slowly turned, still crouching...`
`"...Oh...`
` ...Ooooohhh......"`
`Kinzo's eyes were already red with crying.`
`When he saw me, he groaned with wonder.`
`"...Beatrice...`
` ...Beatrice..."`
`Had he even forgotten how to stand up?`
`He crawled over to where I was.`
`...While calling out to me with the name of the woman he had loved long ago.`
`I was too stunned to move.`
`Kinzo grabbed the hem of my dress, gripped it tightly, ...then curled up and sobbed.`
`"Beatrice...`
` ...I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...`
` I knew how you felt, ...and yet I...`
` I'm sorry... Please forgive me... Please, please forgive me..."`
`"............"`
`The words weren't directed at me.`
`However, just standing here like this was all I needed to do.`
`Kinzo's moment of atonement, the moment he had spent half of his life searching for, had finally come.`
`...A human's life is stained with sin.`
`So, humans seek forgiveness while they still live.`
`However, in most cases, the person capable of granting such forgiveness is no longer on this Earth.`
`It was like that for Kinzo too.`
` The one he sought no longer existed in this world.`
`...Instead, that forgiveness had been woven together by a miracle, and now, Kinzo had received it...`
`"Ooooooohhh, Beatrice...`
` ...Beatrice...`
` ...You need not forgive me... You need not say anything...!`
` I simply needed...to apologize to you just once...!`
` Oooohhhhhh......"`
`Kinzo kept grasping the dress's hem and sobbing.`
`The sins of humans are not forgiven from without.`
`Forgiveness is found through regret and repentance.`
`...I want to believe that some sin, some fault of his...has been forgiven thanks to the way I look...`
`Kinzo's sobbing gradually ceased,`
` ...and he slowly looked up at me and rose.`
`He looked unsteady.`
` Nanjo rushed forward to support him.`
`"............"`
`"...So, ...I see that you are alive...`
` ...I'm glad..."`
`This time, these words weren't directed through me, but at me.`
`I hesitated, unsure how I should respond.`
`"...I beg your forgiveness for keeping this a secret from you all this time."`
`"No matter.`
` ...I do not fault you, Genji...`
` ...Considering the sin that I committed, ...every single day until now has been necessary for my atonement..."`
`"However, there can be no doubt that today's miracle is a true one.`
` ...By her own power, without anyone's help,`
` ...she solved the epitaph before anyone else."`
`"Well done, ...solving such a difficult epitaph..."`
`"...Th-Thanks..."`
`"...Indeed.`
` ...Your voice resembles your mother's.`
` Even your face reminds me of that mother and daughter...`
` ...There can be no doubt that Beatrice's blood flows through your veins..."`
`"Yes.`
` ...The traces of the lady of Kuwadorian in her youth are right there."`
`Does my face look like someone else's...?`
`"...Beatrice-sama, `
`please forgive me for keeping this a secret, even from you.`
` Your parents are Beatrice-sama and the Master."`
`"......Wha..."`
`"It's true.`
` ...Until now, you have been raised as a child without parents.`
` However, your true father is the Master.`
` And your true mother...is Beatrice-sama."`
`"...Is that, ...umm, ...really..."`
`"Yes.`
` You truly are a descendant of Beatrice-sama."`
`Is such a strange fate...really possible...?`
`I've dreamed about it.`
` Dreamed about what it'd be like to be the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
`But that dream had been mine alone.`
`I dreamed that if I solved the epitaph and carried out its ceremony,`
` I would revive as the true Beatrice.`
`...So, is it okay to believe...`
`...that since I've solved it,`
` Beatrice really has revived...?`
`"I...`
`truly carry...`
`Beatrice's...`
`...blood...?"`
`"Yes.`
` There is no doubt of that whatsoever."`
`"...It must have been hard for you to live until this day without knowing a parent's affection...`
` ...And yet, look at how wonderfully you've grown..."`
`"...So, ...you all knew...?`
` About me...?"`
`Genji, Kumasawa, and even Nanjo nodded wordlessly.`
`...Now that I think about it, there might have been lots of hints.`
`I've always felt as though there was something special about me.`
`Genji and especially Kumasawa always treated me very kindly.`
`Then, ...does that mean this day is a promised day, which would eventually have come no matter what...?`
`I don't understand anything anymore.`
`It's all a miracle from God.`
`A promised fate has led me to this day.`
`"......Beatrice.`
` ......No,`
` ...Lion."`
`"............?"`
`"That is the name I wanted to give you..."`
`"...It is your true name."`
`"Lion...`
` I will now return to you everything that Beatrice gave me.`
` ...I return to you the gold, as well as everything of the Ushiromiya family, which was created by it."`
`Kinzo stuck out a hand that looked like a rotting tree.`
`On his finger was a ring with the One-Winged Eagle crest, the symbol of the Ushiromiya Family Head.`
`He pulled it off, grasped it tightly, and then held it out to me.`
`...I didn't know what to do.`
`Slowly, as though they were being drawn forward, ...I held out my hands, palms up.`
`After pressing his fists against my cupped hands, Kinzo slowly opened his hands and let the ring drop.`
`"......Lion, my child...`
` ...All the ways your fate has been toyed with until today were caused by my sins.`
` ...Please forgive me...`
` ...You will now inherit my ring.`
` You are the new Ushiromiya Family Head."`
`"All of that gold belongs to you.`
` I ask that you use it as you please, and hope that it will be enough to heal some small part of the pain you have suffered...`
` That trifling amount of gold may be nothing in comparison with the sin I committed,`
` ...but even so, it should be enough to bring you some comfort."`
`"...Th-Thank...you......"`
`"......Lion,`
` ...I have one...final request."`
`"...Wh-What is that...?"`
`"Could you...`
`...call me......"`
`"...Uh, ...sorry, what did you say...?"`
`"Could you...call me...Father?"`
`"............"`
`"...I understand why you are not able to...`
` ...I have not been a father to you in any way.`
` Furthermore, you have been raised without knowing anything about a father.`
` ...I realize that it's not a name you can call me by.`
` And, I realize that I have no right to ask this of you.`
` ...But, even with that in mind, ...please...`
` ...If I could just hear that, ...I would have no further regrets..."`
`...After being asked like that, ...could I possibly have refused?`
`Even if I am his child, ...I truly cannot acknowledge him as my father...`
`So, it felt very strange to say it.`
`And yet, ...I decided that saying it was the right thing to do.`
`Only God can truly forgive sins.`
`But, ...though it may be temporary...`
`People can be saved by the forgiveness of others.`
`"...F......"`
`".........Yes..."`
`"......`
`...Fath...er......"`
`"Heh, ...heheheh......"`
`That awkward word made Kinzo laugh.`
`Drops of silver fell from both of his eyes.`
`At that moment, ...the shadow that had covered his face...was wiped away...`
`"Thank you, ...Lion.`
` My child...`
` ...And Beatrice, as well.`
` Thank you for this last chance...to ask for forgiveness..."`
`"...Of course, I don't believe that I have been forgiven by this alone.`
` ...I shall atone for the rest as I burn in the fires of hell.`
` ...I, Ushiromiya Kinzo, have no more regrets in this life!!`
` None at all! No regrets or matters left unfinished!!`
` Wahaha, ...wahahahahahahahaahahah!!`
` Waaahhahahahahaahahahahahaha!!!"`
`Looking up to the heavens, Kinzo spread his arms as though facing an applauding audience,`
` ...laughing at the top of his lungs.`
`It was the final pleasure, known only by those who have been released from all regrets of this world.`
`...Kinzo's laugh weakened, ...and when it disappeared...`
`He dropped to his knees...`
`like a puppet with its strings cut...`
`...and slowly...`
`fell to the ground......`
`"...M-Master..."`
`"Doctor Nanjo..."`
`"...Y-Yes..."`
`Though their master had fallen, ...they walked up to him slowly.`
`They already knew.`
`Kinzo's soul...had already burned itself out.`
`After checking Kinzo's pulse, Nanjo shook his head and stood back up.`
`"...It was a peaceful death.`
` ...I don't think he had any regrets at all."`
`"It may be...that the Master died long before now.`
` ...It was only his magic and tenacity that kept him here so long.`
` ...And, ...he finally had a chance to apologize to Beatrice-sama for everything...and finished everything he had to do..."`
`"...Please, ...rest in peace.`
` ...I believe that you have redeemed yourself."`
`"......Father......"`
`That was...`
`...the one-night reunion between me and my father...`
`...and also our final farewell...`
`"...This gold all belongs to you now.`
` ...If you wish to exchange it for money, I can arrange for that."`
`"I hear it's worth 20 billion yen.`
` ...From here on, any of your dreams in this world can by granted with money."`
`"Hohohoho...`
` It must be tough to think of what to do with this much money when it suddenly comes your way."`
`"...There is nothing I desire among the things money can buy.`
` ...So, for the present, I would like to leave this here."`
`...Of course, I'm glad I have a lot of money.`
`However, money can't heal the pain in my heart.`
`I just...want him to come back.`
`"As you wish.`
` Then it shall be left here.`
` ...Also, take this key."`
`"...What is this?"`
`"It is a key to the underground VIP room.`
` If you use this, you won't need to use that entrance contraption."`
`She was the only one who knew the answer to the epitaph's riddle, and the only key to this place was now hers.`
`...At this point, she truly was the master of this golden VIP room.`
`"You are already the master of Rokkenjima.`
` You have the right to know all of this island's secrets."`
`"...We should talk about Kuwadorian too."`
`"That's the mansion your mother lived in.`
` ...I'm sure you've heard rumors about it."`
`"Kuwadorian..."`
`"There are two mansions on this island, one at either end.`
` ...One is the mansion we know well.`
` The other is a hidden mansion known as Kuwadorian."`
`"Below this island are the remains of a military base built during the war.`
` The Master used that to travel between the two ends of the island..."`
`"There is an underground path in the back of this room, and if you follow it, you will reach the basement of Kuwadorian on the other end of this island.`
` ...That is a secret mansion, which only the Master knew of.`
` Of course, that mansion also now belongs to the new Head."`
`"...It's the mansion your mother lived in.`
` It will probably be worth taking a trip over there sometime."`
`"My...mother......"`
`I've lived alone my whole life.`
`The only person I've ever felt like calling 'Mother' is Kumasawa-san, who always helped me out.`
`So, there's a mansion where a mother I've never met nor seen lived...`
`...Who exactly...am I...?`
`"Ask any questions you wish.`
` ...You now deserve to know everything."`
`"...Right now, ...I'm feeling very confused.`
` ...I don't even know where I should start asking questions.`
` ...But I'm sure...I'll think of plenty of things to ask about.`
` ...When I do, please tell me..."`
`"As you wish."`
`"...A-Also, `
`...being treated so respectfully like that...`
`is a bit uncomfortable.`
` I'd be happier if you could talk to me the same way you've always done."`
`"If that is what you wish, then I will do so."`
`"Hohohoho.`
` That's easier for me too."`
`"...Well now.`
` What will we do now, Genji-san?`
` ...Kinzo-san is dead."`
`"I will tell Krauss-sama and Madam that he has passed away.`
` ...Then, we must tell them that Lion-sama is the official Successor to the Headship.`
` After all, from this point forth, you are the Ushiromiya Family Head."`
`"M-Me as the Head? That's...`
` And isn't Krauss-sama the Successor...?"`
`"The one who solves the epitaph's riddle is the Successor.`
` ......There exists a will specifying this much.`
` ......The Master's final order was that you were to inherit everything."`
`"P-Please wait...!`
` I appreciate the sentiment, ...but I can't do the job of being the Successor,`
` ...and I can't accept such a big responsibility.`
` I think it would be better for Krauss-sama to inherit that role..."`
`"......Are you certain?"`
`"Today, ...I have learned who I am.`
` ...Everyone knows about their parents,`
` but I didn't, since the time of my birth.`
` ...And here, today, I finally learned the truth.`
` ...That alone is enough for me."`
`If I suddenly became the Ushiromiya Family Head, how would Krauss-sama react?`
` How angry would Madam be?`
`I don't want to become the Head if it means making them feel like that.`
`Today, I learned who I am.`
`Who gave birth to me, how, and when?`
`...These are things I want to learn from them as time goes by.`
`That alone is enough.`
`"...I am Lion.`
` ...And, I am the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
` Knowing that is enough for me.`
` ...I don't plan on calling myself the Head.`
` ...Krauss-sama can take that job."`
`"Is that your order, as the Ushiromiya Family Head?"`
`"...Yes."`
`"......`
`...As you wish, Master.`
` Then I will make it so."`
`"And please, don't tell anyone about what happened tonight.`
` ...I want to stay me.`
` ...There's nothing I'd want to do with the Ushiromiya Headship or the gold."`
`...I just...`
`"I want to wait...here on this island...as I have done in the past.`
` I want everything to be exactly the same as it was.`
` ...That's my only wish."`
`"......`
`As you wish, Master.`
` ...Everything that has happened tonight will not go beyond those present here.`
` ...Kumasawa.`
` Doctor Nanjo.`
` That is the wish of the new Head."`
`"...If that's what you want, I have no objections.`
` Kinzo-san's will entrusted everything to you.`
` If this is what you want to do, none of us will complain."`
`"You say 'exactly the same as it was', `
`...but do you really mean exactly the same...?`
` With no differences at all...?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...We'll keep this a secret.`
` ...This place and the gold will be sealed away.`
` If I need money, I'll ask you about it then.`
` ...That's enough for me."`
`"As you wish.`
` The device leading to this place and the key both belong to you.`
` ...And all of us swear to keep the events of this night a secret.`
` ...Krauss-sama will be the Successor,`
` ...but in my heart, you will be the only true Successor."`
`"...As you have ordered, we will behave the same way we always have, but please order us whenever it suits you.`
` You are my only master."`
`"......Th-Thank you very much..."`
`A vast mountain of gold and the ring of the Ushiromiya Family Head.`
`The dress of the portrait Beatrice.`
`And, ...I became the true Beatrice, the Golden Witch.`
`Right here in my very own Golden Land.`
`If I think about it, not much has actually changed.`
`After all, I've always been the Golden Witch.`
` ...I've just had a few more people acknowledge that.`
`November 29th.`
`The day I became a true witch.`
`Oh, I am one yet many.`
`I am the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
`The true ruler of Rokkenjima...and the possessor of endless gold.`
`And yet, I am in no way complete.`
`...I await the return of the one person I love...`
`"......That is `
`the end of my tale."`
`"Oh,`
` ...is that all?`
` But aren't the next two years pretty fun...?"`
`"We don't need them.`
` ...After all we've heard in the past games about your inner conflict and how you suffered,`
` you don't need to say any more."`
`"......You mean...the conflict of the furniture with incomplete souls?"`
`"There was a duel.`
` The result had almost been decided.`
` ......However, the year 1986...was incredibly merciless."`
`"...I'll bet you cursed your fate."`
`"Yes.`
` ...If it had been one year sooner...`
` ...Or else, one year later..."`
`"The duel would've been settled, though the way it got settled would've been different."`
`Silently, Clair hung her head.`
`...If only I had been given time...`
`Or else, if I hadn't been given time to worry...`
`I hate...everything.`
`Why...did it have to be 1986?`
`"I decided...`
`...to abandon control over everything."`
`"...Abandon control..."`
`"Like the ceremony in which I inherited everything from the previous Head,`
` ...I decided to abandon myself to the fate known as a miracle."`
`It may be more accurate to say that I abandoned myself to the choice of the roulette.`
`I...we...could not even decide our own fate,`
` so we let fate decide everything for us.`
`Perhaps one of us will find what they seek.`
`Or, perhaps all will be joined and released.`
`Or, perhaps someone will put a stop to this folly.`
`"...No matter which fate the roulette chose,`
` I planned to obey its ruling.`
` I will not resist fate.`
` ...After all, whenever I have tried in the past, fate has always been heartless to me......"`
`Clair hung her head and let a single tear drop down...`
`Humans will carelessly say that people possess infinite possibilities.`
`However, the Endless Witch...knows how limited those possibilities really are.`
`So, out of her limited fate, she tried to create the infinite.`
`By entrusting her fate to God, she tried to create the infinite.`
`However, this did not mean that she was resigned to her fate.`
`She spun the roulette of fate with an unshakable and certain will.`
`A certain fate, where absolutely no one could escape if the epitaph was not solved.`
`She sealed off the island with it. Herself included.`
`October 4th and 5th, 1986, were sealed away by an absolute and certain will,`
` ...and she abandoned herself to that short span of time and the one fate out of many that would be chosen on that island.`
`"...And now, my confession is over.`
` ...Isn't that enough to place my motive for the crime?`
` ...If you still do not know, I will say no more.`
` It's not as though anyone could `
`understand my heart anyway."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...There's no need to say any more."`
`"...Lion,`
` ...after watching how I have wandered through a dead-end of fate, do you see how great a hope you are to me?"`
`"......`
`...I'm...a different possible 'you'."`
`"The happiness you live in makes me jealous, but even more overwhelmed...with happiness.`
` ...The future you represent was a possible one.`
` ...Right now, ...that fact alone is my salvation."`
`"...I......"`
`"...Please, live with enough happiness for the both of us.`
` I'm glad I got to meet you once, ...at the end.`
` ...You have my thanks,`
` Lady Bernkastel."`
`"...I'm just carrying out your funeral.`
` There's no need to thank me.`
` ...Well, it's about time to end this.`
` It's about time to send the dead to the land of the dead."`
`"......Yes.`
` This is my funeral, after all.`
` It's time for me to go back to where I belong."`
`"............"`
`"Don't make that face.`
` And please, rejoice that you were not me.`
` After all, I rejoice in that fact as well."`
`"......I'll live.`
` ...I'll live life for the both of us..."`
`"Thank you.`
` ...Live in happiness.`
` And someday, find yourself a wonderful person.`
` ...I pray that you live as a Human, without awakening as a witch.`
` ...That you have a whole and single soul...and love one person with all your strength...`
` ...I hope you live that sort of life."`
`"...I will..."`
`"Will-san,`
` I thank you for being an observer.`
` ...You aren't the one I truly wanted to understand me, ...but you have saved my heart."`
`"I...understand you.`
` I don't neglect the heart."`
`"...Thank you.`
` ......So, now that I have a splendid observer who understands me, ...I want to entrust my final moments to you."`
`"......Are you sure you're okay with it being me?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...For me, the important thing is whether the person understands me, not how well I know them."`
`...The one I wanted to understand didn't.`
` ...A person I don't know did understand.`
`There's nothing sad about it.`
` On the contrary, I'm grateful for this miracle.`
` A person was able to understand, even though he has no relation to me.`
`"You are a good observer...and the only one who has managed to understand me.`
` ...That connection is strong enough."`
`"......Understood."`
`"I offer my heart to you, ...nameless and wonderful observer."`
`"............"`
`"...Lion,`
` stand back."`
`"Huh?`
` ...What's going to happen...?"`
`"In the mystery genre, there can be no death unless the detective performs the last rites."`
`"...Will just stopping your heart be enough...?"`
`"When you mourn the dearly departed, do you put just their heart into the coffin?"`
`"...Got it.`
` ...That which was born from earth will return to earth.`
` ...I'll return all of you to the earth."`
`"Earth to earth.`
` Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.`
` Illusions to illusions.`
` And dreams to dreams."`
`"......Right."`
`"...Then let us begin.`
` ...This is my...burial."`
`"Whenever you're ready."`
`"Let us start.`
` ...This is almost like the end of my last game."`
`Light gathered at Will's back, and a sword materialized there.`
`Slowly, ...he drew it out.`
`Its pitch-black tip, which could neatly slice apart truth from fiction,`
` swung once, leaving a black trail, and then again, leaving a white trail.`
`"...I'll cut the truth out from the fiction.`
` ......Come."`
`Following Will's lead, a similar sword appeared in Clair's hand.`
`Its tip glinted silver, the opposite of Will's.`
`"First game, first twilight.`
` Six corpses in the gardening shed."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ...The corpse that cannot return to earth returns to illusions."`
`Will's pitch-black slash cut across Clair's body at an angle.`
`The blade passed through her like she was water, ...but its tip sent golden flower petals scattering.`
`"First game, second twilight.`
` Two corpses are close in a closed room protected by a chain."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ...A chain of illusions can only trap illusions."`
`The razor-thin black blur sent golden flower petals scattering again...`
`"First game, fourth twilight.`
` The old Head from the closed room study, confined in a scorching furnace."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ...Let the man of illusions go to where he belongs."`
`"First game, fifth twilight.`
` The last moments of the sacrificed boy with a stake in his chest."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ...The witch and stake of illusions can pierce naught but illusions."`
`"First game, sixth, seventh, and eighth twilights.`
` Three corpses lying in the closed room of the singing girl."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ...Illusions are the blind girl's song. Illusion of a closed room."`
`"......Well done.`
` ...Yes, you really are splendid."`
`"...That was a risky game from the very start.`
` ...What if the guy really wanted to see that dead face anyway and just stepped inside?"`
`"That's what it means to abandon one's self to fate."`
`"...That's what your roulette is, isn't it?"`
`"Let us continue.`
` Second game, first twilight.`
` The six with their stomachs split in the closed room chapel."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ...The gold truth locks the lock of illusions."`
`"Second game, second twilight.`
` The two who are close cannot even be close as corpses."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ...Illusions who have fulfilled their role do not leave even a corpse behind."`
`"Second game, fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights.`
` In Natsuhi's closed room, none are left alive."`
`"Earth to earth.`
` ...No one would dispute that a coffin is a closed room."`
`"Second game, seventh and eighth twilights.`
` The two sliced to death by the red-eyed illusion."`
`"Earth to earth. Illusions to illusions.`
` ...No illusion can create a corpse."`
`Every time the blade passed through Clair's body, golden flower petals flew everywhere.`
`...The petals covering her heart were being torn away, bit by bit.`
`The Illusion of the Witch was breaking down...and becoming flower petals.`
`"Third game, first twilight.`
` Six corpses connected by the linked closed rooms."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ...In a closed room ring, the end and the beginning overlap."`
`"Third game, second twilight.`
` The corpses of mother and child lay together in the rose garden."`
`"Earth to earth.`
` ...No falsehoods in their final moments as told."`
`"Third game, fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights.`
` Three corpses lying in the mansion."`
`"Earth to earth.`
` ...No falsehoods in their final moments as told."`
`"Third game, seventh and eighth twilights.`
` The corpses of husband and wife lay exposed under the arbor."`
`"Earth to earth.`
` ...The obvious culprit wields a mutable blade."`
`"Fourth game, first twilight.`
` A massacring storm sweeps through the dining hall."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ...Tales woven by the gold truth return to illusions."`
`"Fourth game, second twilight.`
` The two youths face a trial and pass away together."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ...Tales woven by the gold truth return to illusions."`
`"Fourth game, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth twilights.`
` None of the runaways are left alive."`
`"Earth to earth. Illusions to illusions.`
` ...Silent corpses, adorned by fiction."`
`"Fourth game, ninth twilight.`
` And none shall be left alive."`
`"Earth to earth. Illusions to illusions.`
` ...When fiction is shut up inside a cat box, it becomes truth."`
`...Over and over again, Clair's body was sliced by the pitch-black sword.`
`As proof, the chapel was now filled with golden flower petals, ...which danced around like gold snow.\`
`"...It's beautiful......"\`
`"Who wouldn't want their last moments to be like that?"@\`
`The gold snow was like confetti at the finale of a show.@`
`The curtains were finally falling on the stage that was her.\`
`"...Then, one final question."@`
`"......Sure."\`
`Clair slowly raised her hands.@`
`The sword she held became golden rose petals and melted away.@`
`She stood there, arms wide, waiting for the final strike...\`
`"Who...aaam I...?"@`
`"Illusions...to illusions.@`
` ...The promised reaper lowers the curtains on the tale regardless of the witch's will."\`
`The pitch-black blade that Will swung high...`
`...cut down Clair's form.`
`At the same time, she was blown away by a gust of wind.@ ...Her human form crumbled in an instant, became a storm of golden flower petals, and was torn apart.@`
`After she was blown away, a golden heart remained in midair, @ but it too was swallowed by the torrent of wind and broke down into flower petals.\`
`The gold torrent of wind swirled around the chapel...@`
`Then, the swirl of petals scattered out of existence...and vanished...\`
`A few remaining petals danced around like snowflakes,`
` and those final vestiges decorated the chapel beautifully.`
`......A beam of light lit the center of the stage.`
`There stood Clair, whose tale had ended.`
`Then, slowly, ...softly, ...she faced the audience and bowed.`
`Applause spread throughout the room.`
`The long, long tale she had just finished telling was being given a massive applause.`
`It went on and on.`
` ...And on and on.`
`The stage slowly sunk into the darkness of oblivion.`
`Behind the darkness and the curtain, Clair continued to bow in front of the unending applause...and disappeared.`
`...People are born with sin...and live life to obtain forgiveness from someone.`
`Or perhaps they are born with riddles...and live life searching for someone to solve them.`
`Here, all of her riddles had been solved, ...leaving no lingering regrets behind.`
`People are riddles.`
`They want someone else to solve their riddle.`
`They live life wanting someone to solve the riddle that they are, the most difficult riddle in the world.`
`They want someone to look at the riddle they are.`
`And they want that person to solve it.`
`For her, that wish has been granted...`
`...Her soul will wander no longer.`
`Sleep in endless peace, in your cat box coffin...`
`Though there had been so many golden flower petals flitting about like a blizzard, ...not a single one remained.`
`Everything had become dust, vanishing as though there had been nothing there in the first place, ...and all was silent once more.`
`Come to think of it, even the sound of rain is gone.`
`The rain must have stopped at some point.`
`"............"`
`"...Meeting you was her salvation."`
`"I...hope so."`
`"She cursed herself and her inescapable, dead-end fate...and gave up.`
` ...Meeting you, a happy miracle in her eyes, saved her in a way nothing else could.`
` ...So don't make that face."`
`"......Heh."`
`"That was a pretty tasteful ending...for you."`
`"...Auau only told me to carry out the funeral.`
` ...Well, I pretty much just called a facilitator, you, and let you do everything."`
`"Thank you, Will."`
`"...Nn."`
`"In Clair's place, I want to thank you.`
` ...Thanks for cutting off all the lingering regrets...of a 'me' of a different fate."`
`"...I thought I'd see a bit more head clutching and panic from you."`
`"I understand now.`
` ...I realize how happy my life has been.`
` ...If fate had toyed with me...and if I was living in another world, I might have gotten stuck in the same dead-end of fate.`
` ...However, thanks to an extremely improbable bit of good luck, I live in this world.`
` ...I now know how much that means, ...how much it's worth."`
`"............"`
`"......What's up?`
` Why the surprised look?"`
`"I thought decent witches didn't exist,`
` ...but I might have to change that theory."`
`"Don't worry, no need to change it.`
` ...I only joined that kid's game to kill some time.`
` ...And, though I lost, I enjoyed playing.`
` ...That kid died without folding up her game board.`
` ...I just took charge of cleaning up...as thanks to her for letting me play and because it's the loser's duty."`
`"...I was sure you'd be a lot crueler than this."`
`"Crueler?"`
`"I thought this'd be a cruel game that neglects the heart."`
`"Yes, it was a cruel game.`
` ...Though she claimed that the game was fantasy, `
`I've brought you along and made it end as a mystery.`
` ...The Illusion of the Witch has been spectacularly crushed, and my little bit of revenge is complete."`
`"............"`
`"This tale of intertwined loves ends thanks to an absolute and certain willpower.`
` ...Out of respect for that certain willpower, the Witch of Certainty made that kid a witch for just two days."`
`"...Even within this limited span of two days, I've been able to enjoy an endless kaleidoscope.`
` ...I won't be bestowing my favor, so no miracle will occur.`
` ......However, even this ending is something that child wished for."`
`"...I wonder which truth actually lay at the end of this endless tale."`
`"Who knows?`
` Not being able to say that for sure....`
`is what makes it a cat box."`
`"When you open the box, you get a tale where no trace of the mansion remains, and no one except Eva survives.`
` ...Now that Eva has died without saying anything, all the truth is inside the cat box.`
` ......Endless possibilities, all kept within a limited box."`
`"...Now that I think about it,`
` maybe the whole island where she lived and died was the Golden Land."`
`"If you can call a cat box a Golden Land, that is.`
` ...By the way, Battler has written up the most fun tale imaginable of the inside of the cat box."`
`"...You mean that book in Beatrice's coffin?"`
`"That's right.`
` ......It's the happiest possible tale for her, which he thought up himself."`
`"It was a really fun, love-filled, ...happy tale.`
` ...I also think...that tale was the most fitting one to put in her coffin."`
`"No, that's wrong."`
`"...Huh?"`
`"......You heard Clair.`
` ...You are her hope and her salvation.`
` More than anything else, you living on in happiness will be her salvation."`
`"......`
`...Right."`
`"...Live happily.`
` That's all you need to do to be that kid's miracle."`
`"Yes.`
` ......I'll live happily enough for the both of us."`
`"...I'm surprised you found this kid.`
` Didn't you have to search through `
`about 200,000 of them in that vast sea?"`
`"Such trivialities are all I am capable of."`
`"......Hmph."`
`"And now, the funeral is over.`
` ...As promised, I've released the barrier.`
` Once you leave, time will start moving again like normal."`
`"So, you're done with us now.`
` If I don't get back quickly, Diana'll start scratching the curtains."`
`"...We weren't together long, but thank you for your help."`
`"So long.`
` Be happy...for the sake of the hundreds of thousands of other 'you's."`
`When he left the chapel, a beautiful after-rain sky stretched out above him.`
`That sky, which was a mix of rain clouds, gaps of sunlight, and the tint of twilight,`
` had a beauty to it that couldn't be described in words.`
`Will slowly descended the stone stairs, stepping through puddles.`
`Then, he waved without looking back...and left the chapel behind.`
`His form and footprints gradually faded away...until there was no trace left.`
`"Okay, time for me to disappear too.`
` ...Goodbye, Lion."`
`"I have you to thank as well.`
` ...I believe I said some fairly inconsiderate things to you.`
` You have my apologies.`
` ...You taught me something very important."`
`"............"`
`"...What is it?"`
`"No, it's nothing.`
` ...It's been a century since anyone's thanked me, so I wasn't sure how to respond."`
`Bernkastel shrugged, then floated up into the air.`
`Then, she looked up at the beautiful seven colors of light shining in through the stained glass...`
`and spoke as though someone was looking down on her from there.`
`"Auaurora.`
` Was that enough of an answer check for you?`
` If you still don't get it, why not gather the other observer witches and have a tea party or something? Then you can listen to their theories."`
`"I'm mean, so I won't go any further than this.`
` There are no witches who don't think.`
` After all, witches who don't think either die or turn to seaweed."`
`"...Yes, now you can look back and have a drink, ...while seeing how much of your theory was right.`
` I'm tired of playing the part of the bad guy...and of being a miko.`
` You're done with me now.`
` ...Bye, Lion.`
` And bye to you too, observer witches."`
`Bernkastel burst and disappeared.`
`A single golden flower petal glittered.`
`...Lion picked it up.`
`It was the only trace of a miracle that remained in this chapel...`
`At that time, cheery voices could suddenly be heard.`
`It was the relatives.`
` They came out of the waiting room, one by one.`
`"So this is where you were, Lion.`
` I was looking for you."`
`"Mom.`
` My apologies.`
` I was just thinking about something."`
`"Looks like the rain's finally stopped!`
` Finally some good weather!"`
`"Everyone,`
` let us return to the mansion.`
` I have been told that Beatrice's funeral is over."`
`"Dad, where's the Head?"`
`"He'll be here in a sec.`
` Today was pretty crazy.`
` And playing along with Dad's little funeral show was a real pain."`
`"You shouldn't say that.`
` It was a very important ceremony."`
`"That's right.`
` I think it was very important for Father."`
`"I'm starving.`
` Gohda-san, think you could cook something up for us?"`
`"Yes ma'am!`
` I'll prepare some tea at once."`
`"...Where is Lion...?!`
` Lend me a hand."`
`"Our Family Head...! There you are."`
`As Kinzo came out after the others, Lion ran up to him.`
`"...You did very well today.`
` ...Beatrice's funeral is now complete."`
`"Yes.`
` ...And I'm sure that Beatrice's soul was saved."`
`"......`
`...How could you know that?"`
`"I was with Beatrice until a second ago.`
` ...And I saw her leave on her journey with no regrets.`
` That's how I know."`
`"............"`
`"...I guarantee it."`
`"I see.`
` ......If you say it, then it must be so."`
`The relatives left the chapel one by one.`
`Lion left too, giving Kinzo a shoulder to lean on.`
`A beam of sunlight peeked through the clouds,`
` ...looking like a staircase leading up to heaven.`
`Two silhouettes could be seen in the chapel.`
`A big brother...and a little sister.`
`The big brother who would never return from that day 12 years in the past, `
`and the little sister who waited all alone 12 years in the future.`
`However, the big brother knew everything, ...understood everything.`
`And the little sister knew nothing, ...understood nothing.`
`So, no matter how much time passed, the little sister remained as the girl she had been 12 years before.`
`She remained a six-year-old girl forever...`
`Her sobs into his chest finally subsided...`
`She quietly waited for his next words.`
`After patting her head gently, the big brother fished around inside his shirt pocket.`
`Then, ...he took 'that' out.`
`"Are you listening, Ange?`
` Take good care of this."`
`"...What is it...?`
` ...A key...?"`
`Battler took a large key attached to a necklace out of his pocket, then held it out to Ange.`
`It was large enough to cover his entire palm,`
` and little Ange probably wouldn't even be able to wrap her hand all the way around it.`
`The key glittered gold and had a beautiful, intricate design.`
`Its weight alone made it clear that this key was something very important.`
`Battler put the necklace around Ange's neck.`
`"This precious key is yours alone."`
`"What's it for...?"`
`"The time to use it will come soon.`
` When it does, you'll have to decide for yourself.`
` ...Understand?"`
`...Of course, she didn't have a clue what Battler was saying.`
`But she did realize that he was telling her to take good care of this key.`
` So, Ange nodded, at least in response to that part.`
`In her hand, the key had felt heavy.`
`However, now that it was around her neck, it felt as light as an ordinary necklace.`
`How strange.`
`"Okay, let's go."`
`"Where to...?"`
`She had been sure that her brother was about to sit down.`
`After all, just a second ago, he said he'd tell her what happened on Rokkenjima on that day.`
`She'd expected him to tell her here...`
`"On that day, on that island,`
` ...just what is it that happened?"`
`"I thought you were going to tell me about that, Onii-chan..."`
`"Absolutely.`
` And you'll be given the chance to listen.`
` ...However, to you, it may not feel as though you're merely listening to a story."`
`"......What does that mean...?"`
`"What you really want...isn't to know what happened on that island on that day."`
`...So, ...he does understand, after all.`
`What happened on that island that day?`
`Trying to answer that question was all I was capable of, so I wished for nothing more.`
`...But, if I could...`
`I'd...want to go there.`
`To that island.`
` On that day.`
`To Rokkenjima, on that day I couldn't go...`
` To the Ushiromiya family mansion.`
`To Mom and Dad.`
` To all the cousins, all the relatives.`
` And...everyone else.`
`I want to go back...to that island on that day.`
`So, I remain the way I was on that day.`
`My heart and soul stopped, stuck as a six-year-old's forever...`
`"...I want to go home."`
`"I know."`
`"Mom, Dad, Onii-chan.`
` Everyone.`
` ...I want to go home...to where everyone is..."`
`"That's why...I've decided to invite you there."`
`"...Huh...?"`
`"Your Onii-chan is the Game Master now.`
` Only those who know everything about the game board can open it up and invite pieces in.`
` ...So, I'll invite you to come to the game board."`
`"You'll...take me to Rokkenjima...on that day...?"`
`"That's right.`
` I'll invite you to the Rokkenjima of 1986."`
`"Will I `
`be able to see everyone...?"`
`"Of course."`
`"Even though...my memory is vague, ...and I can't remember anyone's face clearly...?"`
`"You'll remember soon enough.`
` ...And, though it'll be a reunion after 12 years for you,`
` ...it'll only have been a short gap for us.`
` ...Everyone will welcome you.`
` When you finally return from the distant future, everyone will welcome you."`
`"Will I...be able to stay there forever...?"`
`This way, ...I can be with everyone forever.`
`This is the goal I'm supposed to reach...`
`"Ange, listen to me carefully."`
`But Battler spoke in an admonishing tone.`
`As though warning me that this was a dream that wouldn't be granted...`
`"The Rokkenjima family conference usually ends after a single night.`
` Because of the typhoon that day, the boat couldn't come, and it lasted two nights."`
`"So, when the typhoon passes, ...I'll have to leave the island again...?"`
`"...Not exactly.`
` That decision is yours as well, Ange."`
`"............"`
`"You'll decide that yourself."`
`...I understand, of course.`
`I don't exist on that island on that day.`
`It's a miracle just to be invited there like this.`
`Just the two days before the typhoon passes.`
`Just getting those two days to myself is already the sort of miracle that will never come again.`
`If I'm greedy enough to ask for more, that faint miracle might vanish.`
`...Even though I thought this, my young heart, which was still six years old, wasn't satisfied with such a short-lived miracle...`
`"I don't want to leave."`
`"......I know."`
`"I'll be with everyone forever.`
` I'll stay with my family.`
` Even if Onii-chan says I have to head back, ...I'll stay on Rokkenjima."`
`"You can stay or you can leave, but it's not as though one of those is 'the right choice'.`
` That's not how it works, Ange."`
`"...Even so, you'll let me choose...?"`
`"Yes.`
` That's what the key is for."`
`Battler touched the glittering key that hung from Ange's neck.`
`"I've...already made my decision."`
`"You don't have to decide now.`
` The time to choose will come soon.`
` ...When it does, you must use your honest heart to choose how you'll use that key."`
`"............"`
`"You don't need to listen to anything your Onii-chan tells you.`
` You're free to choose your answer in any way you like.`
` ......However,`
` if you're a good kid, and if you can trust your Onii-chan..."`
`"...If I can...?"`
`"Then believe everything Onii-chan says."`
`"I'll...believe all of it..."`
`"That will lead to the best choice for you.`
` Listen to your Onii-chan's words and believe everything.`
` ...Can you do that?"`
`"......I don't know."`
`"That's good enough.`
` Believe whatever you want to.`
` That's also a choice you can make."`
`"...If I don't believe Onii-chan,`
` ...will I wake up from this dream...?"`
`"That won't happen.`
` So don't worry."`
`For some reason, Ange was suspicious of her brother...and scared of him.`
`Her wish was to remain on that island on that day, together with her family, forever.`
`...She was afraid that, once she got her two miraculous days, `
`...her brother might tell her to be satisfied with that and return to 12 years in the future all alone.`
`"I already told you.`
` ...There is no right decision.`
` You can go, or you can stay.`
` That's for you to decide.`
` And you don't need to make your decision right now."`
`"And no one will force me to make either choice...?"`
`"Of course."`
`"And Onii-chan won't tell me...to go back to the future...?"`
`"...There is a choice your Onii-chan wants you to make.`
` Even so, Onii-chan wants to respect your decision and let you reach it of your own accord, `
`regardless of what it happens to be."`
`"And I just told you.`
` I've already made my choice."`
`"And I just told you.`
` Now isn't the time to choose."`
`"When will it be time?"`
`"The key will tell you."`
`The large, gold key hung from Ange's neck.`
`Her small hand held it tightly...`
`...At that moment, she noticed a book lying on the chapel's altar.`
`The book had a lock on it and was sealed, so that it could not be read without a key.`
`Ange looked between the key hanging at her chest and the book on the altar.`
`"......Will this key unlock that book?"`
`"Don't touch that book."`
`His sudden, forceful response made Ange flinch.`
`Battler, realizing he had scared Ange, softened his expression.`
`"Come on, let's go.`
` ...I'm inviting you to come back to October 4th, 1986."`
`"Okay."`
`Battler held out his hand, and Ange gripped it tightly.`
`Then, they started walking.`
`A brilliant light lay beyond the chapel's door.`
`That blinding light peeked in through the cracks around the door.`
`...The brother and sister began to walk through to the other side...`
`Welcome back, Ange.`
`This will be the last time.`
`I'm opening this game board one last time...for you...`
`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!`
` Fall, fall, faaaaaaaaaaalllll!!!"`
`Once again, Captain Kawabata's ferryboat to Rokkenjima cut across the sea in perfect form.`
`Yes.`
` The tale of October 4th, 1986...always begins with Battler's screams.`
`But this time, one thing was different.`
`There was another yell alongside Battler's.`
`Battler was screaming.`
`The other was...laughing?`
`"Fall, fall, faaaaaaallll!!`
` Nooooooooooooooooooooooo...!!"`
`"Fun, fun, fuuuuuunnn!!`
` *giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"Battler's face looks funny!!`
` *giggle*, *giggle*giggle*!!"`
`Alongside the big brother, who was grasping at the handrail and screaming in a way no one that age should scream,`
` was the little sister, also grasping the handrail and jumping about like it was a ride at an amusement park.`
` George and the others just couldn't hold in their laughter at the difference.`
`"I guess Battler-kun hasn't changed much these past six years. He's as energetic as ever."`
`"Plus, Ange and Maria look more cheery than usual this year."`
`"Could this be the first time we've had all five cousins together?"`
`"Oh, is it?`
` I get it.`
` That explains why it's noisier this year than any year before."`
`"G-George-anikiiiiiiiii!!`
` This is way too fast, right?!`
` I'm begging you, ask the driver to slow down before it's too laaaate!!"`
`"Kihihahahahahahahaha!`
` This is too fast? Battler's so pathetic!"`
`"I wanna go faster!!`
` Faster, faster!`
` *giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"Any faster than this, and I'll fall right off the boat!!`
` Will that make you happy?!`
` I'm gonna faaaaaaaaaaaalllll!!!"`
`"Hahaha.`
` Going by popular vote, I'd have to say that Battler-kun's proposal is-"`
`"Rejected!`
` Ahahahahahahaha."`
`"Look out, Onii-chan. Look, you're gonna fall!`
` Ahhahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"Scaredy-cat Battler needs to be punished!! Tickle time!`
` Kihihihihi-!!"`
`"W-Wait, stop, Maria!!`
` You too, Ange!`
` N-Noooooooooooooooooooo!!"`
`"Thank goodness.`
` I was worried about Ange's health, but..."`
`"It'd be too sad to leave her behind at home.`
` I'm glad we decided to bring her anyway."`
`"Wasn't she very sick shortly before you left?"`
`"She was all better this morning.`
` Kids can be so incredible sometimes."`
`"She's the kind of person whose health takes a hit when she's stressed!`
` It's not that strange for people like that to get all better when the big day finally comes."`
`"She must really have been looking forward to playing with all five of the cousins together."`
`"Hohoho.`
` Just watching them play together makes you feel charged with energy, doesn't it?"`
`The adults smiled as they watched the children play around.`
`Ange, who had gotten very sick, and who everyone had thought would be absent, made a miraculous recovery.`
`Thanks in part to her strong desire to join in, she had come along to the family conference with the others.`
`And so...`
`For the first time ever, all five cousins were gathered together.`
`October 4th, 1986, became a day like no other.`
`The kids dashed up the path leading from the harbor to the rose garden.`
`They were probably so charged up that even walking was too boring for them.`
`"Wahhahahaha!`
` See that?!`
` First place!"`
`Battler was the first one to reach the rose garden, which was the goal.`
`Apparently, he was trying to make up for the dishonor he had suffered on the boat by proving his superiority on land.`
`A short while later, Ange and Maria reached him in a dead heat.`
`"I'm second!!`
` I'm faster than Ange, uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"No, you aren't! Maria onee-chan cheated!!`
` I'm second!!"`
`The three year gap between Ange and Maria was large, especially since both of them were growing kids.`
`It was only natural that Maria was faster, but Ange seemed to be complaining about a shoulder bump at the start line.`
`Maria onee-chan cheated, so she gets last place!`
` Teacher always says you get last place if you cheat!`
` ...Protested Ange.`
`"Come on, no need to fight.`
` Still, both of you really are fast...!"`
`"It's been a long time since I've run that much...`
` Ah, the breeze feels so nice."`
`"Are you out of shape, George-aniki?`
` You know, anyone who has to run the race-to-make-it-before-the-bell every day gets strong legs by default."`
`"In other words, being a fast runner is proof that you sleep in a lot."`
`"Onii-chan always sleeps in!`
` He didn't wake up today either, so I had to wake him up!`
` Right?!"`
`"A stomp followed by a flying elbow.`
` And that body-plex from the top rope at the end there just about finished me."`
`"That sounds more likely to put you in an eternal sleep..."`
`"Sounds fun!`
` I wanna do it too!"`
`"I'll bet Onii-chan sleeps in tomorrow too!`
` We'll wake him up together this time, okay?! *giggle*giggle*!"`
`"...I'd recommend against staying up too late tonight."`
`Finally, the adults came into sight.`
`The cousins waved at them, urging them to hurry up.`
`Ange and Maria were so excited that they could hardly wait.`
`Just by having all five cousins together...`
`Just by adding Ange into the group...`
`Look at how energetic this day has become.`
`"Excuse me.`
` The family members have arrived."`
`"So, they made it.`
` I must let Father know."`
`"Are they all in the guesthouse now?"`
`"Yes.`
` They will meet you here after they have set down their luggage."`
`"Understood.`
` Kanon, please show them the way.`
` Shannon, quickly get some tea ready."`
`""As you wish, Madam.""`
`"Father. It's me, Krauss.`
` It's about time for you to get ready."`
`After Krauss knocked on the door, it opened from the inside.`
`"Oh, Doctor Nanjo.`
` How is Father doing?"`
`"No need to worry.`
` He's changing as we speak.`
` I think he's just a little nervous."`
`"Who are you calling nervous?!!`
` Nooo, I cannot find my favorite One-Winged necktie pin!`
` How many times must I tell Natsuhi?`
` My possessions must never be moved without my approval...!"`
`Apparently, Kinzo had been running around for some time, just because he couldn't decide on a tie and a tie pin.`
`Kinzo, who felt that the dignity of the Family Head must always be preserved, `
`usually made a big deal about the Head's attire being equally dignified.`
`"...Will he make it in time?"`
`"Do you think you could give us a little longer?`
` We'll come down as soon as he's ready."`
`"Understood.`
` I'm counting on you, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...Father,`
` I must say, that necktie pin looks splendid on you."`
`"This necktie pin, you say?! This pin?!!`
` The family conference is held but once a year!`
` There shall be no compromise! I must have 'that' necktie pin!!`
` Where is it, ...where?!!"`
`"Kinzo-san, you already looked in that drawer five seconds ago...`
` Besides, you own several splendid necktie pins.`
` Is it not stylish to select something fitting to match fate's whims?"`
`"Hmmmmmm, you think so?`
` So, I don't need to use the One-Winged Eagle pin...?`
` Hmmmmm..."`
`As Krauss watched Nanjo calm Kinzo down,`
` he started finding it hard to believe that this doctor wasn't his own mother.`
`Well, it was always like this.`
`He always makes a fuss when no one's looking, but when the time comes, he makes his decision with pride.`
`After asking Nanjo to come down by lunch at the latest, Krauss snuck out of the study...`
`"What do you think? A splendid aroma, is it not?!`
` And a unique one, as well!"`
`"I've never had pumpkin tea before...`
` That little touch of sweetness makes it delicious."`
`As one step in preparing the tea for the guests, Gohda let Shannon try a bit first.`
`Until then, Shannon had thought it would be outrageous for a servant such as herself to drink the same thing as the family and their guests.`
`However, according to Gohda, that kind of thinking was a mistake.`
`"One must not serve something if one does not know the taste beforehand.`
` ...For example, when you visit a restaurant and a dish you've never heard of catches your eye, `
`what are you likely to ask the waiter?`
` 'How does this dish taste', correct?"`
`"I see...`
` So, if the waiter says that he's never eaten it before, that would seem a bit odd..."`
`"Precisely.`
` As a matter of course, anyone serving their customers must be deeply acquainted with the taste of the tea and food they serve."`
`"Hohohoho.`
` And, you'll always feel happier serving a sort of tea that you've tried and enjoyed for yourself."`
`"That's right.`
` After tasting tea this delicious, I can't wait to let everyone else try it."`
`"And because of that!`
` We servants must be very familiar with the tastes of all sorts of foods.`
` That's why 'sampling' food whenever I can is part of my job description, ...hohoho."`
`"It's a perk as well as our job.`
` Do you understand?"`
`"Yes!"`
`"...Everything is proceeding smoothly.`
` Are there any problems with the tea?"`
`"Oh, Genji-san, you must try some as well.`
` Seeing as it's almost Halloween, I decided to make some pumpkin tea."`
`"Later, perhaps.`
` The family will be arriving at the mansion very soon.`
` ...It looks as though the children will be joining in."`
`"Yes sir.`
` The cups are ready to go as well."`
`At that moment, the kitchen's extension line started to ring.`
`Genji, who was standing right beside it, swiftly picked up the receiver before the second ring.`
`Shannon and the others always thought Genji looked like a samurai when he did this.`
`"...Understood.`
` Take care when guiding them."`
`After giving that short response, Genji set the receiver down.`
`"That was Kanon.`
` The relatives will be here shortly.`
` The children are with them.`
` Shannon, Kumasawa, go to serve them.`
` Gohda, hurry up with that tea."`
`"""Yes sir!"""`
`The family conference.`
` It was the largest event of the year for the servants.`
`They were all excited and determined to make it through together once again this year.`
`"Krauss-sama,`
` I have led the relatives here."`
`"Oho, there you are.`
` Were there any troubles on your trip here?"`
`"Nii-san, you've been doing pretty well for yourself lately, haven't you?`
` Isn't it about time you bought a private jet?"`
`"Wahahahaha.`
` After all, no one was in the plane but the family, as usual!"`
`"I'm glad `
`Ange-chan made it.`
` I was so worried when I heard she was too sick to come."`
`"Thanks for your concern.`
` She suddenly got all better this morning."`
`"My tummy ache went away!`
` I rubbed my tummy clockwise!"`
`"Uu-uu-!`
` That's a magical ritual to heal tummy aches!"`
`"Now, Maria, quiet down..."`
`"Oh, is that Battler-kun...?!`
` You've grown so big!"`
`"It's been six years, hasn't it?`
` You've grown splendidly."`
`"Well, ...ihihi.`
` I do keep getting bigger, at least..."`
`"Can't really say that about his guts though!"`
`"I'm just happy to learn that he's still the same old Battler-kun."`
`Wahhahahahahahahaha.`
` Battler may be bigger, but he's still Battler.`
`"This brat's always been terrified of falling off planes and boats and stuff."`
`"That must be Asumu-san's blood, right?"`
`"When he was a kid and we went to theme parks, we always went on some of the wilder rides.`
` That's probably what did it."`
`"Don't they have height restrictions for those?"`
`"No, I don't mean that kind.`
` You know those paddle boats and teacup rides, right?`
` Looks like we took those a bit too rough back in the day."`
`"You've always gone a bit overboard on rides like that, Rudolf nii-san."`
`"I see...`
` Poor Battler-kun."`
`"Haha, poor Battler-kun indeed."`
`"Still, it's comforting, in a way.`
` Even after all this time, nothing says 'Battler-kun' like a fear of riding things."`
`"Onii-chan isn't scared of riding things.`
` He's just scared of falling off them!"`
`"Faaall, faaall!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Hey, stop running around...!`
` Maria! You're one of the big cousins now, right?`
` Set a good example!"`
`"Pardon me.`
` I've brought some tea for everyone."`
`A pleasant aroma followed Shannon as she came into the room, pushing a serving cart.`
`Even Ange and Maria, who had been running around in circles, sat down obediently when they heard that drinks were here.`
`"By the way, what's Dad doing?"`
`"He should be down here soon.`
` He's been rushing about all morning trying to choose a tie."`
`"You mean, all that about choosing 'an attire suitable for the Family Head'?"`
`"Father's always been picky about ties, hasn't he?"`
`"It's just something he has a passion for.`
` Staying stylish is a good thing."`
`"And yet, he always shows up wearing the same tie in the end."`
`The family members burst out laughing.`
`The sweet scent of Gohda's specially-made pumpkin tea spread throughout the parlor, and the calm atmosphere grew more cheery and excited.`
`"Look, Mama! Look, Mama!`
` It's a pumpkin cookie! For Halloween!!"`
`"Oh, that's right.`
` This sweet scent is kabocha, isn't it?"`
`"What the hell's a kabocha?"`
`"That's right.`
` Today, we have some special pumpkin-flavored tea for you to try.`
` It really is delicious, so I suggest you try some without sugar first."`
`"I wish I knew."`
`"Nee-san, `
`watch your sleeve."`
`"Wow,`
` so kabocha tea actually does exist.`
` Gohda-san really did his homework."`
`"Delicious.`
` This is excellent.`
` You can taste the kabocha's natural sweetness."`
`"Kabocha tea, huh?`
` Still, kabocha always tastes best in tempura!"`
`"Uu-!`
` It's 'pumpkin', not 'kabocha'!"`
`"Yeah, pumpkin is different from kabocha!`
` This is pumpkin!"`
`Maria was apparently speaking in English, but Ange, being normal, was not.`
`Maria seemed to think the English word was more fitting for Halloween,`
` but it looked like Ange thought kabocha and pumpkins were entirely different things.`
`Everyone laughed, but Ange, not knowing why she was being laughed at, cocked her head to one side discontentedly.`
`Just when it looked like she was about get in a bad mood and start grumbling,`
` Maria started teaching her a 'cookie game', and Ange immediately became engrossed with that distraction.`
`Then, the sound of approaching footsteps drifted in from the hallway.`
`When the relatives realized whose footsteps those must be, they straightened up.`
`Those quick footsteps stopped for a moment just outside the parlor door.`
`...As though someone was taking a deep breath and setting up a dramatic pause.`
`Then, the door exploded open as Kinzo yelled out loud, with Genji and Nanjo standing behind him.`
`"<Hhhhhhappy Halloween!!`
` And trick-or-treeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaat!!>"`
`"""<Trick-or-treeeeat>!!"""`
`The cousins shouted it back.`
`The adults returned the greeting too, looking embarrassed and refusing to meet his gaze.`
`Ange alone stood there with her mouth open,`
` unable to comprehend what had just happened.`
`"Welcome, my grandchildren!!`
` If you don't give me a treat, I shall trick yooooou!!"`
`"Go ahead, Maria."`
`"Happy Halloween, Grandfather!!`
` I got you a really incredible one this year! You'll be surprised!!"`
`Maria picked up a present that had been hidden behind a sofa.`
`Come to think of it, all of the relatives were now holding similar packages.`
`"Come on, Ange, you too.`
` Give this to Grandfather."`
`Kyrie handed Ange a neatly-wrapped present.`
`"Ooooooh, Mariaaaaaaaaa, you're always so thoughtful!!`
` Grandpa's so happyyyyyyyyyy!!"`
`As Kinzo took Maria's present, a smile broke out across his face, and he rubbed his cheek up against it.`
`"...Master,`
` your dignity."`
`"Nngg... O-Oh, that's right.`
` ...You have pleased your grandfather greatly, my granddaughter.`
` In return for the treat you have given me, I promise not to trick you at all this coming year."`
`"Now it's your turn, Grandfather!!`
` If you don't give me a treat, I'll prank you!!"`
`"Indeed, I'm well aware.`
` Genji...!"`
`"Here."`
`Genji fished through something that looked like Santa Claus's sack and pulled out a present addressed to Maria,`
` handing it over to Kinzo.`
`"Heeere you go, Mariaaa!!`
` Here's a present from meeeeeee!!`
` I'm warning yoooou, it's so cuuuuute!!`
` Such a waste to give it up to you♪"`
`"......Master. Dignity."`
`"Nnngggyyyyhhhh...`
` Th-This is a present from the Ushiromiya Family Head to Maria...`
` It is a...cute...nnnggg, *cough*cough*.`
` An item worthy of the Ushiromiya family's dignity and grace.`
` T-Take good care of it..."`
`"Thank you, Grandfather!!`
` I love you!!`
` *kiss*kiss*!"`
`"N-Nngggwoooooooohhhhh...!!`
` Ooohhh, Mariaaaaaaa, my adorable granddaughter!!`
` *kiss*kiss*!!!"`
`"............"`
`By this point, even Genji had to give up on Kinzo's dignity.`
`Still, the dignity of the Family Head had lasted a full ten seconds longer than usual this year.`
`"Happy Halloween, Grandfather.`
` This is from me."`
`"Happy Halloween. This one's mine.`
` I hope you like it."`
`"Oooooh, George, Jessica,`
` I must thank you once again this year.`
` I'm...so happy..."`
`With tears streaming down his face, Kinzo hugged George and Jessica.`
`"Oh, and Battler too.`
` ...I'm so glad you've returned to the family.`
` ...It's been lonely without you, these six years..."`
`"...Well, ...um, anyway,`
` ...Happy Halloween.`
` Not sure if you'll like it though..."`
`"Don't worry, ...don't worry, Battler...`
` I know you have things you want to say, things you want to ask.`
` ...But now is not the time."`
`"Grandfather..."`
`"I am...glad that you have returned to the Ushiromiya family...`
` ...It makes me feel...happy..."`
`Slowly, ...Kinzo moved forward and hugged Battler.`
`Battler drew back at first, but then he understood Kinzo's feelings and hugged him back.`
`Ange watched this scene play out, ...shocked.`
`Was Ushiromiya Kinzo...always this kind of person...?`
`"Ange,`
` you're up."`
`"Go on, give it to Grandfather."`
`"...Ah, ...okay."`
`Ange...didn't have a clue what was going on.`
`She took the present her mother had given her...and walked forward timidly.`
`...Kinzo's face, which had looked so cheery a second ago,`
` suddenly became stern as soon as Ange stepped forward.`
`No, it didn't 'become' stern.`
`That expression...was the one always worn by the Kinzo inside Ange's mind.`
`This was Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
`He was fickle, short-tempered, and always wore a stern expression on his face.`
` ...This was the most terrifying person in the Ushiromiya family...`
`"............"`
`"............"`
`It felt as though the world went suddenly quiet, and it only did it when I stepped forward.`
`...Why?`
` Why only for me?`
`But, ...isn't this how it should be?`
`Isn't this the Ushiromiya Kinzo I expect?`
` ...The Ushiromiya Kinzo I understand...?`
`I was like a puppet carrying a tea tray.`
`I walked forward, bewildered, with the present held out in front of me, ...and stopped in front of Kinzo.`
`Without letting his expression change in the slightest,`
` Kinzo slowly reached out and touched the present...`
`"AAAAAaaaaannnggeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`In an instant, Ange was caught in a firm embrace, present and all.`
`Kinzo's white beard rubbed against her cheek.`
`"Grandpa...Grandpa is so happyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!`
` I'm so glad to be blessed with such lovely grandchildren!!`
` I feel happyyyyyyy!!`
` So happy the tears just won't...just won't stoooooooooooop!!"`
`"...Master, your nose is running.`
` ...That...and your dignity."`
`"Oh, Genji, forgive me!!`
` *sniffle*!!"`
`he didn't look like he could possibly be anyone other than a kindly grandpa overcome with tears at his grandchildren's gifts.`
`"Thank you, Ange.`
` I heard that you chose to come even though you weren't feeling well at all...`
` I'm so glad...!`
` Here, this is for you."`
`He pressed a large gift box to Ange's chest.`
`...She finally realized that all of Kinzo's presents were wrapped differently and in boxes of different sizes.`
`"I wonder what he got you, Ange.`
` I hear that Grandfather always personally chooses what he'll give each one of us.`
` Pretty incredible, with all these people."`
`"......He picks them himself.`
` ...Every year.`
` ........."`
`He does...`
`what every year?`
`He picks...`
`what himself?`
`This bizarre ceremony happens...every year.`
`The cousins were all happily chattering about what their Halloween presents would be this year.`
`Maria came up to Ange and suggested that they compare the weights of their presents,`
` but for some reason, Ange just stared blankly.`
`After that, the adults also handed their presents to Kinzo one by one,`
` receiving a gift in return, along with considerate words about their health and questions about how they'd been doing recently.`
`Then, after watching to see that all exchanges had been completed, Gohda appeared...`
`and announced that lunch was ready.`
`"Ah, is it ready...?!`
` Come, ladies and gentlemen!`
` Let us enjoy the splendid lunch that Gohda has prepared for us.`
` Quickly, to the dining hall!"`
`"This way, everyone.`
` Follow me."`
`"We will carry your presents to your rooms in the guesthouse."`
`"Please, feel free to leave them here as you leave for lunch."`
`The relatives stood up, leaving their presents where they lay on tables and sofas, and followed Kinzo out of the parlor.`
`...Only Ange remained standing there, stunned,`
` ...as she clutched the present Kinzo had given her...`
`Gohda's lunches had never betrayed expectations before.`
`When Hideyoshi said that these meals were the only reason anyone ever came to these family conferences, everyone laughed and nodded.`
`The delicious food caused conversations to erupt all over the room.`
`You've gotten so big.`
` How have you been lately?`
` Pretty good.`
`It was a fun meal, with everyone asking each other about the latest and laughing together.`
`The Ushiromiya family sat at meals in a specific ranked seating order,`
` so the adult siblings, the cousins, and the spouses all sat in groups.`
`So, conversations sprung up naturally.`
`Ange had withdrawn slightly from the cousins' chat and was looking around the dining hall.`
`...What are Kinzo and the adult siblings doing?`
`Their conversation seemed to be peaceful and fun.`
`Most of the time, the siblings were mothers or fathers of their own households.`
`However, when they gathered together by themselves in front of Kinzo, that burden was lifted from their shoulders,`
` and they became young and bright as though they'd gone back to being kids again.`
`Rudolf, who was usually an easygoing father who nonetheless had a sense of dignity,`
` became so bright and cheery in this group that it almost looked like there was another Battler.`
`Even Kinzo looked peaceful and relaxed.`
`He didn't say a word about money or the inheritance.`
`In fact, he didn't even insult his children or call them incompetent.`
`He just looked like a happy old man, genuinely pleased to have his whole family together for the only time this year.`
`The group of spouses was just as harmonious.`
`The mothers kept bringing up problems with education and household matters, as well as family health issues.`
`Hideyoshi and Nanjo happily joined in on their conversation.`
`And what about the cousins?`
`...There was no way such an enjoyable meal with such a fun group of friends could fail to be raucous.`
`Maria was in her element, showing off her knowledge of Halloween trivia.`
`George and Jessica would nod in understanding, Battler would say something stupid, and Maria would laugh at him.`
`If I wanted, I could easily join in on that conversation,`
` and if the dessert caught my attention, I could easily slip out of the conversation too.`
`It was...happiness, both fun and natural.`
`...It felt like waking up from a daydream to be greeted by the rays of the springtime sun.`
`"According to the weather report, we can expect a big storm sometime tonight."`
`"It's supposed to be a typhoon.`
` Looks like we'll be stuck here for more than one night again."`
`"I do not mind in the least.`
` You may stay here as long as you wish. If it would mean seeing my adorable grandchildren's faces more, I would pray for rain every day."`
`"Give us a break. We do have work to get back to."`
`"Why don't you leave the island, Father?`
` That way, you could see your grandchildren whenever you wanted."`
`"Hahhahaha, true.`
` Living on a remote island may have a sense of majesty, but haven't you had your fill of it?"`
`"...It's too noisy in the city.`
` I much prefer a quiet island, with no one on it but my family.`
` I like it here."`
`"But on Rokkenjima, if something happens, it would take some time for a doctor to arrive."`
`"I agree.`
` At your age, I think you should at least consider moving to Niijima."`
`"...I am old now.`
` I want to live in peace, surrounded only by my family.`
` ...And I am satisfied.`
` I have this island to make that dream of mine come true."`
`"Father..."`
`"Hmm...`
` It seems I've gotten you all down.`
` Ladies and gentlemen, this ends Gohda's lunch.`
` Grandchildren, it will probably be raining constantly starting tomorrow.`
` Now is your last chance to see clear skies.`
` Why not enjoy the flowers and then take a walk on the beach?"`
`"That sounds good.`
` Okay, everyone.`
` Let's go."`
`"Uu-!`
` I wanna see the flowers and walk on the beach!`
` We can collect shells, and collect glass too!"`
`"Collect glass?`
` That, uh, sounds a bit dangerous...!"`
`"Fragments of glass get washed by the waves and become round, beautiful gems, which drift to shore.`
` Did you forget, Battler?`
` Remember how we used to pick them up together?"`
`"Oh... Were those glass fragments?`
` I always thought they were just pretty stones."`
`"Have you ever seen a glass gem, Ange?!"`
`"...No."`
`"Then let's go!!`
` I'll show you!!`
` Let's go, let's go!`
` But the first to see them gets to keep them!`
` I'm gonna get them all!"`
`"Heheh, in that case, I'm not gonna lose either.`
` Let's see who can find the prettiest, biggest glass gem!"`
`"All right!`
` At times like this, why not be a kid?!`
` I'm not gonna lose either!"`
`"Then we'll head down to the beach."`
`"Indeed.`
` Take it easy and enjoy your time together, grandchildren."`
`The cousins rose from their seats and noisily left the dining hall.`
`Maria grabbed Ange's hand and dragged her along.`
`However, Ange's expression was vague and absentminded, the opposite of Maria's full smile...`
`The cousins walked along the beach, playing in all kinds of ways.`
`They searched for bits of glass, polished by the waves to become small and gem-like.`
`They caught up on news of each other's lives and joked around.`
`They wrote words in the sand.`
`They chased the receding waves and ran away from the coming ones.`
`The cousins enjoyed the time they had to themselves.`
`"Get back here, Maria!`
` You won't get off easy this time!!`
` Wahahaha!"`
`"Kyahahahahahaha!!`
` No way, no way, kyahahahaha!"`
`"You'll get hurt if you fall.`
` Be careful, you two."`
`"Feels like the wind's gotten stronger.`
` Maybe we should head back soon."`
`"You're right.`
` I think the sky's getting cloudier too.`
` ......Battler-kun, Maria-chan!`
` I think we should call it a day soon and head back to the guesthouse for the time being."`
`"Uu-? No way!`
` I wanna play more!!"`
`"Hey, don't ignore your cousin.`
` Okay, that's all for now.`
` Here, I'll give you my glass gem."`
`"Uu-!! Really?!`
` Thank you, Battler!!`
` Now, I have the most, so I win!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Ange, are you okay?"`
`"...Yeah."`
`"What's wrong, Ange?`
` You look a little down."`
`"She's just tired out.`
` Come on, let's all head back together."`
`Ange's expression probably did look tired.`
`However, Battler alone thought he saw something else in it.`
`"What's wrong?`
` Can you tell me?"`
`"...It's nothing."`
`She said that, `
`but something in her expression showed that she was unsatisfied for some reason.`
`Since Ange didn't say what it was, and Battler couldn't think of anything,`
` he was unable to guess any more.`
`So, he squeezed her small hand, silently letting her know that she could tell him whenever she was ready...`
`Even though it had seemed like such a bright, sunny day a second ago...`
`The sky turned gray, and the winds started to feel more annoying than pleasant.`
`If they waited around, they would probably see scattered raindrops as well soon.`
`"I guess it'll be raining the whole time from now on.`
` What a pain."`
`"Still, even though it didn't last long, it was fun to be a kid again."`
`"I can't wait to show Mama this glass gem!`
` I'm gonna tell her I won!"`
`"Ihihi.`
` Even though you only won 'cause I gave you mine."`
`"Uu-!`
` I got it, so it's mine!`
` So I won!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`Ange walked distractedly, pulled along by her brother.`
`George and the others thought that she had probably woken up too early and was tired, so they didn't try to talk to her much.`
`As they reached the end of the forested path, the rose garden lay before them.`
`They could see strong winds making the rose bushes wave.`
`"Mama!! Look!!`
` I won!!"`
`Maria ran forward, waving her hands about and yelling.`
`It looked as though Rosa was waving to them from the front of the guesthouse.`
`"I'm gonna head back to my room for a sec.`
` I'll meet you in the cousin room right after."`
`"Okay, got it.`
` See you later, then."`
`Jessica ran off in the direction of the mansion.`
`George turned around, as though suggesting that they had better get going too.`
`However, when he saw Ange standing still with a crabby look on her face,`
` he realized that something might have put her into a bad mood.`
`"...Is everything okay?"`
`"Y-Yeah, she's fine.`
` Sorry, but would you mind going on ahead of us?"`
`"Sure, got it.`
` See you later."`
`George headed for the guesthouse.`
`The only ones left in the rose garden were Battler, who was waving at George, `
`...and Ange, who was still staring at the ground and holding Battler's hand.`
`For the past few minutes, he had repeatedly asked Ange what was wrong.`
`He realized that this wasn't anything like a stomachache, or something obvious that had made her grumpy.`
`However, young girls sometimes get upset for reasons that only they can understand.`
`Battler knew this, so he didn't rush her in any way,`
` and continued to gaze around the beautiful rose garden, holding her hand.`
`"......Onii-chan."`
`"...What is it?"`
`"Where...`
`...are we?"`
`She asked the question as though she was talking about something on the other side of the silver screen.`
`Though Battler understood what that question meant, he played dumb.`
`"Where are we?`
` We're on Rokkenjima, right?"`
`"You're wrong."`
`"No, I'm not."`
`"How is this Rokkenjima?"`
`"It's the Rokkenjima of October 4th, 1986.`
` ...The Rokkenjima you've wanted to see for so long."`
`"That's a lie."`
`"Why do you say that?"`
`"This is...totally fake."`
`Ange wrenched her hand from her brother's grip.`
`That hand hit a rose and sent flower petals flying.`
`"I don't lie."`
`"How is this supposed to be the truth?!"`
`Ange spat those words out.`
`However, Battler's expression remained calm and composed.`
`"...What don't you like about it?"`
`"Ushiromiya Kinzo, for example!`
` He wasn't anything like that, right?!"`
`"What grandfather wouldn't smile `
`when he's been reunited with his grandchildren after a long time?"`
`"Ushiromiya Kinzo wasn't that kind of person!!`
` Ushiromiya Kinzo was...!"`
`"Strict, discontented, short-tempered and quick to anger?"`
`"So you do understand!!`
` What was all that back there?!!`
` How was that supposed to be Ushiromiya Kinzo?!`
` Halloween?`
` Exchanging presents?!`
` What the hell was that?!!`
` That's nothing like Ushiromiya Kinzo... This is nothing like Rokkenjima...!!"`
`"...Don't you remember, Ange?"`
`"Remember what...?!"`
`"We did that every year, didn't we?"`
`"Every year...? That?!"`
`"Well, I guess it's no surprise.`
` The last time you went to a family conference, you were less than six years old.`
` ...So, it's only natural that you wouldn't remember."`
`"It's only natural that I don't remember...?`
` ........."`
`Ange understood what her brother was trying to say.`
` ...However, she couldn't accept it.`
`"It's true that Ushiromiya Kinzo was a rigid man.`
` When he was younger, he really was strict with his kids, apparently.`
` ...And, well, it's probably not wrong to say that it was pretty traumatic for Dad and the others, `
`and that they're still a bit scared of him."`
`The grand tale of how Kinzo restored the Ushiromiya family was more than enough to paint him as a rigid, terrifying man.`
`Furthermore, Kinzo was an investor.`
` All the legends and tales that made him seem more mysterious had probably worked in his business's favor.`
`...At times, Kinzo may even have acted out this part people expected, endeavoring to make his presence all the more overpowering.`
`That's why the world at large spoke of Ushiromiya Kinzo as a strict, short-tempered man.`
` And they even thought of him as a fickle, bold, incomprehensible eccentric...`
`"But that was just the face Grandfather showed to the world.`
` That's not how he acted in private, alone with his family."`
`"Are you saying...that weeping old man who doted on his grandchildren...`
`is the real Ushiromiya Kinzo?"`
`"He must have played with you and patted your head many times.`
` Do you really not remember...?"`
`"............"`
`Stuff like that...might have happened once or twice.`
` But that must've been a mere whim of his...`
`My parents told me all the time.`
`...Grandfather is a terrifying person, so make sure you act properly.`
`...They always...always said...that he's very scary, so take care...`
`"...And that means...`
`...he was a scary person..."`
`"When you were little, you would always accept whatever your parents said and take it too seriously.`
` To put it nicely, you were obedient, ...but to put it bluntly, you were a kid with an overactive imagination.`
` ...Dad and the others were just trying to make you realize how important it was to be polite."`
`"...I...I saw it though!`
` I knew about it!`
` I knew that Ushiromiya Kinzo was a scary person!`
` I've even seen him yelling in anger!!`
` I'll never forget it!!"`
`"Well, like you saw just now, Grandfather could be a bit abrupt at times.`
` ...He might just have been trying to surprise you.`
` Or, it might have slipped out when he was having a serious discussion with his kids."`
`"And you think I just got scared for no reason...`
`and got the wrong idea?"`
`"............"`
`"That can't be! That can't be true!!`
` I mean, I still remember it!`
` I know I saw Ushiromiya Kinzo yelling and being scary!`
` Mom and Dad were terrified too, so I know I'm right!!"`
`"...The impression you had of Grandfather when you were young remained with you, and that impression grew inside you as you grew up."`
`How many times did Ange see Kinzo in her life?`
`How old was she the last time she saw him?`
`Ange, who got sick easily when under pressure, couldn't have gone to Rokkenjima often.`
`And, since she was absent for the family conference when she was six, her last memories of him must have come from when she was just five years old.`
`"...B-But even you haven't seen Ushiromiya Kinzo `
`for six years."`
`"That's right.`
` But, when I finally came back after six years,`
` ...I saw that Grandfather hadn't changed in the slightest."`
`"Kinzo was...fickle, so you could never understand what he was thinking,`
` ...and he was an eccentric with a creepy love for the occult, and..."`
`"It's true that he had a love for the occult.`
` Yeah, it was a bit of a strange hobby for him to get into in his final years.`
` ...I'll admit that his hobby of collecting strange objects to scare his grandchildren and laugh at them wasn't exactly praiseworthy."`
`Even Battler had been pranked by Kinzo in the past.`
`He'd do things like showing off an attache case with seven strange stakes in it...`
`...and say something about how they were once used in the Middle Ages to gouge the hearts of victims in a witch's ceremony.`
`When Kinzo did things like that, it was pretty scary, but looking back on it now, they really were childish pranks.`
`Grandfather only scared his grandchildren because he wanted to joke around with them.`
`"I'd be willing to bet...that Grandfather pulled a prank like that on you too.`
` It's no surprise that, young as you were, you let that scare you and convince you that Grandfather was a strange, terrifying person."`
`"...I...I don't know what you're talking about, ...Onii-chan..."`
`Ange bit her lower lip and stared at the ground.`
`She said she didn't understand,`
` ...but in truth, she understood perfectly, and was refusing to accept it.`
`"Remember how we traded Halloween presents in the parlor just now?"`
`"...What was that all about?`
` The Ushiromiya family never did anything that sentimental...!"`
`"It's almost as though...you don't remember it at all."`
`"Are you saying I got presents once too?!`
` I don't remember anything like that!!`
` That could never happen!"`
`"...Do you really think that Grandfather, a man who loved the occult and Western traditions, wouldn't celebrate Halloween?`
` ...Grandfather's 'Happy Halloween' was pretty much the standard greeting at our family conferences.`
` ...He must've said it to you too."`
`"...Youth can be so cruel.`
` Even though Grandfather put all his heart into choosing those presents, ...it looks like your heart didn't remember anything."`
`"Are you saying that I was just too young to remember,`
` ...and that...'that'...was the truth of October 4th?!"`
`On that day, just like six years before,`
` Grandfather entered the parlor with a cry of 'Happy Halloween'.`
`Then, he and I traded presents...as he shed tears over our long-awaited reunion after a six-year gap.`
`...Grandfather seemed so sad that Ange wasn't able to come.`
`So, he gave Kyrie-san a present, telling her to make sure that Ange got it...`
`"I never heard anything about a present like that!`
` Mom never gave it to me!!"`
`"...True.`
` ...She never...had the chance..."`
`"I don't believe it!!`
` I won't believe that was Ushiromiya Kinzo!`
` Then what about the family conference itself?!`
` Wasn't there a tense argument over the distribution of the inheritance?!"`
`"All of the adult siblings were in money trouble!`
` That's why they all longed for Kinzo's inheritance money...!"`
`"......Ange, where did you hear that from?"`
`"What do you mean, where?!`
` It's the truth, isn't it?!"`
`"Do you think Dad would talk to you about financial difficulties with his company when you were that age...?`
` And not just Dad.`
` Even if Uncle Krauss, Aunt Eva, and Aunt Rosa were in money trouble and wanted Kinzo's inheritance money,`
` ...do you really think they'd talk about it in front of you...?"`
`"B-But...`
` ...But it's true, isn't it?!?!"`
`In the end, it was true.`
`Ange's words were not mistaken.`
`Not only Rudolf, but even Krauss, Hideyoshi, and Rosa...had companies in money trouble.`
`...People started talking about the Rokkenjima Explosion Accident as though it was some sort of conspiracy,`
` ...and a 'mystery' imagined by the public covered the island.`
`Weekly magazines and television shows researched the circumstances of Kinzo's children at the time, `
`and in the future where Ange lived, that research had been made public.`
`"...You learned about all of that...after 1986."`
`"But it's a fact, isn't it?`
` There's no difference between facts and truth!"`
`"Does that prove that the inheritance created a strained atmosphere between the relatives on Rokkenjima?`
` ...I guess that might fit with your memory...of your parents telling you repeatedly to be extra polite at the family conference..."`
`"...A-Are you saying that what I know about Rokkenjima...what I know about the Ushiromiya family...`
`...is wrong...?!"`
`"........."`
`"You're the one who's wrong, Onii-chan!!`
` There's no way something like that could be possible!!`
` I won't accept that 'that' was Ushiromiya Kinzo!`
` I could never accept that!!"`
`"So, you don't believe, Ange?"`
`"That's right, I don't believe!!`
` I don't understand why you're showing me something like this!`
` After all, this is your game...no, your game board, isn't it?!"`
`"............"`
`"First it was Beato and Bern!`
` One witch after another has sneered at my fate, trying to make me surrender in their games.`
` But I want the truth!`
` Witch illusions won't work on me!`
` ...Now I get it, you damn witches.`
` So, you've sent Onii-chan as a final assassin to finish me off."`
`"...You're right.`
` ...This is...my game.`
` So, of course, this is my tale, and I'm the one making it.`
` That's why I'm able to add in 'what if' situations, like what would happen if you came to the island too."`
`"See?!`
` You made this tale!!`
` It's all a pack of lies, ...a fiction you created!!"`
`"......You're right.`
` ...This is all...a fiction I created."`
`"See?!!`
` You've admitted it! You have, haven't you?!!`
` Just like I thought, this is all a lie you made...!`
` Why are you lying to me?!`
` Why won't you tell me the truth?!"`
`"...Because there's something I need you to understand.`
` ...Something more important than the truth."`
`"Something more important than the truth...?!`
` What the hell are you talking about?!"`
`"The purpose of my game is to make you understand that."`
`Just as Beato's games were made to make Battler believe in witches.`
`Battler's game...was made to show Ange something that was more important than the truth.`
`Games never bring about their intended ends by force.`
`After all, Beato's game could never be won for all eternity, unless Battler acknowledged witches on his own.`
`Battler's game was the same.`
`Battler couldn't win in this game...unless Ange acknowledged it herself.`
`So, Battler had advanced this game just as Beato had done in the past.`
`To believe it, or not.`
`To accept it, or not.`
` The decision lay solely in the hands of the opponent.`
`And so,`
` ...Battler was trying to enshroud Ange with his own illusion...`
`"I finally get it.`
` ...This is a game between me and you, Onii-chan."`
`"Ange,`
` I'm not trying to challenge you to a game."`
`"No.`
` This is a game.`
` ...I made a wish, hoping to learn the truth of October 4th, 1986.`
` And so, you invited me to this game, saying that you'd show me the truth.`
` And now, you're showing me this strange illusion, trying to make me believe that it's the truth!`
` ...Well, too bad.`
` I'm already used to dealing with witches.`
` I can totally tell that you're trying to use that kind face of yours to trick me...!!"`
`"............"`
`The big brother realized that no words of his would have any effect on his enraged little sister.`
`So, he just quietly listened to Ange's words.`
`But even so, ...Ange was dissatisfied.`
`"I've had more than enough of this stupid farce.`
` If you don't plan on telling me the truth, then end it all now!`
` I'll find my own truth for myself!`
` I won't rely on you...!`
` ......That's right.`
` There never was anyone I could rely on anyway...`
` ...I've...always been...all alone..."`
`"Sorry.`
` I won't let you leave this game."`
`"...Ah, that's right.`
` Unless the Game Master admits defeat, the game never ends, right?"`
`"That isn't what I meant.`
` ...I'm just telling you to stay quiet and listen."`
`"...Oh, sure.`
` I'll just stay quiet then.`
` ...Even if a player isn't around, the pieces just move by themselves, and the game moves forward.`
` ...Isn't that how it works?"`
`"......`
`...That's right.`
` A player can step back and become an observer for a while if they want.`
` And they can return and join in whenever they want too."`
`"Then I'll do that.`
` This is an endurance contest.`
` ...It'll keep on going until you stop trying to cover up the truth."`
`"............"`
`"Something more important than the truth?`
` ...I don't get it...!`
` How could anything like that exist...?!"`
`"It does, Ange.`
` ...Whether my tale is the truth or not,`
` ...the fact remains that you lost something precious on this island."`
`"Dad, Mom.`
` And you, Onii-chan.`
` ...I lost my family...and everything that mattered to me."`
`She spat out those words as though no further questioning would do any good...and looked away.`
`Even as he watched this, Battler's expression remained gentle.`
`"Just keep going however you like.`
` Later, Onii-chan."`
`"...At least make sure you watch the tale.`
` Even just listening is enough."`
`"If I feel like it.`
` ...Later."`
`Ange's eyes clouded.`
`Then, a particularly strong gust of wind blew by, sending her hair flying.`
`The wind must have been carrying some dust with it.`
` Ange's nose twitched, and she sneezed loudly.`
`"......Nnnnn.`
` ...Onii-chan...?"`
`"What is it?"`
`"...How long are we gonna stand here...? The weather's all weird.`
` ...Let's go back to the guesthouse."`
`Ange's eyes weren't cloudy anymore.`
`However, the tone and atmosphere about those eyes seemed somehow different from before...`
`In a manner typical of young girls, Ange signaled that she was too bored and wanted to go do something.`
`This Ange was clearly a six-year-old Ange.`
`"Good point.`
` ...Then, why don't you head back to the guesthouse now?`
` I'm going to stay here."`
`"Why...? It'll start raining soon."`
`"It won't be long now.`
` So, I'll wait here a bit longer."`
`"You're waiting here? ...Who are you waiting for?`
` ......Huh?"`
`Then, to Ange's eyes, it looked as though the strong winds were carrying flakes of gold along with them.`
`No, she had definitely seen something, ...but she wasn't able to describe what she had seen,`
` so to her it had seemed like flakes of gold dancing on the wind.`
`"So, here you are.`
` ...I've been waiting a while now."`
`It was as though he was talking to the wind.`
` ...Battler spoke to the empty rose garden.`
`That can't be right.`
` After all, it was clear from his words that he was talking to someone right in front of him.`
`So, Ange thought it must be someone that she alone couldn't see, and she rubbed her eyes.`
`Then, when she opened her eyes wide, another large gust of wind blew past her.`
`She shut her eyes immediately, ...and when she timidly opened them...`
`From the other end of the rose garden...`
` Yes, from the path that led up from the harbor...`
` ...A person appeared.`
`To Ange, it looked as though she had appeared along with a cloud of gold flakes carried by the wind...`
`"You're late, Beato."`
`"Am I? I'd call it early."`
`"You should ride in the boat with us every now and then."`
`"You mean grasp the handrail and scream alongside you?"`
`"Yeah, sure, let's scream. Fall, fall..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` I see, how interesting...!`
` Yes, I suppose I did arrive too late."`
`The pair casually walked up to each other and hugged.`
`It looked like a pair of friends being reunited after several years.`
`"............"`
`Ange, surprised by this unfamiliar woman, looked for somewhere to hide.`
`However, her eyes met Beato's, and she was unable to escape...`
`"Oh, and you must be Ange."`
`"......!"`
`She was shocked to hear this unfamiliar woman suddenly use her name.`
`"Look, even she can be so cute when she's six years old."`
`"...O-Onii-chan,`
` ...who...is this person...?"`
`"A friend of mine."`
`"A friiiieeeend?!`
` How can you say that?!"`
`"...Onii-chan's...friend...?"`
`"This is Beatrice.`
` You've heard from Grandfather, haven't you?`
` About the Golden Witch, who gave the Ushiromiya family its gold?"`
`Haven't I...heard that before?`
`The Golden Witch.`
`...Now I remember.`
`That was the scary witch who would snatch you up and carry you off into the forest if you didn't listen to your parents or stayed up too late on Rokkenjiima.`
`"Mom said...`
`that on rainy nights, if you look out the window at the dark forest,`
` ...you might see the witch looking back at you and get snatched away."`
`"Which must mean...`
`that I'm supposed to be wandering about in the cold rain, looking into each window to find kids staying up too late?`
` How pathetic that would be...!"`
`"Wahhahahaha, good point.`
` Ange, your parents just made that story up to get you to go to bed on time.`
` Beatrice doesn't do stuff like that."`
`"Very well, allow me to introduce myself!`
` I am Beatrice, the Golden Witch!"`
`"Or her grandchild, at least."`
`"Grandchild...?"`
`"...Th-That grandchild part's a bit of a killjoy."`
`"Well, it's true, isn't it?`
` The person that Grandfather got the gold from and called the Golden Witch was your grandmother, right?"`
`"N-Nnnnggg, I guess.`
` ...The Grandchild of the Golden Witch, am I?`
` ...Nnngyah, can't I get a better title than that?"`
`"...Is this person...a witch...?"`
`"Yep, she is.`
` She's a guest who's been invited to the family conference today."`
`"...She isn't a scary witch?`
` She's not gonna take me away into the forest...?"`
`"Damn Rudolf and Kyrie.`
` Just what do they think they're telling this kid about me?!`
` I don't do things like that...!`
` I'll lodge a firm protest later! *pout*!"`
`...She looked like a fiercely emotional person,`
` ...but she wasn't at all what Ange had expected the creepy Golden Witch to be like.`
`She was very loud, overreacting to everything.`
` ...Nothing at all like the witch Maria onee-chan had talked about, who had lived for a thousand years and had various servants from the demon world.`
`She looked, well, like an energetic young woman, the kind Ange's mom might have gotten along great with.`
`Her brother and the witch talked together happily like a pair of close friends.`
`Dogs tend not to trust people they meet for the first time.`
` However, people say that they calm down once they see that their owner is on good terms with the stranger.`
`Surely, something similar to this was going on in Ange's heart.`
`Ange kept staring at this pushy, temperamental woman who called herself a witch...`
`as she chatted happily with her brother...`
`"......What's this key for?"`
`Beato noticed the gold key hanging from Ange's neck.`
`Ange automatically and defensively grasped it.`
`"That's Ange's precious key."`
`After hearing these vague words, the witch stared blankly for a second.`
`But, almost immediately, she seemed to understand what he meant.`
`"......I see.`
` Is that how it is?"`
`"I thought it'd be easier to understand if I made it clear what she's supposed to do."`
`"............"`
`"Fear not, Ange.`
` No one's going to steal your precious key."`
`"...Are you sure...?"`
`"Of course.`
` That key belongs to you, and the choice is yours.`
` Battler and the rest of us are merely signposts to guide you on your path."`
`"......?"`
`When her brother gave her the key, he had said that it was very important, so she had to take good care of it.`
`Ange didn't have a clue what the key was for,`
` ...but it looked like Beato did.`
`However, just like her brother had done earlier, Beato only spoke in riddles.`
`This irritated Ange,`
` but for the time being, the Golden Witch said that she didn't intend to steal the key, so Ange calmed down a little.`
`"...Do you...`
`know what this key is used for...?"`
`"But of course.`
` However, I cannot tell you."`
`"Why not...?"`
`"Because you must decide how to use that key for yourself."`
`The witch said the same thing as my brother.`
`The pair nodded to each other, but it was all Greek to me.`
`It felt like someone had laid out a riddle that everyone knew but me, and everyone was making fun of me.`
`"You'll know soon enough.`
` Don't waste time thinking about it."`
`"............"`
`Ange held the key tightly.`
`Even if she didn't understand what it meant, ...it was her own key, and her big brother had told her to take good care of it.`
`With her youthful suspicion, she was scared that the witch might ask her to hand it over, saying that she'd teach her how to use it.`
`Of course, her thoughts showed up clearly on her face.`
`The witch couldn't help but laugh at that honest expression.`
`"Fear not.`
` It is impossible for anyone to steal that key from you."`
`"...No one can steal it...?"`
`"You might say that it has been imbued with magic to make it so.`
` At any rate, fear not.`
` Neither I, nor Battler, nor anyone else on this island can steal that key from you."`
`"Really...?"`
`"Yeah, really.`
` The magic won't let them."`
`The key was hanging around her neck like an ordinary necklace.`
`Ange could take it off right now if she wanted, and if an adult tried to use force, it seemed like it would be easy for them to take it away.`
`However, both her brother and the witch said that it was protected by a magic that would stop anyone from stealing it...`
`"......Does magic...`
`...really...exist...?"`
`Even the six-year-old Ange knew about the word 'magic'.`
`However, she also realized that real magic didn't exist,`
` ...and that certain kinds of magic tricks were sometimes called magic.`
`However, her brother and the witch were talking about magic itself.`
`"Yeah.`
` Magic exists."`
`"...Really...?"`
`"Maria spoke of me often, did she not?`
` She says that witches exist.`
`True, Maria had talked about that many times.`
`When they were just playing, Ange had believed her, more or less.`
`However, Ange was, in some ways, sharp for her age,`
` ...and when she heard Maria talking happily about magic, she sometimes thought that such a thing couldn't really exist.`
`"Then, ...show me."`
`"Hmm?"`
`"Show me magic!`
` Or I won't believe you...!"`
`"Hold up a sec...`
` Beato just arrived on the island, and she hasn't even gone to say hi to everyone at the mansion yet..."`
`Battler spoke as though he was trying to smooth something over.`
`When she heard that, Ange became sure that magic didn't exist after all.`
`"Magic is just a bunch of lies...!`
` I know!"`
`"Hey, stop that.`
` You'll hurt Beato's feelings..."`
`"No, it's no problem.`
` Anyone would say that upon meeting a witch.`
` Normally, I would ignore provocation from such a small child, but she is your little sister, after all.`
` Why don't we give her a special showing?"`
`"Are you sure...?"`
`"Of course I am.`
` Watch carefully, Ange."`
`"...O-Okay."`
`Though Ange had challenged the witch,`
` now that she was about to be shown magic, she looked a bit hesitant.`
`She gulped, then stared up at the witch's face.`
`The witch held out her left hand, bringing it close to Ange's face.`
`Then, she slowly spread her fingers.`
`Ange, thinking that she was about to be turned into a frog, shrank back.`
`However, after waiting a while and grinding her teeth, she realized that nothing was happening.`
`So, the part of her that had been scared began to get angry.`
`"Nothing's happening."`
`"Don't jump to conclusions.`
` I haven't used magic yet.`
` See, look carefully at my palm.`
` I'm not hiding anything, correct?"`
`Oh, so that's what she's doing...`
` Now that she finally understood, Ange checked both sides of the witch's hand.`
`"...Yeah.`
` There's nothing there."`
`"Watch closely.`
` I'll make a fist, `
`...and then stretch out my index finger."`
`She stretched out her index finger and held it right in front of Ange's eyes.`
`Ange, thinking that she'd lose the game if she took a step back, stood her ground and concentrated on the fingertip.`
`"Watch the tip of my finger closely.`
` Ready? It'll be fast."`
`The witch rapidly lifted her index finger high into the air, pointing at the heavens.`
`Just as Ange looked up to see the finger raised high, it swung down as though trying to dodge her gaze.`
`In that manner, `
`...up, down, left, right, then left again.`
`Ange, feeling as though she'd lose if she couldn't keep up with the fingertip, swung her face this way and that, looking serious.`
`Ever since she was very young, Ange had hated to lose.`
` She would take even the most trivial games seriously, determined not to lose to the adults.`
`The witch's hand moved faster and faster.`
` Ange didn't lose track of it.`
`Then, the high pointing finger was swung down all of a sudden,`
` ...the index finger curled up again, and the hand was held in a simple fist.`
`Could it be...that something was going to come out of that hand...?`
`Ange, who had suspected that this might happen, had followed the finger very closely.`
` There was no way that once-empty hand could have grabbed anything.`
`"............"`
`"Ready? I'm going to open my hand..."`
`The witch slowly opened her right fist...`
`And there...`
`"......Wha? ...What?!`
` ...How?!`
` How, Onii-chan?!"`
`The witch gave the cutely wrapped candy to Ange as a present.`
`Ange took it and desperately searched for some kind of trick on it, but it was just an everyday, ordinary candy...`
`"How?!`
` That was a trick, wasn't it, Onii-chan?!`
` Onii-chan?!!"`
`"Nope. That was magic.`
` You were watching the whole time, weren't you?"`
`"Nng, ...nnnnnnnn......!"`
`Since I was watching the whole time, ...how did it happen...?`
`Ange didn't like it, but she was unable to see how that could have been anything other than magic.`
`As the little sister furrowed her brow and bit her lower lip, her brother gently told her again that it was magic.`
`"It's about time for me to head to the mansion to pay my respects.`
` You should come along, Battler.`
` I'll suffocate if I have to go alone."`
`"You sure? Then I'll join you.`
` ...What about you, Ange?`
` Will you go back to the guesthouse?"`
`"......I-I wanna stay with you, Onii-chan."`
`She still couldn't accept it.`
` However, ...could it really be...?`
`She still looked grumpy,`
` ...but it looked like she was getting interested in this witch.`
`"Then let us go.`
` The Golden Witch returns...!"`
`"The Golden Witch's...grandchild returns, you mean."`
`"We really need to do something about that name...!"`
`The big brother and the witch really did seem close.`
`With kindred spirits like a pair of comedians, they started walking.`
`Ange held onto the corner of her brother's sleeve, trying to make sure he didn't forget about her...`
`The VIP room was filled with the sweet smell of pumpkin tea...`
`and packed with smiles and laughter.`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Simply splendid.`
` I am glad to see you in such high spirits...!"`
`"I could say the same for you.`
` What idiot said you're reaching your last years?"`
`"I just borrow a bit of cheer from you.`
` Once I return to my study, I will be little more than a withering, senile old man."`
`"Enough with your lies!`
` Give it up and swear that you'll be living it large until you're a hundred."`
`"Same here. I haven't seen you for six years, but I was surprised to see how little you'd changed."`
`"Wahahahaha, you little brat.`
` So, it seems you've learned flattery during these past six years!`
` Sorry to disappoint you, but you're hardly a fair judge in the matter.`
` I have grown quite old indeed."`
`"I'll bet a thousand yen that Kinzo's still doing great when he turns a hundred."`
`"Yeah, me too.`
` Grandfather won't be any different when he's a hundred."`
`"Wahhahahaha!`
` Don't think you'll get any more presents for complimenting me!"`
`Kinzo laughed cheerily.`
`Beato, who sat next to Battler, was also laughing merrily.`
`Ange stood all alone by the window,`
` ...staring at the others and trying to figure out what sort of relationship the witch of the portrait and her grandfather had.`
`There was a knock on the door.`
`"Is that you, Genji?`
` Come in!"`
`"...Pardon the intrusion.`
` Krauss-sama and Natsuhi-sama are here."`
`"Father...oh, and Battler-kun's here too."`
`"It has been some time, Beatrice-san.`
` Has there been any news?"`
`"I'm just the way I used to be.`
` Come on, have a seat.`
` And Ange, why are you standing by the window like that?`
` Come over here and sit down."`
`"Ange, come over here."`
`"...I'll just watch from here."`
`Ange grasped the candy she had gotten from Beato tightly,`
` and with a gaze that was still wary, she continued to stare.`
`Genji offered her a chair, but Ange just shook her head.`
`"Let her do as she pleases.`
` Come, Krauss, Natsuhi, and have a seat as well."`
`"...Is it something important?`
` I guess Ange and I should leave."`
`"Hey, if you leave, who's going to back me up here...?!`
` Kinzo, you don't mind if Battler stays, do you?"`
`"I have nothing to hide.`
` I care not."`
`However, he had called Krauss and Natsuhi to the VIP room to meet Beatrice, the Golden Witch.`
`It was hard to imagine that Kinzo wanted to have a casual conversation...`
`After Kinzo said he didn't mind, Beato also asked Battler to stay, so he decided to do so.`
`In order to avoid getting in the way of their conversation, Battler stood up from the sofa and walked over to Ange's window.`
`When the big brother finally came back to Ange, she clung to his waist, as though determined not to let him go away again.`
`"Oh, I see.`
` That must be why Ange doesn't like me."`
`"Huh? What do you mean?`
` Ange doesn't dislike you, does she?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` You really don't understand women, Battler."`
`Beato smiled at Ange, but the latter turned to look the other way...`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Even a young woman is a woman nonetheless."`
`When Beato stopped laughing, the conversation switched gears.`
`Why on earth did Kinzo summon Krauss and Natsuhi to the VIP room, and what was he going to talk about?`
` Everyone fell automatically silent.`
`"Golden Witch Beatrice,`
` each and every day, I remember the debt the Ushiromiya family owes from when it was saved from the brink of destruction."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Yeah, you'd better thank me."`
`"Well, it's actually your grandmother he's thanking."`
`"Shut up, you."`
`"No, it comes to the same thing.`
` All of that gold has been lent to the Ushiromiya family for three generations.`
` And without cost."`
`"...We truly...cannot be grateful enough."`
`"Gold bars are the same as bricks to me.`
` I had nowhere else to put them, so it was a relief to have Kinzo hold onto them."`
`"Whoa.`
` I'd like to say that just once before I die."`
`"......Is the Golden Witch...a rich person...?"`
`"Hmm?`
` Well, yeah.`
` After all, she just went and lent Grandfather 10 tons of gold."`
`"Precisely.`
` I've been borrowing it for several decades, always promising to return it someday.`
` It is a debt I will never be able to fully repay."`
`"The Head Family has never forgotten its gratitude.`
` Isn't that right, dear?"`
`"Of course.`
` If the Beatrices hadn't kindly lent it to us for three generations,`
` the Ushiromiya family would have fallen long ago.`
` Even someone as shrewd as Father couldn't have done anything without funds to start with."`
`"By now, my money is making money, and the gold that made up my original funds can sleep in peace.`
` ......Krauss,`
` do you know what I am about to say?"`
`Since the moment Krauss had been summoned here, he had guessed what Kinzo was hinting at now.`
`All things borrowed must be returned someday.`
` That day had finally come.`
`"...Yes, I understand,`
` Father."`
`"Beatrice,`
` I do not have many years ahead of me.`
` In fact,`
` ...this may be the last family conference that we will attend together."`
`"How faint-hearted you sound.`
` You must be joking."`
`Beato alone laughed.`
`She looked at Battler, so he laughed along with her, but Kinzo and the others remained silent.`
`Apparently, there existed some major concerns about Kinzo's health...`
`"Of course, I do not intend to die as soon as next year.`
` However, I don't believe I can make any certain promises about meeting you again.`
` I never make promises I cannot keep."`
`"If you say it so proudly like that, I'm in no position to disagree.`
` ...Are you serious about this?"`
`"Beatrice,`
` I want to make amends.`
` And I must do it while I am still in high spirits.`
` For that reason, I made a decision today."`
`"...What's Grandfather talking about...?"`
`"Quiet.`
` ...Grandfather is...about to talk about something very important."`
`By now, even Battler understood what Kinzo was about to propose.`
`Beato probably realized it too...`
`At one time, the Ushiromiya family had ruled the skies like an eagle, ...before being crushed by the Great Kanto Earthquake.`
`The eagle had one of its wings torn off, and it crawled in the mud, on the point of death.`
`Then, they were saved by the Golden Witch's golden miracle.`
`Under the Golden Witch's protection, the eagle had nursed its wounds for many years.`
`And now, finally, it was time for the eagle to leave the nest the witch had provided...`
`"I will return all of the gold `
`that your grandmother lent me.`
` ...Krauss, you have no objections, correct?`
` That gold did not belong to the Ushiromiya family in the first place."`
`"Of course.`
` I have no objections whatsoever."`
`"Are you sure, Krauss?`
` You're an investor, aren't you?`
` You could always do with more money, right?`
` Didn't you want Kinzo to hand the gold over to you?"`
`"Hahahaha...`
` Yes, now that you mention it, it's hard to deny what you say.`
` However, the contract was always between you and Father, and the gold was yours to begin with."`
`"My husband is the Successor, after all.`
` Just as Father rebuilt the family in one generation,`
` I am sure my husband will make the family thrive in his.`
` And this is something the two of us will do together."`
`"Hmm, well said.`
` Yes, that's the spirit."`
`"...So, letting go of 10 tons of gold leaves you with no regrets?`
` I must say, that is quite impressive.`
` What can a witch do against an opponent who cannot be swayed by the golden magic?"`
`"I will return the gold to you,`
` but the Ushiromiya family will always be supremely indebted to Beatrice, the Golden Witch."`
`"............"`
`They would return the gold once lent by the Golden Witch.`
` It was both simple and clear.`
`However, the expression worn by the Golden Witch herself was slightly lonely.`
`Ange couldn't understand why this was.`
`"...After all, if you're returning it, I cannot simply say 'I don't want it, take it back'.`
` Ah, well."`
`Beato rose from the sofa.`
`Then, she walked up to the window and looked down at the rose garden waving in the wind.`
`"Krauss,`
` I have also decided to present you and the others with my inheritance while I still live."`
`"F-Father..."`
`"When I die, you will not only be busy with the funeral, but I imagine that you will have Eva and the others at your throats over the inheritance issue.`
` If all is divided now, the funeral will be less trying for you.`
` ...Krauss, write this down.`
` And Genji, please be our secretary.`
` I will now lay out the distribution of my assets."`
`Kinzo immediately began explaining how the inheritance would be split up.`
`Battler, realizing that he shouldn't be listening in on this conversation,`
` walked over to where Beato was loitering by the window...`
`"Hey, rich person.`
` If you've got too much gold on your hands, I'd be happy to lighten the load."`
`"Gold...would be more useful if you turned it into firewood and used it to cook a stew."`
`"What's the matter?`
` You're looking a bit bored."`
`"So, this day has finally come.`
` ...I do feel a bit lonely."`
`"...You do?"`
`"My magic revived the Ushiromiya family and created Rokkenjima.`
` ...And now, it seems the Ushiromiya family no longer has any need for the power of my gold.`
` It has taken flight, leaving the nest of my magic behind."`
`"True.`
` ...That's how it's turned out."`
`"I have called Rokkenjima the witch's island,`
` ...my island."`
`"...Yeah."`
`"And now, Rokkenjima is returning the gold to me.`
` ...The day has come...for Rokkenjima to awaken from my magic."`
`"......`
`...That's true."`
`"I...knew that this would be the last game.`
` ...However, now that we've reached this point, even in a manner such as this, ...it's surprisingly painful."`
`"You're the type of person who looks totally carefree, but who's actually full of lingering attachments and regrets."`
`"The cruel and obstinate ones are usually the quickest to grow attached...and then to feel lonely."`
`"That's right.`
` That's the kind of person you are."`
`"...It was...a game for you and me."`
`"It was fun.`
` A great game you polished to perfection during those six years..."`
`"I once likened it to eternal torture for the both of us."`
`"...Eternity...is happiest when you can still believe that it's eternal.`
` But all things must end.`
` And we have to be aware of that."`
`"So, we must not avert our eyes."`
`"Just as the sun always rises,`
` there's no sun that doesn't set."`
`"............"`
`Of course, Ange didn't have the slightest idea what her brother and the witch were talking about.`
`...However, even as young as she was, she could feel that the pair had spent an incredibly long time together...`
`and that they understood each other so well that they might as well be a married couple...`
`Then, `
`Beato noticed her reaction.`
`"......Ange,`
` at one point, the two of us wove games for each other.`
` However, that time is now over.`
` This game has been made, not for our sake, but for yours."`
`They were speaking in riddles again.`
`Grasping the key that hung by her chest, Ange looked at her brother's face...`
`"We need to show you the contents of the cat box of this day.`
` ...That key I gave you is for opening it."`
`"...What do you mean...by cat box...?"`
`"He means this day."`
`"With the miracle of magic, `
`I've brought you to the day you wanted to reach so much.`
` ......You must continue telling the story of this day, as the final witch."`
`"Does that mean...that I mustn't remain here...?"`
`Ange's tone was slightly tense.`
`She understood what her brother meant, and it made her frown.`
`"Just how long have I suffered, wishing that I could return to the Rokkenjima of 1986...`
` And now, I've finally made it here!`
` So why are you chasing me out...?!`
` You said I could decide for myself!"`
`"That's right.`
` I did say that."`
`"I'm not leaving.`
` And please, stop trying to spoil me with this strange, made-up game...!`
` I want to know the truth of this day!!"`
`"She's a moody girl, be it 12 years in the future or in the past."`
`"Shut up. I didn't ask you...!`
` And what the hell do you think you're doing here...?!`
` Didn't the Golden Witch come here to perform her resurrection ceremony?!`
` Didn't you appear on the island with a crash of thunder and try to offer up 13 people as sacrifices?!`
` Why are you acting so happy and casual?!`
` It doesn't make sense!"`
`"You're the one that doesn't make sense.`
` What are you thinking?`
` Do you want me to be a murderer?"`
`"You wrote it down in a tale, sealed it in a message bottle, and threw it into the sea!`
` Two of those were discovered later on...!`
` Both of them were stories of cruel serial murders!"`
`"What a shame that only two of them made it to shore...!`
` How sad that 'Land', my greatest masterpiece, was never seen by human eyes."`
`"I've been wanting to ask this for a while, but what's up with those message bottles?"`
`"As I was working out the details for my game against you, I began creating those tales along the way.`
` Once I realized that I could create endless different tales out of the same game board, it really started to get fun...!"`
`"So, you wrote them down, hoping that I'd read them someday."`
`"Precisely!`
` They were so good, I just couldn't bear to wait for your return...!`
` Inspired by Agatha Christie, I tried sealing them in bottles and throwing them into the ocean.`
` Mysterious, don't you think?!"`
`"Don't mock me...!!!`
` Those were your plans for the crime!`
` You used the location of the hidden gold to fan up discontent between the family members...`
`as you planned your brutal serial murders...!!"`
`"Sheesh,`
` is that what I've become in the year 1998?`
` ...Well, I guess I can't blame them, *cackle*cackle*."`
`"Huh?!`
` What's with the sudden change of character...?!!`
` Is this some scheme to make me let my guard down?!`
` I'm not gonna be fooled so easily, Beatrice! Onii-chan!!`
` You want to make me surrender and say that witches exist, don't you?!`
` You think I'll fall for that...?!`
` I'll find the truth without your help!"`
`"Even though that truth is all around you right now?`
` You once called yourself Gretel, but it seems the name Mytyl would be more fitting."`
`"Enough!!!"`
`Ange tried to slap Beato's cheek.`
`However, the difference between their heights was so great that Beato dodged before the hand could reach her.`
`"Stupid...`
` Stupid...!`
` I won't accept it...`
` I'll never...acknowledge this farce as the truth...!!"`
`After Ange yelled those words, her eyes grew cloudy.`
`They cleared up almost immediately.`
` By that time, she had already gone back to her six-year-old self...`
`"......You're right, Ange.`
` This is the sin I left behind, ...and the reason for this final tale's existence."`
`".........?"`
`As Ange stared blankly, uncomprehending, Beato gently patted her head.`
`"Indeed.`
` This tale is a farce.`
` Of course it isn't the truth.`
` ...However, `
`there is something that he feels he must tell you.`
` ...Something he's so determined to convey that he went to such lengths."`
`"Beato,`
` I'm already showing her.`
` I don't want to force it on her."`
`"I see."`
`"...I don't understand what you're saying.`
` ...I'm sleepy."`
`"True.`
` We should probably go take a nap."`
`"Kinzo,`
` must I remain here longer?"`
`"My apologies, but I must ask you to stay for just a bit.`
` ...Moving on, Krauss,`
` the continued support of the Fukuin House should be viewed as your responsibility as the Ushiromiya Family Head..."`
`"...What a pain.`
` Forgive me, Battler.`
` It seems I cannot go with you.`
` ...Genji,`
` would you mind taking these two to the guesthouse?"`
`"As you wish.`
` ...Battler-sama, Ange-sama, please follow me."`
`"Thanks.`
` ...See you later, `
`Beato."`
`"Of course!`
` I have a mountain of things I wish to discuss with you.`
` And I'd like to have some time alone tonight.`
` We must act the part of a married couple every now and then...!"`
`"Wh-What do you mean, act the part of a married couple?`
` Ihihi...!"`
`Because Ange had gotten so bored, she had grown very sleepy.`
`It would probably be best for her to take a quick nap.`
`Battler walked through the windy rose garden, pulling her by the hand.`
`When he questioned their guide, Genji, ...he learned that the old servant had known beforehand of Kinzo's desire to return the gold to Beato...`
`and settle the inheritance problem early.`
`"...The Master decided to start preparations early for his final task in this world, the ending of his life."`
`"Most people don't think much about what happens after they die...`
` ...Haah.`
` Guess Grandfather just lives on a whole different scale."`
`"Today marks the start of a new flight, when the Ushiromiya family will depart from the Golden Witch's patronage."`
`"...That's true.`
` Heheh, that's a pretty cool way to say it."`
`Apparently, a grand Halloween party was to be held tonight,`
` and Gohda and the others had been ordered to start getting ready for it.`
`However, it wouldn't just be a party.`
`It would be a ceremony to mark the return of Beatrice's gold.`
`At the start of dinner, Grandfather would make the announcement,`
` and the three generations of Beatrices would be thanked for their gift to the family with a round of applause.`
`Apparently, this was what they had planned.`
`"Are we still keeping this secret from Dad and the others?"`
`"Technically, it is a secret.`
` ...However, the Master did not suddenly begin thinking in this way today.`
` He has considered this day many times over many years, and has even discussed certain matters with his children.`
` I doubt that any will be surprised to hear this night's announcement."`
`"Apparently, my old bastard's been running all over the place trying to get money for his company.`
` I guess he'll be dancing around when he hears that Grandfather's giving him his part of the inheritance early.`
` A nice present for him."`
`"I rather think the great responsibility is what will spur him on.`
` ...Ever since Rudolf-sama left the island, he has succeeded splendidly.`
` However, his success so far has been supported by the Master's wealth."`
`"...And now that he's suddenly getting his inheritance money, he'll have to keep going by his own strength alone in the future.`
` ...Heheh, that's some nice pressure for him."`
`"The siblings must have suffered for decades because of their father's excess of success and ability.`
` ...Simply having a parent who is too successful can be a great burden to a child."`
`"And tonight,`
` ...they'll be leaving the nest, truly becoming adults for the first time."`
`"It seems the Master plans to call this night a gold-returning ceremony.`
` ...However, he originally intended to call it a living funeral."`
`"Sounds pretty depressing, having a funeral while you're still alive.`
` I'll admit that calling it a day to start a new journey and leave the nest fits the Ushiromiya family much better."`
`"......Onii-chan, ...I'm sleepy..."`
`"Look, we're almost to the guesthouse.`
` Do you want to go to Mom's room?`
` Or to the cousin room?"`
`"I don't care...`
` ...I'll...sleep until dinner..."`
`Ange, still holding her brother's hand, crouched down and looked as though she was about to fall asleep.`
`Battler lifted her up and carried her.`
`As she felt the warmth and safety of her brother's back, Ange drifted off into sleep...`
`What happened that day...?`
`Just what on earth happened on October 4th and 5th, 1986?`
`Because of the massive size of the Rokkenjima Explosion Accident, the time of the explosion was known almost exactly, down to the minute.`
`That time was...`
`October 5, 24:00.`
`The sheer improbability of that round number proved that the accident had been produced by artificial means.`
`Later on, the following statements were collected from individuals who knew Ushiromiya Kinzo when he was alive.`
`During his lifetime, Ushiromiya Kinzo built a clock rigged to blow up the island at exactly 24:00.`
`This clock was apparently inside his secret study.`
` When he felt mentally cornered and wanted to think up a brilliant plan,`
` he would activate that device and use the tension of the approaching midnight to bring some flash of inspiration to him.`
`While Ushiromiya Kinzo still lived, this was only thought of as a tall tale about this eccentric man,`
` ...but the fact that the Rokkenjima Explosion Accident occurred at exactly 24:00 supported the story...`
`"...It sounds crazy."`
`"He must have hoped to gain some sort of mystical power from those short periods of madness.`
` If we call this his source of high-output mental power, the story isn't that difficult to swallow."`
`Professor Ootsuki spoke passionately.`
`Witch Hunters.`
`Enthusiasts who treat the mad fantasy surrounding Rokkenjima as their plaything.`
`Ange had no reason to love these people, who embellished the deaths of her family just for the fun of it.`
`How ironic it was to Ange, who wanted to know what happened that day,`
` that such people knew more about that island than anyone else.`
`"If someone used that device, the island would be blown away without a trace.`
` ......There would be nothing left.`
` No matter what had happened there, they could erase it."`
`"Theories that Ushiromiya Eva was the ringleader of some conspiracy sprang up very early on.`
` However, no one was able to explain how she set off such a massive explosion."`
`"And the rigged clock proves that such a thing was possible..."`
`"Correct.`
` We can theorize that Ushiromiya Eva, fully aware of the timing and expected radius of the explosion, took refuge in Kuwadorian."`
`"...To get all of the family wealth to herself,`
` she killed everyone...and used the explosion to remove all evidence..."`
`"That idea provides the most logical explanation for the Rokkenjima mystery.`
` It also conforms with the fact that Eva never spoke to anyone about the events of that day."`
`Where was that rigged clock, and how did Eva find it?`
`Several forgeries have speculated on this matter.`
` There's no need for me to waste time thinking about it.`
`Eva activated the clock device, hid in Kuwadorian to escape the blast,`
` and was therefore the only one to survive.`
`That was everything, the answer, which eloquently told the whole story.`
`...When Eva first adopted me,`
` our relationship wasn't that bad at all.`
`I asked her several times.`
`What happened that day?`
`Every single time she answered, it was to say that she didn't remember.`
`But, ...well, she must have been flustered at the time.`
`The very first time I asked, she answered like this:`
`"I can't...tell you about it."`
`It was a slip of the tongue.`
` She knew what had happened that day.`
`And she left this world without telling even a bit of the truth.`
`She sealed the truth in a cat box...`
`and left this world, taking the key with her.`
`There can be only one answer.`
`She was behind everything.`
`She got to keep all of the family wealth to herself and became super-rich.`
`And afterward, she lamented the fact that her beloved son would never inherit any of what she had created, ...and she cursed me.`
`...Just remembering that old bitch makes me want to vomit.`
`What happened that day?`
` That's what I want to know.`
`It's my only goal, ...the one reason I'm still alive.`
`However, later on, I had to come to grips with the fact that my goal was an abstract one.`
`After all, though I don't know what happened that day...`
`If it's a question of 'who' did the crime...`
`That's already clear.`
`Ushiromiya Eva.`
` She's the culprit.`
`That has never changed since the beginning.`
`That's right.`
` I'm not trying to find out what happened that day.`
`I'm trying to find out what Ushiromiya Eva did that day.`
`If I can reveal that, then I can expose Eva's evil, even though she's already dead.`
`That is...my true goal.`
`The police also suspected that the accident might be a crime, and they did investigate.`
`However, no matter how much they inspected the crater that had once been Rokkenjima, they didn't find anything at all.`
`The public and the Witch Hunters cornered Eva with several bits of circumstantial evidence, but not a single bit of physical evidence was found...`
` Though Eva was only the merest fraction of a shade away from guilty, they were unable to expose her crime...`
`My goal isn't anything as vague as learning what happened that day...`
`It's to expose the crime Ushiromiya Eva committed that day...and to have my revenge.`
`I haven't been able to expose Ushiromiya Eva's crime, so people are acting as though the events on the island were all done by some bizarre Golden Witch.`
`Defeating the Golden Witch means exposing Ushiromiya Eva's sin.`
`I won't forgive Ushiromiya Eva.`
`I'll certainly...certainly......`
`Hate her and take revenge for my family.`
`That is Ushiromiya Ange's one and only reason for living...`
`"Hahhahahaha.`
` If she knew you hated her that much, the President would probably be rolling around laughing in the next world."`
`"...Shut up.`
` I'll expose that old bitch's crime.`
` ...I won't accept that it was a perfect crime, with all traces blown away. I'll never do that."`
`"In other words, this journey of yours is a journey to take revenge for your family."`
`"Got a problem with that?"`
`"You must be joking.`
` It's great to know that you have a purpose in life."`
`"...Could you turn that off?"`
`"Oh?`
` You don't like M. Zakki?"`
`Amakusa turned the radio off.`
`The dull sound of the engine became the BGM that filled the car.`
`"Is it really so strange?`
` Fighting for revenge."`
`"Not really.`
` Out on the front, I met people who live for that reason over and over."`
`"...You've been on battlefields many times as a mercenary, right?"`
`"Well, I've seen a few."`
`"So, are people who fight to take revenge for their families...`
`strong?"`
`"No doubt about it.`
` ...Some people'll even strap bombs to themselves and commit suicide to take revenge for their families.`
` Humans are more than capable of dying for vengeance."`
`"...That's right.`
` I could do it too."`
`"Have you heard of child soldiers?"`
`"You mean kids who fight like soldiers?"`
`"That's it.`
` Kids who've lost their parents and have nowhere to go sometimes get picked up by groups of armed insurgents and become soldiers.`
` ...They get a gun thrust in their hands, and they're taught how to take revenge.`
` ...But in the end, children are expendable.`
` Anyone can be a soldier in a battlefield if they can pull a trigger."`
`"Are you trying to say that I'm like that?"`
`"Revenge can be a reason for living.`
` It can also give you the strength to become a soldier.`
` ...Like a miracle, it can turn a girl who could do nothing but sob over her parents' corpses into a soldier, almost overnight.`
` ...Nothing gives you more power than revenge."`
`"I guess so.`
` And that's what I'm like."`
`"Do you know about the child soldier problem?"`
`"No."`
`"Child soldiers who are given guns and taught how to take revenge...make that their reason for living.`
` Well, that's not exactly right.`
` It becomes their reason for firing their guns.`
` ......But revenge is something that never ends.`
` At some point, they no longer have any reason to keep shooting."`
`"...What do you mean?"`
`"They once shot for revenge.`
` But, eventually, they keep on shooting for no reason at all."`
`"You mean they forget about taking revenge?"`
`"When revenge is impossible, they eventually get tired of it and forget their original goals.`
` When that happens, they have nothing except their guns.`
` Eventually, they'll keep shooting just so they can eat."`
`"...You're saying that child soldiers who started using guns for revenge...`
`end up as bandits or something?"`
`"After all, they've never even gone to school, and they haven't been taught any useful skills as far as employment goes."`
`They only learned how to shoot guns.`
`And they were only ever praised when they killed the enemy.`
`"Eventually, your reason for living stops being revenge...and becomes the means you once used to take revenge.`
` ...It's sad, really."`
`"Are you saying that I'll eventually get tired of revenge, and...`
`...uh, what would it be in my case?"`
`"You'll get tired of exposing the truth,`
` and you'll eventually become a person who can do nothing but hate Ushiromiya Eva."`
`"Well, that's true already. Got a problem with it?"`
`"Hyahha...!`
` Come to think of it, that's right."`
`I'm not sure what Amakusa is trying to say.`
`Probably something annoying.`
`So I'm not interested.`
`"...Revenge is pointless.`
` Is that what you're trying to say?"`
`"You still have a long life ahead of you, Lady.`
` With your youth, you could do anything.`
` ...I get the feeling that this journey might be a waste of that precious youth."`
`"It's none of your business.`
` ...I've already jumped once, remember?`
` Off that huge skyscraper."`
`"And you only barely made it out of that alive."`
`"Back then,`
` I died.`
` So, I'm already a ghost.`
` And my only purpose is to expose the truth of that day, to take revenge on my family's enemy."`
`"...Sheesh.`
` That's an iron will you've got there, Lady."`
`"There's no way a flippant man like you could understand how I feel."`
`After that, Amakusa was forced to shut his mouth.`
`He shrugged, but Ange didn't see.`
`Even so, Amakusa spoke once more.`
`"On the first day we started this journey,`
` ...you said something.`
` You said you wanted to know what happened on that island that day."`
`"It's the same now.`
` What's changed?"`
`"Now, you're saying that you want to know what happened on that island that day `
`so you can expose Ushiromiya Eva's crime."`
`"And isn't that exactly the same?"`
`"...Well, that's true, but..."`
`"I'm tired, so I'll sleep now.`
` Would you mind staying quiet for a bit?`
` Tell me when we get there."`
`"Roger that."`
`I wasn't particularly tired, really.`
`I just said that because I didn't like talking about this.`
`"Don't become one.`
` A child soldier."`
`Ange, who had decided to feign sleep, ignored him.`
`But Amakusa kept talking.`
` He wanted to make sure she heard at least this much.`
`"You started on a journey to learn the truth.`
` It's becoming more and more a journey of revenge.`
` ...A journey to have revenge by exposing the truth.`
` But, as you know, there's nothing left on Rokkenjima.`
` There aren't even any traces left.`
` ...Exposing the truth might not be a picnic."`
`...I know what Amakusa's trying to say.`
`The police searched the scene so thoroughly just after the crime, and even they weren't able to find any physical evidence proving that Ushiromiya Eva was the culprit.`
`And a full 12 years have passed since then.`
`...If the truth could be discovered by a girl like me, waving wads of cash around to pick up a bit of info from those who were somehow related to the incident,`
` then someone would have exposed the truth long ago.`
`I might not be able to reach the truth.`
`If so, ......then my first desire, my desire to expose the truth, will probably fade away.`
`After that, only my hatred for Eva will remain.`
`Just like those child soldiers, who forget their original purpose and live just to shoot.`
`I'll forget my original purpose...and live just to hate.`
`I'll do nothing but despise Ushiromiya Eva, ...but my goal, exposing the truth for revenge, will be gone, `
`...so hating Ushiromiya Eva will become my whole life.`
`...Is there any difference between shooting for revenge and shooting to live?`
`When you pull the trigger, someone dies either way.`
`And what about my case?`
`Is there any difference between hating Eva as I expose the truth...and hating Eva after I've given up?`
`There's no difference.`
`In the end, whether I find the truth or not, I'll just keep on cursing Eva, over and over, until I die.`
`......What a crappy life.`
`But now, ...that's all I have left.`
`Ushiromiya Eva stole my family.`
`So, I'll take revenge.`
` ...By exposing her crimes and showing the world.`
`...My consciousness was slowly drifting away into sleep...`
`Why is Onii-chan showing me such a bizarre Rokkenjima...?`
`Is this supposed to be the truth?`
`Enough with this farce.`
`Why is even Onii-chan trying to hide the truth from me?`
`I'm trying to find it so that I can avenge him and the others.`
`...Or would Onii-chan say the same thing as Amakusa?`
`That revenge is meaningless, so I should stop?`
`Is that why...he's speaking in riddles, trying to make everything more confusing...?`
`...That's none of his business.`
`I'm not just trying to take revenge for their sakes.`
`I'm doing it for my sake too.`
`After all, that's the only reason I'm still alive.`
`Taking revenge...is my reason to live.`
`.........`
`I don't have a clue...`
`what Onii-chan is thinking.`
`Outside, the rain had started to pour down hard.`
`However, inside the cousin room, it was loud and cheery.`
`It could have been raining spears, and no one would have paid any attention.`
`"Ihihiii!!`
` Full house!!`
` Take that!"`
`"Whoa.`
` You weren't bluffing...!"`
`The cousins were all bursting with energy, sitting in a circle on the bed.`
`"And I thought Battler always had crap in his hands every time he acted tough...!"`
`"Of course, I've been losing all this time just to make you think that!`
` Ushiromiya Battler, the man who loses strategically to win in the end! Ihihi!"`
`"Uu-, Battler's incredible...!`
` All my coins have disappeared again."`
`"I'll give you some of mine.`
` Let's crush Battler together, okay?!"`
`With just a deck of cards, the cousins could enjoy themselves for hours and hours.`
`They were so engrossed that the occasional thunderbolt hardly even registered as static in the background.`
`"I'm starting to get hungry.`
` I wonder if dinner's ready yet."`
`"Who knows.`
` It should be ready soon.`
` Gohda-san and the others really went all out for tonight."`
`"Heheh, which means we've got a lot to look forward to.`
` Is this to celebrate my long-awaited return?"`
`"I heard from Shannon just now that it's going to be a Halloween party.`
` They'll set up a buffet in the hall.`
` Sounds incredible."`
`"A Halloween party?!`
` Incredible, incredible, uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Hmm?`
` Yeah, who is it?"`
`There was a knock, the door opened, and Ange was there.`
`She had been sleeping in her parents' room.`
`"Hey, Ange!`
` So, you woke up."`
`"Umm, they said it's time for dinner, so we have to go to the mansion.`
` They said to get ready."`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Food, fooood!!`
` I'm hungry!!"`
`Perhaps because she was the hungriest, Maria celebrated more vigorously than anyone else.`
`She jumped up happily and hopped off the bed.`
`As the others all clambered off the bed and started putting their shoes on, Kyrie and Rudolf came into view.`
`"Hey, brats.`
` Time for food, so get ready."`
`"It looks like today will be extra special.`
` I can't wait to see it."`
`"Uu-!! I know!`
` It's a Halloween party!"`
`"...A Halloween party?"`
`"KIhhihihihihi!`
` I know, and Ange doesn't.`
` Kihhihihihi."`
`"Mom, what's a Halloween party?"`
`"Who knows?`
` We'll have to go and see for ourselves."`
`"Everyone ready?`
` It's about time to go."`
`"Is everyone here?`
` Please follow me."`
`"Maria, over here.`
` Your collar's crooked."`
`"Ah, I'm starving.`
` The food is the best part of these family conferences.`
` Are you starving too, Ange-chan?"`
`Eva smiled at Ange.`
`"...Yeah.`
` I'm starving."`
`"Ange.`
` That's 'I'm hungry', right?"`
`"*giggle* Don't worry about it.`
` Yeah, I'll bet you're starving.`
` My stomach's rumbling too."`
`"Okay, let's get out of here.`
` Looks like the wind's blowing hard outside.`
` Make sure you don't lose your umbrellas."`
`"Everyone, please take an umbrella."`
`"Here's your umbrella, Ange-chan."`
`"Thanks, Aunt Eva."`
`"*giggle*`
` ...Ah, girls really are so cute.`
` Come over to play at your aunt's house one of these days.`
` It's a promise, okay?"`
`"...It looks like Aunt Eva's taken a liking to Ange."`
`"Yep.`
` Apparently, Mother really wanted a daughter."`
`"Ah, I've heard that too.`
` I think she adored me too, when I was little."`
`"My Mama said she really wanted a son, uu-!"`
`"If your kid grows up happily, it doesn't matter if they're a boy or a girl.`
` Maria is my precious, precious gift from God."`
`When they got outside, the wind was fairly strong.`
`Eva, who had really hit it off with Ange, offered to share an umbrella with the little girl.`
`It was hard to tell what they were chatting so excitedly about, but they seemed to be getting along splendidly already.`
`Battler opened his umbrella as he watched this.`
`His little sister was cute when she clung to him, but she was just as cute and adorable when looking up at someone else with a happy smile.`
`The wind and rain were strong, but even this must have been the perfect spice to heighten their anticipation of the coming meal...`
`Thanks to some festive decorations, the main hall had been remade into the scene of a Halloween party.`
`The Ushiromiya family always took meals in the dining hall.`
`This was the first time I'd ever seen a buffet-style party set up in the main hall.`
`"Yo, Battleeer!`
` Hey, Maria! Long time no see...!"`
`"Beato!!`
` Happy Halloween!`
` Trick-or-treat...!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` I have some candy for you, but now is not the time.`
` After all, it's just before a meal."`
`"*giggle*`
` Thank you, Beatrice-san.`
` I see you're looking as beautiful as ever."`
`"You too, Rosa!`
` You certainly don't look old enough to be a mother.`
` Wahaha!"`
`"Have you been drinking?`
` Your ears are looking pretty red there."`
`"Hmm?`
` Well, after you left, uhihi-!`
` Kinzo said he'd bought this rare drink, so I couldn't help but sample a bit...!`
` Wahahahahaha!"`
`"And this coming from a person who tells little kids not to eat candy before a meal..."`
`"Pardon me.`
` Beatrice-sama, the Master is calling for you."`
`I saw Kinzo beckoning from over by the portrait.`
`"Good grief.`
` When it comes to ceremonies, that man is always so obsessed with form."`
`"It's probably about that ceremony for the gold's return.`
` This is a huge turning point for the Ushiromiya family.`
` You'd better go and play along."`
`"It does make one feel a bit lonely though."`
`"This won't change the fact that you're the Ushiromiya family alchemist."`
`"Perhaps.`
` Then I'll be back shortly.`
` See you later, okay?`
` According to Genji, today's party has a bit of a theme to it.`
` You'd better look forward to it...!"`
`"You make it sound like you did any of the work."`
`"Wahhahahaha, you're another one who obsesses too much over details...!`
` Later!"`
`"...Onii-chan, is something going to happen today?`
` Is it a special day...?"`
`It looked as though even Ange had picked up on that much.`
`She seemed to be getting tense for no reason.`
`"This is a special day for the Ushiromiya family.`
` But it doesn't have anything to do with you personally, so you should just relax."`
`"Okay.`
` ...Ah, that's right. Hey, hey, did you know?`
` I just heard a huge secret from Aunt Eva...!`
` Even Maria onee-chan doesn't know, but I'll tell you!"`
`"Ooh?`
` So, what's this secret?"`
`"Okay, okay!`
` I heard that if you get an almond in yours, you win...!"`
`"Win?`
` Is this like a lottery or something?"`
`"Hmmmmmmmmmm...`
` Anyway, if you get an almond, you win!"`
`Ange puffed out her cheeks.`
` Apparently, she wanted to be praised for sharing this exciting secret.`
`But just knowing that almonds win doesn't really explain much.`
`"Okay, got it.`
` Thanks for letting me in on that major secret."`
`"Nnnnnnng, you're mean, Onii-chan!`
` And I even told you my secret!"`
`Ange, her cheeks still puffed out, headed back to where Aunt Eva was.`
`They really are getting along well.`
` Well, I guess I have no problem if it's her aunt.`
`If it was some guy from her class, I don't care if they're in elementary school, it's not happening!`
` No playing with the opposite sex without Onii-chan's approval!`
`At that moment, Genji-san's voice rang out.`
`The chatter gradually subsided, and the rain outside once again became apparent.`
`"Ladies and gentlemen, I ask for your silence."`
`Silence filled the room.`
`All of the relatives seemed vaguely aware that tonight's festivities consisted of more than a Halloween party.`
`Battler already knew.`
`This was a ceremony to mark the return of the gold, from Kinzo to Beatrice, which had been borrowed for so many years.`
`Now, that fact was being announced by Kinzo himself.`
`He spoke of how this gold had not only restored the Ushiromiya family, but brought it to a level of wealth it had never before experienced.`
` He spoke of how he would finally return this gold to Beatrice, the one who had saved the Ushiromiya family.`
`Kinzo personally handed an ingot, decorated with a bright red ribbon, to Beatrice.`
`"......This is the debt we owe to three generations of Beatrice, the Golden Witch.`
` The Ushiromiya family will never forget it."`
`"Sheesh.`
` If you've nowhere to put it, I'll be happy to take it off your hands."`
`"...Beatrice-sama."`
`"N-Nnng, *cough*cough*."`
`It was hard to imagine Beato, of all people, getting admonished by Genji.`
` I couldn't help but laugh.`
`"I am Beatrice, the Ushiromiya family alchemist.`
` Tonight, I acknowledge the end of the loan contract for the 10 tons of gold.`
` ...Now, several decades following my grandmother's generation,`
` the time has come for the eagle that lost one wing to fly once more.`
` I will watch over that eagle, and I pray for its prosperity in all generations to come."`
`Applause filled the hall.`
`Though she'd managed to make such a dignified speech for once, as soon as it was over, she stuck her tongue out and leered at us.`
`I guess that's about the limit to how long Beato can stay serious.`
`"By passing her name on through the generations, Beatrice, the Golden Witch, may live for thousands of years.`
` Therefore, even her descendants shall be Beatrice, and all shall be alchemists to this family.`
` The descendants of the Ushiromiya family will praise Beatrice for her gratitude forevermore, and this will be passed on through the generations.`
` ...This family will always be indebted to Beatrice, and she will always be our family, tied by a noble bond."`
`"...Let those who acknowledge this show their recognition with their applause."`
`After Genji's words, the relatives all looked at each other, then started applauding at once.`
`"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.`
` ...Beatrice,`
` you are a member of the Ushiromiya family.`
` And that is a bond more sacred than one of blood."`
`"Wahaha, of course lending money is more important than being a blood relation."`
`"...Beatrice-sama."`
`"Nngyhh, nnn...!"`
`After that, Kinzo's longwinded speech continued.`
`Tonight, Kinzo would retire as the Ushiromiya Family Head.`
`Then, he announced that he would reveal the distribution of his inheritance.`
`A stir of excitement spread across the siblings in money trouble when they heard that they wouldn't have to wait for Kinzo's death to get their shares.`
`"I am aware that each of you is in trouble with money.`
` This should be enough to resolve all of those problems.`
` ...But do not grow complacent.`
` This is my inheritance, given to you before my death.`
` In the past, though I have been strict, I have always watched over you."`
`"However, beginning tonight, your father will cease to provide support of that kind.`
` ...I shall watch on as you take flight, as though watching down upon you from the heavens.`
` No longer will I interfere.`
` ...You may live however you please."`
`"...D-Dad..."`
`"Father..."`
`"We understand...`
` ...We will certainly...take flight on our own."`
`"Here and now, all of us siblings swear to work together...`
`to make the Ushiromiya family even more prosperous."`
`"That's right...!`
` If we stick together, nothin' can stand in our way...!"`
`Hideyoshi laughed, but Genji admonished him.`
`However, he could understand why they were so happy.`
`...So far, the siblings had quarreled ruthlessly over the inheritance.`
`However, this evening,`
` ...the inheritance had been neatly split apart, and they no longer had any need to scheme for money.`
`In other words, the siblings no longer had any reason to squabble with each other anymore.`
`On the contrary, this was a time for them to join hands and help each other become more and more prosperous.`
`Eva and Rosa were sniffling, with tears in their eyes.`
` ...And so was Rudolf.`
`Perhaps now, ...despite their ages,`
` ...they had finally left the nest for real.`
`Tonight, the eagles of the Ushiromiya family would leave Rokkenjima, the nest weaved from the witch's magic, and go their separate ways.`
` With their own power and determination.`
`It made Kinzo think.`
`If only I had done this from the start...`
`...If he had settled the inheritance problem himself, there would have been no need for his children to quarrel at all.`
`Instead, he had acted in a sullen manner and left the problem to them, `
`which had resulted in their strained relationships.`
`Yes.`
` It was all his responsibility.`
`And now, the intertwining bonds had been released.`
`It was as though an invisible rope had been wrapped around Kinzo's body.`
`That rope was now gone, and he felt a sense of release he hadn't experienced for many years...`
`The four siblings stepped forward, and before Kinzo, they swore to all support Krauss, the new Head, and lead the family to greater prosperity.`
`Their faces sparkled with an unexpected youthfulness.`
`It was only natural.`
` After all, none of the four had made such a natural-feeling promise since the time they were kids.`
`As the vibrancy of their youth returned to them, the siblings made a promise once again.`
`When Krauss finished his announcement, a friendly applause filled the hall.`
`The cousins...`
`and the servants too...`
`...joined in on the applause that continued on and on.`
`Ange...watched this, dumbfounded.`
`...The four siblings were supposed to have quarreled with each other constantly since they were kids.`
`And they were supposed to have pointlessly locked swords with Kinzo's inheritance as their goal, their worries over money spurring them on.`
`...Thanks to this ceremony, even the world of 'truth', the world I acknowledge, ...has been rewritten.`
`Were they actually friendly towards each other, or did they quarrel all the time like I believe?`
` It doesn't matter.`
`...Either way, right here, right now, all of those problems have been resolved.`
`I mustn't believe.`
` ...This is just...Onii-chan's farce.`
`Even though I knew that fact,`
` ...when I watched Dad and the others hugging each other, with teary smiles on their faces, ...I couldn't help but feel something warm welling up in my eyes.`
`"I won't believe...`
` ...This is all...Onii-chan's farce..."`
`"What will you have to see...what will you have to hear...`
`before you'll let yourself believe...?"`
`"...Red.`
` ......If you say it with the red truth..."`
`"Is everything that can't be said in red a lie?"`
`"...I won't believe...`
` ...This is...just..."`
`Ange looked at the floor and fell silent.`
`As the Game Master, Battler was able to use the red truth.`
`However, that rule only exists on a witch's game board.`
`In the world of Humans, red truth...doesn't exist.`
`People see things, hear things,`
` ...and when they believe that something is worth believing, they accept it as a red truth.`
`Unless Ange accepts it, no kind of truth can become truth.`
`Battler wanted her to realize this.`
`There was no point in using the red truth, a rule of this game, to force the truth on her.`
`Ange would have to use her own power, her own heart...`
`To accept the truth as truth.`
`The decision was Ange's.`
`No one could force her to decide either way.`
`So, there was nothing wrong with Ange declaring this scene to be a farce.`
`But if so, ...then what about the hot tears dripping down Ange's face?`
`...Ange would have to think that through herself, without anyone telling her...`
`After one sniffle and a rub of her eyes, Ange let the six-year-old version of herself take control of her piece.`
`What followed was a harmonious, fun stretch of time.`
`Beautifully adorned dishes were brought in one after another, and champagne corks were loosened with pleasant sounds.`
`Several small tables were set here and there, each with its own theme.`
`That was where the fun lay in this stand-up buffet party, as the guests wandered from table to table, pondering what they should eat first.`
`This sort of performance was where Gohda's genius shone through.`
` The hotel that let him go should've regretted ever having done so.`
`Of course, a stand-up buffet would probably be a tiring affair for the middle-aged.`
`So, chairs had been set up as well.`
`However, each time a new dish was brought into the hall, they could get up to look, wandering through the tables however they pleased.`
`This way, they could each bump into a new group of people, then mingle elsewhere when that group melted apart.`
`People are interesting.`
` As the members in each group changed, so did the topic of conversation.`
`The bustling Halloween party played out like a colorful kaleidoscope.`
`The origami chains decorating the walls brought back youthful memories.`
`Those would help anyone enjoy themselves like they were kids again...`
`Even to Ange, it was like a dream.`
`She chatted happily with her cousins.`
`She also chatted with her aunts and uncles.`
`Beato showed her several tricks that she called magic.`
`Maria said they were magic, Ange said they were tricks, and the night grew even more lively.`
`The two young girls were so fired up that the adults decided to show some tricks they knew, shocking both of the kids utterly.`
`Eventually, they each started showing tricks to the others, asking if they'd ever seen this one or that one before,`
` and it became a party of magic, just perfect for Halloween.`
`In addition to magic tricks, several quizzes, riddles and games popped up, reminding everyone of their childhood days.`
`Even the servants who were serving food got dragged into the groups, and the whole hall was filled with chatter.`
`To Ange, young as she was, every single magic trick, quiz, and riddle was an entirely new experience.`
`They stimulated her intellectual curiosity, and she couldn't contain her excitement.`
`Add in the wide variety of delicious foods and drinks she could choose from, and it was like being in a dream.`
`Ange felt a floaty sensation, as though she was walking on a cloud...`
`"Ange, ...did you drink some of this?!`
` This is Daddy's drink!"`
`"...I wanted to try some adult grape juice too.`
` So it's okay."`
`"Your face is looking a little red there.`
` Are you feeling all right?"`
`"She only had a bit, so I think she'll be fine..."`
`"...I'll be fine.`
` I'm not a kid...`
` ...*hic*..."`
`"*giggle*`
` Ange-chan, drink this one, okay?`
` That stuff your dad drinks is nasty, so don't try any more, got it?"`
`"That's right!`
` If you drink bad stuff, you'll end up as a bad adult too. Ihihi!"`
`"I'm not gonna be a bad adult!`
` I'm gonna be a princess!"`
`"That's right.`
` Ange is our princess."`
`"Yep.`
` She's our family's princess."`
`"I agree.`
` You'd better come over to my house to play sometime...!`
` We'll have lots of fun!"`
`"Okay.`
` Thanks, Aunt Eva...!"`
`Everyone's being really nice.`
`It almost feels like I've become a real princess.`
`I feel so great, I could almost believe that this whole celebration was being held for my sake.`
`Battler stood outside that group of people.`
` As he watched Ange smiling happily from the distance, he smiled too.`
`"...When she smiles like that, she really lives up to her name.`
` It's so sad."`
`"I agree.`
` It really is a smile fit for an angel."`
`"I hope that smile comes from the real Ange...and not just the piece."`
`"...Even if it doesn't, she's watching this.`
` And she can think it through herself."`
`"This game between you and Ange really is overflowing with affection.`
` So much that it's irritatingly slow for me."`
`"And what's wrong with that?`
` There's no one to get in her way.`
` No obstacles or tactics or anything else to worry about."`
`"That's right.`
` This game...is no longer a battle."`
`"Now that you mention it, this is cleaning up.`
` ...Cleaning up after our game."`
`"......I'll never be able to make up for the sin I did to her...through my careless actions."`
`"We have to take responsibility for our game.`
` We'll make up for our sins together.`
` ...That's why we're showing Ange this final game."`
`"Do you think...that Ange will be able to use that key the right way...?"`
`"...Of course, I've thought about forcibly dragging her in the direction we think is right."`
`"Such an attempt would probably have been meaningless.`
` ...When you're forced to make a decision, it's hard to accept that it was truly a correct one, no matter how much time passes."`
`"Exactly.`
` ...Ange has to think and choose for herself.`
` Even if she doesn't make the decision we view as the correct one, ...I think we should respect it."`
`"...Hmmm.`
` ...You are the Game Master.`
` I cannot argue with you anymore.`
` I will simply watch on and enjoy this night."`
`"This game is really significant for Ange.`
` But for us, it's kind of like a party after the show."`
`"It's almost time.`
` But, are you sure?`
` Ange might get the wrong idea again, right?"`
`"It'll be fine.`
` In fact, this is necessary.`
` ...Just like how you appeared in the way you did.`
` And everyone else too."`
`"......Hmmm.`
` Then let us enjoy this final celebration with the others.`
` After all, all of them have acted their parts so well in this long game."`
`That instant, the sound of someone clapping for attention rang out.`
`"Your attention, everyone.`
` Please gather...And now, for today's special event...!"`
`Gohda had been the one clapping.`
` Everyone gathered together, wondering what was going on.`
`On the serving cart in front of him was a large, sliced, chocolate cake.`
`"As the highlight of tonight's Halloween party, I have prepared this Sachertorte for you all.`
` As you can see, it was made specially for the Ushiromiya family, and bears the crest of the One-Winged Eagle in chocolate!"`
`The stupendous cake drew a gasp of admiration from all present.`
`"What a splendid cake...!`
` A perfect highlight for the party."`
`"Oh, no.`
` It's not just the cake.`
` Tonight's cake has a little secret.`
` ...Master, I ask that you explain that secret to everyone!"`
`"Very well.`
` This is a bit of a game.`
` One slice of this cake will be used to select the winner."`
`"It's got an almond in it...!"`
`Ange shouted happily.`
` Kinzo looked at her and nodded.`
`"In just one slice of this cake, there is a single almond.`
` The one who chooses that piece shall become tonight's king."`
`"Whoo!`
` It's been a long time since I played the king game...!"`
`"I'm guessing the subject matter was a bit different when you played it..."`
`"Hahhahahahahahaha.`
` So, what happens to the person who becomes the king?"`
`"The king gets to name one wish.`
` Then, we shall all try to grant it together."`
`"Oooh!`
` Sounds interesting...!"`
`"Uu-.`
` Kings are boys.`
` Girls can't be kings."`
`"If a girl wins, they get to become the princess."`
`"The almond!`
` The one with the almond wins!`
` Right? Right?!"`
`"Ahahahaha, that's right.`
` You're incredible, Ange."`
`"In times like this, luck can tell you somethin' about a man.`
` Can't let myself lose now!"`
`"Hold up there.`
` Let's let the smallest kids choose first."`
`"Good idea.`
` Ange-chan, you can go first."`
`"Hey, you're the big cousin now, Maria!`
` Let Ange-chan go first."`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!`
` But what if Ange wins, uu-!"`
`"I am gonna win!`
` The almond wins, the almond wins!"`
`"It seems we old fogies must hope that leftovers are lucky today."`
`"If we're going by age, I guess that means Kinzo's last."`
`"Wahhahahahaha, but weren't you a thousand years old?"`
`"N-Nooooooooo!!"`
`Everyone burst out laughing.`
` Her real age was unknown, but she claimed to be 19 years old.`
`In front of Ange lay a large cake, split into several pieces.`
`Just one of those pieces was the winner.`
`"Well then, Ange-sama,`
` which piece would you like?`
` Whichever you choose, it will be ever so delicious."`
`"No way.`
` I only want the winning one."`
`"Well then, you'll have to try and guess right on the first shot.`
` Go ahead, pick one."`
`Battler pushed Ange's small back towards the table with the cake.`
`"......Which one...should I take...?"`
`The chocolate cake was cut into 15 pieces.`
`...I wanna pick the one with the almond and become the princess!`
`One of them has an almond. Which could it be...?`
`I get to choose first, ...but it sort of feels unfair.`
`I mean, it is, isn't it?`
` My chances of getting the right one are one in 15.`
` There's no way I'll get it.`
`And then, when Maria onee-chan goes after me, she has a one in 14 chance of picking the winner.`
` The next person has a one in 13 chance, then a one in 12 chance, ...and the last person...will win for sure??`
`"Onii-chan, this isn't fair...!`
` It's harder for the person who goes first...!"`
`Everyone laughed.`
` Apparently, there was something wrong with my calculations, but I still didn't like it.`
`"Then let us start this contest of luck with Ange-sama.`
` Please, feel free to make your selection...!"`
`"...Okay!`
` Okay...!!"`
`If I have to pick one out of so many, there's no way I'll win.`
`...But for some reason, tonight, it feels like I might actually win after all.`
`I have no reason for feeling this way, but when I'm in a good mood, Lady Luck always brings me fortune.`
`"Have you decided yet?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......I've decided.`
` This one's...the winner."`
`I concentrated on my fingertip...and pointed at one of the 15 slices.`
`The slice I chose was...`
`"...This one!"`
`"This one? Are you sure?"`
`"I've made up my mind.`
` I want this one...!"`
`When he asked me whether I was sure, I felt a little uneasy.`
`Still, at times like this, it's better to stick with your instincts.`
`It was one of the few bits of philosophy that this young girl had learned from her few life experiences.`
`Gohda took the chosen slice, put it on a plate with a fork, and handed it to Ange.`
`"I go next!!`
` Uu-uu-, which should I take?!"`
`It was Maria's turn next.`
` She was excited, determined to be the winner.`
`I walked away from that group, all by myself.`
`...I was struck by a temptation to quickly cut the cake open and check for an almond inside.`
`However, I stopped myself.`
`If I check my piece first, my chance of winning is one in 15.`
`However, if I wait for some other people to check their slices, then when I see that they've lost, my chances will go up, if only slightly.`
`In other words, instead of searching for the almond right away,`
` my chances will go up if I wait for some other people to lose.`
`But if someone picks a winner while I'm sitting around here, the chances of my slice being a winner will go to zero.`
` It'll be tough to calculate the right moment.`
`I need to wait just long enough for as many losers to show up as possible.`
` My chances of winning are highest if I can check my piece immediately before someone else wins.`
`Yeah, that's the trick to winning this game!`
`......`
`......???`
`What a strange thought.`
` ...It feels like I'm missing something??`
`Even though no one else can touch the cake that's sitting in front of me...`
`The almond inside it will appear or disappear depending on whether or not the other people win or lose.`
`......??`
`I was in such a good mood that I felt dizzy, and I couldn't figure out what was wrong with my theory.`
`But I did realize that something was strange.`
`...There is always just one truth inside a cat box.`
`No matter what happens outside the box, ...it shouldn't be able to shake the truth inside.`
`And yet, ...I'm being shaken about by events outside the cat box, trying to use those to change the way I observe the box's contents.`
`............`
`I don't even know what I'm saying.`
`Another me inside me is trying to say that, ...but it's too hard for me to understand.`
`I feel like I'm drifting...`
`I got so cheery and excited that, even though I'm not sleepy, my mind feels hazy.`
`Maybe it's 'cause I drank Dad's adult drink...`
`In the end, even though I chose the first piece, I decided to check it last.`
`After I've seen that everyone else has lost, my chances of winning will be 100%.`
`...I tried to find the contradiction in my thinking, but I didn't really get it, so I stopped.`
`It's much better to have a 100% chance than a one in 15 one, so I decided to bet on that.`
`I couldn't wait to open this precious treasure chest,`
` but I waited for everyone else to choose their pieces and check them.`
`"How is it going?`
` Has anyone found a winner?"`
`"Uu-!`
` Mine didn't have one."`
`"I lost too.`
` Guess I'll have to give up on being the princess...!"`
`"Even if you lose, this Sachertorte really is beautiful and delicious.`
` It's such a good decoration, it's almost a shame to eat it."`
`"How about you?`
` Got the almond?"`
`"No, not me either.`
` What about you, Hideyoshi nii-san?"`
`"Mine's a loser too.`
` Looks like I've used up all my luck with my company and my wife."`
`"What exactly do you mean by that?"`
`"What about you, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"I'm checking it now.`
` Games like this can truly can be fun, every now and then."`
`"Indeed.`
` Sometimes, a simple test of luck, without any strategy or tactics, can be quite entertaining.`
` What about you, Beato?"`
`"Where's the liar who said leftovers would be lucky?!`
` Grrrrrrrr...!"`
`"What about you, Ange?`
` Was there an almond in yours?"`
`"I'm checking now..."`
`"Oh, you still haven't touched yours?"`
`I had been following my own personal probability theory,`
` but I didn't think I could explain it well to Onii-chan, so I didn't mention it to him.`
`I wonder if there's an almond in here.`
`If I win, I'll be tonight's princess.`
`...I'll be happy if I win, but even if I don't, it'll still be a really fun night, so that's okay.`
`It got put on hold when this cake game started, but before then, everyone was having a lot of fun trading tricks, quizzes, and riddles.`
`This game is fun too, but I want to play like that again soon.`
`......Huh?`
`"What's up, Ange?`
` ......Oh?"`
`I lifted up that tiny thing with my fork and stared at it, then showed it to my brother.`
`"This...is an almond, right...?"`
`"Wh-Whoa!!`
` Ange got it!`
` That's awesome...!"`
`At the same time, a stir rose up in the other corner of the room.`
`"I got one, I won...!"`
`"Hoh!`
` So Eva won...!"`
`"My, my!`
` Congratulations, Eva-sama...!!"`
`"That's wrong!!`
` I won!`
` Mine has the almond!!"`
`I held the almond high and shouted across the room.`
`The crowd around Eva split, and everyone stared at me, surprised.`
`I was surprised too.`
` The thing in her hand was, without a doubt, an almond...`
`"What the heck...?`
` What's going on here...?"`
`"Gohda.`
` There seem to be two almonds, ...so are they both winners?"`
`"But...that shouldn't have..."`
`"Does this mean that one of the two winners made a mistake...?"`
`"Ange-sama's is clearly an almond.`
` ...How about your end, Kanon-kun?"`
`"Eva-sama's is clearly an almond."`
`"Hohhohohohohoho.`
` Then it seems that they both win."`
`"......Master."`
`"Heheheheheheh...!`
` What an odd occurrence.`
` What's all this, Gohda?"`
`"Ah, umm, ...well, ...it seems we've had a little mistake...`
` Uh, ...perhaps they should do rock, paper..."`
`"Come now, don't be stingy.`
` It just means that two almonds have appeared to signify the queen and the princess."`
`"Precisely.`
` Let's have them both be winners."`
`"Ah, well, but..."`
`Gohda was hesitant.`
`Actually, he had prepared a single special dessert for the king.`
`It had been decorated in a way that made it hard to split for two people.`
` So, it wasn't convenient for there to be two kings.`
`When Eva heard Gohda mumbling something to this effect, she shrugged and laughed.`
`"In that case, let's have Ange-chan be the princess."`
`"The princess?`
` I'm the princess...?!"`
`"I'll be your attendant.`
` That works, right?"`
`Of course it worked.`
`Ange had been worried that Eva would be declared the winner, since she had spoken up first.`
`So, she hadn't even dreamed that Eva would give it up to her.`
`"But, are you sure...?`
` You won too."`
`"It's okay. I get to be your attendant.`
` Come, princess.`
` What wish do you want granted...?`
` Let's hear it."`
`"I've...already chosen my wish..."`
`"Oh.`
` And what is it?`
` Won't you tell your aunt?"`
`I want this fun time to keep on going.`
` ...Forever.`
`The young me spoke for the desire in my heart.`
`"...Wh-What we were doing before this was fun, so I'd like to keep doing it!"`
`I get the feeling that the nuance has changed.`
`Still, that was unmistakably my wish.`
`"What we were doing before this?`
` ...Oh, you mean those tricks and quizzes?"`
`"Yeah!"`
`"Then let's do this.`
` Listen up, everyone.`
` This is an order from your princess.`
` Remember how much fun we were having earlier?`
` Let's all entertain Ange-chan with tricks and quizzes."`
`"Hold up there.`
` I've already used up all my magic tricks."`
`"Then let's do quizzes and riddles."`
`"So, we just need to entertain Ange-chan with quizzes?"`
`"We can all present quizzes for our princess to enjoy."`
`"I see.`
` Understood."`
`"Wahahaha!`
` Yes, how intriguing.`
` Then, Ange, let us do it this way.`
` Everyone will give you a quiz or a riddle, and you can try to solve them.`
` Each time you succeed, I will give you a medal."`
`"A medal?"`
`"He probably means some sort of commemorative medallion.`
` If you get a lot of puzzles right, you'll get a lot of medals."`
`"Hohohohohoho.`
` Just gathering medals is a tad boring, don't you think?"`
`"Yes.`
` Depending on the number of medals you collect, I shall give you a fantastic present...!`
` Well, do you suddenly feel fired up?!"`
`"It sounds amazing.`
` So, there's even a prize...!"`
`"*giggle*`
` Isn't that great, Ange?"`
`"...Y-Yeah...!"`
`Everyone gathered around me, smiling, as they thought about what sort of puzzle they'd give.`
`They're all thinking about me, so that they can play with me.`
`Just the feel of having that all to myself almost made me explode with joy at becoming the princess.`
`I became the Halloween party princess,`
` and the tournament of quizzes and riddles just for me began.`
`It looks like I get a medal for each puzzle I get right.`
`If I get a lot, I'm supposed to get a wonderful prize from Grandfather.`
`Okay, here I go.`
`"Who should I start with?"`
`"I don't think it matters.`
` Start with whomever you like."`
`"I'd better think up a killer puzzle while I have the chance."`
`"Maria, didn't you have a quiz book in your bag?"`
`"Uu-! I do!`
` Kihihihihihi, I'm gonna give Ange a nasty one...!"`
`Maria onee-chan laughed with an evil smile.`
`Looks like everyone's going to try and bully me.`
` I'm sure they'll think up some really hard questions.`
`"Don't worry, I'll lend a hand."`
`"Really...?"`
`"Of course.`
` After all, I'm the princess's attendant.`
` So, let's give it our all together and get a huge pile of medals."`
`"Okay...!"`
`"Come now, Ange-sama.`
` Start wherever you want.`
` I, Gohda, am ready to challenge you whenever you please."`
`"Whoa, not so fast.`
` The honor of the first audience with the princess belongs to me.`
` Ange, begin with my challenge...!"`
`"O-Okay!"`
`I suddenly got tense, and my stomach began to feel tight.`
`Then, Aunt Eva gently held my hand.`
`"It'll be okay.`
` Let's do this together!"`
`"...O-Okay!"`
`"Then let us begin, Ange.`
` This is a story about December 25th, Christmas Day."`
`"Christmas...?"`
`Even though it was October, he suddenly started talking about Christmas.`
`Is he going to ask what day Christmas is?`
`I know that.`
` It's December 25th.`
`"On Christmas Day,`
` a woman looked up at the night sky and spoke:`
` 『Eventually, the night will end, and morning will come.`
` Wouldn't it be wonderful if, after the sun sinks and it becomes night once more, it could be Christmas again?〝`
` And then, the man spoke.`
` 『Okay,`
` I'll make your dream come true for you.〝`
` Is such a thing possible...?"`
`"The day after Christmas is the 26th, a normal day.`
` That's impossible."`
`"...Still Christmas, even after the sun rises...`
` Oh, I've got it."`
`"Huh? How?!`
` How can the day after Christmas be Christmas again?!"`
`"Wahhahahahaha.`
` Think about it for yourself, Ange."`
`"The day after Christmas isn't Christmas.`
` It couldn't happen."`
`"Heheheh.`
` Too bad. Wrong."`
`"Huh? Why...?!"`
`"Ange-chan, what time of day does a new day start?"`
`"Midnight, at 12:00 AM."`
`"There you go.`
` Isn't it nighttime at midnight?"`
`"...Ah."`
`I see.`
` The first night was just after midnight on December 25th.`
`In other words, the time right after the previous day ended and Christmas began.`
`That would indeed be Christmas Day, and it would be at night.`
`"And then, the morning of the 25th would come, and when the sun sank again, that would be nighttime on the 25th again..."`
`"Exactly!`
` You figured it out."`
`"Hohoho!`
` If only you had figured it out a little faster."`
`Grandfather laughed like Santa Claus.`
`Aunt Eva asked him to count it as a right answer, since I figured it out in the end, but Grandfather shook his head.`
`"Come on...!`
` Don't be such a stingy Grandpa."`
`"Still, now I've figured out how to do it.`
` I'll get the next one right."`
`"Yes, yes.`
` That's the spirit.`
` That's my granddaughter for you."`
`"Thank you, Grandpa!`
` I'm really ready now.`
` I'll start getting a lot of them right!"`
`"Yes.`
` Give it your all.`
` I have a truly splendid present waiting for you."`
`After bowing to Grandfather, I hurried off with Aunt Eva to where everyone else was gathered.`
`"Oh, I see.`
` It is possible...!"`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` After all, there are two nights in every day."`
`"Right!`
` December 25th starts at 12:00 midnight.`
` Midnight is during the night, so that's the first night.`
` Then, morning comes, and when night falls again, it's still the same day until midnight!"`
`"Exactly.`
` And both of those nights are nights on Christmas Day."`
`"Heheheheh.`
` Am I awesome? Am I awesome...?!"`
`With a delighted smile, Aunt Eva patted my head vigorously.`
`"Wahahaha!`
` Well done, Ange.`
` I tried to make it a hard question, but you solved it like it was nothing."`
`"Congratulations, Ange-sama.`
` ...Here is a medal for getting the first question right."`
`Genji-san held out a gold-colored medal.`
`Grandfather smiled at me, urging me to take it.`
`"Th-Thank you!"`
`"Keep up the pace.`
` Well now, that is all for my puzzle.`
` Head over there and ask whomever you choose for a quiz."`
`It was a heavy, gold-colored medal.`
`If I get a lot of these right, my pocket might burst.`
`I'm gonna get so many that I can brag about it to everyone!`
`After bowing to Grandfather,`
` I hurried off with Aunt Eva to where everyone else was gathered.`
`Kinzo watched Ange go with a warm gaze.`
`"Did I make it a bit too easy...?"`
`"No.`
` I think it was just right."`
`"......Genji,`
` have I...managed to act the part of a good grandpa...?"`
`"Of course."`
`"Ange is young.`
` And, she frequently grows sick and is unable to come to Rokkenjima.`
` ...She probably won't...remember me well."`
`Young children have their own kind of cruelty.`
`They think of kindness as something they'll naturally receive.`
`And because they think of kindness as only natural, ...they forget about it quickly.`
`"...It is no different from gratitude to one's parents.`
` It will probably take Ange-sama many years before she understands."`
`"Do you think...`
`...she will eventually remember that I was a fun grandpa?"`
`"...Yes.`
` I am certain of it."`
`"..............."`
`Kinzo's expression grew slightly darker.`
`...Eventually, even Ange will get older, and she will probably hear how the public at large regards Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
`The Ushiromiya Kinzo known by the public is completely different from the Kinzo who plays with his grandchildren.`
`When she learns,`
` ...will Ange remember the face of Kinzo the tyrant, known of by the world, ...or that gently smiling face?`
`"...I would hope for her to remember my smile, if possible, ...but such a thing is probably too much to ask for."`
`"............"`
`"There's no way around it.`
` That's what children are."`
`"Oh, it's you."`
`"Children just eat up kindness, and it never remains in their memories.`
` By the time 12 years have passed, she will surely learn what a bizarre eccentric Ushiromiya Kinzo was.`
` Your smile is fated to be painted over by that and forgotten."`
`"...Most probably.`
` No matter how much I spoil her, my love will not be rewarded."`
`"However,`
` just as it takes a long time to remember what you owe your parents,`
` ...Ange will surely remember someday.`
` ...She will remember the smiles you showed her."`
`"Hmph...`
` Let her forget.`
` One smile from her is the greatest parting gift I could ever take with me, when my time comes.`
` This is...the essence of unrewarded love."`
`"I guess grandfathers are always unrewarded."`
`"Oh, but I have been rewarded.`
` With Ange's smile just now to look back upon,`
` I could happily pass on in my sleep tonight.`
` Wahhahahahahahahaha..."`
`With a lonely laugh, Kinzo spun around, setting his cape fluttering.`
`This was all the love he could offer Ange as a grandfather.`
`Part of him wanted to be remembered, but he knew he mustn't wish for that.`
`That was...how unrewarded love worked.`
`After looking at Kinzo's back, Beato stared at Ange's back again.`
`"......Ange.`
` ...Even so, please remember it someday.`
` ...Remember the smile...that Kinzo once showed you."`
`Okay, whose quiz should I take next?`
`I'm gonna challenge more and more people, get more and more medals for getting them right, and get a wonderful present to show everyone.`
`Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi are over there.`
`They're looking this way and smiling.`
` I'm sure they've thought up some interesting puzzles.`
`There's Uncle Hideyoshi, beckoning for me to come over.`
`He's a fun uncle, so I'm sure he's thought up a fun question.`
`Mom and Dad are across from him.`
`They're waving at me, telling me to have lots of fun.`
`...Dad probably knows a lot of really hard questions.`
` He might be tough.`
`Over there is Aunt Rosa and Maria onee-chan.`
`It looks like they're reading a quiz book together, searching for a problem.`
`Every now and then, Maria onee-chan glances over at me, saying 'kihihihihi'.`
`She can be mean sometimes, so I'm sure her puzzle won't be a nice one.`
`Beyond them are Battler onii-chan, George onii-chan, and Jessica onee-chan.`
`...Battler onii-chan is usually nice,`
` but he sometimes says really mean things, and I think he likes seeing me get confused.`
`...I get the feeling...`
`that he'll give me a really tough problem.`
`Is there anyone who looks like they won't be mean?`
`If I can, I'd like to start with some easy puzzles to warm me up.`
`All the way over there are Genji-san and Doctor Nanjo.`
`I don't think those two will be mean to me.`
`And then there's Shannon and Kanon.`
`Shannon knows about a lot of quizzes and fairy tales.`
` I'm sure she'll give me something unique.`
`Then, we have Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san, who are serving tea.`
`Kumasawa-san might be tough.`
` ...I kinda think she'll give me a really confusing problem.`
`...It looks like everyone might be pretty tough.`
`Hmmmmm...`
`"Ange-chan,`
` I've got a good one for ya...!`
` Over here!"`
`Uncle Hideyoshi is calling for me.`
`...What should I do?`
` Should I go?`
`"Do you want to try Uncle Hideyoshi?"`
`"Yeah.`
` The order doesn't matter.`
` After all, I'm gonna challenge everyone."`
`I rolled up my sleeves and headed towards Uncle Hideyoshi.`
`"Wahahahahahaha, here you are.`
` Mine's a tricky one, okay?"`
`"I wonder what sort of question you'll give her.`
` Don't make it too hard, okay?"`
`"It's okay if it's hard.`
` I'll solve it."`
`"Oooh, lookin' pretty confident there...!`
` Okay, here it comes!"`
`After clearing his throat, Uncle Hideyoshi started telling his question...`
`"Mine's a riddle.`
` Listen closely, now.`
` You know the story of Momotarou, right?"`
`"The boy who floated down a river in a peach?"`
`"That's right.`
` But you know, one day, an apple floated down that river."`
`"An apple??"`
`"Yep!`
` And the next day, a butternut squash floated down it!"`
`"I hate butternut squash."`
`"And then, the next day, some cabbage floated down it!`
` And the next day, a dill pickle did.`
` And the next day, an eggplant floated by.`
` And the day after that, a fig did!"`
`"*giggle*`
` What a strange tale.`
` Did a greengrocer live upstream or something?"`
`"Okay, here's the question.`
` What floated down the river the next day?!"`
`"Huh...?!"`
`"I've got it.`
` Do you get it, Ange-chan?"`
`"I don't get it."`
`"Then I'll give you a hint.`
` There's a pattern to the things that float down the river.`
` Can you guess what the pattern is?"`
`"Wahahahaha!`
` What a huge hint...!"`
`One day, an apple floated down.`
`The next day, a butternut squash did.`
`The next day, a cabbage did.`
`The next day, a dill pickle did.`
`The next day, an eggplant did.`
`The next day, a fig did.`
`What floated down the river the day after that...?`
`"......I don't...have a clue!"`
`"Wahhahahahahahahaha.`
` Guess that was a bit too hard...!"`
`"I know what floated down the river the day after that.`
` A hassaku orange, right?"`
`"Yep.`
` And the day after that, it was probably an i......i... hmmm...`
` ...I can't think of a fruit or veggie that starts with 'i'!"`
`I'm not sure I understand.`
`Ah well, too bad.`
`"I know!`
` It's a grapefruit!"`
`"That's right.`
` It wasn't one of the choices, but green beans would have worked too."`
`The names all followed the alphabet.`
` Apple was 'a'.`
` Butternut squash was 'b'.`
` Cabbage was 'c'.`
`It kept going with 'd', 'e', and 'f'.`
`So, after 'f' comes 'g'.`
` That's why the answer had to be something that started with 'g'.`
`"Thanks, Aunt Eva. I got it right thanks to your hint!"`
`"*giggle*`
` You solved it by yourself, Ange-chan.`
` Incredible."`
`"Yep, nice work!`
` Now, here's your medal for gettin' it right...!"`
`Hideyoshi took out a gold-colored medal and placed it on my palm.`
`It felt heavy in my hand.`
` Yeah, this is what victory feels like.`
`I'd better keep it up!`
`"I've got another medal for Eva's puzzle.`
` But I can't think of any more."`
`"Then maybe I should give Ange-chan a puzzle."`
`"Huh?`
` You will?"`
`"Sure.`
` How about a quiz for the princess from her attendant♪`
` I've thought of a fun one, so please, have a go at it!"`
`Aunt Eva smiled brightly.`
`I want to get as many medals as possible, so of course, I want as many chances as I can get.`
`"Okay, I'll have a go at it."`
`"*giggle* That's the spirit.`
` Okay, here it comes."`
`"We've talked about how I love to travel, haven't we?"`
`"Yeah.`
` You said you like traveling overseas a lot."`
`"That's right.`
` So this will be a puzzle about traveling.`
` There was a traveler in a certain place."`
`"A traveler?"`
`"First, the traveler walked five kilometers north."`
`"...Should I write this down on a piece of paper?"`
`"Don't worry.`
` The puzzle isn't that hard, so listening to it will be enough."`
`"The traveler first walked five kilometers north.`
` Then, he walked five kilometers to the east.`
` Then, he walked five kilometers to the south."`
`"......Five kilometers north.`
` Five kilometers east.`
` Five kilometers south.`
` ...You mean, like a blocky 'n'?"`
`"That's right!`
` So, he'd end up at a spot five kilometers to the east of where he started."`
`"That's what you'd think, right?`
` But, incredibly, this traveler ended up in the exact same spot he started.`
` ...Is something so mysterious possible?"`
`"Wahaha, there's no way!`
` His compass must've gone crazy."`
`"Of course it didn't!`
` Heheheheh, do you know, Ange-chan?"`
`"It wasn't because of his compass?`
` ...Is this a play on words?"`
`"No, this is a real quiz.`
` For a hint, why don't you try thinking about a globe?"`
`There was a certain traveler.`
`The traveler walked five kilometers north.`
`Then, he walked five kilometers east.`
`Then, he walked five kilometers south.`
`Then, incredibly, he ended up in the exact same spot he started.`
`This place does exist, but what sort of place is it...?`
`"......I don't get it."`
`I've never traveled overseas at all.`
`There might be some strange place in the world where you could walk in a blocky 'n' and get back to where you started.`
`...Like the Bermuda Triangle, or something...`
`"Hmmm...`
` I guess that was a bit too hard for you, Ange-chan."`
`"If you went north, then east, then south, there's no way you'd get back to where you started."`
`"But there is a place.`
` A place somewhere on the Earth's surface.`
` If you have a globe in your house, take a good look at it and think carefully.`
` If you just can't figure it out, try asking your dad, okay?"`
`"Okay, I'll ask him.`
` So tell me the right answer...!"`
`"*giggle*`
` The right answer is a veeery cold place.`
` Where can you find cold places on a globe?`
` Think about it carefully.`
` Once you figure it out, you can try giving this quiz to the other kids in your class.`
` I'm sure they'll all be surprised."`
`Where can you find a cold place?`
` ...Hokkaido?`
`I don't think you end up at the start if you go north, east, then south in Hokkaido.`
`...Nnnn.`
` I don't get it.`
` I give up.`
`"Okay, that's all for our puzzles!`
` Go ask one of the others to give you one!"`
`"Let's go!`
` Who should we challenge next?!"`
`If Aunt Eva knows puzzles this hard, I'm sure she must be good at quizzes.`
`If she's with me, I know we'll get lots and lots of medals.`
`Who will I ask next...?!`
`"I got it...!`
` It's a really cold place!`
` Yeah, it must be incredibly cold there!"`
`"Perfect!`
` Ange-chan, you must really be a genius, to get something like that at your age."`
`"If you start at the south pole, then after you go north, goin' east just draws a circle around the south pole.`
` So, anytime you head south again, that just takes you right back to the south pole."`
`"I tried to make it an extra hard puzzle, `
`but Ange-chan was just too good."`
`"Congrats!`
` Here's another medal for ya."`
`I got a heavy, gold-colored medal.`
`All right, I did it...!`
` Aunt Eva and I held up our fists in celebration.`
`"Okay, that's all for our puzzles!`
` Go ask one of the others to give you one!"`
`"Okay! Thank you, Uncle Hideyoshi...!"`
`"Your aunt's really clever...!`
` ...With the two of you together, you'll be gettin' medals right and left!"`
`"Yep, that's right!"`
`"Yeah.`
` Let's do our best together, Aunt Eva."`
`I dashed away.`
`Who will I ask next...?!`
`Uncle Hideyoshi waved goodbye, smiling...`
`Hideyoshi and Eva watched as Ange ran off happily, looking for the next quiz.`
`"......Even though that kid can wear such a cute smile...`
` ...I...will be the one who takes that away from her..."`
`"Eva......"`
`Eva hung her head.`
` A single tear sparkled in her eye...`
`"Her reaction was only natural, considering how she felt.`
` ...But I...wasn't able to see past it and accept her feelings..."`
`"It can't be helped.`
` You're as human as anyone else.`
` Humans tend to be more fragile than you'd think."`
`"Even so, it was my fault...!`
` After all, I already had the experience of bringing up a child, right?!`
` ...I should have become her mother.`
` ...And yet, I let sadness overwhelm me, ...and I didn't do it at all..."`
`"It can't be helped, I tell you...!`
` Don't think you were the only one at fault...!`
` You shouldn't blame yourself so much!"`
`By now, Eva was unable to hold back her sobs...`
`Large tears dripped down her cheeks as she stared at the ground and shook...`
`"What a sin I've committed...`
` ...My sadness was no greater than hers...!`
` And yet, I decided that I was suffering the most, ...so I didn't accept her feelings...`
` ...I'm a failure of a mother...`
` I wasn't able...to become a mother for her..."`
`"That's wrong.`
` ...You did your best for her, Eva nee-san."`
`"Kyrie-san..."`
`Kyrie and Rudolf were standing behind Eva now.`
`"I know the lengths you went to...to keep the truth from Ange."`
`"...You held out well, Aneki.`
` Guess that daughter of ours really has been a pain, and clueless about how much you suffered."`
`After the accident on Rokkenjima...`
`Eva, the only one who left Rokkenjima alive, adopted Ange, the girl who had been absent and survived.`
`...While they would eventually develop a sad and mutually painful relationship,`
` it wasn't like that at first.`
`Eva tried to show affection for Ange, her last remaining blood relative.`
` She tried to become Ange's new mother.`
` Even as she fought back the sadness she herself felt.`
`However, Ange wasn't able to accept that kindness.`
`She lashed out at Eva, the only one who had returned alive, for stealing her parents away from her.`
`...Eva, understanding the wounds that this little six-year-old girl bore, withstood these attacks.`
`She grit her teeth and poured all of her affection onto Ange, ...affection that went ignored.`
`However, ...the wounds Eva herself bore were also extremely deep.`
`She was never rewarded for her sad efforts,`
` ...and the future in front of her grew dark.`
`"You tried to show Ange the same affection you once showed George-kun."`
`"But that...was just for my own satisfaction. ...Ange-chan never felt any of it..."`
`"Ange was the one who couldn't accept it.`
` It isn't your fault."`
`"But who could possibly ask that of Ange-chan when she was just six years old...?!`
` I should've held out much, much longer, until she could understand my feelings...!"`
`"Eva nee-san,`
` I want you to believe one thing."`
`"............"`
`"We...don't blame you in the slightest."`
`"...Kyrie-san......"`
`"Thank you so much...for suffering so long for Ange's sake...`
` ...If that kid has a human heart, then I'm sure she'll recognize the affection you showed her someday."`
`"Thank you, Aneki.`
` We'll always be grateful..."`
`"......Isn't that wonderful, Eva...?`
` ...Your efforts...haven't gone unnoticed..."`
`"Uuuuu...uwaaaaaaaahhhh......"`
`"How are you doing, Ange-sama?`
` If you wish, I, Gohda, would be pleased to challenge you."`
`"Hohohoho.`
` And I, Kumasawa, have a veeery tricky puzzle for you."`
`"It doesn't matter how hard it is.`
` I'm not alone.`
` I'll solve it with Aunt Eva!"`
`Gohda and Kumasawa offered to challenge me.`
`I'll have to go up against everyone in the end, so it doesn't matter who comes next.`
`I waved at Aunt Eva to hurry up,`
` and she ran toward me.`
`"So, we're challenging this pair next?`
` Who will we start with?"`
`"Okay, ...Gohda-san."`
`"Very well, as you wish.`
` Here is my puzzle."`
`"Hohohohoho.`
`"I'll still solve it.`
` I've gotten the knack of it."`
`"You'd better not underestimate Ange-chan.`
` Right?!"`
`"Right!"`
`"My, my.`
` ...Well then, being the humble chef that I am, here is a puzzle about food and the kitchen."`
`"We'll fight together this time.`
` If you don't get it, just ask me to lend a hand.`
` I'll give you a hint."`
`"...If I get a hint, does that mean I won't get a medal?"`
`"It won't affect your medals at all, so feel free to ask away!"`
`"I've got it.`
` The hint here...is that the witch got home much later than usual."`
`"...What happens when she gets home later than usual?"`
`"Think carefully.`
` The food is always freshly-made and served at the usual time, right?`
` So, ...what happens when she gets home long after that?"`
`"...I don't get it.`
` Food can't talk."`
`"Well, uh, that's because this is a fairy tale puzzle..."`
`"Hohhohohohohoho...`
` It looks as though she didn't figure it out."`
`The answer I'd chosen at random was wrong, apparently.`
` ...Too bad.`
`"Then tell me the right answer, Aunt Eva.`
` You figured it out, right?`
` Tell me!"`
`"All right.`
` The answer is-"`
`"Eva-sama, if you wouldn't mind...!`
` They say recipes and riddle answers are best while they remain secret."`
`"You think so...?`
` Heheheh, I'll have to tell her sometime later when you aren't around, then."`
`"Yeah, it's a promise!"`
`But even if I hear the answer later on, I still got it wrong.`
`Oh well.`
` I'd better pull myself together and take a shot at Kumasawa-san's puzzle.`
`"The ice cream!`
` The witch got back really late, so the ice cream would've melted.`
` So she couldn't eat it!"`
`"Nicely done!`
` See?`
` Ange-chan is a clever girl, isn't she?"`
`"Congratulations, Ange-sama!`
` Very impressive.`
` How quickly you saw through the puzzle that I, Gohda, put all my efforts into...!"`
`"It was totally easy.`
` Aunt Eva's puzzle was harder."`
`"*giggle* Thanks."`
`"Congratulations.`
` This medal is your prize for answering my question correctly."`
`"Thank you!"`
`Okay, that was easy.`
`Now let's take a shot at Kumasawa-san's puzzle.`
`"Looks like I'm up next.`
` Now, let's test Ange-sama with my specially-made, super-hard puzzle.`
` Are you ready?"`
`"How...`
`hard is it?"`
`"Hohohohohohoho.`
` You'll have to wait and see.`
` And now, let the mackerel dessert puzzle begin."`
`"Mackerel dessert...?"`
`"This is Kumasawa-san we're talking about, so you can bet it'll be a strange one.`
` Be careful."`
`"Okay!"`
`"Aunt Eva, do you get it?"`
`"She says you have to change one letter, so the answer's probably some sort of word game.`
` Her choice of words is suspicious to say the least. Try and think of some kind of dessert that you can make by changing a letter in...`
` Ah, I've got it!"`
`"Huh?!`
` What is it? What is it?!"`
`"Forget changing a whole letter... You only need to change one line.`
` In fact, that pretty much gives you the answer."`
`"*bzzzz*.`
` Wrooong."`
`"Huh?!`
` I don't get it!`
` I don't get it at all...!"`
`"Hohohohoho, sorry, but wrong is wrong.`
` Perhaps it was a bit too hard for you, Ange-sama."`
`"Come on, Kumasawa-san.`
` That was a nasty puzzle..."`
`"It doesn't make sense!`
` There's no way you could make a dessert out of mackerel!`
` What's the answer?`
` Tell me!"`
`"Hohohoho, it's no fun if I tell you.`
` If you don't guess it quick, ...then you really will be having mackerel for dessert.`
` Ihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`"Tell me, tell me!"`
`"I'm afraid I must say 'no'."`
`Kumasawa smiled cheerily, but remained stubborn.`
`No matter how much I bother her, she probably won't tell me the answer.`
`"That concludes our puzzles.`
` There are probably others waiting for you to challenge them, Ange-sama.`
` Please, on to the next challenge."`
`"We're both rooting for you, Ange-sama."`
`"Okay!`
` I'll keep on trying hard and getting more and more medals!"`
`"That's the spirit. Don't let it get you down.`
` Plenty more chances left!"`
`We rushed away.`
`Okay, who should we take on next...?!`
`"I got it!`
` The letter is 'b'!`
` If you change the 'b' in Sabara to an 'h', you get Sahara!"`
`"Hohohohohoho,`
` that's correct."`
`"The last line said you could make a grand 'desert' out of sabara.`
` Not dessert...!"`
`"I figured out a trick in Japanese and English!`
` Am I awesome? Am I awesome?!"`
`"You're so smart, Ange-chan!`
` You deserve a pat on the head...!"`
`"Haha, `
`I like it when you do that."`
`"Just change a single letter, and even mackerel can make a fine desert.`
` Are you starting to see mackerel's true power?"`
`"The day I'm forced to serve a joke like that for dessert, I imagine heads will roll..."`
`"I wouldn't like it either.`
` I like ice cream for dessert."`
`"Ahahahahahaha, of course.`
` By the way, we shouldn't be worried, should we?`
` What about tonight's dessert?"`
`"Ohohohohoho...`
` I can hardly wait to surprise everyone with the mackerel fruit parfait waiting there in the kitchen!"`
`"Nooooooo!!"`
`Everyone burst out laughing.`
`For some time after that, I was tormented by the terrifying image of a parfait neatly topped with mackerel chunks...`
`"What a shame...`
` I tried so hard to stop Ange-sama from getting that prize, but she solved my best riddle like it was nothing."`
`Though she said that, Kumasawa smiled.`
`A gold-colored medal glittered in her wrinkly hand.`
`Ange took it.`
`"Well then, that's all for our puzzles."`
`"Please keep up the pace, get more and more medals, and win that splendid prize from the Master!"`
`"Okay! Thank you.`
` I'll keep it up...!`
` We did it, Aunt Eva!"`
`"Heheheh!`
` Let's keep it up!"`
`We rushed away.`
`Okay, who should we take on next...?!`
`"It seems that all of a sudden, the tiny girl who used to hide and tremble in Kyrie-sama's shadow...`
`has grown to be so bright and cheery..."`
`"...With each passing family conference, one can feel the growth of those youngsters.`
` After just a few years more, Ange-sama will surely learn of love, of makeup, `
`and will eventually grow to become a true lady."`
`"Very true...`
` If she grows normally with the passing time, that is..."`
`A cruel fate...`
`will force the chick called Ange into a lonely future.`
`If an egg isn't warmed, it won't hatch.`
`The egg she is now will not be warmed by anyone, and it will not hatch...`
`"Inside that frozen egg,`
` will Ange-sama have no choice but to face an isolated future...?"`
`"...An eggshell can always be broken from the inside.`
` ...A cold shell may be very, very hard, but that doesn't mean it cannot be broken."`
`"Does Ange-sama have the strength to do that?"`
`"Is she capable of achieving that or not...?`
` I hear that question is what this final game is all about."`
`"Perhaps we should have sent her a clearer message.`
` ...If the egg cannot be warmed, could we not at least strike it from the outside to make it easier to crack?"`
`"If a chick without the power to break its own shell is forced outside of the egg,`
` it won't be able to withstand the cold winds.`
` Ange-sama will have to find that power and resilience herself."`
`"...But,`
` can we not somehow explain that power and resilience to her?"`
`"Words mean nothing if they are merely given. They must also be accepted.`
` ...No matter what we try to give Ange-sama, it will be meaningless unless she accepts it."`
`"......You're right.`
` No matter what we try to tell her, it won't matter unless she listens."`
`"Hohohoho...`
` We can do nothing but watch over her.`
` You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink."`
`"We can do nothing...`
`but pray that Ange-sama chooses a better future for herself."`
`"If Ange-sama does not abandon herself to anger for the sole purpose of distracting herself from her resignation and sadness...`
` If she can just be honest about that one, single wish that she truly desires more than anything else...`
` Then you can be certain that she will make her greatest wish come true."`
`"It is ironic.`
` ...Since the very beginning, she has been denying that greatest wish of hers herself."`
`"Laughter brings happiness.`
` Tears bring misfortune.`
` Those who believe will be saved.`
` ...People have the power to create their own futures by the strength of their emotions."`
`"I wish we could just let her hear those words..."`
`"Battler-sama is very strict.`
` ...He's hoping that Ange will realize it by her own power alone...and is not permitting even words of this nature to be told to her."`
`"...It seems we can do nothing but watch over her."`
`"And so, let us at least pray.`
` Pray that she grasps the world she desires most with her own hands."`
`"Oh, have you selected me?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I'll have to face everyone sooner or later.`
` Right, Aunt Eva?!"`
`"Right!`
` Come on, let's have a puzzle.`
` We'll solve it in a flash!"`
`"Hahahaha.`
` I see, I see.`
` Then it seems I must make it a good one."`
`"Genji,`
` you should give her one as well.`
` A tough one."`
`"As you wish.`
` ...In that case, a tough one it shall be..."`
`Whoa.`
`I'd hoped that Genji-san would give me a simple puzzle, but now he's saying it'll be tough.`
` Scary.`
`But I'll beat both of them.`
` I can't let myself get scared.`
`"Then let us start with mine.`
` I am a doctor, `
`so how about an ambulance puzzle?"`
`"The ??? is a number?`
` But emergency is a word.`
` You can't add a number to a word, right?"`
`"That part sounds like some kind of word game.`
` After all, 'kyu-kyu-' means emergency, and 'kyu-' means nine. If you write two nines together, it looks like 99, doesn't it?"`
`"So, if you add something to 99, you get an ambulance?"`
`"Hmm. Why does some number added to 99 get you an ambulance?`
` ......Ah, I've got it!"`
`"Huh, really?!`
` Hey, what is it?!"`
`"I'll give you a hint.`
` You've got a big advantage here that most people around the world don't have.`
` *giggle* Then again, even people from other countries could narrow it down to two answers with a little math."`
`"Huh? ...Nnnnn...`
` ...I don't get it..."`
`"Oh, are you having trouble?`
` I thought it was an easy puzzle."`
`It's a bit annoying to hear that about a puzzle I don't get.`
`Still, no matter how annoyed I get, I don't have a clue what the answer is.`
`"Aw, so close.`
` I thought you'd made it pretty far too..."`
`Apparently, Aunt Eva knows the answer.`
` She looks disappointed that I didn't figure it out too.`
`"...Mumumumu...?`
` Ah, yes, I have it!`
` If you subtract two from an ambulance, then add on 60, you can even learn the weather."`
`"Well done, Kinzo-san.`
` It seems I must hand this medal over to you."`
`"Wahahahahahaha.`
` Sorry, Ange.`
` This medal's all mine."`
`"...F-Fine, I don't care."`
`The gold medal passed from Nanjo to Kinzo.`
`That medal was supposed to be mine...`
` It's no use regretting it now.`
`If you subtract two from and add 60 to an ambulance...?`
` How would that tell you the weather...??`
`"Hmm, what was the number for the weather forecasting service, I wonder?"`
`"......???"`
`Yeah, I don't have a clue.`
`I'll just have to pick myself up and have a go at Genji's puzzle.`
`"20!`
` Emergency sounds like 99, and if you add 20 to that, you get 119.`
` That's the emergency number for ambulances!"`
`"And if you subtract 20 from 130, you get 110.`
` That's the emergency number for calling the police."`
`"Splendid! That is correct.`
` I knew you were a quick thinker, Ange-san."`
`"Oooooooh, well done, Angeeeeeeee!`
` What a wise granddaughter I have!"`
`"Congratulations.`
` This medal belongs to you."`
`"But...what was that about the difference between the two being half an emergency?"`
`"Heheh, yeah, we didn't really need that part.`
` If you use that hint, you could make a pretty good guess at the answer even if you forgot what the emergency numbers were."`
`"Huh??"`
`At any rate, the gold medal glittering in Nanjo's hand is now mine.`
`Okay, now I'll defeat Genji too and get another one.`
`"Yes, that's the spirit.`
` Let's solve more and more!"`
`"Your turn, Genji-san."`
`"My friend here doesn't speak much, but his knowledge is quite extensive.`
` Even I cannot wait to see what sort of puzzle he whips up."`
`"Now then, Ange-sama,`
` prepare yourself.`
` The puzzle starts now."`
`...I've never heard anyone say 'prepare yourself' like that when giving a quiz.`
`I started to get so tense that my stomach began to hurt...`
`"It'll be okay.`
` Hang in there!"`
`Aunt Eva gripped my hand firmly, and my stomachache got a little better.`
`"...Ange-sama, have you learned division?"`
`"Y-Yeah.`
` I learned it in cram school."`
`"Incredible, a six-year-old who knows division?"`
`"Then there should be no problems.`
` Here it comes."`
`This is bad...`
` I did learn division, but I'm not very good at it...`
`"Half of its remaining length burns away each hour, right...?`
` After the first hour, it's burned down by half of 5 centimeters.`
` During the next hour, it burns down half of that remaining length.`
` And during the third hour, it burns down half of that remaining length..."`
`"...I can't really do it without a calculator.`
` Do you know the answer, Aunt Eva?"`
`"Ah, ...I've got it.`
` *giggle* This is a pretty mean puzzle."`
`"Why is it mean?"`
`"This has nothing to do with division.`
` Read through the puzzle again carefully."`
`...Umm, `
`...what was it, again...?`
`"My sincere apologies, but that is incorrect."`
`"Huh?!`
` Why?!`
` I know I did the math right...!"`
`"You see, ...there's no need for math in this puzzle.`
` Yep, he tricked us good this time..."`
`"Wahhahahahahahaha.`
` Too bad, Ange.`
` Did you get it, Nanjo?"`
`"Yes, of course.`
` Division is unnecessary.`
` This was an easy puzzle, one that even Ange-san could have solved."`
`Not only Aunt Eva, but everyone else said that math wasn't needed.`
`And I worked so hard on that division...`
`"That is all for my puzzle.`
` I believe several others are waiting for you to challenge them, Ange-sama.`
` Perhaps you ought to search for the next challenge."`
`"Good luck, Ange-san.`
` I am rooting for you."`
`"That's right.`
` This is no time to get down!`
` Now's our chance to turn things around."`
`"Yeah!`
` I'll try even harder and get lots of medals!"`
`We dashed away.`
`There are still many people waiting to give me puzzles.`
` I have tons of chances to get medals.`
`Okay, who should I challenge next...?!`
`"...After one hour, the 5 centimeters becomes 2.5 centimeters,`
` ...and in the next hour, that becomes 1.25 centimeters,`
` ...and in the next hour, that becomes 0.625 centimeters..."`
`"............"`
`"Ange-chan.`
` You don't need to use math.`
` Make sure you remember the problem clearly...`
` How long...is the candle when it burns out...?"`
`"Ah!`
` That was a close one...!`
` The candle goes out when it's 1 centimeter long, so the rest doesn't matter!"`
`The flame on this candle dies when the candle is 1 centimeter in length.`
`In other words, it can never get shorter than 1 centimeter.`
`So the right answer is the fifth choice, "About 10mm"...!`
`"That's right...!"`
`"You are correct."`
`"Oooh, splendidly done, Ange!`
` How clever of you, not to be misled!"`
`"I didn't even need division.`
` I almost got tricked...!"`
`"You were pretty mean there, Genji-san.`
` You even asked her if she could do division.`
` That was a trap, right?"`
`"Correct.`
` My humble apologies."`
`"Hahhahahahaha.`
` After all, Genji-san is the sort who can trick you without changing his expression in the slightest."`
`"Congratulations, Ange-sama.`
` This medal is proof that you have correctly solved my puzzle."`
`"Thanks!`
` Heheheh, I got another medal, Aunt Eva...!"`
`"Heheh, nice going!"`
`"I'll get lots more.`
` I'll get a ton, and then Grandfather will give me a great prize!"`
`"Indeed.`
` Give it all you've got, my granddaughter...!"`
`"Good luck, Ange-san.`
` I am rooting for you."`
`"There must be others waiting for you.`
` Perhaps you ought to search for the next challenge."`
`"Okay! Thank you.`
` I'll try even harder now...!"`
`We dashed away.`
`There are still many people waiting to give me puzzles.`
` I have tons of chances to get medals.`
`Okay, who should I challenge next...?!`
`After Ange and Eva left,`
` ...Battler, who had been watching their progress, came over.`
`"How is Ange doing?"`
`"Oh, Battler.`
` I am not certain, but she does seem to be enjoying herself."`
`"I heard your puzzle, Genji-san.`
` Even I was almost taken in back there."`
`"You honor me."`
`"Still, it's not quite what I would've expected.`
` Who would've thought that you'd give a trick question like that?`
` I figured you'd make a straightforward, simple puzzle."`
`"Hahahahahahaha.`
` You might expect such a thing from him, silent as he is,`
` ...but he is much more of a schemer than he appears."`
`"Very true.`
` If you play a chess match against him, you'll see that right away."`
`"He even fools me, from time to time.`
` He'll trick me right to my face, with that stern, serious expression of his.`
` He has always been like that.`
` And yet, despite the numerous occasions on which he has fooled me in the past, I keep on getting tricked.`
` Wahhahhahahahahahaha."`
`"Come to think of it,`
` ...what sort of relationship do you and Genji-san have?"`
`For just an instant, Kinzo glanced at Genji's face.`
`Apparently, he didn't plan on touching on this subject if Genji had any objections.`
`However, Genji spoke as though there was no point hiding it any longer.`
`"...I knew the Master once...in Taiwan."`
`"Wahaha, 'knew me', he says...!`
` We were partners in crime, you might say!`
` The two of us were both prodigal sons of rich families.`
` A pair of ruffians who caused their parents nothing but trouble."`
`"Genji-san, a prodigal son...?`
` That's a surprise...`
` So, Genji-san also moved to Taiwan, where he met Grandfather?"`
`"......No.`
` I am a native of Taiwan."`
`"Genji-san was born in Taiwan.`
` ...Well, since Taiwan was under Japanese rule before the war, he is still Japanese, of course."`
`"He was a man who hated losing.`
` When we first met, we fought all the time.`
` Once we hit it off, we became the best of friends."`
`"...There was a lot of disorder and conflict after the war.`
` The Master is the one who saved me during that chaotic period.`
` ...If I spent the rest of my life trying to repay that debt, it would not be enough to pay it back in full."`
`"......Don't say that, my friend.`
` ...If only I had been a little more persuasive, I might have been able to bring your family back with us as well...`
` Because I was so inadequate, I was unable to save anyone but you..."`
`I don't know much about the details of Taiwan's history,`
` but apparently, there was still a lot of chaos there even after the war ended and Japan pulled out.`
`Kinzo, predicting this chaos before it happened,`
` worked out a way for Genji and his family to escape.`
`However, Genji's family possessed great wealth in Taiwan.`
` They were unable to abandon it, and they decided to remain there.`
`This wealth had been built up thanks to their close relationship with the Japanese-run government of Taiwan.`
`The new regime after the war wasn't likely to welcome them with open arms.`
`Much mayhem and confusion followed.`
` And Genji was the only one who escaped harm.`
`...I don't know what happened to make this man, whom Kinzo just called a troublesome prodigal son,`
` change so drastically to become the person he is today.`
`It was a story of friendship between the two of them,`
` ...and there could be hardly any point in an unrelated person sifting through history books to interpret it however they pleased.`
`They had been good friends since long ago, and they owed each other their lives.`
` Though the troubled times tossed them about, their friendship held firm for decades...`
`Genji's role is now that of the butler,`
` ...but when they're alone in the study, they sometimes share a drink and think back on the days of their youth.`
`...And they're still that way today.`
`Leaving Kinzo and Genji to reminisce, Battler walked off on his own.`
`It would be rude to ask for any more detail, and he didn't need to know.`
`Kinzo and Genji had been friends since long, long ago.`
`That was something he already knew.`
`"What do you think?`
` Do you want to challenge Aunt Natsuhi and Uncle Krauss next?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Let's beat them!"`
`"Hahahaha. Very well, we'll play along."`
`"The two of us have prepared some formidable puzzles for you."`
`"Should I go first?`
` Or you?"`
`"I will start."`
`"Very well."`
`"Listen closely to what I'm about to say.`
` White black white black white ???? black white black white black white."`
`"Huh?`
` White black white black...huh??"`
`"I'll say it once more.`
` White black white black white ???? black white black white black white.`
` ...What does the '????' stand for?"`
`This is...a really hard one.`
`White black white black white ???? black white black white black white.`
`It looks like the white and black are alternating, but the '????' is between a white and a black.`
`Is it...gray??`
` Is it that easy...?`
`"Th-This is a surprisingly hard one, coming from you, Natsuhi nee-san..."`
`Aunt Eva was groaning.`
` Apparently, this one's really tough.`
`"I-Is it really so hard...?"`
`"...There's a chance that some people won't understand, if they haven't had the right experiences."`
`"Eva-san aside, I think Ange-chan would have seen it a lot at school and kindergarten..."`
`"Wh-What the heck? I don't have a clue!!"`
`Is it a problem that I could get easier than Aunt Eva...?`
`...It's hard.`
`"The hint for this one is probably what Natsuhi nee-san said, about something you might see in a school or kindergarten.`
` ...Do you know what it is, Ange-chan?"`
`"No, I'm stuck."`
`"See, even Ange-chan says she's stuck!`
` Give her at least a little hint."`
`"I-I see.`
` Then, a hint...`
` They may be different colors, but you get a beautiful sound no matter which you push."`
`"A beautiful sound...?`
` Are these black and white things something that make sounds?"`
`"Black and white things that make a sound when you push them...?"`
`"......I don't get it."`
`"I give up too.`
` ...It seems even you know some pretty hard puzzles, Natsuhi nee-san."`
`"Hahahaha.`
` It's the sort of puzzle that brings out one's upbringing.`
` Perhaps it was a bit too hard for you."`
`"Wh-What did you saaaaaaay...?!"`
`"...Aunt Natsuhi,`
` could you tell me the answer?"`
`"The answer is...a keyboard."`
`"A keyboard?`
` Like on a piano?"`
`"That's right.`
` The blacks and whites are the pattern of colors on a keyboard.`
` In which case, you must already know the right answer."`
`Aunt Natsuhi smiled at me, but I don't really remember what a keyboard looks like.`
`...Nnng, too bad.`
`I'd better have a go at Uncle Krauss's puzzle and redeem myself.`
`"Ready?`
` It's Nii-san's turn now.`
` We'll solve it in a flash and teach him a lesson, okay?"`
`"That black and white thing...is a keyboard!`
` Like a piano!"`
`"Ah, ...is that it?!`
` It's a keyboard?!"`
`Something that can be found in kindergartens and schools, which is covered with a line of white and black things.`
`It's an instrument.`
`Like a keyboard on a piano or a melodica.`
`"The first two black keys are between 'do', 're', and 'mi'.`
` The set of three black keys are between 'fa', 'so', 'la', and 'ti'..."`
`"It started 'white black white black white ???? black', so...the three white ones are 'do', 're', and 'mi'..."`
`"There is no black key between 'mi' and 'fa'.`
` So, 'fa' comes right after 'mi'!"`
`"And since the question mark comes after 'mi', the right answer is 'fa'.`
` ...In other words-"`
`""The right answer is white!""`
`"Correct.`
` I thought it might have been a bit too hard, but you did well."`
`"Splendidly done, you two.`
` Go ahead, Natsuhi."`
`"Congratulations, Ange-chan.`
` Here's my medal for you."`
`"All right!`
` Aunt Eva, I got another one!"`
`"Things are moving along nicely.`
` Next up is Nii-san's puzzle.`
` Let's solve it in a flash and teach him a lesson, okay?"`
`"How interesting.`
` Looks like it's time you were taught a lesson."`
`"Stop it, Aunt Eva! Don't make him mad!`
` You'll make the puzzle harder!"`
`"Heheheheheheh.`
` If there's anyone you have to blame, it's Eva!`
` Now, take this brain-twister!`
` Here's a puzzle about the tenants of a skyscraper I've invested in."`
`"I don't know anything about this skyscraper,`
` so there's no way I could know..."`
`I know what's in floors five and above, so the answer must be somewhere between floor one and floor four.`
` There's no doubt about that.`
`"Heheheheh.`
` Do you give up?"`
`"I-I won't give up, kiii!!`
` So, you're saying that Murakoshi Publishing Co., Ltd. is on this floor X?!"`
`"Not floor X.`
` The ＿th floor."`
`"It's the same either way, isn't it...?"`
`"...Ah.`
` ............"`
`Aunt Eva suddenly stumbled on something.`
`Then, she started counting on her fingers, starting from the first floor...`
`"I've got it, Ange-chan...!`
` Try saying them aloud, starting from the first floor...!`
` There's only one that fits!"`
`"Huh?`
` Wh-What do you mean...?"`
`"...I don't get it."`
`"It's 'the ＿th floor', not 'floor X'. That's the trick."`
`"That's right.`
` Though, in a way, the answer is right there in the question."`
`"What do you mean...?"`
`"For example, let's take floor 7.`
` You'd call that 'the seventh floor', right?`
` But you wouldn't call floor 3 'the threeth floor', would you?"`
`"Precisely.`
` From floor 1 to floor 4, there's only one floor that ends in 'th'."`
`"A...Ah......"`
`By this point, even I had figured out the answer.`
`If only I'd paid a bit more attention to the way Uncle Krauss said the question...`
`"Hahahahahahaha.`
` Too bad.`
` Looks like I'll be keeping this medal."`
`"The 4th floor!"`
`"Mu..."`
`"Well done, you got it...!`
` From floor one to floor four, there's only one floor that ends in 'th', ...the 4th floor."`
`"Yeah!`
` The 4th floor fits, but the other ones are the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd floors."`
`"...N-Nicely done...`
` Even I didn't figure that out until I had the answer given to me..."`
`Apparently, Uncle Krauss once had this puzzle shown to him, and he wasn't able to answer it right.`
`He looked a bit downcast to see a kid like me solve it.`
`...For some reason, he looked even more mortified to see that Eva had solved it.`
` How strange.`
`"Come on, now.`
` Let's see that medal."`
`"This medal is a mark of Ange-chan's intelligence.`
` I mustn't let you have it, Eva."`
`"Heh, sore loser...!"`
`"Thank you, Uncle Krauss.`
` Am I incredible?!"`
`"Very much so.`
` You're a more flexible thinker than your uncle.`
` I am proud to have you as a niece."`
`"That's all for our puzzles."`
`"I do hope you enjoyed them."`
`"I did!`
` Thank you, Aunt Natsuhi and Uncle Krauss!"`
`"I hope you can enjoy all the tricky questions, without worrying about your medal count too much."`
`"We all hope that this becomes a wonderful night, just for you."`
`"We really are enjoying ourselves."`
`"Yeah!`
` We're having a lot of fun!"`
`Krauss and Natsuhi smiled at them as they dashed away.`
`"Oh, it's you, Natsuhi.`
` How did your puzzles go?"`
`"We did the best we could,`
` ...but I'm not sure how much they enjoyed them."`
`On the other side of the room, Ange and Eva were counting the medals they had gathered so far.`
`On the other side of the room, Ange and Eva were counting the medal they had gathered so far.`
`On the other side of the room, Ange and Eva were trying to count the medals they had gathered so far.`
`Ange and Eva.`
` ...It was such an unexpected pairing, but they looked like they were having a great time.`
`"...A future parent and child, unrelated by blood.`
` Watching them like this, they look just like a normal parent and child."`
`"Yes, they do.`
` ...Bonds between people are nurtured by the heart.`
` Ties of blood do not bond as strongly."`
`After saying this,`
` ...Natsuhi bit back her own words and stared at the floor.`
`"What's wrong?"`
`"...I was just...surprised that I would dare to say such words..."`
`"......`
`...You don't need to worry about me."`
`"Because I rejected you, ...you met a painful fate in so many worlds...`
` ...All of that is my responsibility..."`
`"I understand how you felt.`
` ...Unable to become pregnant, you were forced to feel shame for many years.`
` In that situation, any woman would be shocked if they were handed a baby whose parentage they didn't even know, ...and then told to adopt them."`
`"...That was no reason...`
`for me to push you off a cliff..."`
`"True.`
` You will have to carry that cross for the rest of your life."`
`"...Yes.`
` I am prepared to do so..."`
`"In that case, the suffering you must endure will come from the cross you bear.`
` Not from me."`
`"You don't...despise me...?"`
`"Don't make that dejected face.`
` ...No, perhaps it's the other way around.`
` As long as you continue making that dejected face, I will feel no desire to punish you.`
` As long as you continue to carry that cross,`
` I will feel no desire to hate you."`
`"Do you mean...that you don't hate me...?"`
`"To tell the truth, I did hate you.`
` I hated your guts.`
` I hated you so much, I wanted to hang up a pillow with your picture on it and use it as a punching bag!"`
`"But, as I watched you, that feeling faded away.`
` ...You regretted and lamented.`
` And I'm sure you'll never forget that feeling for as long as you live."`
`"How could I forget...?`
` ...After all, I'm a murderer..."`
`"Your cross is a heavy one, doubtless.`
` I can feel compassion for you now.`
` I'm serious.`
` After all, Kinzo was the one at fault, right?`
` It's his fault for having an illegitimate child in the first place!`
` And the way he forced that child on you was even worse!`
` He should at least have been able to avoid hurting you by saying `
`'Please take care of this poor child', instead of 'You can't give birth, so adopt this kid'.`
` Men! That Kinzo...!"`
`"............"`
`"I no longer hate you.`
` Doesn't that make the cross you bear feel any lighter?"`
`"No.`
` ...I still don't know how I can make up for what I did to you."`
`"Then let's do it this way.`
` Hold out your arms."`
`"...H-Huh?`
` L-Like this...?"`
`As Natsuhi spread her arms uncertainly, `
`Beato leapt forward and hugged her tight.`
`"...U-Umm, `
`...th-this is a little..."`
`"I'll never say this again, so let me say it once.`
` ...After all, I never had a chance to meet my mother."`
`Still hugging Natsuhi, Beato spoke in a whisper.`
`She spoke those words that she would certainly never say again...`
`"Thank you for worrying so much for my sake.`
` ...But I really don't hate you anymore.`
` Please, believe that,`
` ......Mother."`
`"...B-Beatrice......"`
`"Who should we get a puzzle from next?"`
`"What about those two?"`
`"Shannon-chan and Kanon-kun?`
` Sure, it looks like they'll put up a good fight."`
`"Do you need something, Eva-sama and Ange-sama?"`
`"...Don't be stupid, Nee-san.`
` They're asking us for puzzles."`
`"Ah, m-my apologies!"`
`Shannon was as absentminded as ever.`
`However, Kanon looked extremely calm, and would probably have a well-polished puzzle ready.`
`"Ummm, uhhhhh......"`
`"...*sigh*.`
` Okay, I'll go first.`
` Use that time to think up a puzzle, Nee-san."`
`"O-Okay. Sorry..."`
`"So, if I'm buying time for Nee-san to think up a puzzle, I'll have to make one tricky enough to keep you stumped for a while."`
`"Heheheheh, you've got guts, kid.`
` Let's have it, shall we?`
` Show us the hardest one you've got!"`
`"Don't provoke him!`
` I want a easy one!"`
`"Now that I have Eva-sama's permission, allow me to present an insanely difficult puzzle."`
`"Leave this to me.`
` I'll solve it!"`
`"The number of coins are really different, and kind of weird."`
`"Wait a second, Kanon-kun! What are you thinking?!`
` There's no way she'll be able to get this one, right?!"`
`"This is just to buy time until Nee-san can think up a question, so forgive me."`
`"Th-Thank you...!`
` I've thought of a question...!"`
`"...Understood.`
` Now then, Eva-sama and Ange-sama,`
` I'll give you a hint.`
` ......Copper is 29, silver is 47, and gold is 79.`
` That's the hint."`
`"That's just what you said in the question...!`
` That's not a hint!"`
`"...Copper is 29?`
` Silver is 47??`
` ......Oh, so that's it!"`
`"Huh?`
` You got it?!`
` I get it too!`
` Platinum is better than gold, so the prize must be more than 79 gold coins!"`
`"That's wrong.`
` With these rules, the platinum prize is probably worth less than the gold prize.`
` Isn't that right?"`
`"...It is as you say.`
` It seems you've already found the answer."`
`"This puzzle is impossible for Ange-chan.`
` You'd need to have gone to middle school at the very least.`
` I'll answer!`
` Is that all right, Ange-chan?"`
`"S-Sure.`
` I'll leave it to you...!"`
`"Incorrect."`
`"Aaaaaaaahhh, sorry, I messed up!!`
` If only I'd taken science class more seriously!"`
`"What do you mean?`
` I don't get it."`
`"The number of gold coins is the atomic number for each element.`
` Copper is 29, silver is 47, and gold is 79.`
` I can't remember what number platinum was...!!"`
`"I don't have a clue what you're talking about."`
`"You!`
` What kind of problem do you think you're giving Ange-chan?!`
` Can't you put a little more thought into your puzzles?!"`
`"You did give me permission to show her the hardest one I've got."`
`"...That's right.`
` You said it yourself.`
` That's why we got a puzzle that was too hard for me."`
`"Nnggggggggggghhhh...!!`
` ...S-Sorry, Ange-chan..."`
`Aunt Eva clenched her hands together, grimacing.`
`It was just too hard, and I didn't have a clue...`
`"......Correct."`
`"Awesome, Aunt Eva!`
` Why?!`
` Why is it 78 coins?!`
` If platinum is better than gold, then why does gold get more coins?!"`
`"The number of coins you get is always the same as the atomic number of the prize.`
` Copper is 29, silver is 47, and gold is 79.`
` And, by the way, platinum is 78.`
` So, the platinum prize gets you 78 gold coins."`
`"...A-Aunt Eva, you're incredible!!"`
`Dad once told me that Aunt Eva was an enthusiastic studier, and really, really smart even back when she was in school.`
`Even George onii-chan, her son, is smart, so Aunt Eva must really be incredible.`
`"Still, that was a pretty nasty riddle to choose.`
` You should have at least given one that Ange could understand."`
`"You did give me permission to show her the hardest one I've got."`
`"...That's right.`
` You said it yourself.`
` That's why we got a puzzle that was too hard for me."`
`"Nnggggggggggghhhh...!!`
` I-Is it my fault?`
` Sorry, Ange-chan...`
` But look, we got a medal, so please forgive me."`
`We got another medal.`
` Just how many have we gotten so far?`
`But we still have a lot left to get.`
` Next up is Shannon.`
`"Mine isn't that hard, so you can relax."`
`"After all, you managed to think it up."`
`"Y-You're making fun of me...!`
` Then do you want to have a go at it too, Kanon-kun?"`
`"Bring it on."`
`"It sounds like you'll be able to understand it this time, Ange-chan.`
` I'll stick to giving hints again."`
`"Okay, I'll do my best.`
` I'll solve it.`
` Another medal for me."`
`"Let's go then.`
` Listen carefully..."`
`"I don't get it.`
` What do the letters mean...?"`
`"...Could it be the first letter of each word?"`
`"That's what I thought at first.`
` White chocolate starts with 'W', pepper jack starts with 'P', and anchovy starts with 'A'.`
` But then, `
`how do you explain lemonade being 'O'?"`
`"Heheheheheheheh.`
` Do you get it?"`
`"...If it's about letters, spelling out big words like that is hard."`
`"You don't need to know how to spell any hard words.`
` If you and Eva-sama work together, `
`I know you'll be able to solve it."`
`"Don't you have any more hints?"`
`"I do.`
` I'll teach you the letters for some other foods.`
` First, watermelon is 'W'.`
` For 'P', how about picante potatoes?`
` Albacore tuna is an 'A'.`
` Orange-lime sherbet would probably be an 'O'.`
` Heheheheheheheh..."`
`"It really does sound like the first letter is the key...`
` But then how do you explain lemonade being 'O'...?"`
`"...I love 'W' foods.`
` Cookies and cake are 'W', right?"`
`"That's right."`
`"So, `
`it isn't the first letter after all..."`
`"What's going on?`
` Is the 'W' group about desserts?`
` But watermelon isn't a dessert...`
` 'P' is picante potatoes and pepper jack cheese?`
` 'A' is anchovy pizza and albacore tuna?`
` 'O' is lemonade and orange-lime sherbet?`
` Just what are these `
`groups??"`
`"...I sort of get it, but I sort of don't.`
` ...It's a little annoying."`
`"One last hint.`
` I'm sure your parents don't let you drink coffee, but do you know how it's supposed to taste?"`
`"I had a little once.`
` I thought it was gonna be sweet, so I was really surprised.`
` I'll never drink it again."`
`"...Ah, ...I've got it!`
` Ange-chan, thank you.`
` Thanks to you, I've probably figured it out!"`
`"Giving up?`
` What about you, Kanon-kun?"`
`"...I don't get it.`
` ...I think I almost do, but..."`
`"Yeah.`
` I almost know what all the groups mean, but I can't figure out that last step."`
`"It's...tastes, right?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` Have you figured it out now, Ange-sama and Kanon-kun?"`
`"I don't get it!`
` What is it, Aunt Eva?`
` Tell me!"`
`"Everything in the 'W' group is sweet, right?`
` So, what about the 'O' group?`
` The 'P' group?"`
`"...I see, so that's what it was...`
` Not bad, coming from you, Nee-san..."`
`"Why don't you try saying 'Sorry for making fun of you'?`
` If you don't, I'll make all your meals 'O' and 'I'."`
`"'O' is one thing, but eating 'I' all the time would be awful."`
`In the end, Kanon caved under the threat of 'I' cooking and was forced to apologize to Shannon.`
`Ange was still confused.`
`No point thinking about it anymore.`
`I've got to pull myself together and take a shot at the next one.`
`"See, Ange-chan?`
` Think about the tastes of all these foods!`
` How does white chocolate taste?"`
`"Sweet."`
`"And what about pepper jack cheese?"`
`"Spicy."`
`"Then how about anchovy pizza?`
` And lemonade?!"`
`"...I see, so that's what it is..."`
`"Anchovies are salty.`
` Lemonade is sour.`
` ...So what is it?`
` Do the letters match the tastes?"`
`"That's right!`
` The second letter of sweet is 'W'.`
` The second letter of spicy is 'P', salty is 'A', and sour is 'O'!`
` So, what does black coffee taste like?"`
`"Bitter!"`
`"Exactly!`
` And the second letter of bitter is...`
` Wait, when did you drink coffee?"`
`"Nice job.`
` You got it right, Eva-sama and Ange-sama."`
`"Aunt Eva, you're so awesome!!"`
`"We had to work together to solve that one.`
` It's a team effort."`
`"And here is my medal.`
` Please take it."`
`"All right, I got another medal!`
` Thanks!"`
`"You didn't get it, did you, Kanon-kun?`
` I'll bet it was hard."`
`"...Not bad, coming from you, Nee-san..."`
`"Why don't you try saying 'Sorry for making fun of you'?`
` If you don't, I'll make all your meals 'O' and 'I'."`
`"'O' is one thing, but eating 'I' all the time would be awful."`
`"I wanna eat 'W' all the time!"`
`"Careful, you'll get cavities.`
` But if you ever come to my house to play, I'd be more than willing to share."`
`"Yay!!`
` I love you, Aunt Eva!!"`
`In the end, Kanon caved under the threat of 'I' cooking and was forced to apologize to Shannon...`
`"That's all for our puzzles.`
` Did you enjoy them...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Thanks!"`
`"It seems the others still have some brain-twisters waiting for you.`
` Please be careful."`
`"Good point.`
` Everyone left looks like they'll be a challenge."`
`"But we'll win!`
` We can do it if we work together...!"`
`"That's right.`
` Let's combine our wits and move on!"`
`"Goodbye.`
` And good luck."`
`Shannon and Kanon returned to the kitchen with the serving cart.`
`The dining hall was filled with such an exciting and fun atmosphere,`
` but out here in the corridor, one was reminded of the fierce winds and the rain.`
`But, they were satisfied with this.`
`The whole point of this noisy farewell party was to forget the loneliness of the rain for just a little bit.`
`"...So, we've reached the end of this long game..."`
`"I feel relieved.`
` ...Finally, we won't have to be toys for anyone else.`
` ...I'd like to be quietly forgotten, to get covered with dust and vanish."`
`"You're wrong.`
` We aren't going to vanish like that."`
`"............"`
`"In the world locked inside the cat box, our future will continue, unknown to anyone."`
`"...You're right.`
` ...Sorry.`
` That's a world that even we can't know about, ...so I forgot."`
`"Just what kind of future will we make for ourselves in the cat box world?"`
`"I don't know. That's why it's called a cat box."`
`"......Good point."`
`"Don't you have any regrets, Nee-san?`
` ...About George-sama, for instance?"`
`"........."`
`"Receiving that ring is all you can do for George-sama.`
` As for marriage, living together, and all the rest..."`
`"Our future inside the cat box is what will make all that come true, isn't it?`
` ...I'm not the only one.`
` It's the same for you, right?`
` What about a future for you and Milady Jessica?"`
`"...I'm..."`
`"I could break off my engagement with George-sama, then leave the island and disappear.`
` That future is also possible for me.`
` In that world, you wouldn't have to hesitate for my sake. ...You could enjoy your youth to the fullest with Milady."`
`"...If you gave up on your engagement with George-sama, that sort of world might be possible."`
`"So,`
` ...since it's a cat box, `
`the world where I spend my life with George-sama and the world where you spend your life with Milady can both exist at the same time."`
`"...It's a world where any contradicting dreams can exist at once."`
`"That's the world we'll be put away in as pieces.`
` ...So, there's no need to be lonely, no need to be sad.`
` ...Even though the 'me' here right now can only observe the part where I accept George-sama's ring."`
`The other 'me' who lives in the cat box, in a world I cannot witness,`
` will surely build a happy life in the future...`
`The cat box is such a strange thing, a place where any pieces and toys and dreams can be kept.`
`It's no cage sealing us in.`
`On the contrary, being inside the cat box means being free from everything in countless worlds...`
`"A world where we're freed from everything, and yet where all of our wishes come true.`
` ...However, the 'me' in that world won't be the 'me' here and now.`
` ...That's a bit depressing."`
`"...Hey, Kanon-kun."`
`"Yes...?"`
`"Let's do it."`
`"...Do what?"`
`"Let's have a duel."`
`"......Are you sure?"`
`"We both wish we'd settled this much sooner.`
` And yet, we've put it off until the last moment, just before the game is going to end."`
`"...Sure.`
` ...The game is nearly over anyway.`
` Now, at the very end,`
` ...it's time for us to settle things by ourselves."`
`"That way, we'll be able to see our future before we're put away in the cat box."`
`"...Sure.`
` Let's do it.`
` ...How will we decide it?`
` A coin?`
` Or with pistols again...?"`
`"Ummm, `
`...in that case, why don't we have our own quiz tournament?"`
`"...Huh?`
` ...You're really getting into this."`
`"Okay, then...`
` First question-"`
`"Kihhihihihihihihi!`
` I'm gonna give Ange a reeeeally hard one!`
` I'll trick her with my extra-hard puzzle and make sure she neeever gets my medal!"`
`"I'll solve it.`
` I'll definitely solve it...!"`
`As soon as Maria and Ange crossed gazes, they started fighting.`
`The two girls so close in age were really good friends, but they also fought a lot.`
`Especially when they were opponents in a game.`
`"Maria-chan probably knows tons of different quizzes.`
` This should be interesting.`
` Let's have it."`
`"Kihhihihihi, not now.`
` I'm the star, so I'll go after Mama!"`
`"Really?`
` You're sure it's okay for me to go first?"`
`"Yeah!"`
`"Then let's begin.`
` Ready?`
` Heheheheheh."`
`"Hmmmm... I guess you don't need a hint for this one."`
`"*giggle* You're right.`
` I made it for Ange-chan.`
` It's probably a bit too easy for you, Nee-san."`
`"An hour is 60 minutes, and it takes 8 minutes for each round trip..."`
`"Good luck.`
` I know you can solve it.`
` I won't give you a hint this time."`
`"Huh?`
` Why is that wrong...?!"`
`"Heheh, sorry about that.`
` I guess that was a little mean."`
`"The key to the puzzle is the part about how many can she 'carry out'."`
`...Oh.`
`Looks like I made a pretty simple mistake.`
`I've been taking on so many tricky riddles, I've gotten a bit too tense.`
`"That's all for my puzzle.`
` Now, for the one you've been waiting for.`
` Good luck with Maria's puzzle!"`
`"8 ingots...!"`
`"Heheh, are you sure?`
` It takes eight minutes to carry each ingot to the surface, right?`
` 8x8 is more than 60."`
`"That's right.`
` But the question was 'How many can she carry out of the room?'`
` Rosa only has to take one step out of the room to 'carry it out'."`
`"Nice going, Ange-chan...!`
` All those puzzles have really warmed you up good."`
`"That's right.`
` To do 7 trips, you need 8X7=56 minutes.`
` There are only 4 minutes left.`
` However, you can make it back to the underground room in 3 minutes, then 'carry out' the eighth ingot in the last minute."`
`"Kihihihihihihi...`
` Not bad, Ange!`
` Nice one, uu-."`
`"I'm not gonna lose to you, Maria onee-chan!"`
`"Congratulations.`
` Here's my medal.`
` Now you can try the puzzle Maria picked out just for you."`
`"So, it's finally my turn.`
` Kihihihihi, you took so long on Mama's easy puzzle that I got a little worried.`
` There's no way you'll ever solve this one!"`
`"I've got Aunt Eva with me, and we'll solve it together!"`
`"Kihihihihihi, impossible, impossible, impossible!`
` Even Aunt Eva can't solve this one!`
` Wolves and Sheep puzzles are incredibly hard...!"`
`From her handbag, Maria pulled out a "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle Book" that was worn-out, well-used, and had a majestic feel to it, like a grimoire.`
`"You know what a Wolves and Sheep puzzle is, right?"`
`"I know.`
` You show me those all the time."`
`"They're puzzles about using a boat to take everyone from one shore of a river to another."`
`"They usually have a few bizarre rules.`
` When there's wolves and sheep, you can't let the number of wolves on either shore get bigger than the number of sheep, right?"`
`"Yeah, that's right!`
` Send a boat back and forth, moving everyone to the other side while making sure that there are never more wolves than sheep...!!`
` But the ones with just wolves and sheep are the simplest, easiest, plainest beginner's basic practice puzzles...!"`
`"When you get to the higher levels, you have many things other than wolves and sheep.`
` It's pretty clever."`
`"...Should we write this down on a piece of paper?"`
`"Good idea. That'll definitely make it easier for you to sort out your thoughts."`
`"*sigh* ...Sounds like this puzzle will be a handful."`
`"There's no way you're getting my medal, Ange!`
` Kihihihihihihi!!"`
`"I won't lose. I'm not gonna lose!!"`
`"W-Wait a second...`
` Who ever heard of a puzzle with such complicated rules?!"`
`"Did you only know about the ones with wolves and sheep?`
` It's got lots of complicated puzzles that you've got to deal with in different ways!`
` See?`
` You don't get it either, right, Ange?!`
` Kihihihihihi!"`
`"Please, give me a hint!"`
`"You have to organize your thoughts carefully.`
` Only the three humans can row the boat.`
` Then, you have to memorize all the things to look out for.`
` When the peasant is away, you can't leave his wife with the shepherd.`
` When both the peasant and his wife are away, you can't leave the shepherd with the meat.`
` When the shepherd is away, you can't leave the sheep with the veggies.`
` You also need someone to watch the cow, but any of the humans can do that.`
` Still, I guess the meat is the real key to the whole thing."`
`"...Ah, I see.`
` You can't put it on the boat again once you take it off, but that doesn't mean you can only take it across once."`
`"That's right.`
` The veggies really can make only one trip, so once you've sent them across, you can't get them back.`
` But as long as you don't take the meat off the boat, you can take it back and forth as much as you want."`
`"...It's so complicated.`
` Even after thinking about it, I don't get it at all..."`
`"We'll have to write it down and sort out our ideas.`
` Do you want a pen and paper too, `
`Ange-chan?"`
`"Impossible, impossible! You'll never solve it!`
` If only you'd just give up.`
` Thinking is a waste of time for the incompetent!`
` Kihihihihihihihihi...!"`
`"Can this really be solved?`
` Don't tell me there's actually some contradiction that makes it unsolvable..."`
`"Uuu---?`
` Who knows?`
` Kiiihihihihihihi!"`
`"Kihihihihihihi!!`
` Wrong!`
` You can't even do this one?!`
` You suck, Ange, kihihihihihihihihihi, `
`ouch!"`
`"Maria!`
` Show some manners!"`
`I thought so hard before getting that answer, but Maria onee-chan just burst out laughing.`
`The laughter broke off when Aunt Rosa hit her, but then she was grinning again.`
`"I don't get it at all. What was the difficulty level for this one...?"`
`"Just about 20 picarats, I guess?`
` Lots of the puzzles in this book are much, much harder!"`
`I don't know what a pica-thing is,`
` but apparently, even this puzzle doesn't count as a hard one for Maria onee-chan...`
`I hung my head dejectedly.`
`Maria onee-chan kept on laughing until Aunt Rosa smacked her again.`
`"This really is a nasty problem. Can it really be solved?`
` Is there some trick to it, like throwing things into the river without using the boat, `
`or making the cow eat the vegetables so that they can be carried as one passenger...?"`
`"Well, who knows?`
` If that's as far as you can go, maybe you should give up, right...?"`
`"This one's really hard!`
` Even Mama couldn't solve it!`
` But I solved it on my first try!"`
`"So, do you get it?`
` How many trips does it take to get every person across?"`
`"This isn't a cheap trick or a riddle, right?`
` There's no way you can solve this straightforwardly, right?!"`
`"No, that's not true.`
` I'm sure you'll get it Nee-san, smart as you are.`
` How many trips does it take to get every person across?"`
`"I've got it.`
` Three trips."`
`"...Huh?`
` Three?!`
` How...?!"`
`"It's easy.`
` The peasant and his wife get on the boat, then the wife gets dropped off on the other side in the first move.`
` Then, the peasant takes the boat back across in the second move.`
` Then, he crosses with the shepherd in the third move."`
`"But what about the cow and the sheep?!`
` What about the meat and the vegetables?!"`
`"But Aunt Eva, it said to take every person across, right?`
` Those other things aren't people."`
`"Huh? Ah......"`
`As Aunt Eva's mouth flopped open, Aunt Rosa started applauding.`
` After clicking her tongue, Maria onee-chan joined in.`
`"That's right.`
` The question just asks how many moves it would take to move each person across.`
` The animals and luggage never had anything to do with it."`
`"They only got it because you kept saying 'every person' over and over again, Mama.`
` Uu!"`
`Aunt Rosa had probably said it so much as a sort of hint.`
` Without that, even I wouldn't have figured it out.`
`"Come on.`
` I was totally taken in.`
` That was a mean question!"`
`"Go on, Maria.`
` Give Ange-chan her medal."`
`"Uu-uu-uu-..."`
`Whining like a unhappy dog, she reluctantly handed the medal over.`
`I grabbed it and started jumping around like a happy dog.`
`As Maria onee-chan smiled at me from behind, ...her face was bright, just like a big sister's.`
`"That's the end of our riddles.`
` Let's play again sometime, okay?"`
`"Next time, I'll have a really nasty puzzle that's even harder...!`
` One so hard that even I couldn't solve it!"`
`"No way!`
` I'm not playing with Maria onee-chan anymore...!!"`
`"*giggle*`
` Look, Ange-chan.`
` Your parents are waving at you, so let's go.`
` See you later, Rosa."`
`"Sure.`
` Later, Ange-chan.`
` There aren't too many people left with puzzles for you.`
` Keep it up until the end.`
` And make sure you keep cheering her on, Nee-san."`
`"Of course.`
` We got all these medals by working together, right?"`
`"Yeah!"`
`We dashed away.`
`Dad and Mom are waving at me from over there.`
`I'm sure they've thought up some mean problems.`
`Still, they have to be easier than Maria onee-chan's...!`
`I hate Maria onee-chan! She's such a meanie!`
`"Uryu-.`
` You bullied her too much with that puzzle..."`
`"Well, I wanted to play with Ange a lot.`
` If it was an easy one, she'd solve it right away, right?"`
`"You really love Ange, don't you?"`
`"I hate her.`
` She made fun of you and called you a stuffed animal."`
`Maria pouted as she said this, but her expression didn't match her words at all.`
`"I hope Ange finds happiness."`
`"I'm sure she will.`
` After all, look at all the people here wishing for her happiness.`
` And now, Battler is the Game Master, and he's set up this final game just for Ange.`
` ...After all this, there's no way she won't be happy."`
`"...Still, even though anyone can make happiness appear, you can only ever grasp it for yourself."`
`"That's right.`
` That kid is really bad at finding Fragments of happiness.`
` Even though we tried to teach her how, she's been covering her ears for 12 full years.`
` ...This game might be much harder for Ange than Battler thinks."`
`"...I'm sure Ange will find happiness."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...If she really does enjoy herself at this party,`
` that itself might be the greatest lesson we can teach her now."`
`Ange is the girl who doesn't believe and says that everything is a trick, no matter what magic is shown to her...`
`12 years in the future, that girl will become the last person to inherit Beatrice's name.`
`"At one point in time, that kid understood my white magic."`
`"Yeah.`
` And she understood me too."`
`"She even summoned all of the Seven Sisters and understood magic itself.`
` ...And yet, she still can't use magic on herself."`
`"Let us believe.`
` Just as Battler did once, in the past."`
`"...Beato."`
`"It is easy to cast magic on others.`
` And believing in other people's magic is not so difficult.`
` The hardest thing is casting magic on yourself."`
`"Is that...something Ange can do...?"`
`"She can.`
` Even Battler managed to understand magic.`
` Of course his little sister will be able to do the same."`
`"You're right.`
` ...There are some kinds of magic that we can only see when we're kids.`
` ...And there are some that only adults can understand.`
` Right now, Ange is between the two of those."`
`"She's lost the magic of children, but she has yet to understand the magic of adults. It's the most painful period of one's life."`
`"It's so sad...that she didn't have anyone close to her at a time like that..."`
`"That's not true.`
` We're always by that kid's side.`
` She just doesn't believe it."`
`Ange, please, realize that quickly.`
`There are so many people smiling at you from behind, watching over you.`
`If you just turn around, we'll be able to smile so much more...and talk to you so much more.`
`......You're ANGE Beatrice, the final witch of Mariage Sorcière.`
`"Even if you aren't able to do the right thing in the end,`
` ...I pray that you can at least enjoy yourself tonight..."`
`Have fun, Ange.`
`So long.`
`The time we spent together feels so long, yet so short.`
`Even so, for me, those memories are eternal...`
`"How's it going, Ange?`
` Did you get a ton of medals?"`
`"I wonder how many it is now!"`
`"Me too.`
` Let's count them later, okay?!"`
`"It seems you've been given quite a few puzzles already."`
`"Yeah.`
` Once I get your puzzles, I think only the cousins are left."`
`"Is that so, huh?`
` All right.`
` Time to take a shot at Mom and Dad's puzzles!`
` I'll warn you, they're gonna be hard!"`
`"Everyone says the same thing, but we just keep on solving them!"`
`"Yeah!`
` We'll get those medals together!"`
`"*giggle*`
` That's the spirit.`
` Okay, I guess I'll go first."`
`"Ah, it's a classic liar puzzle.`
` Those are the ones I'm best at."`
`"Don't you mean lying is what you're best at?"`
`Wow.`
` I didn't think Dad's ears could stretch that far.`
`"Only one of them is speaking the truth.`
` And both of the others are lying.`
` So, if you find an answer where two of them are telling the truth, it's wrong."`
`"...I don't really get it.`
` I want some more hints."`
`"That's all for my hint.`
` If you want more, try talking to Aunt Eva."`
`"Aunt Eva!"`
`"Rika is the key.`
` Rika says that Miyoko is a liar.`
` So, if Miyoko is speaking the truth, then Rika is a liar, and if Miyoko is lying, then Rika is speaking the truth.`
` ...In other words, since that pair contradicts each other, we know that one of them is lying and one is telling the truth."`
`"That's Eva nee-san for you.`
` Exactly.`
` In liar games like this one, when you see a pair that contradicts each other, you know that one of them must be telling the truth.`
` Neither of them is Satoko, so she's already confirmed as a liar.`
` ...*giggle* Looks like the answer's already popped up."`
`"Ummm, ......???"`
`"Too bad, but that's not it."`
`"I guess Ange's still too little for that one."`
`"Am not!`
` I just made a little mistake!`
` I'll get it right next time. So, one more...!"`
`"Aw, and you were so close too..."`
`"Then you can make up for it with my puzzle.`
` Okay, let's try another one of those liar games.`
` Will you be able to get it this time?"`
`"Rika!"`
`"That's right!`
` Nice job, Ange-chan!`
` Hard to imagine such a smart girl being related to that dolt of a father!"`
`"Yeah, sorry for being a dolt.`
` Nice going, Ange!`
` Did you think of all the combinations?"`
`"Yeah.`
` If Miyoko is the oldest, then what Satoko says is true.`
` Only the oldest person is supposed to tell the truth, so that doesn't make sense."`
`"That's right.`
` Then what if Satoko is the oldest?"`
`"If she is, then Rika would be telling the truth when she says Miyoko is a liar, which doesn't work.`
` So, Rika has to be the oldest."`
`"Good job.`
` Here's my medal for you.`
` Congrats."`
`"Thank you, Mom!"`
`"Rudolf is up next.`
` I wonder what sort of puzzle he has for us."`
`"Well, guess I'll do a liar puzzle too.`
` Let's crank it up a notch this time..."`
`"They're all wearing masks, ...and except for Miyoko, we can't tell if they're lying or telling the truth.`
` ...This one's hard."`
`"No, it isn't.`
` I've already figured it out.`
` This is even easier than the one your mom gave a second ago."`
`"Why?"`
`"You can't trust the two who aren't Miyoko, so you first need to figure out who Miyoko is.`
` Miyoko doesn't lie, right?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Miyoko doesn't lie."`
`"So, start off by figuring out who Miyoko is, then read through the puzzle again.`
` I'm sure you'll see it at once."`
`"Just think about who Miyoko is...`
` Okay, I've got it."`
`"You really do whatever Eva nee-san tells you."`
`"Yeah.`
` Aunt Eva is nice and smart, and I like her.`
` So I do what she tells me!"`
`"Next time we try to feed Ange eggplant and bell peppers, we'll need to ask her to lend a hand."`
`"*giggle*giggle*..."`
`"Toooo bad!!`
` That's wrong."`
`"Huh?!`
` I got it wrong? I got it wrong?!"`
`"Later on, try thinking it over with Aunt Eva.`
` I'm sure you'll figure it out soon."`
`"Think about it.`
` Miyoko speaks the truth, right?`
` So, is it possible for someone to be Miyoko if they say the person next to them is Miyoko?"`
`Miyoko speaks the truth.`
`So, she should say that she is Miyoko.`
` She wouldn't say that someone else was Miyoko.`
`...Once you realize that, it's probably easy to figure out who Miyoko is.`
`I've figured out the knack of it, but too late.`
` Too bad...`
`"I know who Miyoko is.`
` She's on the left.`
` After all, the girls in the middle and on the right both say that someone else is Miyoko. `
`If they were Miyoko, they couldn't lie and say that someone else was Miyoko."`
`"That's right.`
` Miyoko is supposed to be honest.`
` So, once someone says that someone else is Miyoko, they can't be her."`
`"So, since the middle one and the right one aren't Miyoko, the left one automatically is.`
` And since Miyoko speaks the truth, then it's also true that the kid on the right is Satoko."`
`"Which means that the only kid left, the one in the middle, is Rika.`
` Perfect!"`
`"You solved it like it was nothing!`
` Ange, you really are smart like your Mom!"`
`Dad rubbed my cheek and hugged me.`
`"That's all for our puzzles."`
`"Listen up, Ange.`
` Life will lead you through countless puzzles.`
` ...Aunt Eva is here to help you now, so it's okay to rely on her.`
` However, you'll have to solve most problems in life by yourself.`
` When that happens, you must remember the advice you've gotten from those who have helped you in the past."`
`"Okay.`
` I get it."`
`"...Eva nee-san,`
` take care of Ange."`
`"Yes, of course."`
`Even though the cousins were the only ones who hadn't given us puzzles,`
` Mom spoke as though I was leaving on a long, long trip.`
` ...Weird.`
`"Let's go, Ange-chan.`
` The game will be over soon."`
`"I wonder what Grandpa will give us for getting all these medals...!"`
`"Me too.`
` Still, we've already gotten many things that are far more wonderful than that prize."`
`"What do you mean...?"`
`"We've all had a lot of fun talking to you like this, Ange-chan."`
`"......?`
` I don't get it.`
` You're weird."`
`"I'm sorry.`
` Let's go then.`
` Now, all that's left are the cousins and Beatrice, I guess."`
`"What is it?`
` Why did you tell me to come over here?`
` ......Is it something to do with Ange?"`
`"No, that's not it.`
` ............"`
`Rudolf put a cigarette in his mouth and toyed with his lighter.`
`...Though he should have done this easily, he somehow managed to mess up several times.`
`"I...wanted to take this to my grave.`
` ...No, to hide it away in a cat box.`
` If I just kept my mouth shut until tomorrow night, I'd be able to do that.`
` It'd be easy."`
`"............"`
`"I...might be killed tonight.`
` ...That's what I wanted to talk about."`
`"...I knew it.`
` I knew you were hiding something."`
`"Did you?`
` Guess I still need more practice."`
`"......If it isn't about Ange, then who is it about?`
` You aren't talking about Asumu-san, right...?"`
`"It's about Battler."`
`"...It comes to the same thing.`
` I've tried to behave as an adult towards Battler-kun, right?`
` Even though he's Asumu's son, I've tried to treat him the same as Ange.`
` I do think of him as a child in our family, so don't worry."`
`"He's not just a kid in our family.`
` He's my kid and yours."`
`"I'm sorry, but you'll have to let me draw the line there."`
`"You don't get it.`
` He's my kid...and yours."`
`"......What?"`
`"You didn't have a stillbirth.`
` Asumu did.`
` ...Back then, when I was double-timing the two of you, I got myself stuck and couldn't find a way out..."`
`"You don't...mean..."`
`"...Asumu and I were married.`
` You and I were cheating.`
` Then, Asumu had a stillbirth, and you gave birth.`
` ...My head was a mess with it all."`
`The sin Rudolf committed when his mind was at its most chaotic...`
`...was to switch the two babies.`
`"I was even better off financially back then.`
` I was young, and I didn't give a damn about what lengths I went to.`
` ...I threatened the hospital while slapping them with money...and switched your kid with Asumu's."`
`If Kyrie had a child, Rudolf would have to maintain two households.`
`However, if Kyrie had a stillbirth and the child who survived was Asumu's, that would settle everything.`
`...The stillbirth might even have given him a chance to break off his relationship with Kyrie.`
`...It was a grave sin, one that simply couldn't be forgiven as an act of youthful enthusiasm and immaturity.`
`"......That's why...I should be apologizing to all three of you.`
` ...I forced Asumu to raise a kid that wasn't hers.`
` ...That woman wasn't anywhere near as generous and accepting as she looked.`
` ...There's a chance she figured it out.`
` ...However, she raised Battler, who loved her as a mother, with all the affection she had."`
`And in Kyrie and Battler's cases, ...he had to atone for an even greater sin.`
`He stole every moment of everyday family life that they should have shared as mother and son.`
`Until this very day, Kyrie had believed that Battler was Asumu's child.`
`Though she had acted kindly towards him on the surface, she had always kept a distance in her heart between herself and Asumu's son.`
`Finally, ...Rudolf's conscience had been unable to bear seeing her like that.`
`"...But, ...I..."`
`Kyrie sank into a crouch, unable to speak.`
`"...Feel free to curse me.`
` In fact, I couldn't complain if you killed me where I stand.`
` That's how horrible my sin against you is.`
` ...This is the secret I wanted to confess before the cat box closes over us."`
`"Battler...kun......"`
`"I'm so sorry, Kyrie.`
` ...And to you, Battler......"`
`"Come to think of it, we've already gone through a ton of puzzles."`
`"Yeah.`
` Now, there's only George onii-chan, Jessica onee-chan, Battler onii-chan, and Beatrice left."`
`"Oh, they're finally here."`
`"We could hardly wait.`
` Thought you might have forgotten about us."`
`Finally, we challenged George onii-chan and Jessica onee-chan.`
`"Sorry to keep you two waiting.`
` So, did you think up some incredibly hard ones for us?"`
`"We decided to give you one puzzle together."`
`"My, my, even one riddle from this pair sounds challenging."`
`"It's a special puzzle we made just for Ange-chan, so good luck."`
`"I'll solve it. I'll definitely solve it!"`
`"Okay, then let's go.`
` Jessica-chan, let's set them out."`
`"There you go."`
`They placed three small, colorful, cubic boxes on the table.`
`"Two of these are traps!`
` The other has a medal inside."`
`"Ange-chan, do you think you can guess which one has the medal in it...?"`
`"Not without a hint.`
` That would just be luck!"`
`"That's right. So far, this is just a test of luck with three choices.`
` In other words, your odds of winning are one in three."`
`"George,`
` this isn't a quiz.`
` It really is just a test of luck."`
`"The puzzle comes later.`
` Let's continue."`
`"Okay, Ange.`
` Which of these has a medal inside, do you think?`
` Just say the first one that pops into your head."`
`A red box, a blue box, and a green box.`
`There's no way to know which one it's in.`
`...This really is...a test of luck.`
`In a way, this is even worse than a hard puzzle.`
`After all, if you solve a hard puzzle, you'll always be right.`
`...But in the very beginning, I picked the almond with a 1 in 15 chance.`
`Compared to that, a 1 in 3 chance is 5 times easier to get.`
`There's no point worrying about it.`
` Might as well test my luck again.`
`"Then, ......this one."`
`"The red box?`
` Then let's set this box right in front of you.`
` ...Wouldn't it be great if there was a medal inside?`
` So, let's start with a little warm-up.`
` What's the probability of the medal being inside that red box?"`
`"1 in 3."`
`"That's right.`
` If this really is a simple test of luck."`
`"Heheheheh.`
` Are you sure, Ange?`
` Are you aaabsolutely sure you're happy with that red box?`
` After all, we're gonna make you open it in a second.`
` ...If it's a trap, it'll be reeeally scary."`
`Jessica onee-chan grinned threateningly.`
`"Are you happy with the red box?`
` ...The medal might be in the blue box or the green box.`
` Do you want to change your mind?"`
`It's not fair for them to scare me like that, not after I've already made my choice.`
`And I know.`
`All of the boxes have the same probability of having a medal in them.`
` Whether I try to open the red box or change my mind and try the blue or green boxes, the probability will be the same.`
`So, stick with your first choice is my motto.`
` I'll stay with this red box.`
` I won't change my mind.`
`"I'm happy with the red box.`
` I'll bet on it!"`
`"That's the spirit.`
` But seriously, the traps are terrifying.`
` Why don't we show you just how scary they are?"`
`Jessica onee-chan laughed creepily, then opened the green box.`
`And then, `
`*bang*!`
` Pumpkin monsters and ribbon came flying out of the box.`
`...It scared me a little.`
` ...No, that's a lie.`
` It scared me a lot...`
`If that came flying out of the box I opened, right at my face, I might fall to my knees and start crying...`
`"Ange, are you sure you want the red box...?`
` Something really scary might come flying out, okay...?`
` Are you sure you don't want to switch to the blue box...?"`
`"I'm not scared!`
` I'll stick with the red box!"`
`"Hahahahaha, you're going a bit overboard, Jessica-chan.`
` So, one of the boxes is now gone, and there's only two left.`
` This is where the puzzle starts, Ange-chan."`
`"You mean, which box is the medal in?"`
`"We have the red box that's been sitting in front of you the whole time, and the blue box here in front of me.`
` Which has a higher probability of having a medal inside it?`
` That's the puzzle."`
`"Even though we don't know what's inside, there are two boxes, so there's a 50-50 chance of the medal being in either.`
` ...They're both the same, aren't they?"`
`"...I thought that too.`
` Still, that would make the answer too obvious, wouldn't it?`
` I wonder if there's some trick here..."`
`Or, that itself might be the trick, and the obvious answer could be the right one.`
`It might be one of those classic puzzles that trips you up by making you think too hard and suspiciously.`
`"......`
`I have two questions for you two. Is that okay?"`
`"Go ahead."`
`"Who do these three boxes belong to?`
` You, Jessica-chan?"`
`"Well, yeah."`
`"In other words, you know which colors are traps, right?"`
`"Yeah, of course."`
`"Thanks.`
` And now for my second question.`
` A second ago, you opened one of the boxes to show us how scary the traps were.`
` Would you have done that no matter which of the boxes Ange-chan chose?"`
`"That's right.`
` I figured giving her a bit of a scare would make for a nice psychological warfare tactic."`
`"Thanks.`
` Those hints will be enough."`
`"Hints?`
` Huh...??"`
`I'm completely lost.`
`How were Aunt Eva's questions just now hints...?`
`"Sorry.`
` That's wrong."`
`"What?!`
` ...Wh-Why?!"`
`We started with three boxes.`
`When they set the red box in front of me, the odds of there being a medal inside were, obviously, one in three.`
`At the same time, the odds for the blue box were one in three, as were the odds for the green box.`
`Jessica onee-chan opened the green box, so there were then only two boxes left, and the odds became 50-50.`
`So, ...why was I wrong...???`
`"...It was you George, wasn't it?`
` You thought this puzzle up.`
` Did the Monty Hall problem even exist in 1986?"`
`"Nope, not until 1990.`
` It's a puzzle that already exists in Ange-chan's world, so I thought it'd be okay to use it."`
`"George nii-san ran me through the answer, but I was totally lost.`
` ...Anyway, I don't get the details, but in this case, `
`the odds of the blue box having the medal are about twice the odds of the red box having it."`
`Twice the odds?`
` ...Even if there was a difference, I thought it'd be a tiny one.`
`...Probability is hard.`
`Didn't Onii-chan once say that people who don't get probability should never go gambling?`
`...I guess I'll never gamble for the rest of my life...`
`Aunt Eva nodded and patted my head encouragingly...`
`"Oh.`
` ...The odds are better for the blue box!"`
`"Hmmm.`
` And why is that?"`
`"Well, ...I-I just sorta..."`
`"Think back to the 15 slice cake that you found the almond in.`
` If there was only one almond, the odds of winning were 1 in 15, right?"`
`"Yeah.`
` 1 in 15."`
`I figured that out when the cake first appeared.`
`I'd thought that waiting for a lot of people to get wrong ones would make my chances for winning higher.`
`But, in the end, no matter when I ate my slice, the odds were still 1 in 15.`
`"Still, Ange-chan,`
` what if the servants were also having cake, `
`and it started with 20 slices?"`
`"......Huh?`
` ...What...?"`
`"This is a party, right?`
` It's not fair that the servants don't get any cake, don't you think?`
` So, let's say it was originally a 20 slice cake.`
` The servants took out 5 slices, then redecorated it as a 15 slice cake and let you choose a slice.`
` If so, what would your chances of choosing the right slice be?"`
`If there really were 20 slices,`
` ......then the chances would be 1 in 20.`
`"However, the servants know where the almond is, so they chose 5 slices for themselves that had no almonds.`
` In other words, they removed 5 losing slices.`
` That would mean your chances of winning were 1 in 15, not 1 in 20."`
`"...They took out losing slices, so the odds would obviously go up."`
`"Just now, Jessica-san did the same thing.`
` Jessica-chan removed one of the two boxes you didn't choose.`
` In other words, the odds that the remaining box you didn't choose was the winner went up a bit, right...?"`
`"Ahahahahahahahah, ...I sort of get it, but not really..."`
`If you remove a losing box, it's only natural that your chances of getting the right one go up.`
`And just now, Jessica onee-chan removed a losing box 'from the pair of boxes I didn't choose'.`
`So, doesn't it make sense that my odds of winning with 'those boxes' went up...?`
`"...Now I'm getting confused..."`
`"Actually, you really are incredible, Ange-chan.`
` Even though you're only six, you're trying to understand posterior probability, a concept in probability theory.`
` Probability really is interesting.`
` I'm sure you'll like it when you get into high school and college.`
` Go and enjoy studying it all you can."`
`My little head was already filled to the brim.`
`Bewildered, I had to beg Aunt Eva for an explanation.`
`Aunt Eva wore a bitter smile too.`
` I'll bet she doesn't really get it herself.`
`As we felt a sense of connection through this failure, we happily grasped the medals we had wrangled out of them...`
`"Ange-chan,`
` could you come over here for a second?"`
`"......?`
` What is it, George onii-chan?"`
`George onii-chan and Jessica onee-chan were calling to me from the window.`
`Aunt Eva was talking with Mom and the others, and since it looked like they'd be a while, I went over to George onii-chan and Jessica onee-chan.`
`"What?"`
`"It looks like the quiz tournament is almost over."`
`"Yeah.`
` There's only Battler onii-chan and Beatrice left.`
` ...I'm starting to get sleepy."`
`It's probably because of that adult drink I swiped from Dad.`
`I've felt floaty ever since I drank that.`
` ...That floaty feeling keeps getting stronger, and I've been feeling sleepy for a while now.`
`I gave a huge yawn.`
`"Sleepy?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` If I had a sofa, I'd probably fall asleep."`
`"I see.`
` ...Then I guess it's almost time for this party to end."`
`"......?"`
`...The party will end if I fall asleep?`
`But I just wanted to take a nap while everyone else kept having fun.`
`"Was our puzzle just now a hard one?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` I still don't really get it.`
` ...And, ...I'm sleepy..."`
`"It's called posterior probability.`
` That's what we call it when the probability of something changes because we learn or fail to learn some piece of information."`
`"............"`
`Did George onii-chan call me all the way over here to lecture me on math...?`
`...For some reason, I feel even sleepier now.`
`"So, `
`if we have one almond in ten slices of cake, our chances of getting it are 10%.`
` ...But what if 'we learn' that those ten pieces were chosen at random from a hundred pieces?"`
`"You'd think that the probability went from 1 in 10 to 1 in 100, right...?"`
`"Absolutely nothing has changed about your slice of cake.`
` ...Depending on whether you know or don't know a certain fact,`
` the probability of your slice being a winner changes.`
` Doesn't that sound strange?"`
`"...That sounds hard, so I don't wanna think about it..."`
`"Ange,`
` please, just listen until the end."`
`Jessica onee-chan's voice grew a bit stern.`
`As young as I was, ...I couldn't understand what all this was supposed to mean to me.`
`"There's only one thing I want to tell you.`
` So please, don't forget this."`
`"...What?"`
`"In the future,`
` various bits of information will affect the slice of cake in your hands.`
` ...By learning about those, the insides of your slice might change.`
` Sometimes, they'll change into things you want.`
` ...But, most likely, almost all of the changes will be bad ones."`
`"The truth is always right there in your hands, Ange.`
` ...Don't you think it's stupid to let it change around just because you hear other people talking? Just because they think the truth should be one thing or another?"`
`"The truth inside of you has been in your hands since the beginning.`
` ...The nature of that truth...is actually something you decide for yourself.`
` ...You change it yourself depending on what you hear...and what you refuse to listen to."`
`"You probably don't get what we're saying.`
` But you have to understand.`
` Even if you can't understand when you're 6 years old, I'm sure you will once 12 years have passed."`
`"............"`
`With very serious expressions on their faces, they grasped my shoulders as they spoke.`
`...I don't know what they're trying to tell me.`
`"The truth that lies in your hands is not unchangeable.`
` You'll be interfered with in many ways that'll make it change.`
` ...So, if the truth in your hands is really important to you..."`
`"You need to protect it yourself.`
` Don't forget it."`
`"............"`
`"Next is Onii-chan and Beatrice's puzzles, and then I'm done."`
`"Ah, really?`
` Even though there were so many of us, it looks like it's finally over."`
`"How was it?`
` Did you enjoy tonight's party...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` It was fun.`
` But I think I'm a bit sleepy."`
`"...That's no surprise, `
`considering how much we've been running around."`
`I rubbed my eyes.`
`I must've gotten really excited.`
`But whenever I get excited, I'm always tired afterwards.`
`Right now, I'd rather have a sofa to lie on than medals.`
`"I've got a special puzzle just for you, ...but are you sure you want it?`
` If you're sleepy, you can stop now."`
`"No.`
` I've come this far, so I'll keep going...`
` ......*yaaawn*..."`
`Onii-chan and Beato laughed at my yawn.`
`"Looks like it's time to call it a day..."`
`"Indeed.`
` Ange,`
` let us leave my puzzle for later.`
` It's too difficult to be solved by one with eyes as sleepy as that."`
`"......No way.`
` ...I've...come this far, and...`
` ...I also want...Onii-chan's medal......"`
`I'm just so...so sleepy...`
`............`
`Ange drifted over to a chair in the corner of the room and plopped down onto it.`
`Then, she closed her eyes and sat there like a doll.`
`It didn't take long before the cute sound of her breathing in her sleep could be heard...`
`When she saw that Ange was finally asleep, Beato spoke softly.`
`"Quiet please, everyone.`
` ...Ange fell asleep."`
`When she spoke, the peaceful clatter that filled the room fell silent.`
`Everyone looked down into Ange's sleeping face.`
`Each of them wore an affectionate gaze, as if they'd just watched a baby finally drift to sleep.`
`"...Did Ange-chan have a good time?"`
`"But of course.`
` ...The feeling might not be so strong now,`
` but one day, she will surely remember tonight's party and understand how fun it was."`
`"...You're right."`
`"...It was fun for us too, getting to play with Ange-chan."`
`By this point, everyone was standing in a wide circle around Ange as she slept.`
`Now that the guest of honor was asleep, ...this Halloween party had reached its conclusion...`
`"So long, my granddaughter.`
` ...I was so pleased to have this chance to play with you again after 12 years.`
` ...It matters not if you forget everything about me.`
` Remember me as an arrogant despot.`
` ...But, every now and then, just try and remember how much I adored you."`
`"She will remember.`
` ...Ange-san,`
` you have a long life ahead of you.`
` Even after 12 years, there is still much for you to experience.`
` I pray that you find this life meaningful and worthwhile."`
`"...You are the final grandchild and daughter of the Ushiromiya family.`
` All of us pray for your happiness."`
`"Ange-chan,`
` stay well.`
` ...Happiness isn't something you find, it's something you make.`
` And in fact, memories work the same way."`
`"True.`
` ...There are some things that we only truly understand when we think back on them years later."`
`"Make sure you remember my pretty face every now and then.`
` Just havin' you remember us is the greatest memorial service we could ever have."`
`"Oh, come on.`
` It's not like we're dying.`
` We're just going to the inside of the cat box, ...the other side of the curtain."`
`"That's right.`
` It's not even a curtain.`
` It's just like we are now.`
` Ange-chan's there sleepin' away.`
` The rest of us are right by her side, watchin' over her.`
` We'll always be with her."`
`All of them still wore warm smiles, but the sound of sniffling came from several places throughout the room...`
`This party wasn't only for the girl who wasn't able to be here this day.`
`It was also for all those people who weren't able to meet her here,`
` ...who never had the chance to say goodbye...`
`"Ange,`
` live life strongly.`
` ...Our blood flows through your veins.`
` That'll definitely bring you strength."`
`"...Eva nee-san,`
` take care of our daughter.`
` ...She's not honest with herself, and she'll often be selfish and short-tempered.`
` She might be a pain all the time, but..."`
`"I'll make sure...she finds happiness.`
` As long as she wants it herself..."`
`"Ange-sama, ...it's okay if you forget my face.`
` But please, at least remember the taste of my cooking...!"`
`"Hohhohohohohohohoho.`
` And I won't ask you to remember old Kumasawa.`
` But please, at least remember the taste of mackerel juice."`
`Someone said "When'd you feed her that?!" and everyone laughed wryly.`
`"Her face looks so cute, sleeping there like that.`
` ...She looks like an angel, just like her name."`
`"She's not an angel, she's a witch.`
` Ange's the final witch, ANGE Beatrice."`
`"I wonder if that magic will bring her happiness."`
`"Will she become a white witch or a black witch?`
` ...That's for Ange to choose.`
` I've shown her both sides."`
`"I'm sure a painful life lies ahead for you.`
` You'll probably believe that you're all alone in this world.`
` ...But we will always be there right behind you, cheering you on.`
` Don't forget that..."`
`"Ange,`
` ...don't forget.`
` Your self, your happiness, your fate...`
` These are all things you create for yourself.`
` Only you can choose them.`
` No one else can give you them, and no one else can hide them from you.`
` ...Don't forget that."`
`"I'm sure your message reached her."`
`"...I hope so."`
`"I'm certain the tale of the two of us will help Ange-sama understand."`
`"......Yeah."`
`"Don't you have anything to tell her, George-sama?"`
`"...I've already said all I wanted with that box puzzle."`
`"Will that puzzle teach her something?"`
`"I don't know.`
` But I do know that she's wise.`
` I'm sure she'll learn something from it."`
`"...Ange-sama,`
` I pray that you're guided along the right path as you move towards the future."`
`One by one, they stepped forward and said words of farewell to Ange.`
`Then, finally, Battler and Beato walked forward...`
`"Ange,`
` ...were you able to remember everyone, at least a little bit?"`
`Of course, Ange didn't answer in her sleep.`
`But Battler continued.`
`"It's true that the Ushiromiyas are a strange family.`
` We're super-rich, and that's given rise to all sorts of rumors and stories.`
` ...However, that's all speculation made by people outside the island."`
`"...No one will blame you for forgetting these kind memories, young as you were.`
` But even so, you must remember.`
` ...It is not a sin to forget.`
` ...But to not remember again...is a sin."`
`"All of us...`
`...were really happy to have you at this party.`
` Right, everyone?"`
`Everyone nodded at Battler's words.`
`Everyone knew about the merciless and lonely life that awaited her.`
`It was no longer possible for them to heal those wounds.`
`If there was one thing they could do...`
`...It was to make her remember what a kind, fun family she once had.`
` ...To remind her that, both today and into the future, they would always care for her and watch over her.`
`"It goes without saying...`
`that this is an illusion.`
` You cannot come to Rokkenjima on October 4th, 1986.`
` This whole party we shared was all a magical illusion, created by the Game Master, Battler."`
`"But you've remembered, right...?`
` You've remembered the truth...`
`...about how kind everyone was, and how much of a blast we all had at the family conferences, right...?"`
`Ange breathed softly in her sleep.`
`Who knows...if those words truly reached her...?`
`"Aunt Eva."`
`"............"`
`"...Take care of her."`
`"Do you...really think...that I deserve to become her mother...?"`
`"I do.`
` ...Even though your own sadness was so unbearable,`
` ...you tried so hard to be a mother for Ange."`
`"But, in the end......"`
`"It's okay.`
` ...Ange, listen carefully."`
`Battler grasped Ange's hand, then took Eva's hand and joined the two hands together...`
`"...We know that a tragic fate leads to a future where you two hurt each other.`
` ...It's a sad thing for Ange...and just as sad for Aunt Eva.`
` ...It would've been cruel to ask you to open your heart to her.`
` Likewise, it would've been cruel to ask Aunt Eva to keep on overcoming her sadness after being rejected."`
`"...Neither of you `
`is at fault."`
`"Even so, we have no right to tell you to forgive her.`
` ...So, we won't.`
` ...Just try and understand.`
` It doesn't matter how long it takes, how far into the future it happens.`
` Just try and understand Aunt Eva.`
` And, every once in a while, ......remember us."`
`"I concur.`
` And, every once in a while, remember this merry, cheerful, attractive paragon of a woman, and chant my name in praise three times every day."`
`The relatives smiled bitterly, apparently disagreeing with some of that last bit.`
`Eva softly stroked Ange's cheek and spoke one last time.`
`"...It's okay if you don't forgive your aunt.`
` ...But...`
`it's true that I don't hate you.`
` ...At least understand that..."`
`Eva wiped her eyes and slowly stood up.`
` Hideyoshi held her shoulder, and Rudolf and Kyrie gathered around her too.`
`"...Genji-san,`
` would you mind carrying Ange to somewhere she can lie down?"`
`"As you wish.`
` ...Shall I take her to the guesthouse?"`
`"It would be a little too sad to leave her there all alone."`
`"You're right.`
` ...Could you carry her to a sofa in the parlor?`
` That way, she'll be able to come back if she wakes up and feels like joining in again."`
`Genji gently lifted Ange up and carried her towards the parlor.`
`Everyone continued to watch over her as she left...`
`"Shannon, Kanon.`
` In the end, how many medals did Ange gather?"`
`"...She didn't get any medals."`
`"...She got 1 medal."`
`"...She got 2 medals."`
`"...She got 3 medals."`
`"...She got 4 medals."`
`"...She got 5 medals."`
`"...She got 6 medals."`
`"...She got 7 medals."`
`"...She got 8 medals."`
`"...She got 9 medals."`
`"...She got 10 medals."`
`"...She got 11 medals."`
`"...She got 12 medals."`
`"...She got 13 medals."`
`"...She got 14 medals."`
`"...She got 15 medals."`
`"...She got 16 medals."`
`"...She got `
` medals."`
`"Hmm, I see.`
` ...Then place this by her pillow."`
`"Yes, `
`as you wish."`
`Genji carried Ange to the parlor and set her down on the sofa.`
`Shannon quietly laid a warm blanket on top of her.`
`Kanon placed a message card by her pillow, along with that thing Kinzo had handed them.`
`The message card read as follows:`
`We'll all be with you, always.`
`--From the whole Ushiromiya family`
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ...`
`.`
`Ange, mumbling in her sleep, held it tightly against her cheek.`
`"Let us go.`
` We mustn't wake her."`
`"Nee-san."`
`"...Yeah.`
` ......?"`
`Shannon thought she saw something glittering silver near Ange's eye...`
`The servants left and closed the parlor door.`
`As Ange slept, she was wrapped up in the soft sound of the rain.`
`Surely, she was reliving that fun evening once more in her dreams...`
`After putting Ange to sleep in the parlor, Genji and the others returned.`
`"Thanks.`
` Was she sleeping well...?"`
`"Yes.`
` She is sleeping peacefully."`
`"The noise from here won't reach the parlor, right...?"`
`"That's right.`
` The door is closed, so I don't think it will reach."`
`"......Ange,`
` sweet dreams."`
`"Well then!!`
` That's enough solemn farewells!`
` Let us begin the magnificent festivities we have planned for the after-partyyyy!!"`
`When Beato clapped her hands loudly above her head, a white flash filled the hall, and its entire appearance changed in an instant.`
`The hall had transformed into a golden party chamber, with gold butterflies flitting about and gold leaf dancing everywhere.`
`"Yes, the true party shall now begin!"`
`"You said it!`
` Okay, the anti-magic toxin is totally gone!!`
` Everyone, come on in!`
` The party after the show is about to start!!"`
`With a burst of applause and cheering, a tornado of gold butterflies rose up in the center of the room.`
`By the time it passed, the number of faces had grown significantly.`
`"Let the witch of the future find happiness.`
` And let us of the past be rewarded for our efforts, yes?"`
`"Indeed.`
` Let us enjoy ourselves as well."`
`"Come on, haven't we been enjoying ourselves the whole time?!"`
`"Pu ku ku ku.`
` In this world, the one who enjoys the most is the true winner."`
`"Come, let's have the Seven Sisters over here too."`
`"The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here!!"`
`"I can't believe the game's finally over!`
` Waaah!"`
`"What do you think you're doing, crying at the after-party?!`
` You little crybaby!"`
`"Lord BATTLER, Beatrice-sama, thank you for the invitation!"`
`"I wanna see six-year-old Ange-sama's sleeping face and have it all to myself!"`
`"I wanna see the food and have it all to myself!!"`
`"Then I want a hot guy to have all to myself!!"`
`"Why are you clinging to Battler when you say that?!`
` Stop, thief!"`
`"Glad to see you, Seven Sisters of Purgatory!`
` Enjoy yourselves!"`
`"Ah yes, things do get much noisier the moment they enter a room."`
`"And what's so terrible about that?!`
` In fact, it still isn't nearly noisy enough!"`
`Another gold cyclone rose up.`
` In its wake, three people with bunny ears came into view.`
`"Chiester Sisters Imperial Guards, right here!!"`
`"It's s-such an honor to be summoned to a gathering such as this!"`
`"I haven't had nearly enough fun for it to end yet nyeh.`
` Nihihihihi!"`
`"There, I agree with you.`
` But fear not, for our game shall continue much longer than this."`
`"For eternity, inside the cat box.`
` Glad to have you here, Chiester Sisters."`
`"Lord BATTLER, allow me to express our deep gratitude for your invitation.`
` In the future, we will endeavor to show even more-"`
`"Come on, don't be so stiff and formal.`
` Tonight, we're all equal!"`
`"That's right nyeh!`
` Battler gets it nyeh, nihihihihihihi!!"`
`"S-Stop it, 410.`
` You're getting carried away... We'll get in trouble!"`
`"Hey there, Riiche.`
` Long time no see!`
` Wow, how long's it been since we've had so many of us here?"`
`"Not since Natsuhi's trial, right?`
` And you could hardly call that a party!"`
`"If you're talking about a party!"`
`"You'd better not try and leave us out of it!"`
`"...Dang, just how many of them are there?"`
`"If they keep coming like this, there'll be more of them than us Humans..."`
`"You can come out now, Sakutaro!"`
`"Uryu-!!"`
`"Lord BATTLER,`
` it was an honor to receive your INVITATION."`
`""Let it be known that it is an honor.""`
`"Hey!`
` Glad you came.`
` It's been a long time. How've you been?"`
`"Very well, thank YOU.`
` Fighting with you all is always extremely FUN.`
` I have had enough of stamping DOCUMENTS."`
`"Commander Dlanor,`
` know that your to-do box is piling up as we speak."`
`"Please make haste with the approval of our vacation papers.`
` They are exceedingly important."`
`"Pft, wahahahaha!`
` Sounds like living in the Great Court is as boring as ever!"`
`"...Lord BATTLER,`
` I fear I must bring you some sad NEWS."`
`"Hmm, what is it?"`
`Dlanor held out an envelope.`
`It was one of the invitation cards that Battler had handed out for this night's party.`
`The name on the card was...Furudo Erika.`
`"......We did all we COULD."`
`The invitation was filled with stamps bearing the unreadable words of various foreign countries.`
`Even without reading them, it was easy to guess that it had been returned to sender, destination unknown.`
`"I see...`
` Thanks for trying so hard."`
`"The depths of oblivion are like an empty endless desert, or perhaps the bottom of the SEA.`
` ...No one besides Lady Bernkastel herself could find her LOCATION..."`
`"I did send invitations to those witches too.`
` ...We'll have to hope they have the kindness to bring her along..."`
`"...Lady Bernkastel is just like a cat.`
` She'll show up whenever she feels like it, but when she isn't in the mood, she'll never come no matter how often you call her."`
`"Ahhaha, yeah, that kid's totally like a cat.`
` She'll come to get her food, but she won't let you pet her head."`
`"Lambdadelta.`
` So, you came."`
`"Believe it or not, I'm a busy person, okay?`
` Still, I am Beato's guardian.`
` Wasn't I your guardian too?`
` Well, anyway, I came because it's my 'responsibility'.`
` I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I stopped by!`
` Hey, you, Gohda!`
` I've brought some presents!`
` Could you just put these wherever for me?"`
`For someone who just dropped by because she was in the neighborhood, she brought an awful lot of presents, which included colorfully wrapped bottles and food boxes.`
`"Bernkastel isn't here yet."`
`"You really think she'd come?`
` She's not the kind of kid who'd just drop by to say 'hi' at a game she's lost."`
`"...Probably.`
` After all, she is very proud."`
`"I seem to remember her putting us through hell,`
` but she's still one of the players in this game.`
` I thought it'd be good to have her over to celebrate the final night of the final game."`
`"You're right.`
` Without that kid, this game might not have reached its conclusion.`
` Enemies and allies are the bare minimum you need for a game."`
`"True.`
` Without a foe, there can be no game."`
`"At least I can enjoy defeat as just another part of the game.`
` That kid can't.`
` ...It's too bad, but she's been through a lot.`
` So please, don't blame her too harshly."`
`"Actually, I was planning to thank her.`
` ...A lot of crazy stuff happened, but thanks to her, we were able to make it to where we are today."`
`"...Thanks.`
` I don't know when I'll see her next,`
` but if I'm lucky, I'll get my chance in a few hundred years.`
` I'll let her know what you said.`
` Ah, that's right.`
` They don't have invitations, but I've brought two guests with me."`
`"Guests?`
` Who?`
` I'm pretty sure I sent invitations to all the usual suspects..."`
`"Come on over, you two!`
` I'll introduce you."`
`When Lambda snapped her fingers, the empty air exploded and two forms appeared.`
`"...If it isn't WILLARD!"`
`"Hey.`
` I see you're as short as ever."`
`"...Now here are some unfamiliar guests.`
` Who are they?"`
`"Owowow...don't...pinch...my ass!"`
`"Shouldn't we be introducing ourselves first?`
` I'm fairly certain that Battler-kun and the others in this world don't know about us."`
`"You have the mark of the One-Winged Eagle on your clothes.`
` Are you an Ushiromiya...?"`
`"My name is Ushiromiya Lion.`
` In my world, we're cousins."`
`"I'll introduce Lion!`
` This is the Successor to the Ushiromiya Family Headship, born only in a world of extremely low probability.`
` In that world, Jessica isn't an only child.`
` She's Lion's little sister."`
`"Now there's a surprise...`
` So, there's a world like that..."`
`"......`
`Wait, you couldn't be..."`
`"Pleased to meet you, Beatrice.`
` I know quite a lot about you."`
`"............"`
`"Seeing you smiling happily is the greatest joy I can imagine.`
` ...I'm as glad as anyone else that you've made it to this point."`
`"...I see.`
` ...So, it's you...`
` ...I'm glad you're here..."`
`Beato realized who and what Lion was.`
`The two of them stared at each other's faces, as though looking at their own face in a mirror.`
`"Willard's the name.`
` I'm just a passing stranger who got caught up in a game you know nothing about."`
`"He is an Inquisitor of Heresy from the Great Court, like MYSELF.`
` A truly skilled one, though he is now RETIRED."`
`"I see. If you're Dlanor's friend, you can't be anyone bad.`
` Please, make yourself at home."`
`"Just where did these two come from?"`
`"Bern brought them in and made them pieces.`
` ...When she was done with them and about to crush them, I picked them up.`
` Auau said leaving them there would leave a bad aftertaste."`
`"Is that okay?`
` If, by chance, Lady Bernkastel does drop by here..."`
`"On this game board, they're my pieces, okay?`
` And I can't wait to see the look on that kid's face when she bumps into them in a place like this.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"...I don't really get it, but you obviously brought them here for some shady reason."`
`"That's all for my gifts.`
` I'll just hang around for the rest.`
` I'm leaving the rest to you, the host."`
`"Come, Lord BATTLER!"`
`"If you don't announce it, we can't start!"`
`""The start of tonight's party at the end of this long, long game!!""`
`"Ladies and gentlemen, your silence please!!`
` Our territory lord, Lord BATTLER, has a message he wishes to convey to you all...!"`
`"Enough of that.`
` It's embarrassing."`
`"Come on, it's a wife's responsibility.`
` I'm not letting anyone else take it!"`
`Beato sulked and handed Battler a glass of champagne.`
`Come to think of it, everyone had a glass in their hands now.`
`"Maria, you're a kid, so drink some sparkling cider instead!"`
`"Uu-!!`
` I want champagne too!"`
`"Hey, Maria-chan, why don't we drink some sparkling cider together."`
`"Battler, our drinks are getting warm!"`
`"Agreed.`
` Begin, Battler."`
`"No objections, I see.`
` This way please, Lord BATTLER."`
`Ronove motioned towards the center of the room.`
`When Battler stepped forward, everyone silently awaited his words.`
`"Glad you all could make it!!`
` This marks the end of my long game with Beato...!`
` I've invited everyone who's been a part of this game as a piece, a player, or a Game Master!`
` I hope you'll enjoy this unending night to the fullest!!"`
`Cheers.`
`""Cheeeeeeeeeeers!!""`
`Everyone raised their glasses to the heavens as they cheered, and afterward, the soft sound of glasses clinking together rang out across the room...`
`...Only I...was apart from all that fun noise.`
`Maybe that was what did it.`
`Before I realized it, my cheeks were wet with tears.`
`I was lying on the sofa, covered by a blanket.`
`...I can just barely remember getting sleepy and falling asleep in a chair.`
`Someone probably carried me here.`
`I can't actually hear them, ...but I get the feeling that everyone's still in the hall, having a good time.`
`...I...want to go there too.`
`No.`
`I will go.`
` Over there.`
`...It's what I've wanted all along, but I never took the first step.`
`I'll go to where everyone is.`
`My head still feels hazy, ...so there aren't any complicated thoughts in my mind.`
`But that's okay.`
`It's okay if my head's empty.`
`I'll be together with everyone.`
` I'll go to where they are.`
` ...That's all that matters.`
`I got up from the sofa and put on my shoes.`
`Let's go.`
` To where everyone is.`
`The parlor door was shut.`
`...I tried to open it, but maybe because of my clumsiness, I couldn't get it open.`
`It was a bit creepy, as though the bad dream I'd just had was still going on.`
`"......It won't open.`
` Why?`
` It isn't even locked..."`
`My mood grew darker and darker.`
`The knob that locks or unlocks the door is on this side.`
`If I twist it, I should be able to lock or unlock it.`
`I turned it.`
` *click*.`
`The door won't open.`
`...Did I accidentally lock it just now?`
`I turned it.`
` *click*.`
`The door won't open.`
`...It didn't open the last time, so it should've opened this time.`
`I don't have a clue how I'm supposed to turn it to unlock the door.`
`I kept on alternating between turning the lock and roughly twisting the doorknob.`
`I began to get irritated, wondering why they'd locked me away behind such an inconvenient door.`
`Eventually, I ran out of patience and pounded hard on the door, but that noise didn't bring anyone to me.`
`Why am I locked up in a place like this, all alone?!`
`Everyone else is having a fun party, right there in the hall...!`
`Let me out of here...!!`
`At that moment, ...a cold wind blew past me.`
`The wind rippled through my hair.`
`Wind? Inside...?`
`I turned around...to find the window curtain waving about.`
`There was a sound like scraping or crying.`
`...At some point, the double window had opened outwards toward the darkness.`
`The icy wind that came through it...told me that this window was the only exit from this room.`
`Huh?`
`I suddenly realized that the darkness beyond the open window was glaring at me, and my heart leapt.`
`*jingle* ...A cute sound rang out.`
`I finally understood.`
`That sound was a cat's bell.`
`The glaring emerald eyes in the darkness...were those of a cat standing in the open window.`
`Its pitch-black, luxuriant fur left only the eyes visible, blending in with the darkness easily.`
`...Did the Ushiromiya family own a cat?`
`It has a bell on it, so it can't be a stray.`
` It's a cat someone owns.`
`At any rate, the cat was standing by the window...and staring straight at me.`
`"......Who...are you...?"`
`Of course, the cat didn't answer my question.`
`I didn't think it was a cute cat, ...but I thought it might be trying to tell me something, `
`...so I approached it slowly.`
`As I did, the cat did an about-face, turning its back to me.`
`Then, it turned its head to look at me, almost as though it was telling me to follow it,`
` and it leapt down into the darkness, leaving the jingle of its bell behind.`
`When I peeked out the window, I saw the cat waiting for me under the pounding rain.`
`...I finally realized.`
`This window was the only exit out of this closed room parlor.`
` The cat must have come to tell me that.`
`The longer I keep standing around here, the longer the cat will have to wait in the rain.`
`That's no good.`
` It'll catch cold.`
`I climbed up onto the windowsill and went out the window.`
`The wind was strong, and the rain was cold, but I didn't get as wet as I'd thought I would.`
`I might've been in the mansion's shadow.`
`When the cat saw that I was outside, it walked along the wall of the mansion as if guiding me.`
`It quickly disappeared into the blackness, but every now and then, it would turn around and set the bell jingling to let me know it was there.`
`Eventually, a window with light seeping out came into view.`
`It was the window to the hall.`
`When I peeked inside, I saw everyone having a good time.`
`I couldn't hear their voices, but they were all right there.`
`"Open up...!`
` Open up!!"`
`I pounded on the window, but no one heard.`
`...Maybe the window was really thick, or maybe it was just noisy inside.`
` ...Or, it might have been so dark outside that I blended in with the darkness.`
`In any event, no matter how much I hit the window, it didn't look as though anyone noticed.`
`By this point, my loneliness was giving way to anger.`
` Why don't you notice me?`
` Why did you lock me up in that room all alone?`
`I've had enough.`
`I'll get inside somehow and yell at everyone.`
`When the cat realized that I had given up knocking on the window, it led me onwards with another jingle.`
`...But just where is this cat going?`
`I know it's following the wall of the mansion.`
`But that's not the way to the front door.`
`The front door might be locked.`
`I'm sure the cat knows a way into the mansion...and is leading me there.`
`Away from the light seeping from the hall,`
` ...and towards the blackness lit only dimly by the lights in the garden, ...the cat and I continued to walk.`
`Then, ...I found it.`
`An open...window.`
`The cat stood below it and looked between me and the window, as though telling me to go inside.`
`"Thanks, kitty.`
` I'd like to give you some milk to thank you.`
` Won't you come with me?"`
`When I walked closer to pick the cat up, it slipped away from my hands and flew into the bushes in a nearby flower bed.`
`Then, as though it really had melted away into the darkness inside the bush, all traces of it vanished.`
`No matter how much I strained my ears, I couldn't hear the sound of that bell...`
`Suddenly, the wind changed directions, and the rain started to hit me fiercely.`
`I can't stay in a place like this forever.`
`"...I'll go inside.`
` ...What room is this, I wonder...?"`
`I climbed up onto the windowsill and entered the room.`
`Then, the window silently shut and locked itself.`
`...Good. That saves me the trouble of doing it myself.`
`The room was completely dark.`
`However, as my eyes got used to the darkness, I was able to make out a few things.`
`It was a large room.`
` There was a long table...and many chairs.`
`...It was...the dining hall.`
`Perhaps because I realized this and relaxed, it quickly became hard for me to make out details.`
`I searched blindly along the wall for the light switch.`
`Then, finally, I felt a familiar shape.`
`...Wouldn't it be annoying if I pushed this, and the light didn't come on?`
`*click*.`
`In fact, ...it was nearly the opposite, and an annoyingly bright light filled the dining hall and made my eyes hurt.`
`I slowly opened my tightly shut eyes.`
`......And then.`
`...I saw the state the room was in.`
`The dining hall was covered with blood...`
` Here...and there...were humans lying on the floor.`
`Then, ...I realized that two of the people were my own parents.`
`"Hey, are you having a great time, people?!!"`
`"If anyone's not having a good time, we're gonna eat you!"`
`""Yell and sing the praises of tonight's banquet!!`
` Ahhahahahahahahahaha!!""`
`The hall was alive with a mingling of Humans and the magical Illusions who lived on this island.`
`At first, everyone stayed with their own groups, too nervous to mingle.`
`However, as time passed, people started to move around, and both halves began to chat happily together.`
`"But they just never listen, do they?!"`
`"Leadership's important.`
` You need to lead by example if you want anyone to follow you!"`
`"Maybe some subordinates are like that, but I've never had any success with ordinary methods..."`
`"Anyway, you're done for if your subordinates don't take you seriously!`
` It's important to scold people loudly, even for small mistakes, every once in a while in front of everyone else."`
`"You can't do that! It'll just make everyone scared...!`
` A leader has to be an example for everyone to follow.`
` If you really want to be a leader-"`
`Everyone listened intently to the vegeta-lion's theory on leadership.`
`This was after several rounds of drinks had gone by, and everyone was unnaturally focused on the conversation.`
`"Kyrie!!`
` Why do you get stronger the more jealous you are?!"`
`"Don't make it sound so bad.`
` If I want something, I won't let it slip away.`
` I always put that theory into practice. There's nothing more to it."`
`"Thanks for waiting, everyone.`
` Even more food is on the way."`
`"...Nnngaahhh...!`
` Butting in on the family party like this...`
` ...And yet, while I hate to admit it, every movement of his is flawless.`
` Just what sort of hotel did he train at...?"`
`"Too bad, Ronove-sama just happens to be totally perfect.`
` But I still love Gohda more.`
` This one's been cooked juuust right♪"`
`The Seven Sisters had blended into the party perfectly, and they were making things interesting.`
`"And yet, many great mysteries are called masterpieces despite being shut down by Van Dine's Twenty Rules."`
`"It's not like I'm trying to shut down anything.`
` ...Mystery novels exist for the sake of your own amusement.`
` If you have fun, that's all that matters."`
`"Know that even the great Wizard-Hunting Wright has gone quite soft."`
`"...Whether it's literature or forms of amusement, generally accepted rules change with the times.`
` It must be the same with mystery novels, yes?"`
`Everyone chimed in on Will's theory of mystery novels.`
` There was no shortage of things to talk about.`
`"Yes, that is a fitting attitude for a beginner.`
` However, at that rate, you'll never become a key player in your organization."`
`"But...know that the regulations are always to be enforced..."`
`"That's something for newbies to do.`
` Don't forget that regulations and rules are pretty much guidelines for the new guys who don't know any better."`
`"You said it.`
` You can't really call yourself an adult until you learn how to move outside the rules.`
` You're still a kid if you let the rules hold you back."`
`"I can't stand letting other people do the work!`
` I'm Mammon of Greed!`
` I'll do all the jobs myself!"`
`"That's some spirit you've got there.`
` How much are they paying you for being a Sister of Purgatory?`
` Come get a job at my husband's business instead. I'll recommend you personally."`
`The Humans and the Illusions were now very much on casual terms.`
`"I-I see... So this is how it's done in the world of witches..."`
`"Yeah nyeh, you've got it nyeh!`
` Where we come from, you pour the tea onto the saucer, press your palms on the table, and slurp it up like a dog nyeh!"`
`"Wh-What the hell are you teaching her?! Who does that?!`
` And Natsuhi, what do you think you're doing, getting tricked like that, and at your age!!"`
`"Get away from her, Satan...!`
` How can you be so rude to Natsuhi-san...?!!`
` ...Huh?`
` Wh-Why are you crying, Satan?`
` ...W-Was I too hard on you...?!"`
`"Chiester 410-san, please stop giving my pure and trusting mother such crazy ideas.`
` Don't worry, it won't leave a mark."`
`410 started yelling about animal abuse, jumping around in circles and holding her butt.`
`"I wonder if there's a prince out there for me!`
` I wanna have some hot, passionate love!"`
`"If I fell in love, could I become a beautiful princess too?"`
`"Of course!`
` Love is a miracle, power, a mineral!!`
` It grants you invincible strength!"`
`"...*giggle*`
` Is that the person who once claimed that love equals lust I hear?"`
`"Indeed.`
` It would seem she's getting her fill every night, heheheh!"`
`"Sh-Shut up, you perverts!!"`
`The circle surrounding Beato was always a lively one.`
`"Yeah, I know how you feel.`
` It's only when we're given orders that we find meaning in our lives."`
`"I get nervous when I don't have any orders!`
` Someone, order me to do something, or I'll die!"`
`"You can't have that attitude!`
` You've gotta find your own meaning for your life, cut your own path!"`
`"That's right.`
` Your resolve has to be certain and absolute, okay?`
` Back when I was Human, I lived like a daredevil all the time...!"`
`A bit shakily, Lambdadelta started talking about her theory of life.`
` Apparently, she'd also had her fair share of champagne.`
`"What a bizarre SCENE."`
`"*giggle* Yeah, I guess so.`
` Dlanor-sama, would you like some more to drink?"`
`"Something non-ALCOHOLIC.`
` After all, I am a KID."`
`"Ah, Shannon-chan will do.`
` ...Do you have a second?"`
`Battler came back into the hall.`
`He was searching for a servant, and the first one his eyes met was Shannon.`
`"Of course, Battler-sama.`
` Do you need something?"`
`"Sorry, but would you mind lending me the key to the parlor?"`
`"The...parlor...?`
` I can get you in with a master key, ...but why?"`
`"Well, I was just wondering if Ange was asleep, so I went over there.`
` The door was locked."`
`"Locked...?`
` After we carried Ange-sama to the sofa, we shut the door, but we didn't lock it."`
`"...Ah, don't tell me that Ange...`
` She must've felt like she was being left out of the fun...and locked the door from the inside in a huff.`
` Silly kid."`
`"*giggle*`
` Shall we unlock it, then?"`
`"Yeah, if you don't mind.`
` Sorry about the trouble."`
`Battler and Shannon left the hall together.`
`In the hall, Lambdadelta started suggesting that they all have another quiz tournament together.`
`Apparently, the Witch of Certainty would be handing out prizes.`
` Everyone seemed enthusiastic about the idea.`
`Smiling contently at the ensuing uproar, Battler headed towards the parlor.`
`"...It really is locked.`
` Shall I open it?"`
`"Hmmm...`
` She was sleeping, so I didn't knock on the door, but if she locked it, that proves she woke up.`
` ...Let's try knocking once."`
`Battler knocked on the door and called Ange's name.`
`However, there was no response from the other side.`
`He pressed his ear against the door, listening carefully, but there was no hint of Ange unhappily throwing a cushion at it.`
`"She might have fallen asleep again after having her little tantrum.`
` ...Could you open it for me?"`
`"As you wish."`
`Shannon took out her master key and unlocked the door.`
`Then, she stepped back to let Battler go through.`
`"...Ange...`
` I'm coming in..."`
`Speaking a quiet voice to avoid waking Ange if she was asleep, Battler opened the door.`
`Then, just as the door was opened, a chilly breeze drifted by.`
`The breeze, which felt like outside air, immediately caught the attention of the pair, and they looked at each other.`
`...It could be seen at a glance that Ange wasn't in the parlor.`
`The curtains on the wide-open window fluttered about.`
`"Ange? ......Ange...?"`
`A blanket lay crumpled up on the sofa.`
`It sat there just as Ange had left it after waking up.`
`The blanket was slightly warm.`
`Clearly, she had been here until a short while ago.`
`"Ange-sama...?`
` ...Are you there...?"`
`She obviously wasn't playing hide-and-seek.`
` ...Ange was nowhere to be seen in the parlor.`
`Battler peered out the open window into the rainy blackness.`
`...So, she slipped out the window in this rain and went...where?`
`"Do you think Ange-sama might have gone out the window...?"`
`"...That'd make her one hell of a sleepwalker."`
`She couldn't have left from the main entrance, so she probably doesn't have an umbrella.`
`It was very hard to imagine a reason Ange might have for going outside in this weather.`
`...I have a bad feeling about this.`
`This shouldn't be happening.`
`I'm the Game Master of this game board.`
`So why are we in a situation that the Game Master can't understand...?`
`A large bolt of lightning lit up the surrounding area for an instant, but I was unable to see any trace of Ange...`
`"Okay, okay, now it's my turn to think of a question!`
` Umm, okay, so you have a third of a cake, a quarter of a cake, and a fifth of a cake all on a plate!`
` It takes 30 minutes to eat one whole cake, so how much is left on the plate when you've finished eating?!"`
`At that moment, there was a roar of thunder and the lights flickered.`
`The cheery voices vanished in an instant, like candles being blown out.`
`"...None.`
` That's a riddle you were tricked with once, isn't it?"`
`Amidst the silence, one voice rang out and answered Lambda's riddle.`
`The crowd parted, ...and the form of a girl, a thousand-year-old witch, came into view.`
`She had been invited.`
`She was an official guest, holding an invitation to this party...`
`"...Sorry I'm late.`
` I was busy planning some festivities to liven up the party."`
`As Bernkastel spoke, she looked around at everyone...`
`"............"`
`"Ooh.`
` And I thought you two were rotting away in the Fragment sea."`
`"They're my pieces now.`
` Pretty cool, right?"`
`"...Hmph."`
`She stared at Lion and Will with an unnerving smile on her face, but she seemed to lose interest.`
`"Where's Battler? And Beato?`
` I'm a guest, aren't I?`
` Isn't there anyone to welcome me in?"`
`"...I'm here."`
`"We did invite you,`
` but I didn't expect you to actually come.`
` ...I see, this must truly be a miracle."`
`"Now that's an interesting way to put it.`
` *giggle*...`
` ......Why'd everyone get so quiet?`
` This is a party, right?`
` Go ahead and be noisy just for the hell of it.`
` Or is you welcoming me with silence part of some kind of joke...?"`
`"Now it's your turn."`
`"...My turn for what?"`
`"You asked where Battler was.`
` So I told you I was here.`
` Now it's your turn."`
`"What are you talking about?`
` Did something happen...?"`
`"Ange's gone.`
` Even I, the Game Master, don't know where she went."`
`"That's insane...!`
` Isn't this your game?!`
` That doesn't make sense...!"`
`"......If Ange disappearing isn't a scenario created by Battler,`
` ...that means there must be another Game Master."`
`"Is that even possible...?!"`
`"Oh, yes,`
` I was surprised myself.`
` ...Just when I opened the game board to start a delightful game of my own,`
` I found that Battler had started up this bizarre game at the same time.`
` ...I never thought I'd be in a game with two Game Masters..."`
`"In other words, ...you're admitting that you hid Ange away somewhere."`
`"......`
`...It would seem so.`
` After all, no one could introduce a scenario you didn't build, ...except another Game Master."`
`"So is this...one of those festivities to liven up the party that you mentioned?"`
`"...You all looked like you were having a blast with that quiz tournament.`
` So, I decided I wanted to join in."`
`"And you chose to hold Ange hostage for that purpose?"`
`"You've got it.`
` ...Battler, Beato,`
` I want to challenge you to a game.`
` You cannot refuse.`
` Not if you treasure Ange as a little sister, that is."`
`"......What do you want?"`
`"Lambda and I made a bet about the game between you and Beato.`
` ...I must acknowledge that I've lost.`
` At least, that I've lost to Lambda."`
`"*giggle*giggle*`
` ...Bern tries to act all dry, but she's way more persistent than she looks.`
` So, you're saying you lost to me, `
`but not to Battler and Beato?"`
`It seemed as though Bernkastel might smile.`
`However, she didn't.`
`Those cold eyes spoke without words.`
`Battler understood.`
`He had played so many games against Beato.`
`Those games had been a wordless message from Beato.`
`So he knew.`
` He understood.`
`"She wants to fight us.`
` ...Is that it?"`
`"...She will be a fearsome opponent."`
`"But we can't back out."`
`"I know that.`
` ...We mustn't let Ange become Lady Bernkastel's plaything."`
`Beato understood as well.`
`She understood why Bernkastel was asking for one final battle...`
`"...I never thought I'd see Bern fighting openly like this."`
`"Do you find that funny?"`
`"Why would I?"`
`"Thanks."`
`"............"`
`Lambdadelta understood as well.`
`Before the tale of Battler and Beato ended, before everything was locked away in the cat box...`
`Bernkastel would finally move from the audience to the stage.`
`That witch who had hidden off to the side of the stage, unwilling to come out into the light, ...would now show that she had the courage to step forward onto the stage itself.`
`As a friend, Lambdadelta showed that she understood Bernkastel's human emotions, which had given her this courage...`
`"Is there anything I can do?"`
`"Please act as an observer for my game."`
`"...Sure.`
` If you promise that you'll release Ange if we take part in your game, that is."`
`"Of course.`
` Without such a promise, we aren't obligated to go along with this farce in any way...!"`
`"You may not owe me anything, but you'll never see Ange again..."`
`"In that case, you can enjoy being branded as a loser for the next few centuries."`
`"Beato, don't provoke her.`
` ...This isn't a fight we can back down from."`
`"...I-Indeed."`
`Now that a hostage had been taken, their ability to negotiate had disappeared.`
`However, Lambdadelta was agreeing to become an observer if that would make Bernkastel promise to release Ange.`
`Unless she held Bernkastel to a promise like that, the latter would have nothing to lose.`
`To make this final fight Bernkastel wanted a proper one,`
` ...Lambdadelta made her agree to this.`
`"......Of course, Lambda.`
` I promise.`
` When the game ends, I'll release Ange."`
`"Don't make a fool of me, okay...?`
` When I get shamed, I never let go of the one who did it until they regret it..."`
`Lambdadelta spoke in a soft, threatening tone.`
`However, Bernkastel laughed lightly as though the look on Lambdadelta's face was merely cute.`
`"I swear it.`
` ...I swear it on our friendship."`
`"...Whew."`
`Lambdadelta whistled and grinned.`
`Apparently, this was the most reliable oath Bernkastel could utter.`
`"Okay."`
`Lambdadelta nodded, looked between Battler and Bernkastel, and spoke.`
`"By the name of Lambdadelta, Witch of Certainty, I accept the role of observer for your fight.`
` ...Battler, Beato, you have no objections, right?"`
`Battler and Beato nodded at each other, then nodded at Lambdadelta to show their determination.`
`"......I'm so glad.`
` We finally get to fight each other."`
`"I had a feeling I'd end up fighting you sooner or later."`
`"Since when?"`
`"......`
`...I'm not sure.`
` It might've been before I even learned your name."`
`Battler vaguely remembered her speaking to him, somewhere in an unconscious world he couldn't recall.`
`At the time, it had sounded like she was giving him advice for his fight with Beato.`
`But, thinking back on it, there was a bit more to it than that.`
`...She might have been a cat fighting from the sidelines, too scared to go out into the bright sunlight.`
`So, I had a vague premonition that, eventually, we would stand opposed to each other on the game board in some way...`
`"...She was also one of the players.`
` ...Now, at the very end, as the game board is being put away, she's finally found the courage to step up onto the stage.`
` ...I'd like to accept your brave challenge.`
` ...In the name of that courageous girl who was once your piece."`
`"I forced Erika to fight a duel.`
` ...I wanted to win.`
` And, even more strongly, I didn't want to lose.`
` The fear of possibly tasting defeat tormented me.`
` ......And, thinking back on it, I envied you two back then."`
`"............"`
`"......Erika was a great piece of yours...and my rival.`
` I won't forgive you for abandoning her in the end and burying her in the depths of oblivion."`
`"Just what do you want me to do...?`
` Apologize to Erika?"`
`"Save Erika from the depths of oblivion.`
` And invite her to this party."`
`"...Save...`
`Erika...?"`
`"I feel the same as Battler.`
` She was a piece who stood in opposition to us, but she was only faithfully fulfilling her role.`
` There can be no game without a rival.`
` ...She remains our enemy, but she's also an important friend to us."`
`"......Even though she made you suffer so much...?"`
`"We fought a fair fight.`
` The outcome may have changed our fates, ...but now that we've dueled each other, we'll always be friends."`
`"............"`
`"You want to be their friend too, don't you Bern?`
` That's why you want a fair fight with them now, isn't it?"`
`"...Are you laughing at me?"`
`"We aren't."`
`"On the contrary, we welcome it."`
`"...Even though I've taken a hostage?"`
`"If you didn't, you probably wouldn't have been able to come up onto the stage."`
`There had been no need to take a hostage.`
`Battler and Beato had been more than willing to accept this final duel, if Bernkastel wished it.`
`...It was hard to make out anything from Bernkastel's silent expression.`
`"Fine."`
`"...What's fine?"`
`"...I'll release Erika from the depths."`
`"I'm glad you decided to do this."`
`For someone as proud as Bernkastel, forgiving the piece who had caused her defeat should have been nearly unbearable.`
`Battler knew this, ...so he realized how much this bit of compassion had cost Bernkastel...`
`Bernkastel snapped her fingers, and a black cat slipped out of her shadow.`
`"I tossed her all the way into the deepest parts of oblivion.`
` ...It might take her a while to get here."`
`"It matters not.`
` There's no danger of the food and drink running out."`
`"...Go, kitty.`
` ...Guide that kid here."`
`When she gave this order, the cat melted into the darkness, its bell jingling.`
`"I can hardly believe that you'd forgive Erika."`
`"...I don't plan on forgiving her.`
` So, she's not my piece anymore.`
` ...Anyone feel like picking her up?`
` After all, you already picked up Lion and Will."`
`"......Bernkastel,`
` you have my thanks."`
`"Okay, enough with the sentimentality.`
` I've already had as much as I can bear."`
`"Sure.`
` ...Where will we have the game?`
` As far as I care, we could have it here, with all the noise, or in the usual quiet spot."`
`"...Lady Bernkastel has already shown that she has the courage to stand before a great many people.`
` ...There is no point in making her suffer any longer."`
`"Good point.`
` ...Then let's go to the usual place."`
`"Any objections, Bern?"`
`"...None."`
`"Sorry, partygoers...!`
` We'll be heading out for a bit, but please continue to enjoy yourselves!`
` Zepar, Furfur!`
` Liven this place up!`
` When Erika gets here, let's have everyone give her a warm welcome."`
`""Yes, Lady Lambdadelta!!`
` Your wish is our command!!""`
`"Now then, let us take her to the usual room, a fitting place for our battle of wits...!"`
`When Battler snapped his fingers, space shattered.`
`They were now in the smoking room of the witches, the place where witches had once debated, schemed, and reasoned all they could.`
`Bernkastel had been invited there once again, and the final game would now begin...`
`"...Do you have a game prepared?"`
`"Of course.`
` ...I worked hard on this game, and I'm pretty proud of it."`
`"So, Bern will be the Game Master, and Battler and Beato will be the players?`
` Will it be a normal game, where Bern creates a murder tale and the two players have to reconstruct it with Human tricks?"`
`"I'm interested to see what sort of scenario Lady Bernkastel develops."`
`"...We'll explain things with the blue truth, and you'll knock those down with the red truth.`
` Are we okay with those rules?"`
`"......My game will be a simpler one.`
` It's just a quiz of guessing the culprit.`
` ...I don't feel like trading red and blue with you."`
`"Oh...?`
` What kind of game will that be...?`
` Would you mind letting me have a look at it first?"`
`Bernkastel held her palm upwards...and a palely glowing Fragment appeared there.`
`Lambdadelta brushed it with her hand and shut her eyes...`
`"...See?`
` It's a simple game, isn't it?"`
`"You're right...`
` It's much more straightforward than the mind games these two played in the past.`
` This isn't even a game about witches and Humans anymore."`
`"That's right.`
` This is a game about Humans."`
`"......What a surprise.`
` The game Bern created to combat Beato's fantasy...is a genuine mystery."`
`"Please explain."`
`"It's extremely simple.`
` ...You'll watch the tale Bern has prepared for you.`
`"So, ...it's an ordinary mystery novel?"`
`"I see...`
` In that case, there's no need for combat between red and blue truth."`
`In Beato's games, the argument had been about whether the story was a mystery or not.`
`However, Bernkastel's game was a mystery.`
` There was no need to argue over that from the start.`
`"I've even cut out the motive and the tricks.`
` ...There's only one question I'm asking you."`
`"Who dunnit."`
`"...What a simple, yet fitting game to conclude our fight."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...No cheap tricks.`
` Just a stoically simple game."`
`"This is a genuine duel..."`
`"As the observer, I'll say this.`
` ...This game 'is made to be solvable'.`
` In other words, I guarantee that it's a suitable setting for your duel.`
` ...Bern, I know I keep on saying this,`
` ...but are you really sure?`
` ...Battler and Beato's relationship started because they both loved mystery.`
` ...I agree it's a pretty tricky scenario, ...but I'm not sure it'll be enough to stop these two..."`
`"...If my best tale can't stop them, then what comes will come."`
`"The important thing is that Lady Bernkastel put everything she had into this game."`
`"You're right.`
` Will that be enough to stump us?`
` That's all this simple game is about.`
` ...Thanks, Lambda.`
` Thanks to you, we know that this duel will be a fair fight."`
`"You're welcome.`
` I'm happy too.`
` ...It'll be an honor to witness Bern fighting this precious fight."`
`"I am also honored to have you as an opponent."`
`"...Same here.`
` ...I underestimated you.`
` And I did it without even stepping onto the battlefield with you.`
` Just thinking about it makes me want to vomit.`
` ...So let me fight."`
`"Indeed.`
` Show us what you've got."`
`"If I win, I'll be able to look down on you for real this time.`
` ...And if I lose, `
`...I'll surely be reminded of the emotion I know I've forgotten."`
`"Indeed."`
`"...Bernkastel,`
` whether you end up winning or losing, I promise you one thing."`
`"......What's that?"`
`"When this duel is over,`
` ...we'll be friends."`
`"...Hmph.`
` ...Enough of that, please.`
` The sentimentality is killing me."`
`Lambda clapped her hands.`
`A pleasant sound rang out.`
`"Will you be the Reader, Bern?`
` Or shall I do that...?"`
`"...I don't need a Reader."`
`"Huh?"`
`"...A Reader miko can use her own voice to embellish or distort the tale.`
` ...Even if there was no cheap trickery in my game, by having a Reader, any amount of trickery could be added."`
`"Yes, that is true.`
` ...That's another of the Game Master's privileges."`
`"I want to have a straightforward duel with you.`
` ...So, I don't need a Reader.`
` You can read this tale with your own eyes and ears."`
`"Are you sure...?!`
` That means you've lost almost all of your advantages...!"`
`"...Understood.`
` You don't need a Reader.`
` We'll read the tale ourselves."`
`"If there is no Reader, ...does that mean there will be absolutely no falsehoods contained in the narrated text?"`
`"We're ready, Bernkastel."`
`"............"`
`"A showdown over a genuine mystery, without any cheap tricks.`
` ...If you're gonna play fair and square, we'll challenge you head on too."`
`"...Thank you.`
` ...And I don't plan on losing either."`
`"No, no, no.`
` That's no good, Lady Bern."`
`"...?"`
`"She's right.`
` If you're a witch challenging us with a mystery, you can't have an attitude like that. Yeah, it's all useless...!"`
`Bernkastel, realizing what Battler and Beato were asking for, snorted.`
` Lambdadelta nodded at her, telling her to enjoy this final duel to the fullest.`
`"Heheheheh, ...ahahahahahahahah...`
` What were you expecting, a happy mystery chat between Humans and witches?!`
` Come on, don't make me laugh!`
` Let's see if your cheery mysteries are any match for the one I've prepared!`
` Let's see what you've got!!"`
`"We wouldn't have it any other way!`
` Yes, we'll accept your challenge, Lady Bernkastel, Witch of Miracles!"`
`"All right, time to start!!`
` I, Game Master Ushiromiya Battler,`
` and Beatrice, the Endless Witch, will be your opponents!`
` Don't start crying when we wipe the floor with you!!"`
`"Take this! Here's my mystery!!!"`
`Bernkastel took a Fragment containing the game and smashed it against the table, shattering it with a brilliant light as the game's scenario laid itself out.`
`The curtain rose...on the mystery Bernkastel had created...`
`No sound but that of the falling rain filled the room.`
`It covered the tragic scene in the bloody dining hall...`
`"............"`
`At some point, Ange had fainted and fallen to the floor.`
`Now, her consciousness was slowly returning, ...forcing her to remember what had happened in this room.`
`So, she reflexively averted her gaze even before the memory overtook her.`
`Six bodies lay in the bloodstained dining hall.`
`Strangely enough, as her consciousness returned bit by bit, the terrifying scene before her seemed somehow less intense.`
`This time, Ange was able to look at the six corpses well enough to make out who they were.`
`First, ...those are my own parents.`
` ...They're a pitiful sight, colored bright red by a bloody makeup.`
`And, lying next to them...are Uncle Hideyoshi and Aunt Eva.`
`Uncle Hideyoshi, the uncle who always says funny things and makes me laugh, `
`...and Aunt Eva, the aunt who seems to be so fond of me...`
`Genji-san, the servant, is lying over there.`
`And, the one lying right here...is Aunt Rosa.`
`Six people.`
`A full six people...had their lives taken from them...and are lying in this room...`
`Maybe I cried myself out before I fell unconscious.`
` ...The scene before me was still terribly painful, ...but I was somehow able to look at it without losing my head.`
`I'd already felt all the sadness I could at my parents' deaths.`
`The next emotion that rose up inside me...was a desire to check and see that everyone else was okay.`
`In that instant, ...I heard a scraping sound.`
`Just as I was about to relax again, thinking I must have imagined it, I heard the same sound again.`
`It was probably coming from the door.`
`Someone was clawing at the door from the outside.`
`Of course, I had no way of knowing who it was.`
`However, for some reason, I was sure that it was that black cat scratching at the door.`
`...The black cat was telling me to leave this room.`
`I understood and put my hand on the doorknob.`
`......?`
`I immediately noticed something odd.`
` The door was locked.`
`The same bad feeling I'd felt after being locked in the parlor crawled up my spine.`
`...However, unlike the time in the parlor, this door unlocked itself easily when I turned the knob.`
`I unlocked it...and slowly opened the door...`
`Beyond the door, ...I could see the dimly-lit hallway...and a cat dashing down it away from me.`
`Then, it stopped, its emerald eyes glittering in the darkness, ...as though it was waiting for me to follow.`
`"............"`
`The hallway was dark...and wrapped in an eerie silence.`
`When the black cat saw that I was coming, it walked forward as if guiding me.`
`I could hear nothing except the creaking of the floor, the bell of the cat, `
`...and the sound of the storm outside.`
`...The party is being held in the hall.`
`I should be able to hear at least a little of the noise from this hallway...`
`"...Maybe it got really late...when I was unconscious in the dining hall..."`
`It was a reasonable conclusion.`
`Then, we finally reached the main hall.`
`...The hall was frigid, and no trace of that party remained.`
`Could all of that fun have been...just an illusion...?`
`The black cat's bell rang out.`
`When I looked up, I saw that it had its feet on the stairway to the second floor, ...urging me to follow it.`
`"...Are you going to the second floor...?"`
`The black cat seemed to nod, then silently went up the stairs.`
`...Guests were allowed to go wherever they wanted on the first floor,`
` but the second floor was Krauss's family's house, and I remembered getting in trouble for trying to go up there.`
`However, at that moment, I couldn't think of any options...other than following that cat...`
`I walked along the dark hallway with the black cat.`
`Eventually, we reached one of the doors.`
`The black cat scratched at the door, then turned to look at me.`
`...It must have been telling me to open it.`
`"Okay...`
` ...I'll open it for you..."`
`I put my hand on the doorknob...and felt the resistance of a lock again.`
`This door is locked.`
` ...I turned around to tell the cat this, ...but...inexplicably...`
`a single key lay right in front of the cat.`
`Ange picked it up and stuck it in the keyhole.`
`...As she did, she finally noticed something strange with her fingertips.`
`Blood.`
`Somehow, Ange's fingertips had been stained red with blood.`
`She let out a short cry, and the key slipped out and fell to the ground.`
`She finally realized.`
` In the darkness, she hadn't noticed before.`
`The black cat's key...was covered with blood...`
`...The emotions that had gone numb in Ange sprang back.`
`A terrified scream rang out through the dark hallway...`
`Even so, Ange would eventually open that door.`
`That door...led to Natsuhi's room.`
`Natsuhi's room was a terrible mess.`
`Blankets and sheets were torn.`
`Cosmetics and books lay all over the place, as though a typhoon had just ripped through it.`
`And...there were corpses.`
`Krauss and Natsuhi's corpses lay sprawled on the floor...`
`Very shortly, Ange will step into this room.`
`She will then scream in terror once more...`
`And it isn't limited to the dining hall and Natsuhi's room.`
`In the stormy rose garden, ...Shannon's tragic corpse lies exposed.`
`...Partway down the path to the rose garden...is Jessica's corpse.`
`When Ange finds that, she'll probably dash crying and screaming into the guesthouse.`
`And...death awaits her inside the guesthouse as well.`
`Just inside the front door...is Nanjo's corpse.`
`In the servant room nearby, even Gohda and Kumasawa lie dead.`
`...The total number of corpses...is 13.`
`A full 13 corpses are waiting for Ange.`
`They wait in the mansion and the guesthouse on this desolate Rokkenjima...`
`for Ange, exposed to the wind and rain and tormented by thunder, to find them...`
`The tragedy of the first twilight was discovered at 6:00 in the morning on the following day.`
`Gohda, who had woken up to get breakfast ready,`
` went to check on the adult siblings, who had remained in the dining hall since the previous night because of the family conference.`
`"Tell us about when you discovered the crime."`
`"#cc99ffThe dining hall was locked up.#ffffff`
` Of course, there is a lock on the doors to the dining hall, but they usually remained unlocked.`
` I knocked, but there was no answer..."`
`"#cc99ffThat's when I arrived.#ffffff`
` I recommended that he try unlocking the door, just in case."`
`"When #cc99ffI unlocked the door with a master key#ffffff, a terrifying sight awaited me inside..."`
`"#cc99ffEva-sama, Hideyoshi-sama, Rudolf-sama, Kyrie-sama, Rosa-sama, and Genji-san,`
` six people in all, were lying there, covered in blood...#ffffff"`
`"A great tumult followed.`
` #cc99ffEveryone gathered in the dining hall.#ffffff"`
`"I don't want to remember it...`
` The sight of all the sobbing children crouched over the corpses of their own parents..."`
`"There was a chance they might've been alive still.`
` ...Everyone was shaking them desperately."`
`"But it was no use...`
` #cc99ffEach of the children confirmed the deaths of their own parents...#ffffff"`
`"#cc99ffDoctor Nanjo and I confirmed that Genji-sama was dead.#ffffff"`
`"Such a gruesome way to be killed...`
` #cc99ffNo one is going to mistakenly confirm a death, even those other than myself.#ffffff"`
`"It looks like #cc99ffall of the victims died instantly.#ffffff`
` ...Kihihihihi."`
`"#cc99ffAfter inspecting the interior of the dining hall, we determined that all of the doors and windows had been locked, making it a closed room.#ffffff"`
`"And #cc99ffnothing suspicious was found inside the dining hall.#ffffff"`
`"Of course, #cc99ffthere was no one hiding in the dining hall either.#ffffff"`
`"Naturally.`
` All of us are here right now.`
` #cc99ffIt's clear that no one is hiding.#ffffff"`
`"But Dad, if that's true, it doesn't make sense...`
` Six people were killed, and the dining hall is a closed room!`
` How could someone have killed them and escaped?!"`
`"...I'd rather not think of it,`
` but perhaps the servants with their master keys are the most suspicious."`
`"They killed the six, then left and locked the door with their master keys.`
` ...It is a logical theory."`
`"E-Eeek!`
` Th-That's absurd!"`
`Since there was no chance of the culprit hiding inside the dining hall, `
`it made sense to assume that the culprit locked the door after committing the murder and exiting the room.`
`It was only natural that the servants, with their master keys, would fall under suspicion.`
`And, sadly enough, none of the servants had an alibi.`
`Then again, it wasn't only the servants.`
` Everyone else lacked an alibi as well.`
`"Is there any way to lock up from the outside without a master key?"`
`"No, there isn't.`
` ......Hmm, that's not enough.`
` I'll say it with the red truth."`
`#ff0000All doors can only be locked or unlocked with a master key.#ffffff`
`#ff0000Of course, it is possible to lock or unlock the doors from inside the room even without a master key.#ffffff`
`"There you have it.`
` Any other questions?"`
`"Shouldn't there be keys to each individual room, in addition to the master keys?"`
`"...Normally, those would exist.`
` However, they make the game more complicated, so I've eliminated them.`
` Red truth.`
` #ff0000We'll consider master keys to be the only keys that exist.#ffffff"`
`"In other words,`
` all of the locks that appear in this game can only be locked or unlocked by master keys."`
`"That's what it means.`
` It really is a simple game."`
`"In that case, we should now check the number of master keys and who holds them."`
`"`
`#ff0000There are five master keys total.`
` One is held by each of the five servants.#ffffff`
` The keys will be managed in a special way.`
` #ff0000The servants keep master keys on their person at all times, so it is impossible for them to be stolen, handed over, or used by any human other than themselves.#ffffff"`
`"What the heck.`
` Now they're sounding less like keys and more like a fingerprinting system."`
`"That's an interesting metaphor.`
` ...In other words, in the world of this game, it isn't the master keys, but the five servants themselves that can lock or unlock doors."`
`"We tried to retrieve Genji-san's master key, but had no luck."`
`"To guard against trouble later on, #cc99ffwe destroyed Genji's master key.#ffffff"`
`This was the crime of the first twilight.`
`The scene was the locked closed room of the dining hall.`
`None of the servants holding master keys have alibis.`
`Then again, no one else has an alibi either...`
`Everyone returned to the parlor to discuss what should be done next.`
`The phones were out, so they couldn't contact the police.`
`Was the mysterious culprit hiding away somewhere, planning to attack their next victim at this very moment?`
`Or was the culprit in here with them, mentally sticking out their tongue and tasting their next prey?`
`None of them had alibis, and any one of them could have been a culprit...`
`However, that tense feeling didn't last long.`
`By midday, everyone got tired of arguing, and they decided to take a break.`
`Krauss and Natsuhi announced that they wanted to talk with each other alone and went up to the second floor.`
`That was the beginning, and after that, everyone went their separate ways now and then, such as to head to the bathroom or gaze at the endless rain.`
`However, no matter how much time passed, Krauss and Natsuhi were the only ones who didn't return.`
`Calls were sent to both Krauss and Natsuhi's rooms using the extension phone line, but there was no answer.`
`Something might have happened.`
`Everyone headed to Krauss's and Natsuhi's rooms together, ...and in Natsuhi's room, they found Krauss and Natsuhi lying sprawled on the floor.`
`"#cc99ffMadam's room was locked!#ffffff`
` It's just like the dining hall!"`
`"After getting everyone's permission, #cc99ffI unlocked the door...#ffffff"`
`"#cc99ffKrauss-sama and Natsuhi-sama lay sprawled on the floor inside the room.#ffffff"`
`"#cc99ffDoctor Nanjo checked their pulse.`
` Then, he announced that the two of them had died instantly.#ffffff"`
`"Correct.`
` #cc99ffI confirmed both of their deaths.`
` There can be no doubt that they died instantly.#ffffff"`
`"I searched all over the room, looking for a clue...!`
` In the end, #cc99ffI found that the windows and doors had all been locked, making it a closed room.#ffffff"`
`"Another closed room!`
` We servants all have master keys, so we'll be suspected again...!"`
`"B-But have no fear...!`
` After Madam began to suspect us, we started keeping an eye on each other!"`
`"#cc99ffAll of us servants were together the whole time.#ffffff"`
`"#cc99ffAll of us servants can prove an alibi for all of the other servants.#ffffff"`
`"Now that's interesting.`
` So, you're saying that this closed room is even more complete."`
`"......In the case of the first closed room, no one had an alibi.`
` So, for this closed room, all of them have alibis."`
`"In this world, the servants themselves become living master keys.`
` Since those servants have perfect alibis, it was impossible to lock Natsuhi's room..."`
`"We decided to preserve the crime scene as it was."`
`"#cc99ffWe put packing tape all over the outside of the doors and windows, sealing them!#ffffff"`
`"I'm sure the culprit left some sort of clue in this room!`
` #cc99ffWe made sure that no one would be able to enter or leave until the police arrived!#ffffff"`
`"Then, we did the same to the dining hall.`
` #cc99ffWe also sealed the dining hall in the same way.#ffffff"`
`"We reached the conclusion that the entire mansion itself should be preserved.`
` #cc99ffWe also sealed the mansion itself, and all of us took refuge in the guesthouse.#ffffff"`
`"They sealed the whole mansion?`
` Packing tape on all the windows?`
` They even used a ladder for the windows on the third floor?"`
`"...The game would get complicated otherwise, so I've simplified it.`
` #ff0000All of the windows had steel bars on them, so it's impossible to enter or leave by them.`
` #ffffffTherefore, `
`#ff0000we'll say that they can seal the whole mansion by sealing the two doors, the front one and the back one.#ffffff"`
`"Got it. That makes it easy."`
`"What do you think?"`
`"Actually killing the two people in Aunt Natsuhi's room would be easy.`
` Someone just had to knock and get them to open the door.`
` However, they couldn't lock it afterwards."`
`"Only the servants can lock doors,`
` but all of the servants have alibis."`
`"Unless the servants are all in it together.`
` More importantly, the first twilight has me suspicious."`
`"You think that one of the six who died in the dining hall was actually alive and committed the crime?"`
`"It's because of Erika.`
` I can't help but be suspicious when people are examining corpses."`
`"So, you think that one of the first six victims was alive?"`
`"Yeah.`
` And afterwards, they killed Krauss and Natsuhi.`
` Then, they locked the door from the inside, hid inside the room, and found a good chance to escape."`
`"Hmm, that theory does make logical sense."`
`"...I'll say it in red.`
` #ff0000The culprit of the first twilight really did kill six people.#ffffff"`
`"Then I'll take a shot with the blue truth.`
` Here is the true nature of this closed room.`
` #5decffThe culprit locked the door from the inside, then hid in Natsuhi's room.`
` Then, after everyone left, they found an opportunity to escape.#ffffff"`
`"...Sure, I'll deny that in red.`
` #ff0000The group sealed the room at the same time they left.`
` No culprit joined the group as they left.`
` Also, all of the seals on Natsuhi's room, the dining hall, and the mansion itself will not be broken.#ffffff"`
`"Heheheheheh.`
` In other words, you can't use that trick where they hide under the bed and slip out later."`
`"...Interesting.`
` Nice going, Bernkastel."`
`"Thanks."`
`This was the crime of the second twilight.`
`The scene was Natsuhi's room, a locked closed room.`
`This time, all of the servants with master keys have alibis.`
`The whole group, realizing the dangers of being inside the mansion, took shelter in the guesthouse...`
`All those who took refuge in the guesthouse decided to hole up in there until the typhoon passed.`
`There, if everyone watched everyone else, they should be able to prevent further crimes both from inside and outside.`
`However, they wouldn't be able to keep it up without any breaks until the typhoon passed.`
`Once again, their actions left a weak point open, and they were faced with yet another tragedy.`
`"Shannon-chan and Kanon-kun went outside on an errand and still haven't come back...!"`
`"George nii-san got upset, so #cc99ffwe all went outside to look for them.#ffffff"`
`"We found Shannon-chan lying there in the rose garden.`
` Oh, poor, poor Shannon-chan..."`
`"I prayed she was still alive.`
` However, #cc99ffI was forced to acknowledge that she was dead...#ffffff"`
`"Of course, #cc99ffI also examined her and confirmed her death.#ffffff"`
`"When the two of them left, we were busy checking the locks around the guesthouse.`
` So, #cc99ffnot one of us has an alibi...!#ffffff"`
`"Me, kill her?!`
` How could I have killed her?!!"`
`"That's right.`
` George onii-chan couldn't kill her, uu-."`
`"Later on, we learned that George nii-san alone had an alibi.`
` #cc99ffAt the very least, George nii-san couldn't possibly have killed Shannon.#ffffff"`
`"To turn it around,`
` #cc99ff...anyone other than George-aniki could have killed her.#ffffff"`
`"To prevent the culprit from using it for any mischief, `
`#cc99ffwe destroyed the master key Shannon-san had on the spot.#ffffff"`
`"...At the time Shannon is killed, Kanon goes missing forever.`
` ......`
`#ff0000From now on, Kanon is treated as being killed.`
` Also, Kanon's master key is treated as being destroyed.#ffffff"`
`"Well, I thought it'd be rude, so I kept quiet about it,`
` but that's what happens when Shannon dies."`
`"In other words,`
` we can interpret this as Shannon and Kanon being killed at the same time, even though we're missing a corpse?"`
`"That's right."`
`"...Hmm.`
` Looks like the crimes are moving along."`
`This was the crime of the fourth twilight.`
`The scene was the rose garden.`
`There were no locks or doors.`
` It wasn't a closed room.`
`So, the master keys were no longer a factor.`
`Then, the pace of the crimes began to accelerate...`
`Everyone took shelter in the guesthouse.`
`They carefully sealed all doors and windows, locking themselves in a closed room.`
`However, several closed room murders had already occurred.`
`Could locking themselves in a closed room do anything more than invite another tragedy?`
`After arguing fiercely in the cousin room about finding the culprit, they decided that they should double-check Nanjo, Kumasawa, and Gohda's testimony.`
`And there, ...they learned that a tragedy had occurred once more.`
`"#cc99ffIn both Gohda-san's and Kumasawa-san's cases, such wounds would have resulted in instant deaths#ffffff, I believe.`
` Such a gruesome way to die..."`
`"Like hell they could survive with wounds like this...!`
` #cc99ffGohda-san and Kumasawa-san are both dead!#ffffff"`
`"Well, we have been busy, keeping a lookout and locking up and all that.`
` Once again, #cc99ffnone of us has an alibi.#ffffff"`
`"That's not true.`
` Look.`
` ...If they were killed in that way, the culprit would definitely have gotten blood spatter on themselves."`
`"But Doctor Nanjo and all of the cousins have no blood spatter on them."`
`"All of us...in other words, #cc99ffthe four cousins and Doctor Nanjo couldn't have killed Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san.#ffffff"`
`"In that case, it's clear that the culprit is someone other than us."`
`"I guessed that someone might have snuck in, so I checked around, #cc99ffbut the guesthouse was still completely locked up.#ffffff"`
`"Perhaps the culprit has a master key after all..."`
`"That's impossible.`
` #cc99ffNo master keys exist anymore except the two keys on the two people who lie dead here.#ffffff"`
`"Since the two master keys that exist are here inside the guesthouse,`
` ...that makes this guesthouse a perfect closed room...!"`
`"Well, since someone's dead, it obviously wasn't perfect.`
` Kihihihihihihihihi..."`
`This was the crime of the fifth and sixth twilights.`
`The scene was the closed room known as the guesthouse.`
`Gohda's and Kumasawa's master keys were also destroyed, meaning that all master keys have now been lost.`
`Now, no one can break into this closed room guesthouse.`
`At least, that should have been the case...`
`This time, Doctor Nanjo was killed.`
`He died in the entrance hall of the guesthouse.`
`It was far too foolish of him to come here alone to check that everything was locked.`
`"#cc99ffH-He's dead...`
` He's been killed...!#ffffff"`
`"Even I...can say for sure that #cc99ffthis was an instant death#ffffff..."`
`"#cc99ffEverything is locked up perfectly.#ffffff`
` How did it happen, if this is a closed room?"`
`"That means the culprit is one of us...!"`
`"Impossible!`
` Judging by the circumstances, #cc99ffMaria, Battler, George nii-san and I all couldn't have killed Doctor Nanjo!#ffffff"`
`"In the first place, #cc99ffit's impossible to kill Doctor Nanjo inside the guesthouse!#ffffff"`
`"In the first place, #cc99ffno one could kill Doctor Nanjo inside the guesthouse!#ffffff"`
`"In the first place, #cc99ffkilling Doctor Nanjo inside the guesthouse was impossible!#ffffff"`
`"And look at this.`
` Simply put, #cc99ffthis is proof that Doctor Nanjo didn't leave the guesthouse...!#ffffff"`
`"That means no one could kill Doctor Nanjo, right?`
` So how was he killed?"`
`No one could answer that innocent question.`
`This was the seventh twilight.`
`Once again, the crime scene was the closed room known as the guesthouse.`
`Various bits of evidence made this crime seem even more impossible.`
`Then, the tragedy reached the eighth twilight, the final one.`
`By now, it was clear that holing up wouldn't keep them safe.`
`Jessica might have chosen anger as a way to numb her fear.`
`She flew out of the guesthouse in a rage, searching for the culprit that surely hid somewhere outside.`
`George, Battler, and Maria hurriedly chased after her.`
`Then, outside the building, they found Jessica lying on the ground.`
`It was, as anyone could tell at a glance, a gruesome corpse...`
`"Poor Jessica-chan...`
` #cc99ffShe probably died instantly.#ffffff"`
`"#cc99ffThere's no way anyone could live through this.#ffffff`
` Kihihihihi."`
`"The three of us were together the whole time!`
` #cc99ffGeorge-aniki, Maria and I couldn't have killed Jessica!#ffffff"`
`"Yeah.`
` #cc99ffThe three of us couldn't have killed Jessica.#ffffff"`
`"As if Maria-chan could kill someone.`
` #cc99ffMaria-chan couldn't kill anyone.#ffffff"`
`"Kihihi, thanks.`
` #cc99ffGeorge onii-chan couldn't kill an adult.`
` He could kill a kid though.#ffffff`
` Kihihihihihi."`
`"Ah, I don't understand it at all...!!`
` What the hell is going on here...?!!"`
`This was the eighth twilight.`
`The crime scene was...outside.`
`However, the three who chased after Jessica have alibis.`
`George, Battler, and Maria couldn't have killed Jessica.`
`So, is there really someone hiding on this island apart from the Ushiromiya family...?`
`The curtain is lowered on this tale, for now...`
`"...That's all for my tale."`
`"It's pretty well-made.`
` If you had a full-on Reader, it'd stand up well against Beato's games."`
`"I agree there.`
` You did a good job."`
`"Well, the real work comes from taking this, Reading it and making it worthy of proper theatergoing."`
`"Still, I'm stumped.`
` On the face of it, the culprit has to be some mysterious person outside the Ushiromiya family."`
`"And that would be the same as acknowledging the existence of a witch.`
` ...We can also suspect the existence of some accomplices aiding the culprit."`
`"By the way, what was that purple text all about?`
` A new rule?"`
`"...I call them 'purple statements'.`
` It's a rule I made to make the story a bit easier to follow.`
` ...Just think of the purple statements as important spoken statements.`
` ...In other words, you might be able to ignore the spoken statements that aren't purple."`
`"Oho...`
` Well, that's nice of you."`
`"Then, are the purple statements as reliable as red truth?"`
`"Yes.`
` You can think of the purple statements as having the same power as red truth.`
` ...However, there's one exception.`
` A culprit can tell lies with purple statements."`
`"...I see.`
` To turn it around, anyone who isn't a culprit can't tell lies."`
`"Purple statements...`
` ...These seem to be the key to Lady Bernkastel's game."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` ...I'll explain the rules."`
`*The definition of 'culprit' is 'one who murders'.`
`*It is possible for a culprit to lie.`
`*It is possible for a culprit to lie even before committing murder.`
`*Characters who are not culprits only speak the truth.`
`*Characters who are not culprits may not cooperate with a culprit.`
`*A culprit must carry out all murders directly, by their own hands.`
`*A culprit must not die.`
`*A culprit must be among the characters appearing in the story.`
`*Purple statements are as absolute as red truths.`
` However, the culprit alone may lie with purple statements.`
`"That's all."`
`"The definition of 'culprit' is 'one who murders'...`
` Makes sense."`
`"It is possible for a culprit to lie.`
` That seems reasonable enough too."`
`"It is possible for a culprit to lie even before committing murder.`
` Well, no surprises there."`
`"Characters who are not culprits only speak the truth.`
` How convenient!"`
`"Characters who are not culprits may not cooperate with a culprit, right?"`
`"So, the culprit can't make accomplices tell lies to match their version of events."`
`"Damn.`
` My guess was that someone manufactured an alibi to cover for the culprit, but..."`
`"...Aw, too bad."`
`"A culprit must carry out all murders directly, by their own hands.`
` ...In other words, there are no remote or indirect methods of murder, like traps."`
`"A culprit must not die.`
` In other words, they can't commit murder, form a closed room, then commit suicide inside it."`
`"Doesn't that also mean that dead people can't be culprits?"`
`"...Hmm.`
` That's a simple yet vital piece of information."`
`"A culprit must be among the characters appearing in the story.`
` ...So, this isn't about some mysterious stranger who snuck onto the island."`
`"The appearing characters are the same old 17 people after Kinzo is removed.`
` No one else appears in the story, so no one else matters."`
`"Purple statements are as absolute as red truths.`
` However, the culprit alone may lie with purple statements.`
` ...Now here's a troublesome one."`
`"It might be the heart of this game.`
` Does that cover all of this game's basic rules?"`
`"......Besides that, I guess there's only 'the Reader will tell no lies'.`
` In other words, `
`#ff0000outside of spoken statements, there are no lies in the narration.#ffffff`
` ...I could've added that stuff if I wanted, but it'd be a pain and make things complicated."`
`"So, you willingly abandoned a witch's privileges.`
` You seem quite confident."`
`"She probably plans to win despite that."`
`"That's all from me.`
` ...I don't intend to give you any more hints or answer any more questions."`
`"As the observer, I'll proclaim this once again.`
` #ff0000I guarantee that it's possible to pinpoint the culprit with this information.#ffffff"`
`"Okay.`
` ......Got it."`
`"I can't wait to get started.`
` I can't believe the two of us are going to take on the same mystery together once more...!"`
`"Yeah.`
` I'm looking forward to it...!"`
`...This is a real game between you and me.`
`I recommend finding some paper and something to write with.`
`That is, if you really intend to fight me.`
`If you do get completely stuck, maybe you should listen in on Battler and Beato's reasoning.`
`We'll have those be 'hints' for when you get absolutely stumped and can't move forward.`
`Still, I'd rather fight you one-on-one.`
`If you plan to enjoy our little duel...`
`Then try defeating me by your own power alone, without relying on hints.`
`Okay, ...let's enjoy ourselves, shall we?`
`Enjoy this game that I've created...just for you...`
`"These purple statements are quite a problem..."`
`"We know that they're statements important enough to be on par with red truth.`
` But they also contain the culprit's lies."`
`"Even the dumbest idiot wouldn't try swallowing a roll whole if there might be needle inside."`
`"Indeed.`
` If we accept the purple blindly, there's no chance the truth will come to light."`
`"A roll with a needle in it... I like that analogy.`
` This precious, vital information might all be wasted thanks to one tiny lie."`
`"Just which lines in this vast collection of purple have lies in them?`
` ...Just thinking about it makes my head hurt."`
`"Then why don't we try spinning the chessboard around?"`
`"Hoh?`
` What do you mean?"`
`"It's simple.`
` Forget which ones are lies.`
` Let's concentrate on finding out which ones must be true."`
`"Are there any purple statements that we know must be true?"`
`"That's what we're looking for.`
` We'll look for people who couldn't possibly be the culprit.`
` If we can do that, then all of their purple statements are the same as red truth."`
`"I see.`
` Instead of searching for the culprit, we'll start by searching for those who couldn't be the culprit!`
` Yes, a simple and fundamental strategy!"`
`"That's it.`
` There's got to be someone, so let's look through it carefully."`
`"In other words, you've gotta start from square one, huh?"`
`"...Let's see what they can do."`
`"How can we know for sure that someone isn't the culprit?"`
`"One of the rules is that the culprit can't die.`
` In other words, though it might sound cruel, we can trust anyone who's dead."`
`"Hoh, that makes it easy!`
` Almost all of the characters were killed.`
` So, we can trust the purple of all those people!"`
`"But it isn't quite that simple.`
` There's the issue of people playing dead, which popped up so often even in our games."`
`"The bodies of all victims were examined, were they not?`
` Nanjo even said with the purple that no one would make a mistake when examining bodies."`
`"If Doctor Nanjo is the culprit, then we can't even rely on that.`
` At a glance, it may look as though all the victims were examined, but all confirmations of their deaths are in purple statements.`
` We can't be 100% sure."`
`"...Then whose death can we be sure about?"`
`"At any rate, let's check all the examinations over again.`
` Let's look for someone who we can be absolutely certain is dead, in some way more reliable than these purple statements."`
`"Yes, I've got it!`
` Battler, it's the narrated parts!`
` We've been told that there are no lies in the narrated sections!"`
`"Ah, I just realized that too.`
` Bernkastel announced in red that there are no lies in the narration."`
`"Oh, looks like they figured it out..."`
`"...They wouldn't get anywhere if they didn't."`
`"Are there any deaths confirmed by the narration?!`
` That would mean we can say for sure that the person in question is dead!"`
`"And that automatically means they aren't the culprit."`
`"And on top of that, it means we can trust their purple!"`
`"Let's look for deaths that are mentioned in the narration.`
` Ones that aren't vague about whether the person is alive or dead, like 'X was lying on the ground'."`
`"Yes, let's read through it once more from the start!"`
`"Battler, look!`
` The narration clearly says that Nanjo was killed on the seventh twilight...!"`
`"I found one too!`
` On the eighth twilight, the narration clearly mentions Jessica's gruesome corpse."`
`"So, in other words..."`
`"Doctor Nanjo and Jessica...`
`are definitely dead.`
` And that means-"`
`"We've proven that Nanjo and Jessica aren't culprits...!`
` And that means-"`
`"All of their purple statements are the same as red truth!"`
`"Indeed!!`
` That's right!"`
`The pair gave each other a high five.`
`Finally, they had found their first big clue.`
`A safe slice on the roll with a needle in it.`
`They had discovered some purple statements they could trust.`
`"Let's try writing out Nanjo's and Jessica's purple statements!`
` These are the same as red truth.`
` We're finally getting somewhere...!"`
`"If we're sure that Doctor Nanjo isn't the culprit, then his purple statement for the first twilight,`
` 'No one is going to mistakenly confirm a death, even those other than myself', becomes very important."`
`"In other words, no one will make any mistakes when confirming deaths...!"`
`"So, any time Doctor Nanjo or Jessica confirms a death, we can be absolutely sure that it's true."`
`"So, anyone whose death was confirmed by Nanjo and Jessica cannot be the culprit...!"`
`"...Uh-oh.`
` Looks like they're moving along."`
`"...It's strange.`
` I find it annoying that they're making progress, ...but if they did get stuck, that would just be boring."`
`"Okay, let's check their examinations and find some more characters who can't be the culprit!"`
`"Indeed!!"`
`"Battler, I've finished checking Nanjo's and Jessica's purple statements...!"`
`"People whose deaths were confirmed by those two are definitely dead.`
` And that means they can't be culprits."`
`"Which in turn increases the number of purple statements we can trust!"`
`"Let's start with Doctor Nanjo.`
` He confirmed the deaths of the victims in the second twilight, Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi."`
`"Then, on the fourth twilight, he also confirmed Shannon's death."`
`"On the fifth and sixth twilights, he even confirmed Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san's deaths."`
`"The number of innocent people has skyrocketed!`
` In addition to Nanjo and Jessica, we now know that Krauss, Natsuhi, Shannon, Gohda, and Kumasawa cannot be culprits...!"`
`"That's not all.`
` On the fourth twilight, Bernkastel announced Kanon-kun's death with the red truth.`
` The culprit can't die, so Kanon-kun isn't the culprit either!"`
`"Nanjo, Jessica, Krauss,`
` Natsuhi, Shannon, Kanon,`
` Gohda, and Kumasawa.`
` All eight of them are not the culprit!"`
`"Oooh...`
` All of a sudden, they now have eight suspects less."`
`"...It's only natural that they'd make it this far.`
` This is where it really begins."`
`"Now, the number of purple statements we can trust has grown tremendously.`
` We're really getting into the thick of it...!"`
`"Yeah!`
` Let's check through the purple statements of the characters we've just proven innocent...!"`
`"Krauss, Natsuhi, Shannon, `
`Kanon, Gohda, Kumasawa.`
` I've looked through the purple statements for all the people we just proved innocent!"`
`"Yeah.`
` And as a result, we've proven that Genji-san isn't the culprit."`
`"After the first twilight, Kanon announces in a purple statement that he confirmed Genji's death.`
` That clears Genji of suspicion as well...!"`
`"So now, a total of 9 people have been proven innocent.`
` Things are going pretty well."`
`"Ah, right. It looks like Shannon's and Kumasawa's purple statements confirm that the six people of the first twilight all died."`
`"......We shouldn't accept that so easily."`
`"Why not?`
` We can trust Shannon's and Kumasawa's statements, can we not?"`
`"Yeah, right?`
` If you're sure they aren't culprits, why can't you trust their purple statements?"`
`"Kumasawa-san, for example, only said they were 'lying there, covered in blood'.`
` So, it's not clear whether they were alive or dead.`
` We can't call this a perfect examination of the six victims."`
`"Shannon speaks of those six in a different way.`
` She says 'Each of the children confirmed the deaths of their own parents'."`
`"In the dining hall, that means George-aniki, Maria, and I each examined our own parents.`
` However, we haven't proven yet that any of those three are innocent."`
`"Oh, I get it.`
` ...Shannon's words prove that the children confirmed each of the six deaths in the dining hall,`
` but they don't prove that the examinations those kids performed were legitimate."`
`"That's it.`
` Since we can't deny the possibility that the kids are lying, we still can't remove all six people in the dining hall from suspicion."`
`"How troublesome...`
` Those three are the survivors who live until the end.`
` Since they are alive, that makes it impossible to prove that they aren't culprits..."`
`"Battler, George, and Maria.`
` ...While these survivors are very likely to be culprits, it's probably also hardest to prove them innocent."`
`"At any rate,`
` it looks like those nine are the only ones whose innocence we can be sure of thanks to their confirmed deaths."`
`"From here on out, it'll just be pure reasoning based off the purple statements of the nine we can trust."`
`"Nanjo, Jessica, Krauss,`
` Natsuhi, Shannon, Kanon,`
` Gohda, Kumasawa, and Genji.`
` All we can do is read through their purple statements once more..."`
`"Things are going to get hard starting now.`
` Let's steel ourselves and take a shot at it...!"`
`"Indeed.`
` It's finally starting to feel like a real mystery...!"`
`"Hey, Beato.`
` I've found something interesting.`
` In this chain of crimes, master keys can never be used."`
`"Come to think of it, the group of nine innocent people includes all five servants, doesn't it?"`
`"Only the servants can use master keys.`
` They can't hand them over to someone else.`
` And, since people who aren't culprits themselves can't assist culprits, the master keys can't be used for crimes."`
`Since it's been guaranteed that all five servants are innocent, `
`we know that the master keys have nothing to do with the crimes.`
`"Yes, that's right...!`
` And that makes this even more troublesome, correct?`
` All of these closed room murders!`
` Every one of them must be constructed without any master keys...!"`
`"No.`
` Spin the chessboard around.`
` This just means that they can all be constructed with tricks that don't involve master keys."`
`"I see...!`
` So, we have the first twilight, the closed room of the dining hall,`
` the second twilight, Natsuhi's closed room,`
` and starting with the fifth twilight, the closed room of the guesthouse.`
` It seems we must look closely through those again..."`
`"Let's read it through once more carefully.`
` ...All of the servants are innocent.`
` Master keys can't be used.`
` Let's think through it again with that in mind."`
`"I think I have a theory about the closed room of the first twilight."`
`"Let's hear it."`
`"The corpse examinations of the victims in the first twilight still aren't certain.`
` In other words, what if one of them was really the culprit?!`
` They killed the other five, locked the dining hall from the inside, and played dead...!"`
`"True, they could create a closed room without using master keys that way.`
` That leaves us with a problem though."`
`"What problem?"`
`"Remember?`
` When we were talking about the second twilight, Bernkastel said this with the red truth:`
` the culprit of the first twilight really did kill six people."`
`"Yes, now that you mention it...`
` ...Muu..."`
`"Because of that red, it seems all six people in the dining hall were dead after all.`
` So, how did someone lock the dining hall from the outside?`
` Without using a key..."`
`"Hey, Battler.`
` Does that red truth really confirm the deaths of all six people in the dining hall?"`
`"...Hmm, ...well, ...doesn't it...?"`
`"In that case, the six in the dining hall were all innocent, and excluding Genji, whose innocence has already been confirmed, we can remove five more people from the list of suspects, yes?`
` In other words, 9+5=14 people have been proved innocent...!`
` There are only three left!`
` Either Battler, George, or Maria is the culprit...!"`
`"Wait a second!`
` ...There's something about this that's bugging me.`
` That red truth did say that the culprit killed six people.`
` However, she didn't say that red right after the first twilight."`
`"I believe she said it back when we were talking about the second twilight, yes...?"`
`"I'd like to read through that bit again.`
` Let's search.`
` It feels like that was a strange time for her to say it..."`
`"...Not bad."`
`"Can't underestimate these two.`
` Even their instincts are sharp."`
`"I've been thinking about the second twilight's closed room, but no matter how many times I try, I keep ending up with the same theory..."`
`"You mean someone killing the pair of them, then locking the door from the inside and hiding?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...Since the master keys can't be used, the door must have been locked from the inside.`
` So, it only makes sense if the culprit was hiding somewhere in Natsuhi's room."`
`"Right.`
` That is weird.`
` It says this in the narration:`
` no matter how much time passed, Krauss and Natsuhi were the only ones who didn't return.`
` And then it continues:`
` everyone headed to Krauss's and Natsuhi's rooms together."`
`"If Krauss and Natsuhi were the only ones who didn't return, ...that implies that everyone else did return to the parlor."`
`"That's right.`
` If the criminal locked themselves in Natsuhi's room after committing the crime, they shouldn't have been able to return.`
` And yet, everyone except the victims did return."`
`"That would make this crime impossible for all the survivors...`
` ...So, maybe we really should follow up on your theory of someone in the dining hall surviving and committing crimes later..."`
`"...Come to think of it,`
` ...when I mentioned that theory, I was hit with a red truth."`
`My theory was that someone in the dining hall was alive and killed Krauss and Natsuhi.`
`That theory was countered by this red: the culprit of the first twilight really did kill six people...`
`"Well, that red is hardly surprising.`
` After all, the culprit went on to kill Krauss and Natsuhi, so they've killed a total of not just six, but eight people."`
`"......`
`...Huh...?`
` Hold on...`
` ...They went on to kill Krauss and Natsuhi, `
`...which means..."`
`"I've got it!!`
` We've been fooled.`
` I know what she meant by saying the culprit killed six people...!!"`
`"What do you mean, you know what she meant?`
` Explain yourself...!"`
`"The culprit of the first twilight really did kill six people.`
` If she'd said this right after the first twilight, I probably wouldn't have found anything odd about it.`
` However, since she said it after the second twilight, a new possibility shows itself...!"`
`"You don't mean...`
`...that the 'six people who were killed' includes the murders of the second twilight...?!"`
`"That's it!`
` The culprit really was hiding among the six in the dining hall!`
` Later on, they snuck out of the dining hall, killed the two people in Aunt Natsuhi's room, locked the door from the inside, and hid somewhere in the room...!"`
`The culprit could only have killed five people at most in the dining hall.`
`However, if we add on the victims of the second twilight, they would definitely have killed at least six times...!`
`"I see, now it all adds up...!`
` You can construct the closed rooms of both the first and second twilights without using master keys...!!"`
`"Well, ...you'd think so, but that reminds me of something else.`
` ...Aunt Natsuhi's room was sealed immediately afterwards..."`
`"Yes, come to think of it...`
` Lady Bernkastel used the red truth to say this:`
` the group sealed the room at the same time they left. No culprit joined the group as they left."`
`"And she also said this:`
` all of the seals will not be broken."`
`"In other words, ...the culprit is trapped in a closed room again."`
`"That theory might explain the first and second twilights.`
` ...However, the culprit would be sealed inside Aunt Natsuhi's room, unable to leave."`
`"And that means they wouldn't be able to carry out the fourth twilight and onwards!`
` ...Gyah, I thought it was such a nice theory, ...but I guess it's wrong..."`
`"I don't think we're wrong about this theory, but...`
` ...Maybe it just needs some more tweaking..."`
`"No, it does work.`
` There's no problem if the culprit gets sealed up.`
` ...Not as long as there's a second culprit!"`
`"A multiple culprit theory...!`
` Yes, that does seem to be the only way.`
` That way, even if one culprit is sealed up, the other can continue murdering..."`
`"If you think about it, `
`our theory needed an accomplice from the very beginning.`
` In the first twilight, Aunt Eva, Uncle Hideyoshi, that old bastard, Kyrie-san, and Aunt Rosa, `
`in other words, everyone who hasn't been confirmed innocent, had their deaths confirmed by people who also haven't been confirmed innocent.`
` Unless those people were fellow culprits, no one would've been able to play dead."`
`"You're right...!`
` After all, the rules say that only culprits can cooperate with other culprits...!"`
`"Culprits are capable of lying even before they commit murder.`
` ...So, we have ourselves a theory."`
`"The culprit who carried out the first twilight murders also carried out the second twilight, then locked themselves up in Natsuhi's room."`
`"Then, the other culprit, who lied about the first culprit's death, carried on with the murders starting at the fourth twilight...!"`
`"Yes, it all matches up that way...!!`
` So, which of them was it?!"`
`"Unfortunately, so far, any one of them could be a culprit.`
` However, we can say for sure that the crime wasn't committed by a single person.`
` And, we know that the culprit locked up in Natsuhi's room was one of those five victims in the dining hall.`
` And we also know that the person who continued with the crimes was one of those who inspected the five suspicious corpses on the first twilight...!"`
`"One of those who inspected the five suspicious corpses in the dining hall...?`
` That would be..."`
`"Battler, George, or Maria.`
` We know that one of those three committed the murders later on!"`
`"Excellent...`
` Let's focus on those three and find the truth about those later crimes...!"`
`"The next crime is the fourth twilight.`
` Shannon-chan was the one killed.`
`"George.`
` Jessica, who has been confirmed innocent, used the purple text to say that it was impossible for George to kill Shannon.`
` So, doesn't that mean either Battler or Maria must have killed her?"`
`"I'd like to think that, but it's too soon to be sure.`
` Battler, Maria, and every other person except George lacks an alibi.`
` I've managed to prove that the crime wasn't committed by a single person, but I didn't prove that there were exactly two culprits.`
` At this point in time, it's still too soon to be sure."`
`"I see.`
` There might be a culprit for the first and second twilights, a culprit who lied about the first culprit's death,`
` ...and another completely separate culprit as well.`
` ...Yes, it was a mistake to overlook that..."`
`"The murder of Shannon-chan was possible for anyone, with only one single exception.`
` Also, that fact alone isn't enough to prove that George-aniki is innocent."`
`"...I thought this would be an easy one since there's no closed room,`
` but on the contrary, we have no suspicious circumstances and no information to lead us to the culprit..."`
`"The pace of the crimes picks up starting here.`
` Instead of getting stuck on this one part, we should start taking a look at the fifth twilight too."`
`"It seems we have a problem with the fifth and sixth twilights...!`
` We can trust Jessica's purple statements, and she said this:`
` the four cousins and Doctor Nanjo couldn't have killed Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san...!"`
`"The four cousins and Nanjo.`
` In other words, all of the survivors at this point in time.`
` On the face of it, that makes this crime impossible."`
`"However, that's where we can spin the chessboard around, correct?"`
`"You've got it.`
` This actually gives us a simple answer.`
` This twilight proves that there's a culprit who isn't Doctor Nanjo or one of the cousins."`
`"Other than these survivors, everyone is supposed to be dead.`
` And yet, it was impossible for the survivors to commit the crime..."`
`"It's absolute proof that one of the culprits faked their death."`
`"And, since there exists a culprit who faked his or her death, that's absolute proof that there were multiple culprits.`
` Only a culprit can fake an examination and lie...!"`
`"The fifth and sixth twilights may seem to be perfect impossible crimes,`
` but this one incident alone tells us so much."`
`"Impossible crimes are a double-edged sword. They have the power to make your opponents surrender, but they also make it possible for theories to break deep into your lines of defense.`
` ...Long ago, you would surely have surrendered.`
` How far you've come."`
`"Heheh.`
` It's all because you've trained me so well."`
`The pair grinned at each other.`
`They had been to the brink of death and back in their many intellectual games before now.`
`They wouldn't be discouraged by a riddle like this.`
`"Now let's move on to the crimes of the seventh and eighth twilights.`
` I think we're getting pretty close to the core of things."`
`"Yes, let's get ourselves ready and go!"`
`"The situation's exactly the same on the seventh twilight.`
` Since we can trust Jessica's purple statement, the four cousins--or in other words, all of the survivors--couldn't have committed the crime."`
`"And yet, ...there's something I don't quite get.`
` The culprit of the first two twilights was someone in that group of five victims from the first twilight.`
` Though that first culprit was sealed in Natsuhi's room, their child was also a culprit, who lied when confirming their death.`
` ...However, the only kids who can be a culprit are Battler, George, and Maria."`
`"That's right.`
` And we've proven that they couldn't have committed murder for the fifth, sixth, and seventh twilights."`
`"In other words,`
` ......this shows us that yet another culprit exists."`
`"Interesting.`
` It also happens to be a theory that makes sense.`
` It would mean that the third culprit was also one of those who played dead.`
` ...It might even be possible to have four or five culprits this way."`
`"*cackle* I'm not sure about that.`
` At any rate, Gohda, Kumasawa, and Nanjo couldn't have been killed if there were only two culprits.`
` There can be no doubt of that...!"`
`"This is getting complicated.`
` Was it a group of three culprits?`
` Or was it a pair working together and someone else on their own?`
` ...Ah, right, we can't forget the possibility that there are more than three culprits."`
`"Of the 17 people who appear in the story, 9 have been confirmed innocent.`
` Let's put Battler, George, and Maria to the side, since they survived.`
` The group of people who were supposedly dead, but not proved innocent,`
` includes Eva, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, Kyrie, and Rosa, `
`all victims in the first twilight."`
`"Now, the question is which of those five victims in the dining hall were playing dead.`
` ...We're close now.`
` This is starting to get interesting...!"`
`"As for the eighth twilight in the end,`
` the layout's exactly the same."`
`"Indeed.`
` The narration says that George, Battler, and Maria could not have killed Jessica.`
` The three survivors couldn't have done it."`
`"The purple statements here sound like they should hold a lot of hints for us."`
`"George's and Maria's purple statements are particularly interesting.`
` If only we could trust them, they would be quite a powerful clue..."`
`"If George-aniki is innocent, then his purple statement about Maria being unable to kill anyone would be true, and Maria would be confirmed innocent.`
` In the same way, if Maria is innocent, then her statement about George being unable to kill an adult would be true, and in the end, that proves George-aniki innocent."`
`"It would, but we cannot confirm that either of them is innocent..."`
`"If either George-aniki or Maria could prove that the other was innocent, they would be innocent too.`
` It's like a chicken and egg dilemma.`
` It almost feels like a useful hint, but not quite.`
` Pretty annoying."`
`"Proving innocence for either of them probably won't be easy.`
` At least we've gotten the suspects down to a small number.`
` From here on out, there's probably nothing left to do except check each one to see if they could have been a culprit."`
`"You're right.`
` It feels like we're getting to the final stretch!"`
`"Looks like they've almost made it, doesn't it...?"`
`"......I feel like a fish on the chopping board."`
`"First, let's try checking theories with Maria as a culprit.`
` If she's guilty, then Rosa could've been playing dead.`
` She could've carried out the crimes on the first and second twilights.`
` Then, she gets locked in Aunt Natsuhi's room, and Maria does the rest of the murders."`
`"It was impossible for Maria to commit any of the murders in the guesthouse.`
` So, the most Maria could do was kill Shannon."`
`"Which means a third culprit would be needed for the guesthouse murders."`
`"The third one would have to be Eva, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, or Kyrie.`
` That means we would need a fourth culprit too, correct?"`
`"...You're right.`
` In order for one of those four adults to play dead, the child who checked them would have to be a culprit too.`
` In other words, if Maria is a culprit, we'll need to have at least four culprits total."`
`"If there are four culprits, then each one of them must kill at least one person."`
`The definition of 'culprit' is 'one who murders'.`
`"...In which case,`
` ...things don't quite seem to add up."`
`"The four culprits would then be two adults and two children.`
` One adult is in charge of the murders on the first and second twilights.`
` The other adult handles the murders from the guesthouse onwards.`
` Yes, that creates a contradiction."`
`"A culprit is defined as 'one who murders'.`
` ...That means every culprit must commit murder at least once."`
`"Simply put, there are very few people that a child culprit could murder.`
` The children could not have killed in the first and second twilights.`
` They also can't commit murder after the first deaths in the guesthouse take place.`
` The only one they can possibly commit is Shannon's murder on the fourth twilight."`
`"...A child culprit can only kill Shannon.`
` A second child culprit couldn't kill anyone, so they couldn't be a culprit at all.`
` ...It means there can be only one child culprit."`
`"As soon as we pick Maria as a culprit, we need another adult culprit besides Rosa.`
` However, it's impossible for there to be a second child culprit to lie about their parent's death.`
` ...In other words, it's impossible for Maria to be a culprit...!"`
`"Next, let's try out theories with George as a culprit.`
` Only one child culprit can exist.`
` So, if George-aniki is a culprit, that means Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi are the only adults who could've been playing dead."`
`"So, a three person group, with two adults and one kid?`
` I see, that sounds like it'd explain all the crimes so far, doesn't it?"`
`"But hold it!`
` That's actually impossible too."`
`"Indeed.`
` It's clearly shown that George cannot be a culprit."`
`"*giggle*`
` ...Pretty sharp.`
` The kids can only kill Shannon on the fourth twilight."`
`"A trustworthy purple statement has already proven that George couldn't have been the culprit in Shannon's murder...!"`
`"That's it.`
` Just one tiny alibi that only works for Shannon-chan's murder.`
` That's what proves George-aniki innocent for all of the crimes...!"`
`"So, we need not suspect George...!`
` Which means all of his purple statements can be relied upon...!"`
`"Once we're sure that George is innocent,`
` that automatically makes Maria innocent too."`
`"Yeah.`
` It confirms George-aniki's purple statement saying 'Maria couldn't kill anyone'.`
` Since she couldn't kill anyone, she can't be a culprit.`
` So, Maria is also confirmed innocent."`
`"Since George and Maria are innocent,`
` that also proves that their examinations of their parents' deaths were trustworthy."`
`"That's right.`
` No one will mistakenly confirm a death,`
` and people who aren't culprits can't lie.`
` So, the deaths of their parents have been confirmed, and those parents are also innocent."`
`"We've gotten rid of almost everyone...`
` ...The answer is already clear, is it not...?"`
`"First off, there are multiple culprits.`
` That's confirmed.`
` These crimes would be impossible for a single person."`
`"To start, `
`one of the adult culprits carried out the first twilight, then played dead."`
`"Since we know that all of the servants with master keys were innocent,`
` there was no way for the culprit to lock the door to the dining hall from the outside.`
` So, we know the one who locked it did so from inside the room."`
`"And, in order for them to play dead,`
` they needed another culprit to lie when examining their death."`
`"Genji-san is innocent, and the examinations of all five suspicious victims were performed by their own children.`
` So, the child of the first culprit is the second culprit."`
`"And, the child culprit couldn't carry out the crimes once they start occurring in the guesthouse.`
` However, the adult culprit was sealed up in Natsuhi's room.`
` So, a second adult culprit was needed."`
`"Two adults, one kid.`
` That's what our culprit group looks like."`
`"It should be obvious by now.`
` The name of the child culprit in this culprit group is clear."`
`"Pretty much.`
` All of the kids have been proven innocent, with one exception."`
`"And the only corpse inspections that a child culprit could lie about were the inspections of that child's own parents.`
` So, the culprit group was a family of two adults and one child."`
`"Murder as a family, huh?`
` How sweet."`
`"So, who are the three culprits?`
` There's hardly any point in stretching this out further, is there?"`
`"Aw, come on.`
` What a messed up answer.`
` Looks like I was the child culprit."`
`"Hmph.`
` Even in my games, Battler culprit theories were some of the most popular, weren't they?"`
`"It seems so.`
` Sheesh, why does everyone think I did it...?!"`
`"If you're a culprit, that automatically makes your parents culprits too.`
` There's no need to worry anymore.`
` We've already won."`
`"There's no need for any more discussions or hints.`
` Let's move ahead with the answer...!"`
`"Is it over?"`
`"...Well done.`
` ...It seems a mystery of this level wasn't enough to beat those two after all."`
`"Somebodyyyyyyyyy!!`
` Is anyone there?!`
` Onii-chaaaaaaaan!!`
` Aaaaaaahh!!"`
`Ange flew out of the guesthouse, sobbing.`
`Is there anyone still alive on this island?`
`When she checked the cousin room earlier, it had been completely empty.`
`However, she remembered that she hadn't seen Battler, George, or Maria's bodies.`
`What she didn't know was whether this meant they were safe...or whether she was about to be reunited with them as corpses.`
`"Where are they?!`
` Wheeeeeeeeere?!!`
` Answer meeeeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`She dashed around through the rain.`
`Where was she going?`
` Nowhere in particular.`
`The lost little sister dashed around in circles, searching for her brother.`
`Drenched with rain and all alone...`
`......Eventually, I thought I heard my brother's voice from beyond a bush.`
`No, it wasn't just his voice.`
` I heard George onii-chan's and Maria onee-chan's voices too.`
`I called out at the top of my lungs, but they didn't answer.`
`But it's okay now.`
` They're right there.`
` Just on the other side of the fence.`
`I could even faintly see them through the fence.`
`When I ran around the fence, I found myself standing in front of a shed or something.`
`It must be a shed to store tools for the rose garden.`
`The three of them were standing in front of the shed.`
`"Onii-chan...!!"`
`I cried out, but my voice didn't reach them.`
`Even though I yelled so loudly?`
`Something felt very wrong about all this.`
`...When people hear a voice, even when they pretend not to have heard it, their bodies tend to show some sign that they've noticed.`
`However, there was no trace of that in the three of them.`
`Even though I was screaming so loud, ...it truly wasn't reaching their ears.`
`The instant I understood that, ...my dash towards them slowed and came to a halt.`
`Though we appeared to be in the same world, ...we were actually in different worlds entirely.`
`It was like seeing someone on TV.`
` Or was it more like seeing a ghost...?`
`I could see them clearly, ...but as far as they were concerned, I didn't exist.`
`...After all, look.`
`Even if I stand in front of them, ...their eyes can't see me.`
`If I try and touch them, will I really be able to?`
`...What if my hand just went right through...?`
`I was so scared at the thought...that I could do nothing but stand there in shock, even though I was so close to them...`
`"Dammit...!!`
` I don't have a clue anymore...!`
` Someone must've snuck in from outside the island after all!!`
` And they're massacring the Ushiromiya family!"`
`"...No matter how we lock ourselves in, someone always gets killed.`
` ...Uu-! It's the work of a witch after all!"`
`"Everyone, calm down...!`
` Let's calm down and think.`
` ...No one exists on this island except those with a direct relation to the Ushiromiya family."`
`"That doesn't make sense...!`
` After all, we've just seen several murders that'd be impossible for any one of us!"`
`"...Well, that's true...`
` But is it really?`
` Maybe we've just missed something."`
`"Missed something?"`
`"For example...`
` ......That's right, maybe someone was playing dead!`
` Since we're the only ones on this island, the culprit must be one of us.`
` That means someone we thought was dead was actually faking...!"`
`"But Aniki, that's impossible!`
` Every one of the corpses was checked by someone!`
` There's no way any of them were faking!"`
`"I don't want to think about it, `
`...but what if those corpse inspections...were also faked?"`
`"...Uu-...?"`
`"It could have gone like this:`
` there were multiple culprits from the start.`
` Then, one plays dead, and the other lies and confirms that the first culprit died.`
` Then, the culprit who played dead keeps on committing crimes, `
`creating the illusion that some stranger has snuck onto the island...!"`
`"Do you...still suspect someone in the Ushiromiya family of being the culprit?!"`
`"...Doctor Nanjo was killed.`
` So, it's probably safe to say that he isn't a culprit.`
` And, we can consider the examinations performed by a doctor like him to be the most reliable."`
`If so, then it's fair to say that the people whose death Nanjo checked were almost certainly dead.`
`Who did Nanjo check?`
`Genji's corpse.`
`Krauss and Natsuhi's corpses.`
`Shannon's corpse.`
`Gohda and Kumasawa's corpses.`
`"Think back to the beginning and the bodies in the dining hall.`
` Of those six victims, Doctor Nanjo only inspected Genji-san."`
`"...But didn't the rest of us check the others?"`
`"Yes, but Doctor Nanjo didn't actually inspect them himself."`
`"What are you talking about?!`
` How the hell could our parents have survived after being killed like that?!`
` Anyway, what do you think you're saying, George-aniki?!`
` Wouldn't that mean one of our parents is the culprit?!`
` That's insane!!`
` They were killed right at the beginning, and so many of them...!`
` How can you accuse our parents of being killers after that?!`
` I won't let anyone, not even you, suspect and slander our parents after they've been killed like that...!!"`
`"......S-Sorry..."`
`"...I know my Mama was really dead.`
` So, does that mean George onii-chan's parents or Battler's parents were the culprits?"`
`"Let's stop this, Maria-chan...`
` I must have lost it a bit back there..."`
`"George onii-chan wouldn't kill Shannon."`
`"That's enough...!`
` None of us would kill members of our family, right?!!"`
`"So, I don't think George onii-chan would lie and say his parents were dead, not if they were really alive.`
` ...There's no way George onii-chan would help out in a crime if Shannon was going to be killed."`
`Calmly, ...as though answering a quiz or a riddle, Maria spoke to George.`
`Then, with a blank look on her face, she turned to Battler and spoke.`
`"......Battler, you saw your Dad's and Mom's corpses, right?"`
`"Yeah, I saw them!!`
` We all saw them right?!`
` Those pitiful, bloodstained...!!"`
`"I think you're lying."`
`"Huh?!`
` Where the hell did that come from?!!"`
`"Because that way, it all makes sense.`
` ...Back in the dining hall, Battler's parents weren't dead.`
` One of them killed Aunt Natsuhi and Uncle Krauss, locked the door from the inside, and waited in that room.`
` ...The other one took over the murders after that.`
` ...To break open the closed room of the guesthouse, they needed to have an accomplice inside.`
` That was Battler.`
` ...That explains everything."`
`"E-Enooooooooooooough!!!"`
`"St-Stop it, Battler-kun...!`
` You too, Maria-chan...!"`
`"Finally, all the pieces fit together in the Wolves and Sheep puzzle in my head.`
` ...The culprits are Battler's family.`
` Uu-.`
` ...Am I right?"`
`"Wh-What are you talking abooooooooout?!!!"`
`"Correct."`
`The voice came from behind Ange.`
`She spun around, surprised.`
`...There, covered in blood, ...yet wearing cheery expressions, ...were Rudolf and Kyrie.`
`"Uncle Rudolf, Aunt Kyrie, ...I-I'm so glad you're sa-"`
`After saying that much, George realized what his words meant, and his face twisted into an expression of shock and horror.`
`Maria wasn't surprised.`
` However, she showed no joy at having her answer proved correct.`
`And as for Battler...`
`...Ange...saw it.`
`That terrible expression, ...one that she would never forget as long as she lived.`
`It was...a demon's smile.`
`A hideous demon that she'd never see again twisted its face in a foul grin, and the truly horrible thing was...`
`That she saw it...on her brother's face...`
`Rudolf and Kyrie lifted up the guns they had been holding behind them.`
`The barrels pointed at the foreheads of George, who staggered backwards, and Maria, who grinned as though she was beyond caring what happened next.`
`There was a flash of lightning and a crack of thunder.`
` Nothing more could be heard.`
`Then, as George and Maria were snapped around by that roar, ...the strings holding them were snipped.`
`The two dolls fell into puddles with a splash...and stopped moving...`
`"...D-Dad, ...Mom..."`
`All of this occurred right before Ange's eyes...`
`"Heh...hahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"Heheheheheh, hahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"Ihihihihihihihahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`Ange, who stood stunned beside them, wasn't visible to their eyes.`
`They guffawed, overcome with laughter.`
` Then, right in front of Ange, they started joking and complimenting each other on their kills so far.`
`The three hideous faces...the faces of her family...made Ange want to cry and vomit at the same time, and she felt as though she would suffocate.`
`Ange dashed away, covering her mouth.`
`She wanted to escape the disgusting laughter coming from her beloved family as soon as possible.`
`Then, she slipped and fell face-down in a puddle of mud.`
`She didn't try to get up.`
`In fact, she instead chose to cover her ears to block out the disgusting laughter that she could still hear.`
`As she did, ...from the shadows of the fences and bushes in this inky-black rose garden, ...several dark things slipped into sight.`
`"......?!?!"`
`Ange looked around in surprise...to see eerie black shapes appearing from all over the garden...`
`and slowly surrounding her.`
`It was...a crowd of people with goat heads.`
`Their outfits were all different.`
`Some wore suits, while others were dressed casually.`
` However, all of them were covered with darkness, and all of them had goat heads.`
`Ange, bewildered, accidentally let her hands fall from her ears.`
`By now, she couldn't hear that disgusting laughter.`
`However, in their place, ...she could hear the words spoken by the goats.`
`『......Kyrie and Rudolf are...the culprits.〝`
`『Battler is the culprit...Battler is the culprit...〝`
`『...Battler culprit theory.`
` Battler's family culprit theory...〝`
`As the goats continued to mumble in eerie voices, ...they surrounded Ange and began to draw nearer.`
`They all pressed around her, each of them naming Ange's family as the culprits...`
`......At first, everyone joined in on the Eva culprit theory.`
`The sole survivor from Rokkenjima got almost all of the wealth to herself, so such a theory was only natural.`
`Why was Ushiromiya Eva the only one who escaped to Kuwadorian?`
` And why did she refuse so stubbornly to talk about what happened that day?`
`It was decided that the Eva culprit theory fit all these facts.`
`However, when Eva died of illness, and people learned that all the vast wealth she had created by unscrupulous means would go to Ange,`
` public opinion...or rather, the Forgers...created and spread a new culprit theory.`
`This was...the 'Rudolf's family culprit theory'.`
`If it was normal for everyone to come to the family conferences, why was Ange the only one who didn't come this time?`
`Did Rudolf's family have some reason for not bringing the young Ange with them?`
`They did take Battler, but he wasn't Kyrie's son.`
`Then, when it was revealed in some magazines that Kyrie's family had close ties to a massive gangster organization, all eyes suddenly gathered on Kyrie herself.`
`The truth of how Rudolf had made a killing out of fraudulent business practices was also laid bare,`
` and almost immediately, the couple became thought of as the most suspicious people on the island.`
`Hideyoshi and Eva's company might have been heavy-handed at times, but at least it had operated within the law.`
`However, the more Rudolf's company was investigated, the more dirt was dug up.`
`Furthermore, testimony was dug up about various scandals involving party tickets from the time Rudolf and Kyrie were students,`
` and it was clear that they were far more suspicious than Eva's family.`
`And so, in a flash,`
` ...the 'Rudolf's family culprit theory' expelled the other conspiracy theories, including the Eva culprit theory, and reigned as the greatest of them all.`
`...It wasn't really because it was more plausible than the Eva culprit theory.`
`They had just gotten bored of the old theory and wanted a new sensation...`
`The goats seemed to bend and undulate.`
`The sky rapidly turned white, ...becoming a ceiling lit by fluorescent lamps.`
`The goats had changed completely, ...becoming the shapes of girls...wearing goat masks.`
`All of the girls were wearing the same clothes.`
`It was a uniform.`
` ...The uniform of Saint Lucia Academy.`
`『...Did you hear? The real culprits were Rudolf and Kyrie!〝`
`『I heard, I heard!`
` Yeah, I knew there was something suspicious about them leaving their kid behind!〝`
`『Didn't Ushiromiya Eva say herself that she was poisoned to death?!`
` Isn't it obvious who was behind that?!〝`
`『Must be nice for her. She gets her whole family's riches all to herself, right?〝`
`『I always knew the 'Rudolf's family culprit theory' was right!〝`
`『I always thought there was something wrong with Ushiromiya-san...〝`
`『*whisper*whisper*whisper*.〝`
`『*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*.〝`
`『Rudolf and Kyrie are culprits.〝`
`『Isn't Battler a culprit too?〝`
`『Rudolf's family culprit theory!〝`
`『Rudolf and Kyrie are the killers!〝`
`『They tried to get the family wealth all to themselves, but Eva killed them back and they failed-〝`
`『But in the end, Ushiromiya Ange gets everything anyway, doesn't she?〝`
`『Rudolf and Kyrie are the culprits, of course!〝`
`『Rudolf's family culprit theory!〝`
`『Rudolf and Kyrie and Battler are the culprits!〝`
`『Rudolf and Kyrie and Battler are the culprits!!〝`
`『They're saying your family were the culprits, Ushiromiya-san!〝`
`『What do you think of that?`
` Hey, what do you think?!〝`
`『But in the end, you get all the family wealth to yourself, don't you?!〝`
`『Even at the end, Ushiromiya Eva never told you anything, right?!〝`
`『I always knew that girl was suspicious!〝`
`『This also explains why Eva hated you so much!〝`
`『Hey, hey, say something, tell us what you think!〝`
`『She really is a creepy kid, isn't she?〝`
`『Can't you at least tell us what you think of this theory, creep?!!〝`
`A blade of air swept over me as I crouched down, holding my head.`
`In a flash, the illusion of female students with goat heads that surrounded me shattered.`
`...I was curled up in a puddle in the rainy rose garden, surrounded by goats.`
`But then, those goats were also sliced in half, and the upper halves slid to the side.`
`It was like seeing a master swordsman slicing through a stick of bamboo.`
`"This way...!"`
`The voice came...from that black cat.`
`The black cat with the bell that had guided me here.`
`Incredible that it can talk...`
`But that doesn't matter now.`
` I dashed after it.`
`The goats shrank back.`
`A hole opened up in the encirclement.`
` The black cat dashed through it.`
`As I hurried through it, the goats began to chase after me.`
`Countless heavy footsteps thundered behind us.`
`"...Wh-Where are we running to, Mr. Cat...?!"`
`The cat ignored my stupid question.`
`Where are we running to?`
`It's obvious.`
` As far away as we can make it.`
`However, there was an unbelievable number of goats.`
`It wasn't just the group chasing us.`
` There were probably goats hiding throughout the rose garden, and everywhere we went, a group of them would appear and block our path.`
`Each time we bumped into them, we ran down a different path in this maze of a rose garden.`
`So, I didn't even know which direction we were running anymore.`
`It couldn't be...`
` We aren't running around in circles inside a massive crowd of goats, are we...?`
`When we ran into the arbor once more, I learned that my fears were justified.`
`The four paths that led from the arbor were all blocked by a crowd of goats.`
`Of course, the path we had come down was also blocked by our pursuers.`
`There was nowhere to go, and nowhere to return to.`
` ...We were finally...trapped...`
`"M-Mr. Cat, ...what should we do? W-We're surrounded...!!"`
`"............"`
`The black cat glared at the goats that surrounded us, standing on guard.`
`It's...all over for us...`
`At that moment, I found myself floating in the air.`
`A massive arm, large enough to crush my entire head, had grabbed my collar from behind.`
`Before I could even think to cry out, ...I saw, right in front of my face, a pair of strangely glowing red eyes, and a massive mouth with jagged teeth and a foul breath.`
`The mouth...opened wide...`
`and, as though it was a separate creature, ...a bizarre tongue stuck itself out.`
`Then, ...it spat words at me.`
`『......Rudolf, Kyrie, and Battler are the culprits...`
` ...Rudolf and Kyrie played dead, and Battler lied when he inspected them...`
` Then, one of the parents carried out the murders up until the second twilight and hid under the bed in Natsuhi's room.`
` ...Battler killed Shannon, and then assisted in the murders in the guesthouse.`
` ...The other parent carried out the guesthouse murders...`
` This is...the truth......〝`
`Then, ...that gaping, smelly mouth...slowly began to close over Ange's head...`
`"Counter.`
` ...`
`#5decffIt's possible to form a logical theory other than 'the Rudolf's family culprit theory'.#ffffff"`
`A blue flash...sliced off the top of the mouth that was trying to eat Ange's head, sending it flying.`
`I fell into a puddle, along with the goat that was still grasping my collar, though there was nothing left of it above its chin.`
`Without any hesitation, ...the goats stretched out their thick arms, as though they'd been given a second chance to snatch this prey for themselves, ...and they rushed towards me.`
` All of them spoke in unison.`
`『#5decffAnything besides the Rudolf's family culprit theory would be impossibllle...`
` ...Absolutely impossibllle...!!#ffffff〝`
`"#ff0000It's possible to form a logical explanation other than the Rudolf's family culprit theory.`
` #5decffFor example, a theory with George's family as the culprits is possible.#ffffff"`
`A red flash and a blue line became blades of wind that passed over my head,`
` doubly slicing the arms of a goat that tried to pick me up.`
`I think the next goats dashed, not towards me, ...but towards the black cat that was protecting me from behind.`
`As I sat on my butt, staring up towards the rainy night's sky,`
` the massive goats were in the air right above me, fighting the black cat...or someone.`
`『#5decffA George's family culprit theory is impossiiible!`
` George can't kill Shannnnnnon!!`
` So he can't be a culprit, and he can't liiiie when checking corpses!!!#ffffff〝`
`"#ff0000No, it is possible.`
` A 'culprit' is defined as 'one who murders'.`
` No one ever said they have to murder a character who appears in the story.`
` ...In other words,`
` if George committed murder outside the island, sometime before this crime, he could be a 'culprit' without killing anyone on the island, and it would be possible for him to lie.#ffffff"`
`The deep-red curves bit into the goat.`
`Its massive body was knocked into the air, ...became about seven logs of flesh, and was thrown into the rose bushes.`
`This time, the terrible force of the attack shocked the goats.`
` They faltered, shook, stepped back.`
`...Finally, I understood.`
`That red slice.`
` ...It had come from a weapon that could draw red slashes...no, it also drew blue slashes just a second ago.`
` It was a massive scythe that could speak both types of truth, red and blue, at will.`
`I looked up at the sky, ...then let my head hang down backwards.`
`There was no black cat there.`
`It was a girl...holding a large scythe...`
`"How's that?`
` This level of reasoning is possible for Furudo Erika."`
`When the crowd of goats recognized the girl who called herself Erika, ...a stir passed through it.`
`It was clear that this person had enough of a reputation to make them tremble.`
`Erika lifted me up, flew into the air, and landed on top of the arbor.`
`Then, she let go of me and, still wielding her scythe, made an elegant curtsy to the crowd of goats surrounding us.`
`"This is probably the first time most of you have met me.`
` Allow me to introduce myself!`
` Pleased to meet you, everyone!`
` I'm Furudo Erika, the detective!`
` ...If you're one of those blockheads who can only think of the Rudolf's family culprit theory, stand down!`
` If anyone thinks they can counter my argument, please feel free!`
` Of course, I won't be holding back either!!"`
`The goats all howled at once.`
` It seemed to be a cry of shock, of fear, or possibly of awe.`
`The goats surrounded the arbor, ...chattering, but not moving any closer.`
`None of them had the courage to stand against this detective, this Witch of Truth called Furudo Erika...`
`"...Good grief.`
` All those thousands, and this is the best you can do?`
` None of you has the courage to fight Furudo Erika in a battle of words?`
` ...Too bad.`
` Let's put an end to this.`
` Then again, I, Furudo Erika,`
` ...don't have enough spare time to counter all you blockheads one by one.`
` I'll let her clean up the rest.`
` ...You're up!!"`
`When Erika cried out, red cracks opened in the dark night's sky.`
`It looked like the spiderweb-shaped fissures that appear when a glass window has been struck hard.`
` ...Or was it more like a blood-red spiderweb?`
`"...*giggle*giggle* ...Kyahahahahahahaha...!"`
`A laugh rang out through the spiderweb-covered world.`
` ...A witch's laugh.`
`It sounded somehow familiar to Ange...`
`And there, ...standing on the spiderweb and gazing down on the goats who must have looked like trapped bugs, was the witch.`
`"You forget me, ...and you call HIM the ruler of Rokkenjima...?`
` You forget me, and you think Rudolf is the culpriiiit...?`
` Kyahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"`
`It was the witch who had hidden inside of Eva.`
` A witch of the future, who would one day call herself the Endless Witch after the cat box closed over this world.`
`"Who forgets EVA Beatrice and calls themselves the murderer of Rokkenjima?!`
` How impertinent!`
` On this island, who lives and who dies is totally up to me!!`
` All the wealth and gold is mine!!`
` Everything about October 4th and 5th in 1986 is mine to do with as I please!`
` It all belongs to me, EVA Beatrice!!"`
`EVA swung her One-Winged staff at the crowd of foolish goats beneath her, proclaiming their deaths.`
`The ceiling of spiderwebs that covered the heavens plummeted...and more spiderwebs seeped out of the ground at the goats' feet.`
`Then, the webs from above and below met, and thousands upon thousands of goats were caught in their grasp.`
`Then, as EVA swung her staff, it swirled.`
` Around and around, like egg yolk being mixed in a bowl.`
`Eventually, it was all packed into a massive, blood-red goo.`
`The moans of goats drifted out from inside.`
`That entire crowd had been compressed into a meatball a few meters across.`
`"So, you morons doubt that I'm the culprit?!!"`
`"Reaching the Eva culprit theory and giving up there...is good enough for the likes of you."`
`"If only you'd just get crushed and disappeeeeeear!!!"`
`Buchin.`
`*squelch*.`
`No other word could do that sound justice.`
`After sucking in all of those goats, the spider web ball vanished into thin air with a squelch.`
`After that, there wasn't even a trace left.`
`The dark rose garden lay there without any sound but that of the falling rain...`
`EVA drifted down from the sky.`
`"Your aunt will always be on your side, Ange-chan.`
` ...I'll never let anyone insult your family."`
`"...A-Aunt Eva..."`
`I knew I should be grateful.`
`And yet, ...it really wasn't easy for me to believe that Aunt Eva was my ally.`
`EVA realized that too.`
`"Don't worry.`
` I'm not doing this because I want to be thanked.`
` But I'll always be on your side.`
` ...See you later."`
`She giggled, spun around, and vanished...`
`Now that she had already left, I started to regret not saying even a thank you...`
`So, ...I figured I should at least thank the other person who had saved me.`
`"...Thanks...for saving me...`
` Who...are you...?"`
`I already knew her name.`
`What I was really asking...was why she had saved me.`
`"I'm Furudo Erika, the detective.`
` ...And I'm also a witch."`
`"...A witch...?"`
`"A Witch of Truth.`
` ...One who searches for the Single Truth.`
` And...so are you, right?"`
`"........."`
`Those two days... October 4th and 5th, 1986.`
`I've been so desperate to know what happened...that I took a step off the roof of that skyscraper,`
` ...drifted through several witch games and Fragment worlds, and abandoned myself to this long journey with no rewards.`
`All I want...is to know what happened that day.`
`All I want...is the Single Truth of that day.`
`"Searching for something like that is what makes you a Witch of Truth.`
` So, you're just the same as me.`
` ...That's why I came to save you."`
`"...I...want to know.`
` ...Just what happened on that day?`
` No one will tell me! No one knows...!`
` But I know something happened that day!`
` I'd give up anything to learn what that was...!`
` That's the one thing I need to know no matter what, even if it kills me...!`
` So tell me!`
` You know, don't you?!`
` You know what happened on this island, right?!"`
`"...Does a Witch of Truth `
`expect to be given the truth?`
` If I told you that so-and-so was the truth, would you really just accept whatever I said...?"`
`"No, ...I wouldn't......"`
`"What did Battler-san show you today?"`
`...Today, ...Onii-chan showed me a bizarre Halloween party.`
`It may have been heart-warming and a lot of fun, but...`
`It definitely...wasn't the truth.`
`"Didn't Battler-san show you something and say it was the truth?"`
`"It's not.`
` ...That couldn't...be the truth!"`
`"Sometimes, other people will try to mislead us by claiming that they know the truth.`
` ...But a real Witch of Truth must continue to pursue the Single Truth without being led astray.`
` That's why you can't accept the fake truth that Battler-san's trying to force on you.`
` ...You care about finding the one real truth more than anything."`
`"......Yeah..."`
`Onii-chan...is trying to confuse me.`
`I've felt that this whole time.`
`Even though he knows everything about what happened that day, ...he won't tell me anything at all.`
`How is he any different from Aunt Eva,`
` who mocked me and refused to tell me anything, even until the very moment of her death?`
`...Why won't Onii-chan tell me?`
`......`
`"...Why...?"`
`"............"`
`"Why...won't he tell me?!"`
`The dam inside my heart burst.`
`"Why won't Onii-chan...tell me what really happened?!!`
` Why? Why...?!!`
` I'm the only one who doesn't know!!`
` No one's telling me the truth!!`
` Tell me!!`
` Tell me what happened that day, Onii-chan!!`
` Onii-chaaaaaaaan!!!"`
`I cried out at the rainy night sky.`
`Hot tears poured from my eyes, but they were covered by the cold rain that beat against me, so no one other than me would know that they were tears.`
`...No one would know my pain and sadness.`
`I'm...always the only one alone...all alone...`
`"Someone, tell me!!!`
` Tell me what happened that day!!!"`
`"...No one can tell you.`
` ...After all, you can only find the truth if you look for yourself."`
`"Where is the truth?!`
` How can I find it?!`
` Everyone's hiding it! They won't tell me!`
` I'll find it myself...!`
` So please, just tell me where the truth is hidden...!"`
`"...Very well.`
` I can tell you."`
`As that voice rang out, the world bent and swirled.`
`After blinking several times, ...I realized that the world had become a sea of stars.`
`No, that's not quite right.`
` There are stars up there in the sky, but those lights below me aren't stars.`
`They're lights from building windows, street lights, car lights.`
`...I was floating in the dark sky...over a city lined with skyscrapers.`
`"...I can't tell you what the truth is.`
` ...However, if it's a question of how the truth can be reached,`
` ...I can show you the way."`
`"You......"`
`Various bad memories are jumping out at me from the back of my mind.`
`...That's right.`
` I was chained in place in that strange theater...and forced to watch a repulsive Fragment where Mom and Dad committed murder...`
`"...I never said that 'that' was the truth."`
`"B-But I heard what you said with the red. 'I'll say it just for you. That this is all truth'..."`
`"You yelled out and interrupted, stopping me from saying any more.`
` ...I was about to say 'That this is all truth...isn't necessarily so.'"`
`".........Just how far are you willing to go to mock me...?"`
`"...I apologize.`
` But I did want to test you."`
`"Test me how?"`
`"I wanted to see if you were ready to accept the truth, no matter what it may be."`
`"............"`
`"...The truth can betray you sometimes.`
` In fact, there are times when it shows itself as the thing you desire least.`
` ...That Fragment I showed you was probably the worst one you could possibly imagine.`
` ...However, if you lack the strength and the courage to withstand even something like that,`
` then you aren't fit to reach the truth."`
`".........!"`
`I have no comeback.`
`Finding the truth is my goal.`
` I just want to know what happened on that island on that day.`
`...I don't like to think...that I only want to hear what I want to hear.`
`...Am I really prepared to face the bloody, unbearable truth that probably awaits me...?`
`...If I find the truth, ...it'll mean having to look straight at my family's tragic final moments and accepting them as they are.`
`And if I do accept that,`
` ...it means abandoning my faint hope for a convenient miracle, `
`...the idea that one of them might have survived somehow...and might return even though 12 years have passed.`
`I know a miracle like that would be completely ridiculous, `
`...but if I'm honest with myself, I have to admit that I've been comforted by that faint hope these past 12 years.`
`...I want to know the truth.`
` But I want one of them to come back.`
`Those two wishes contradict each other.`
`By learning the truth, ...I'll be forced to accept that no one's coming home...`
`"......The truth is always cruel.`
` At times, it can even cut down your hopes.`
` ...Most of the time, Humans don't realize the costs of learning the truth.`
` ...I simply wanted to see if you had the necessary resolve."`
`I must choose between my two contradicting wishes.`
`Will I find the truth...`
`...and abandon my optimistic hopes for my family's return?`
`Or will I give up on the truth...`
`...and keep waiting for the family that will never really return for all eternity?`
` ......Will I freeze up and let myself be fooled by the childish illusion my brother made for me?`
`"......Tell me, Ange.`
` ...Are you truly determined to learn the truth...?"`
`"......`
`...I am."`
`"And your resolve will not falter?"`
`"It won't."`
`After hearing my immediate reply, Bernkastel stared at me.`
`Are those expressionless eyes of hers...measuring my resolve?`
`Now that my brother is covering up the truth even after becoming Game Master,`
` ...the only thing I can rely on in my search for the truth is the path that Bernkastel can show me...`
`"...Deep in your eyes...`
`I see the glint of one who seeks the truth."`
`"Will you tell me?!`
` Will you show me the way that leads to the truth...?!"`
`"Yes.`
` ......I'll guide you.`
` Did you forget, Ange?`
` ...I'm your guardian, right...?"`
`How long has it been since I last heard Bernkastel use that word?`
`...Yes.`
` I haven't heard it since the very beginning, when I met her in this future world and became a witch, with her as my guardian.`
`......That's when I became the Beatrice of 1998, the one who could defeat the Beatrice of 1986...`
`"You are the Beatrice of 1998.`
` ...ANGE Beatrice.`
` ...I became your guardian and recognized you as a witch.`
` However, you aren't an Endless Witch like Beato."`
`"......A Witch of Truth."`
`"That's right.`
` ......You're like Erika.`
` A Witch of Truth, who will seek the Single Truth, undeceived by any illusions."`
`"I guess the Witch of Truth, ...ANGE Beatrice, ...has the power to reach the Single Truth..."`
`"Yes.`
` ...However, up until now, you have been unable to use this power.`
` Do you know why?"`
`"...I do now.`
` ......Even though I searched for the truth, ...I unconsciously resisted learning the truth."`
`"Exactly.`
` ...Finding the truth was your goal,`
` ...but at the same time, you were unconsciously afraid that learning the truth would mean losing that miracle of your family coming back.`
` ...So, you didn't have what it took to stretch your hand out to the Single Truth."`
`"......`
`...You're completely right...`
` I have to admit...that I was naive..."`
`I must admit it.`
`...My entire family is dead.`
`Now that I've acknowledged it,`
` ...I must expose why they died, and who was behind it.`
`"...Thanks.`
` ...The Fragment you showed me in that dark theater...was there to open my eyes."`
`"Many, many games have gone by, waiting for you to become a true Witch of Truth.`
` ...But I think there was a purpose to it all.`
` ...After all, now, in this final game, you really have become a Witch of Truth."`
`"......Tell me.`
` ...What happened on that island that day?`
` ...I won't ask you to tell me directly.`
` So guide me.`
` What can I do to reach the truth...?!"`
`"It's a bit too chilly here.`
` ...Let's move."`
`"To where?"`
`"To a place better for drinking tea."`
`A massive applause filled the hall.`
`It was an applause in honor of a good fight.`
` An applause in honor of Bernkastel.`
`"Yes, Lady Bernkastel's game was another splendid one!"`
`"We're going to reveal her game board to everyone here, so have a go at it.`
` It's pretty awesome!"`
`"...But you solved it in the end all the same."`
`"A game that no one can solve isn't a game.`
` The main point is whether it was fun or not."`
`"It's fun!`
` I guarantee its quality."`
`"Same here.`
` At first, I thought there was no way anyone could solve it, but the way you can use one confirmed purple statement after another to narrow down the suspects made for a great puzzle."`
`"Come, everyone! Gather, gather!"`
`"Just what sort of game is Lady Bernkastel's mystery?!"`
`""That's for you to find out for yourselves!!""`
`Objects resembling chessboards were set out on several tables.`
`Crowds gathered around each, looking down with interest.`
`"Hohoh, it's like a logic puzzle."`
`"Quite an orthodox one, don't you think?"`
`"So this is what a witch's game is like."`
`"Hmm.`
` Looking at it like this, it's just a game.`
` ...But for the pieces, it's a massive series of crimes."`
`"Pu ku ku.`
` Indeed it is."`
`"It would not do to waste such a rare gift from Lady BERNKASTEL.`
` Let us take this opportunity to enjoy OURSELVES."`
`"Still, this is a tough one...`
` It almost makes you wonder if it was made to be solvable, doesn't it...?"`
`"If you don't start by believing that it's made to be solvable, you won't get anywhere.`
` ...A battle of wits doesn't begin until you trust the questioner and believe that it can be solved."`
`"And we guarantee that it is.`
` Come on, have a go at it...!"`
`With Battler's encouragement, discussions over Bernkastel's mystery game began at each table.`
`The mix of Humans and Illusions in heated debate was truly a sight to behold.`
`Beato and Bernkastel sat in a chair far off from the discussions.`
`"Would you like some tea?"`
`"Any kind of calming black tea for me.`
` With milk, if you don't mind."`
`"As you wish.`
` ...Is there anything you need, Lady Bernkastel?"`
`"...Please add some dried plums to some black tea.`
` ...That's the trick to making terrible tea drinkable."`
`"*cackle*!`
` Come now, don't sulk.`
` We're honestly complimenting your game for being such a fun one."`
`Beato, who had emerged victorious in the game Bernkastel had put all her heart into, was in extremely high spirits.`
`"...I'm not sulking.`
` My face just looks this way."`
`"When I managed to spot Bern's own kind of warmth in that expression,`
` I felt like I'd climbed to the pitch-black top of a snowy mountain to find a beautiful star."`
`"...Well, sorry for having an eternally frosty face."`
`"How difficult it is to compliment Lady Bernkastel.`
` No matter what you say, she always takes it in a bad way."`
`"That's okay.`
` She's the type who'll keep thinking about it for hours later on."`
`"Hohoh, the type who lies in bed relishing it while hugging her pillow."`
`"Yep, that's Bern for you."`
`Beato and Lambdadelta giggled together.`
`Bernkastel shrugged and looked away...`
`"Seriously though,`
` that really was a fun game with a twist."`
`"You think so?`
` ...Thank you."`
`"You could've made it unsolvable,`
` but you still made it to be solved.`
` ...You couldn't have done that unless you planned on playing fair and enjoying the game."`
`"...I like games where I win no matter what.`
` Games that I might lose are just a pain."`
`"Later, I'd like to switch sides and try another one.`
` I'll make a puzzle, and we'll see if you can solve it.`
` A game for you to win against me."`
`"............"`
`"Of course, I'll use all the know-how I've picked up in my fights with Beato to make it super-hard.`
` I'm not giving up my winning streak that easily...!"`
`"......Both you and Beato...`
`have such an interesting way of thinking."`
`"How's that?"`
`"...A game is just a means to decide who wins and who loses, right?`
` When you create one, your own victory should be your highest priority.`
` ...So, why would you go to all the trouble of making a game you might lose...?"`
`"What fun is there in a game you always win?`
` That's not even a game."`
`"............"`
`"Victory and defeat.`
` It's fun because you're taking part in a fair competition, balanced between those two outcomes.`
` A game isn't a fight.`
` It's communication.`
` You have to enjoy the means.`
` And if you manage to win in the end, well, that's just an added bonus."`
`"...Finally.`
` ...Finally, I clearly understand the difference between how all of you think and how I think."`
`"What do you mean?"`
`"For you, this is communication.`
` ...It isn't for me."`
`"The world you live in must be pretty savage."`
`"......And what about you?`
` ...Wasn't it the same for you, until you understood Beato's game?`
` ...An eternal game is eternal torture.`
` ...Have you already completely forgotten about that pain you suffered...?"`
`"......`
`...There were days I did think that.`
` ...But now, it's all been resolved.`
` I won't complain about stuff that's in the past.`
` I'm impartial, you might say."`
`"That...is the critical difference between you and me, I think.`
` ...Your eternal torture was something you could laugh off and forget.`
` ...Mine wasn't nearly so trivial.`
` ...That's all there is to it."`
`"...I don't know your history.`
` ...It sounds like you had it rough."`
`"Hmph.`
` ...To think I'm getting sympathy from a mere former piece. I must be getting old."`
`Bernkastel, sipping the black tea that Genji had brought her, gazed up at the ceiling with a faraway look.`
`Battler may not have known her history,`
` ...but even he was able to understand a bit of how she felt.`
`"...Are you `
`being tortured by someone right now?"`
`"Are you kidding?`
` ...I'm as free as can be.`
` I'm not bound by anyone's shackles."`
`"Then that's a good thing, isn't it?`
` At least things are better for you now."`
`"......True.`
` It's much better now than it once was.`
` ...Though I am on a long, endless journey to escape from boredom."`
`"Then at the very least, us meeting here should've been a good thing for you."`
`"Indeed.`
` ...Even the taste of defeat can keep my boredom at bay somewhat."`
`No, no.`
` Battler shook his head and laughed.`
`"...We're friends who've enjoyed fighting in a fair game."`
`"So......?"`
`"If your days are filled with nothing but running away from boredom,`
` ...feel free to drop by our place every now and then.`
` We'd love to welcome a friend.`
` And we'll be able to set up everything needed to help a friend escape from boredom."`
`"You think you can prepare a welcome interesting enough to help me, the great Bernkastel, escape boredom for even a single night...?"`
`"I do.`
` That's what it means to be a friend."`
`"............"`
`"We won tonight's game.`
` So, the next time you come, we'll switch sides.`
` This time, we'll entertain you with one of our games.`
` ...Of course, we don't intend to let you win easily.`
` We'll challenge you to a devilishly twisted logic game!`
` It won't be something you can solve in a night.`
` It'll be good enough to make you stay for months, racking your brains over it."`
`"...You would entertain me, the great Bernkastel, as a friend...?"`
`"Yeah, we would."`
`"...Hmph...`
` ...After talking with you,`
` even this dried plum tea is starting to taste sickly sweet.`
` What a pain."`
`"I heard from Beato.`
` Sounds like this dried plum tea stuff is one of your favorites.`
` Next time, we'll throw in some high-class dried plums covered in gold leaf, so make sure you come again."`
`"...If you really plan to do that, try finding some better tea to start with.`
` I'll never feel like coming again if you keep serving tea like this."`
`"Ah, come on.`
` I guess the tea you're used to drinking is pretty damn high-class.`
` Next time, why don't you invite us somewhere we can drink some of that?"`
`"......Me, ...invite you over?`
` ......*giggle* ...Ahahahahaha."`
`"It's only fair, right?`
` We've treated you.`
` Now it's your turn."`
`"Yes, it would be only fair."`
`"So, let's have the game be fair too.`
` Let's switch sides and start a new game.`
` I'm looking forward to it.`
` We won this time, but who knows about the next...?!"`
`"...That's some confidence you have there.`
` And yet, I'm afraid you're mistaken on one point."`
`"What's that?"`
`"My game isn't over yet.`
` ...I wonder who will win in the end."`
`After taking one more sip of her black tea, Bernkastel set her cup on the table, wearing a thin smile.`
`"...The tea here's far too sweet. It was a mistake to have any.`
` ...Thank you, Genji.`
` Take this away, please."`
`"As you wish..."`
`Bernkastel asked for her tea to be taken away after taking only two sips.`
`Battler smiled, realizing that this was just Bern's way of being shy.`
`......`
`Battler.`
` ...Why are you smiling with such a foolish, optimistic face...?`
`If you really think this final game will be nothing but a happy epilogue...`
`Then I'll have to invite you all to a proper game for bringing this tale to a close.`
`Battler.`
`You forget too easily.`
`Don't you remember in whose hands lie the key to this final game...?`
`The inside of my nose itched.`
`I've never regained consciousness to a smell before.`
`Slowly, I opened my eyes.`
`...Wait, when did I lose consciousness in the first place?`
`I don't remember going to sleep or falling unconscious.`
`That's right.`
` ...Bernkastel invited me to come to a place better for drinking tea...`
`...That's when my memory gets hazy.`
`And, since the smell of black tea is what woke me up...`
`"......Where am I...?"`
`"Auaurora's study.`
` ...I hate to admit it, but her taste in tea really is excellent."`
`I was sitting on what appeared to be a sofa in a dimly lit study.`
`Bernkastel sat across from me.`
` ...And, right before my eyes, was a beautiful cup filled with hot, steaming tea.`
`"...Isn't...this place..."`
`I remembered.`
`I've been here before.`
` ...Wasn't it...`
`"How pleasant it is to see you again, child of man."`
`...Yes, that voice.`
` Just hearing it brings back memories.`
`"Long time no see,`
` ...my master."`
`"I didn't think I would get the chance to welcome you into my study again.`
` ...To think that that game of yours is still continuing."`
`"...It won't be continuing much longer.`
` This is the end, the true final game."`
`This was the study of Featherine Augustus Aurora.`
`The majestic Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating.`
`...Once in the past, I was summoned by her and ordered to be her Reader, her miko.`
`"Don't tell me you want me to Read again..."`
`"I wasn't the one who called you here.`
` ...My miko brought the two of us together."`
`"Why...?"`
`"Isn't it obvious?`
` ...To show you the path that leads to the truth."`
`"You'll show me the way, Featherine?"`
`"...Well, I am the Witch of Theatergoing,`
` ...though I dislike interfering with the actors on the stage."`
`"So, would you rather watch Battler's boring play, `
`or my exciting one that manipulates the branching paths of fate?`
` ...I know you can't stand even a minute of boredom."`
`"Pft, ...heheheheheheheh."`
`As Featherine rocked her rocking chair, she looked up at the ceiling and chuckled.`
`She clearly holds some key to the truth I seek.`
`"...And yet, you are literally the one holding the key.`
` ...I can do nothing but tell you where to find the keyhole, child of man."`
`I don't remember saying anything out loud, but Featherine answered my question as though I had.`
`...Come to think of it, that's right.`
`Featherine can read the thoughts of a mere child of man like me as easily as she can hear me speak.`
`Well, I guess that'll help us get to the point quicker...`
`"Onii-chan did give me this key.`
` But then, he just said something about how I'd know how to use it when the time was right.`
` He didn't say a word about what it was used for.`
` ...Do you two know?`
` What is this key for? Onii-chan said it was something very precious."`
`"Explain, my miko."`
`"No way.`
` You explain."`
`"...You demand that your master explain?"`
`"You've got to go on stage every now and then.`
` Otherwise you'll just get senile all the faster."`
`"My, my...`
` And yet, I just enjoyed some long-overdue time on the stage when Ange was Reader, which should last me several centuries at least."`
`"Tell me.`
` ...What is this key?"`
`"A physical manifestation of the decision you are to make.`
` ...This tale, this game...`
`will end when you are asked to make a certain decision.`
` What you hold there is the act of your decision embodied in the form of a key."`
`"The physical manifestation...of my decision..."`
`"Exactly.`
` Battler was probably planning to end it by putting you in front of two doors, both of which can be opened by the key.`
` Then, he would ask you to choose which door to open.`
` He must have told you that much, right?"`
`"......He didn't tell me anything at all.`
` He just kept saying things like 'You'll know when the time comes'.`
` ...No one will tell me anything. Not Onii-chan, not anyone..."`
`"Battler probably wants to respect your right to make a decision of your own free will."`
`"But Ange,`
` ...you should've at least started to figure it out by now, right?"`
`"...Figure what out?"`
`"There's an answer Battler wants you to choose, isn't there...?"`
`Those words...made my heart jump in my chest.`
`...It was what I had been thinking.`
`Onii-chan is clearly trying to trick me with a vague tale, almost like a daydream,`
` that'll take me even farther away from the truth.`
`At the 1986 family conference...`
`Everyone had a wonderful time as they faded away.`
`Everyone is smiling down on you from heaven,`
` so you don't need to feel alone, even in 1998.`
` So give it your all and live on by yourself.`
`...I've clearly sensed Onii-chan's desire to end it like that.`
`Every time I ask him about it, he dodges the issue and says something about how the decision will be mine in the end.`
`"That's right.`
` It may appear as though Battler is giving you a fair choice,`
` ...but he's actually scheming to get you to choose a certain one of those two answers.`
` ...You've already seen the farce of a tale that he's using to do that, right?"`
`...That bizarre Halloween party.`
`With everyone acting so strange and friendly that it was almost sickening.`
`I've already seen more than enough of that tale, so sickly sweet it makes me want to vomit,`
` where Ushiromiya Kinzo showered me with affection, where his children swore to support each other, ...where everyone was filled with happiness and hope.`
`"...He's trying to trick me with those chummy scenes...so he can keep me away from the truth.`
` ...He's such a...coward..."`
`"True, it might be easy to call him a coward from your perspective.`
` But remember.`
` If you are a player in this game, and if Battler is the Game Master, ...what does that imply?"`
`"In the past, Battler was a player and Beato was the Game Master.`
` And they each fought for their own respective truths.`
` ...So, what's happening this time?"`
`"...I'm a player...and Onii-chan's the Game Master."`
`Could it be...that I've misunderstood everything from the very beginning?`
`Onii-chan said he'd tell me what happened on that day,`
` ...so I assumed that following him meant I'd learn everything.`
`...Isn't that the same as, say, Onii-chan accepting everything Beato said about the crimes being the work of a witch?`
`What...a stupid mistake I've been making...`
`"...So, this game...has always been a fight between me and Onii-chan...?"`
`"I'm surprised you joined in without realizing that."`
`"............"`
`"Battler really is sly.`
` He quickly started up the final game without letting you realize that simple fact.`
` ...Well, it was the same back in Beato's games.`
` Battler was drawn into her game before he knew what was happening.`
` Before he even knew how to fight.`
` ...That's why I taught him how."`
`"And now, it's exactly the same.`
` ...You were forced to start this game before you understood anything about it, and I've come to tell you the truth.`
` To tell you who you're fighting against, and for what."`
`"............"`
`I was...too shocked to speak.`
`And finally, ...I realized what I needed to accomplish in this game.`
`I've always been passive.`
`I was sure that Onii-chan would tell me everything, `
`so I naively thought I just had to believe whatever he said...`
`"I was wrong.`
` ...That's not what this is."`
`This is a battle...`
`...between me, the one who wants to reach the truth,`
` ...and Onii-chan, who wants to trick me and chase me out into a 1998 where I'm all alone...`
`All this time, ...I've kept on saying that Onii-chan was foolish and naive,`
` ...and now I see that I was more naive than anyone else...`
`And yet, Bernkastel didn't sneer at me.`
`On the contrary, ...she looked at me with that cold gaze, as if to say 'So you've finally taken your first step'.`
`"...Now do you understand your own purpose...`
`and the purpose of that key?"`
`I gripped the key Onii-chan had hung around my neck...`
`and for a while, I shook with an emotion that even I couldn't understand.`
`Now that I know Onii-chan tricked me, it would be easy to hate him.`
`But hating him would be missing the point.`
`After all, ...this is a game between me and him.`
`Onii-chan has done nothing but make the optimal moves for winning against me.`
`...If games aren't a playful way to communicate,`
` ...if they're the process that decides who wins and who loses...`
`Then there can be no fair games.`
`The best strategy is always to trick your enemy into defeat without telling them the rules, before they even know what's going on...`
`...In that sense, ...Onii-chan hasn't done anything wrong.`
`He's...using that sickly-sweet illusion to trick me...and force me out into a lonely future...`
`They'll be the only ones having a good time in the cat box, and I'll be the only one chased out.`
`"......Thank you.`
` ...I'm grateful.`
` I think I've finally been able to truly open my eyes."`
`"Please, don't hate Battler.`
` After all, one-sidedly tricking your opponent is what Game Masters do."`
`"...I know.`
` Onii-chan took the best option from his perspective.`
` That's all there is to it.`
` ......So, I need to make the best possible moves from my perspective."`
`My goal is now clear.`
`October 4th and 5th, 1986.`
`What happened on Rokkenjima on those days?`
`I need to tear off the veil covering the truth.`
` Nothing more, nothing less.`
`"......Onii-chan gave me this key, ...probably because he wants me to put it into the keyhole of his choosing.`
` ...That's why he keeps showing me this sentimental illusion.`
` But I won't be fooled anymore.`
` ...I'll open the door I want to open."`
`"Certainly, this kind of tale is more to my liking than one where Ange does whatever Battler says."`
`"Then this time, I'll let you run the show from here on out.`
` ...Tell Ange.`
` Tell her where the keyhole that leads to the truth is."`
`"Tell me.`
` Where is the keyhole?!"`
`"...Very well.`
` First off, have a seat.`
` I'll go and get it for you."`
`When Featherine rose from her rocking chair, ...my vision seemed to twist and bend.`
`...What is this? Some kind of interference?`
`Why now, when Featherine's about to show me something important...?`
` ...Why is my head getting...suddenly...`
`I dug my fingernails into my knees, clenching my teeth to keep from losing consciousness.`
`However, ...the world just kept twisting more and more...`
`Except for the feel of the sofa beneath me, I couldn't sense anything at all...`
`"Lady?"`
`"...Huh?"`
`"Looks like they've arrived."`
`The door opened...and Hachijo Tohya appeared.`
`...What's going on?`
`This isn't the world of witches, ...but the world of Humans...?`
`I was sitting on a sofa, ...and Amakusa was behind me.`
`.........`
`...There's no need to feel confused.`
`Featherine and Hachijo Tohya are the same being.`
`To her, the difference between the two worlds is a trivial thing.`
`To put it in the words of that theater-lover, ...it's like having a slightly different background behind the stage.`
`So, there was no reason for me to feel hesitant.`
`"...Should I call you Madam Hachijo this time?"`
`"How complicated names are.`
` ...Even though both of us are still here, just like before,`
` you have to wonder what to call me."`
`"...True.`
` Calling you Featherine would be a bit rude to you now.`
` ...For an actor, the name of the role they act is only temporary."`
`"Precisely, child of man."`
`"Featherine??"`
`Amakusa's eyes went wide as he wondered what I was suddenly talking about.`
`I ignored him and continued.`
`"...So, what are you going to show me?"`
`As I spoke, my eyes were caught by that heavy-looking object she held under her arm.`
`At a glance, it looked like an encyclopedia with a fancy binding...`
`"Do you know what this is?"`
`As Featherine spoke, she set the heavy object on the table.`
`The first thing it reminded me of...was a grimoire.`
`The heavy book had a mysterious, mystical feel to it, like something Maria onee-chan might carry around.`
`And the most remarkable feature of it...was the large, sturdy lock that held it shut.`
`Why would someone go so far to keep people from reading a book...?`
`"Why don't you take it and observe the back?"`
`"......The back...?"`
`I flipped the heavy book over on my lap.`
`And, as soon as I saw it, I gave a small gasp.`
`"......Eva...`
` ...Ushiro...Ushiromiya...`
` ...Ushiromiya Eva!"`
`Without a doubt, those words were written there in Roman characters.`
`"What is this...?`
` Aunt Eva's...diary...?"`
`"Could this be...that rumored..."`
`"Do you know something about this...?!"`
`"Just a rumor.`
` ...They say that President Eva had a secret diary, and that she always kept it locked up.`
` ...They say she took it with her everywhere she went. At least, that's what I heard from some of the other bodyguards."`
`"...A secret...diary...`
` Why is that here...?"`
`"It was in the hospital room where Ushiromiya Eva passed away."`
`This diary was hidden behind her bed.`
`So, it remained in that room for some time after her death before it was found.`
`Then, by coincidence, it was probably found by someone who worked for the hospital, or else a patient or their family.`
`...Of course, by that time, there was a huge movement dedicated to the Rokkenjima mystery.`
`A locked diary found in the hospital room where Ushiromiya Eva spent her last moments...`
`would be absolutely priceless.`
`The discoverer probably handed it over in secret to one of the 'Witch Hunters', who would be able to accurately determine its worth.`
`Luckily, the Witch Hunters who got their hands on this book were all noble and upright people.`
`Not content to boorishly destroy the lock and reveal the truth,`
` ...they simply satisfied themselves with the fact that the truth of that day slumbered just on the other side of this mysterious lock.`
`Thanks to that, ...Eva's diary has remained undamaged to this very day...`
`"It is already known that Natsuhi, wife of Krauss, the oldest son of Kinzo,`
` sealed up all of her complaints and repressed feelings by writing them down in a diary, which she treated like a sort of charm."`
`"...So, Aunt Eva did the same thing?"`
`"It's possible, at least.`
` ...Opening up a diary like this would be a pain, even if you did have a key.`
` It's sealed up tight like a corset."`
`Amakusa was right.`
`This wasn't a diary made to be casually opened and reminisced over.`
`...It's probably safe to assume that she used this diary to forget things by writing them down and sealing them away, just like Ushiromiya Natsuhi did.`
`Then, she brought it with her into her hospital room...and hid it behind the bed without telling anyone about it...`
`"...Don't tell me that diary is...`
` ...Are you saying Aunt Eva wrote down what happened that day...?"`
`"By reading its contents, you will probably learn everything.`
` ...However, we don't know where the key that unlocks it is."`
`I jumped.`
`Then, I looked down at my chest.`
`That's where my brother hung that key...`
`"Huh?`
` ...I-It's gone!`
` ...Th-The key's gone...!"`
`"...What's wrong, Lady?`
` What key?"`
`"It's been hanging from my neck the whole time, hasn't it?!"`
`"...I never noticed it.`
` You had a key hanging from your neck...?"`
`I understood almost immediately.`
`In the world of Humans, I haven't found the key.`
`The 'me' with the key...is on the game board in the world of witches.`
`"Make me the 'me' with the key!`
` I'm going to unlock this diary."`
`Featherine lifted a finger, spun it around, and the world twisted again.`
`When I returned to Featherine's study, the key popped back into existence, hanging from my neck.`
`But at the same time, ...the diary on my lap popped out of existence.`
`"Where'd the diary go?!"`
`"It should exist somewhere on the game board.`
` Since it is one of the keyholes you are to be given, it must exist."`
`"Did Onii-chan hide it somewhere...?"`
`"...Since Battler wants this to be a game between you and him,`
` it probably isn't hidden completely."`
`"What do you mean...?"`
`"Even if Battler thinks of the diary as a king he mustn't lose,`
` there would be no game unless it exists somewhere on this board."`
`"In other words, ...it's somewhere in the Ushiromiya mansion...?"`
`"Or, you may already have been given an opportunity to witness it.`
` ...Like how a swindler has already hidden a trap in microscopic letters on the first page of a contract you sign."`
`"...If Battler follows the customs of the mystery genre as the Game Master,`
` ......'clues must be shown', `
`so the choice that leads to Battler's defeat must have been shown.`
` ...Ange,`
` try and remember.`
` ...You should have seen Eva's diary in Battler's world already."`
`In that instant, ...from the back of my mind...`
`...drifted the very first scene of this final game.`
`In the chapel...`
`...A book was lying on the altar, a book with a lock on it...`
`As soon as I showed interest in that book, ...my brother suddenly grew stern and told me not to touch it...`
`"That...was Aunt Eva's diary..."`
`"That's right.`
` Ushiromiya Eva's diary.`
` The Book of the Single Truth, with the truth of that day written inside it."`
`"...The Book...of the Single Truth...`
` Is the truth really inside it?`
` After all, there's a chance that it's just something Aunt Eva-"`
`"I'll say it in red.`
` ...`
`#ff0000Ushiromiya Eva's diary, the Book of the Single Truth,`
` has the truth of Rokkenjima during October 4th and 5th, 1986, recorded within it.#ffffff"`
`The discussions over Bernkastel's reasoning game were getting passionate at each of the tables.`
`At some point, each table had started competing to see which could solve it first.`
`"Bernkastel,`
` haven't Ange and Erika arrived yet?"`
`"...They should've been here by now.`
` Wanna make a bet on who arrives first?"`
`"I can understand Erika being late, but what about Ange?`
` ...Just what kind of pit did you toss her into this time?"`
`"How rude.`
` She's sitting on a sofa sipping tea."`
`"Hopefully the sort of tea you drink suits Ange's tastes."`
`"Hahaha, good point."`
`"How rude.`
` That tea would suit anyone's tastes.`
` ...Erika would even lick the last drop of my tea from the bottom of a miso pot."`
`"...Now part of me's dying to ask how miso comes into this picture..."`
`"Still, ...it's Erika...!`
` This will be a long awaited reunion."`
`"That's right, come to think of it.`
` Can't wait to see how long it'll take her to solve Bernkastel's game."`
`"...This sort of game is what that kid's best at.`
` She'll probably read it from start to finish three times, then just say the answer right away."`
`"Probably.`
` I look forward to seeing her give the correct answer immediately with that smug look on her face."`
`"Come now, this is Erika we're talking about.`
` She'll probably pull out some twisted logic and say that it was possible for someone other than Battler's family."`
`"Good point.`
` In fact, I'd like to hear her proud, twisted logic even more than the right answer."`
`Apparently, Battler and Beato were looking forward to their reunion with Erika.`
`...They had already dueled with Erika in two separate games.`
`But now, there was no distinction between foes and allies.`
`They truly wanted to welcome her to this 'party after the show' as a friend...`
`"Still, it's a bit unexpected."`
`"...What is?"`
`"You know.`
` It's surprising that you'd let Ange go this easily."`
`Making sure that Battler and the others couldn't see her face, Lambdadelta sniggered.`
`"Is it really so surprising...?"`
`"Of course it is.`
` I thought that, being you, you'd torture Battler with one tough puzzle after another before releasing her,`
` ...or that you'd at least try to give Ange some weird ideas and have her turn the game around in the end."`
`"............"`
`"And I thought I knew you better than anyone else in the world.`
` So embarrassing that I was wrong."`
`"...I'm sure it is.`
` But don't worry.`
` ...You obviously do know me better than anyone else in the world."`
`"...Y-Yeah, of course!`
` After all, I love, adore, and understand you more than any other person in the universe☆"`
`Lambdadelta was flustered by Bernkastel's apparently friendly words, which were very rare, coming from her.`
`"...Battler-sama,`
` pardon me for interrupting your conversation.`
` Ange-sama has returned."`
`"Oh, she's back?!`
` Great.`
` So, umm, is she okay...?"`
`"It seems that she was soaked by the rain, but Kumasawa is bringing her a towel now."`
`When Battler heard this, he breathed a sigh of relief.`
`Then, he turned to face Bernkastel, showing her a forced smile as though apologizing for still suspecting her just a little.`
`Bernkastel showed no reaction and simply continued to wear a blank expression with a slight smile.`
`"Ange-sama has returned."`
`"...I'm back."`
`"Battler!`
` Ange's back...!"`
`"Ange...!`
` I'm glad you're okay. I was worried."`
`"............"`
`She stared at Battler as he dashed towards her with a relieved smile.`
`Ange's expression seemed somehow indifferent.`
`"...That Battler.`
` Looks like he thought I had you hanging by chains in a cave or something."`
`"N-No, no.`
` I didn't think you'd go that far."`
`"...I was just having some tea at the house of one of Bernkastel's friends.`
` It was delicious."`
`"Did it have dried plums or miso in it...?!"`
`"......`
`...Of course not."`
`As Ange spoke bluntly, she walked right past her brother and exchanged a few whispered words with Bernkastel.`
`"What is it, Battler?"`
`"Huh? Oh, nothing...`
` Nothing at all."`
`If he said he was lonely because his little sister was being so cold, Beato would either laugh at him or scratch him.`
`After all, Ange was a girl at that age.`
`She might be in a bad mood for reasons a boy like him couldn't understand.`
`...Taking note of this, and having satisfied himself that Ange was okay, he made to walk away.`
`"Battler,`
` ...Ange is calling for you."`
`"Huh?`
` Oh, sorry."`
`"I've been trying to get your attention for a while.`
` Don't ignore me."`
`"...I wasn't really ignoring you.`
` ...What's going on with you, anyway?`
` You've looked like you were in a bad mood for a while now."`
`"I imagine Bernkastel gave her something strange to drink and pretended it was just some rare sort of black tea.`
` Hyahhyahhya!"`
`"...I have no business with you.`
` Back off for a bit, would you?`
` I want to talk to Onii-chan alone."`
`"Come, come, I may not look it, but I am the wife of the territory lord...!`
` I'm already far closer to Battler than-"`
`"...Sorry, Beato.`
` Would you mind leaving for just a bit?"`
`By now, Battler realized that Ange's issue was more than just a slight bad mood.`
`Beato puffed out her cheeks as though she wanted to say something more.`
` However, she just let it out with a sigh and walked away...`
`"............"`
`"...Is this okay?"`
`"It is.`
` After all, this game is between me and you, right?`
` I'm the player.`
` You're the Game Master.`
` ...No matter how many pieces get between us, in the end, it's still a direct battle between you and me."`
`"...Well, it's true that I'm the Game Master, but it's not like I'm fighting against you or anything.`
` This final game was held so you could be invited to the Rokkenjima of 1986."`
`"Games are played to decide who wins and who loses.`
` There can be no game unless you have foes and allies.`
` ...Don't try to trick me."`
`"What...are you talking about, all of a sudden...?"`
`"You had me totally fooled.`
` At first, I actually thought you'd take me to that day in 1986.`
` ...But that wasn't true!"`
`"This has all been a farce you created, hasn't it?!`
` You're using this sentimental tale to dodge the issue and leave me confused!`
` You're trying to chase me out into a lonely future with nothing but this cheap happiness as a parting gift!`
` There's just one thing I've been after since the beginning!`
` What happened on Rokkenjima that day?!"`
`"And the only answer you gave me was this game!`
` This sentimental party of illusions!!`
` It's obvious how you're going to try and answer my question now!`
` I want the truth!!`
` And you aren't going to give it to me!"`
`"Ange, ...listen, you've got it wrong-"`
`"Don't try and trick me!!`
` This game is the final fight between me and you!`
` I want the truth of that day!`
` And you're trying to hide it behind an illusion!!`
` It's exactly the same!`
` The setup is no different than those fights between you and Beato!`
` I was about to be chased out of the game board with everything still vague and fuzzy because of you!`
` Well, sorry, but I've already figured out that this game is a battle.`
` Don't think you'll trick me so easily anymore!"`
`Ange's shout tore apart the peaceful atmosphere.`
`The family members and Illusions gulped and watched the scene, wondering what was going on...`
`Beato tried to run up to Battler, but he motioned for her to stay back.`
`"...What is it you want?"`
`"There's only one thing I've ever wanted!`
` The truth of Rokkenjima in 1986.`
` That's all I'm looking for!!"`
`"The truth is sealed within the cat box.`
` ...It can't be reached by someone outside the cat box like you."`
`"Is that why you're trying to trick me with this sentimental illusion?!"`
`"Yes, this is an illusion.`
` However, I wanted you to remember this fun atmosphere, the harmony within your family.`
` ......It's not about what happened on that island that day.`
` I wanted you to remember the warmth of these family conferences, a warmth you forgot."`
`"That's just an illusion you're trying to impose on me!`
` I'll reject it and deny it completely!!"`
`"There is no 'truth of 1986'.`
` The cat box is empty inside.`
` ...You're looking for something that doesn't exist."`
`"...Hmph.`
` I won't be tricked anymore.`
` ...The truth of that day does exist.`
` ...It was written down by the sole survivor and preserved to this very day!"`
`Battler's expression faltered for just an instant, and Ange didn't miss it.`
`So he was hiding it after all.`
`Onii-chan...has been hiding the Book of the Single Truth from me...!!`
`"Aunt Eva...!`
` For the first time since your death, I'd like to express my gratitude.`
` ...Because you wrote down what happened that day, you gave me one last chance at learning the truth...!"`
`"...A-Ange-chan, you have to listen to me...!`
` Everything I wrote in that diary is nonsense, and it doesn't mean..."`
`"There's no point trying to deceive me.`
` It's already been proven in red `
`that your diary has the truth of that day in it!"`
`"...A-Absurd.`
` How could anyone but Battler, the Game Master, use the red truth...?!"`
`"......`
`...It's Auaurora, isn't it?"`
`"That's right.`
` ...The Book of the Single Truth exists in 1998, the world of the future.`
` Who else could perform the crucial role of confirming its contents with the red truth...?"`
`"I heard everything from Bernkastel!!`
` I've been fooled by you long enough!!`
` I don't want some sentimental illusion.`
` I want the real truth!!"`
`"And no matter how hard you try to cover it up in 1986, I can expose it in 1998!!`
` After all,`
` you are the Beatrice of 1986, Onii-chan, ...and I am the Beatrice of 1998!!"`
`A cyclone rose up around Ange.`
`It was a golden swirl of gold butterflies.`
`Just like the Golden Witch, Beatrice...`
`"I am ANGE Beatrice of 1998, the final Golden Witch!!`
` No witch of the past can defeat a witch of the future!!"`
`The cyclone of gold broke apart, and as gold leaves scattered across the room, ...the final witch, who would inherit Beatrice's name in the future, appeared.`
`"ANGE...Beatrice......"`
`"You're the Golden and Endless Witch.`
` But I'm different!`
` I'm the Golden Witch of Truth!`
` No illusion can stand in my way!!`
` Yes, this is the end of Onii-chan's boring party!`
` Now it's time for my party to start!!`
` I've even readied a game to liven things up!`
` You're up, Aunt Eva."`
`"Huh...?!"`
`When Ange snapped her fingers, she vanished along with a swirl of gold butterflies.`
`Replacing her in the middle of that cyclone...was a girl wearing a dress, bowing modestly...`
`"You...!"`
`"...That's pretty rude, you know?`
` ...Inviting everyone to the party except me."`
`"You're......EVA...!!"`
`"The sole survivor of Rokkenjima.`
` And the witch of the future, the Golden and Endless Witch from 1986 to 1998!!`
` In the world of the future, Battler-kun's sentimental illusion is more fragile than a flake of snow on a lake!`
` Okay, let's have some fun!!`
` Come, try to remember, 'all of you'. Remember 'your' endless theory-making!!"`
`When EVA held her hand to the heavens, light gathered there and took the form of a bottle.`
`Yes, a bottle.`
`A glass bottle with no label.`
`There was no alcohol inside.`
` ...Sealed within it was a Fragment that let off a pale, sinister light.`
`"B-Battler!! This is bad!!`
` She must not smash that bottle!!"`
`"Okay, it's show time!!!"`
`The bottle was slammed against the floor and smashed to pieces.`
`As soon as the Fragment within it touched the outside air, it flashed white and burst.`
`...At first, it seemed that nothing had happened.`
` However, EVA grinned at them before becoming a cloud of butterflies and vanishing.`
`At some point, Bernkastel must have vanished as well.`
`"What did she do...?!"`
`"...It was probably a Fragment she brought back with her from the world of the future.`
` ...Perhaps we could call it the contents of the cat box in the future."`
`"What does all this mean?!`
` What?!"`
`At that moment, they heard a thundering roar.`
`It was as though large chunks of hail had started falling everywhere.`
`An earthquake accompanied that noise, and the whole mansion creaked.`
` Dust began to fall from the ceiling.`
`At the same time, it seemed as though the curtain-covered window glowed with a pale light.`
`"Wh-What on earth is going on...?"`
`"Kyrie, look outside!`
` What the hell is that?!"`
`Everyone rushed to the window in response to her voice.`
` Of course, Battler and Beato went too.`
`Then, they drew the curtains, looked at the scene outside, ...and were stunned into silence.`
`"......How...beautiful..."`
`Kinzo's words echoed the first impression felt by all who looked out at the scene beyond the windows.`
`"...Not all beauty is benign."`
`"They always say that beauty has thorns nyeh."`
`Though everyone found the scene beautiful, ...they all sensed impending misfortune from it.`
`Outside the window, ...countless small objects--pale, glowing Fragments of crystals--lay strewn about everywhere like fallen hail.`
`The word 'fantastical' perfectly summed up the scene that lay before them in the glowing rose garden...`
`"...I saw something move over there...!"`
`"H-Hey, is there someone over there?!`
` Wait, huh...?!"`
`"...A-A person...just grew out of that glowing Fragment...!"`
`"Seven Sisters of Purgatory, battle formation!!"`
`With those words of Lucifer's, everyone finally realized that they were being surrounded by 'danger'...`
`One by one, the countless Fragments shook and burst, ...and large, dark bodies rose up from inside each.`
`They were...giants with goat heads.`
`One after another, they appeared from the insides of broken Fragments.`
`Those Fragments lay all over the rose garden in vast numbers and made the ground glow, ...so that everyone inside was forced to shudder.`
`"45! Wide-area surveillance!"`
`"...M-My radar's filled with white!`
` We're either being jammed, o-or the vast number of readings is making a count of enemy numbers impossible!!"`
`Even as she said this, the glowing rose garden outside the window was being filled with giant goats.`
`The Fragments carrying the goats weren't just in the rose garden.`
` ...They were spread evenly across the entire island.`
`...Not just the rose garden, ...but the entire area around the mansion was being covered with goats by now...`
`"...Allow us to speak."`
`"Know that we are completely surrounded."`
`"Yeah, we noticed..."`
`"Kihihihihihihihihi.`
` What'll you do now, Battler...?"`
`"Only one thing to do with uninvited guests.`
` Let's chase them off.`
` ...Who are these people? I'm guessing these aren't your minions, right, Beato?"`
`"...The goat forms they hold are probably just imitations of the pieces on this game board."`
`"They aren't Riiche's or Lia's minions.`
` ...This is something worse."`
`"...I SEE.`
` ...So, they are manifestations of message BOTTLES."`
`"Message bottles?`
` The ones Beato made?"`
`"Not quite.`
` ...These are Fragments of what people in the future have imagined."`
`"...Endless possibilities are hidden within the cat box.`
` ...Because of that, those outside the box can imagine the insides to be any one of an infinite number of things.`
` ...It would seem those endless delusions are the true form of these creatures."`
`"Wh-What will those goats do to us, I wonder..."`
`"It doesn't look like they're here to give us a handshake and a pat on the back."`
`"...Those people...`
` ...Those lowlifes, making up and passing around stories, imagining the tragedies that might have unfolded around us on this island...`
` ...They found it so fascinating that I never talked about the truth...that they kept on creating tragedies one after another for their own enjoyment..."`
`"I see.`
` ......So, they're Fragments from the future, imagining the cat box of 1986 however they please..."`
`"In the world of the future, any and all interpretations can and do EXIST.`
` Unless we deny them, everyone will be able to claim that their own view is the truth, and they will remain on this ISLAND."`
`"Ahhahahahahahaha!`
` What a fix we're in!"`
`"Looks like we're surrounded and fighting for our lives!"`
`"Hmm, what are they doing...?"`
`"Th-They're eating... They're eating something...!"`
`"...They're eating...the roses...?!"`
`The crowd of goats was squirming about and doing something.`
`If you looked closely, you could see them sticking their heads into rose bushes and munching away.`
`And it wasn't just rose bushes.`
`Light poles, the bricks of the flower beds, ...and even the stone paving itself.`
` They were biting all of it.`
`Almost as if they were trying to eat up the whole island.`
`"No.`
` ...They aren't just eating..."`
`"If they aren't eating, what are they doing...?!"`
`"...That is not eating.`
` They are eroding it, shaving away at the edges.`
` ...The edges of the game board itself."`
`"They're...eating the game board...?!"`
`"In the world of the future, everyone believes we were swallowed up by tragedy today.`
` ...That's why 'they' won't accept a truth where we enjoy ourselves in peace...!"`
`"...Truths of the past are subordinate to truths of the future.`
` ...The merciless future fangs and jaws of those goats...refuse to accept our truth and are eroding it, replacing it with 'the kind of truth they expect'."`
`"...D-Dammit...`
` ...This is our truth...!`
` It's not for those people in the future, who have nothing to do with us anyway, to rewrite as they please...!"`
`The garden outside the window was now filled with too many goats to count, all chewing away.`
`This repulsive scene stole the words from everyone's lips...`
`...They weren't stunned into silence.`
`There was just no point in making a fuss and letting the goats know a certain fact.`
`No point in letting them know...that there was plenty of prey waiting in this bright, warm room, ...prey that was softer and easier to chew than roses or bricks...`
`"Th-That goat there, he's looking at us...!"`
`"...Silence. Don't make a fuss."`
`"...I-It's coming this way...`
` ...Dear me, this does not look good..."`
`They saw one of the newly-born goats head slowly towards their window.`
`There was already a huge swarm of them in the garden, so it was no surprise that, when one of them looked around for new prey, it would see the light from this window.`
`Its immense, eerie body slowly approached.`
`As it grew closer, they could finally see it clearly.`
`The eyes blazed, despite being cold, ruthless, and reptilian.`
`Those cruel fangs and jaws could tear apart and crush anything.`
`Any fangs that could chew through brick would hardly have a problem chewing through Humans...`
`Its massive body had to be taller than the windows themselves...`
`And...it was lumbering towards this window...`
`"If only this window was made out of special Ushiromiya bulletproof glass..."`
`"...I doubt even bulletproof glass would stop that thing."`
`"W-Waah...!!`
` It's coming, it's coming! It's running towards us!!!"`
`"...Allow me to speak.`
` Know that this window shall not be breached."`
`The power of Cornelia's seal formed a shield around the glass.`
`The goat was blown back, unable even to touch the glass because of this power.`
`Its weight made the earth tremble.`
` They could feel that clearly, even inside.`
`...But that tremor had also drawn the attention of the nearby goats.`
`A pack of goats started shuffling towards them, and a fight broke out as they each charged forward, trying to reach this new prey first.`
`The window protected by Cornelia's seal would probably be safe.`
`However, there were many windows in the great hall.`
`For the first time, those windows became a source of terror instead of sunlight and a lovely view.`
`"Gertrude!"`
`"...Allow me to speak. Know that this window shall not be breached."`
`Getrude sealed another window.`
`The goats trying to break in through that one were thrown back.`
`But at the same time, they heard the crash of yet another window being smashed.`
`Scattering fragments of glass everywhere, the massive goats broke through the window frame and entered the building.`
`"W-Waaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"St-Stay back. Everyone stay back!"`
`『...On the first twilight, ...the six...chosen by the key......〝`
`Those words really were coming from the goat's mouth.`
`Along with a steaming, foul breath.`
`However, it didn't get a chance to say any more.`
`Forehead, neck, shoulder.`
` Chest, side, gut, knee.`
` The stakes of the Seven Sisters buried themselves in deep, one after another.`
`"What rough, unappetizing flesh for piercing!"`
`"I'd hate to have to gobble up any more of these...!"`
`The other windows shattered one after another, and several goats squeezed their way in through the window frames.`
`Their mouths were still stuffed with the bricks they had just been snacking on.`
`Each time they chewed, it made a ghastly sound, like bones being crushed...`
`"...We will repel THEM."`
`"Chiester troops, prepare for close-range combat!"`
`"Stop.`
` ...You start firing away, and we'll have all the other goats coming to join the party."`
`"...Let's fall back to the second floor.`
` If we can seal the staircase, that'll buy us some time."`
`"Everyone, upstairs.`
` ...Hurry!"`
`After sniffing noisily as though scanning the smells around them,`
` the goats started chewing on whatever chairs, tables, or curtains were close by.`
`The goats would chew anything to bits, as long as it was near them.`
`If the others were careful not to attract the goats' attention, they would be able to escape from this place...`
`The Humans ran on ahead up to the second floor, while the Illusions, who were used to fighting, guarded the rear.`
`The goats were completely absorbed by their feast on everything in the hall.`
`...By now, they were even brutally chewing away at the portrait of Beatrice, which could fairly be called the symbol of the Ushiromiya family itself...`
`"Battler, the Humans have all taken refuge on the second floor...!"`
`"Good.`
` Dlanor, seal all the staircases."`
`"Gertrude and Cornelia will handle IT.`
` However, they need more TIME."`
`All over the mansion, there were loud beating sounds that might be called knocks and the sound of shattering glass.`
`"...Well now, ladies and gentlemen.`
` It's time for work."`
`"Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here!`
` Let's go, you lowlifes!`
` Tonight, it's all-you-can-eat!!"`
`"Chiester Troops, halt all external tasks.`
` Cancel automatic updates, accept no data, take no prisoners!"`
`"Eiserne Jungfrau of the Seventh District.`
` By the territory lord's order, carry out your DUTY."`
`"...I'll lend a hand.`
` Lion, you're in the way.`
` Go up to the second floor."`
`"But Will...!"`
`"Leave this to us and go.`
` ...You have your own job to do. Protect your family."`
`"...I-I understand.`
` ...Everyone, stay safe..."`
`The mansion was filled with the sounds of knocking, crushing, smashing, and chewing.`
`The goats and their wave of destruction was drawing steadily closer...`
`"...Lord BATTLER,`
` Gertrude and Cornelia have finished sealing the other STAIRCASES.`
` The large staircase here is the only one that REMAINS."`
`"The other staircases are tiny, so they went fast.`
` On the other hand, this staircase is huuuge.`
` Looks like you'll have your hands full buying time."`
`Lambdadelta spoke as though it was someone else's problem.`
`It only took a glance at her face to see that she had no intention of lending a hand.`
`Even so, Beato didn't scold her.`
`...This was a game between Battler and Ange.`
` Lambdadelta was only a theatergoer who had been invited.`
`"...Don't think badly of me.`
` ...Even I'd die if I was torn apart by nothingness.`
` Sorry, but I think I'll stick to being an observer."`
`"That's what you've always been.`
` ...Though it is a shame that we can't ask for your help."`
`"...Nah, she's being nice.`
` Doesn't want to steal our show."`
`"Heheh.`
` Sure, let's call it that."`
`As a Voyager Witch, Lambdadelta could retreat from this game board of Battler's if she wanted to.`
`In other words, she was the only one who wasn't in trouble now.`
`"See you later.`
` ...I think I'll watch this game between you and Bern 'til the end.`
` ...I'll be rooting for you."`
`"As you munch on popcorn?"`
`"Of course.`
` I think I'll have some soy-sauce butter flavor today."`
`Lambdadelta vanished with a pop.`
`As soon as she did, a black hole opened up in midair, and Gaap fell out of it.`
`"Battler, Riiche.`
` Could you come here for a second?`
` You should probably see this."`
`"...Right now?"`
`"Yes."`
`"Let's go.`
` ...Everyone, we're counting on you to hold this position...!"`
`When Gaap snapped her fingers, a large hole opened up under Battler and Beato, swallowing them both.`
`They were spat out...into an inky blackness.`
`Both of them were floating in the night sky.`
`Rokkenjima lay far beneath them.`
`And, as soon as they realized this, ...they shuddered.`
`"...Th-This is...!!"`
`"It's not just a crowd.`
` ...It's a sea."`
`It was no longer a crowd of goats, but an entire sea of them.`
`Just as Rokkenjima poked out from the ocean...`
`The mansion was now poking out from a sea of goats.`
`"...People in the future really are amazing.`
` ...Just how many of them have imagined the tragedy on this island?"`
`"It's nothing more than the worthless drivel of those outside the cat box...!`
` Let's clean this place up...!!"`
`"Look over there.`
` ...It's hard to tell, but look at the shoreline."`
`"...The shoreline...?"`
`"It's easy to make out the harbor.`
` Look closely.`
` ...See it...?"`
`"D-Don't tell me...!"`
`"...Yeah, ...you're probably right.`
` ...They're eating it.`
` ...Eating the whole island..."`
`"Come, try and remember, Fragments from the future!!`
` If only you'd just chew up all the embellishment, all the illusions, all the fantasy!"`
`As EVA yelled this to the heavens, hovering about the raging sea, ...hail fell down with a pale glow.`
`Each was an unlabelled bottle with a Fragment inside.`
`They poured onto the island, were smashed to bits, and the Fragments inside them scattered everywhere.`
`Every now and then, the Fragments would split in two, then split in two again,`
` and every single one of them burst and gave birth to a massive goat.`
`To say it was like bamboo shoots springing up after the rain would be a vast understatement.`
`The goats writhed about like bubbling, boiling water in a pot.`
`They ate away at everything they saw.`
`They didn't just eat the harbor, but the trees and rocks, the entire coastline itself.`
` Hundreds, thousands, ...no, tens of thousands of goats continued to eat...`
`They were chewing away at every bit of Rokkenjima, ...of this final game that Battler had prepared...`
`"Ahhahahhahahahahaha!!`
` Too bad, Battler-kun!`
` The future wants a tragedy on this island...!`
` Even Ange wants the truth!`
` Don't worry, we'll chew up all the embellishment, illusions, and fantasy for you!!"`
`By now, Battler and the others had to admit it.`
`The future wanted a tragedy.`
`Even if the truth of this island had been a gentle, peaceful thing...`
`The future didn't want that.`
`The truth they wanted...was painting over the past.`
`"...The past is such a fragile thing.`
` Even the cat box is being chewed apart."`
`"Just who are these people...?`
` ...Are they really so determined to plunge us into a tragedy...?"`
`"That's all I wanted to show you.`
` ...Hope this helps a bit when you're making strategic decisions."`
`"Yeah, thanks.`
` Now I feel like crap."`
`"Then let's go to the study next, if you don't mind.`
` Goldsmith wants to talk to you."`
`Gaap snapped her fingers, and another black hole swallowed them up and spat them out in the study.`
`"Owowowowow...`
` Gaap, if you're gonna drop me, at least do it on a bed."`
`"...Grandfather, we're in trouble! There's absolutely nowhere left to go...!"`
`"I know.`
` And even waiting out the storm from here is not an option."`
`"Ronove and the others should be able to buy us some time, but that's all."`
`If they just holed up in the mansion, it would only be a matter of time before the swarm of goats got them.`
`Trying to repel a few of the goats barging into the mansion...would be like using a cup to bail water from a boat with a hole in it.`
`"We can fight defensively for a while, but it's only a matter of time..."`
`"We need to think of something while we fight.`
` ...Can we escape?!`
` Where to?!`
` Is there any way for us to leave the game board?!"`
`"The outside of the game board is beyond the range of our territory.`
` Only a Voyager Witch could leave."`
`Only Bernkastel and Lambdadelta could do it.`
`However, there was no way Bernkastel would help.`
`Even Lambdadelta had already announced that she would be an observer instead of lending a hand.`
`"So, there's nowhere left to run."`
`"No, there is just one place."`
`"Where?!"`
`"The Golden Land."`
`"I see...`
` Is that our only option now...?!"`
`"Indeed.`
` The Golden Land is the most impenetrable place on this game board.`
` If we wish to escape, it's that or nothing."`
`"These things are eating the cat box itself.`
` For all we know, they might start chewing away at the Golden Land itself at any moment."`
`"...Nng, ...what should we do, Battler...?!"`
`"No point thinking about it.`
` We're retreating.`
` ...If we take too long to make a decision, even that road will be closed to us.`
` Evacuate everyone. How can we open the door to the Golden Land?!"`
`"I just have to open it.`
` ...However, an immense wave of the anti-magic toxin is emanating from that crowd of goats.`
` It will take some time to open the door."`
`"So, we've only got to protect this study with our lives until the door's open.`
` Just have to keep doing what we've been doing."`
`"There's one more problem.`
` ...The door to the Golden Land cannot be shut unless two people close it from the outside."`
`"Two from the outside...?`
` What do you mean...?"`
`As soon as he said this, Battler realized.`
`This must be the result of some agreement made between the three witches who are one...`
`"Normally, there's no need to go to the trouble of shutting the door...`
` But it won't be so easy this time."`
`"...Only you and Beato can fulfill the role of shutting the door."`
`"Me, as the territory lord, and Beato.`
` Yeah, it sounds like the safest choice."`
`"Indeed.`
` If it's just the two of us, we might even be able to protect ourselves."`
`"Okay, open the door...!"`
`Beato waved her pipe, leaving a golden trail behind as she sliced the air vertically.`
`Then, the gap of the door to the Golden Land appeared.`
` It looked like nothing more than a thin golden string hanging from the ceiling.`
`If you looked closely, you could see that the string was getting thicker very slowly.`
`The door to the Golden Land certainly was opening, but so slowly that you couldn't even tell if you weren't careful.`
`At this rate, it would probably take quite some time before it grew big enough to let a person through...`
`"Grandfather, Gaap, we'll need you to be our inner line of defense!"`
`"Yes, there may be goats climbing up the outer walls...!"`
`"Very well.`
` My rifle hungers for some prey!"`
`"Understood.`
` It'll be fun dropping those things into the Abyss."`
`A giant was sliced at an angle, split into two parts, ...and fell to the floor, showering it with filthy dark blood and guts.`
`"Splendidly DONE."`
`"...I'll let you take the next one."`
`Countless massive goats, which had forced their way in from rooms and windows all across the mansion, wandered about in search of something to chew.`
`Several of the goats noticed the group of people huddled around the staircase and lumbered closer,`
` but they were pulverized by merciless attacks.`
`Ronove's shields easily halted the charging goats, and Virgilia's magic spears were pinning the giants against the walls.`
`Dlanor's and Will's blades were also slicing easily through goats.`
`The pinpoint strikes of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory could pierce the vitals of and finish off any opponent, no matter how large.`
`The Chiester Sisters were holding their own too.`
`They had blasted enough goats to bits with one shot from their high-caliber firearms that you couldn't count the kills with both hands.`
`Given a limited number of opponents, they were more than a match for these goats.`
`However, they weren't just up against a crowd, but an entire ocean.`
`It was like a pebble trying to face the approaching waves of a stormy sea...`
`"Hurry on that gun barrel replacement! Requesting cover from the Purgatory troops!"`
`"So, you run out of ammo, and you're nothing but rabbits.`
` Laaame!"`
`"I don't wanna hear that from a bunch of seven paperweights who can only kill one person at a time nyeh."`
`"Yeah, keep them coming!!`
` Don't let us get bored!!"`
`The hall was filled with massive goat corpses.`
`As if in fear of this sight, the goats that came in one after another formed a wall, keeping their distance.`
`"...Perhaps they think they're no match for us."`
`"I wish that were TRUE,`
` ...but it seems to be little more than wishful THINKING."`
`"What're those guys doing...?`
` They're looking at us...and whispering to each other."`
`"Apparently, they have the intelligence to talk together and cooperate."`
`The goats surrounded them at a distance, whispering.`
`Then, they nodded at each other as though deciding something, and the whole group stirred.`
`...What are they doing?`
` It almost looks like they're lining up in a different order...`
`"The enemy is changing its formation...!`
` It appears that the individuals with greater destructive power are being gathered in the front lines!"`
`"So what? Let's go!!"`
`""""""Yes, Onee-sama!!""""""`
`"Wait! Something's wrong...!"`
`Lucifer took aim at one of them, going for its forehead.`
`The other six sisters followed her lead, trying to pierce the vital organs all over the creature's body.`
`However, there was no sound of pierced flesh.`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory were knocked back, unable to cause even the smallest wound.`
`"Wh-What?!`
` What just happened?!"`
`"...Those guys are talking about something."`
`The goats kept whispering the same thing, over and over, as they slowly approached the Seven Sisters.`
`All of them whispered unanimously.`
`『...All fantasy...is fictional...〝`
`『...The Seven Sisters of Purgatory...are illusions...personifying stakes for ceremonial sacrifices...〝`
`『...They're actually paperweights... ...They're actually paperweights...〝`
`As they whispered curses that denied the Seven Sisters' existence, the goats lumbered closer.`
`"Get back, Purgatory troops!!`
` We'll cover you!"`
`"It's time you learned a lesson, goats!!"`
`The golden bows of the Chiester troops mowed down the wall of goats with shower of bright golden bullets.`
`Some of the goats were torn to pieces, but some of them seemed completely unaffected.`
`Then, the goats who were uninjured all whispered as one.`
`『...The Chiester Sisters Imperial Guards...have Maria's rabbit dolls as their vessels...〝`
`『...They're actually rabbit dolls...`
` Maria's imagination, fantasy, fictional beings...〝`
`『...All of the crimes can be explained by mystery...`
` All fantasy is irrelevant...〝`
`"Looks like-"`
`"We've got lots of people who won't accept the existence of magic!"`
`"And that means?!"`
`"No magical attacks will have any effect on them!"`
`"D-Does that mean all of our attacks will be completely useless?!"`
`"...Endless Nine nyeh.`
` ...If they don't accept that we exist, our attacks can't hurt them nyeh."`
`"Is that possible...?!"`
`"We'll have to test it."`
`Ronove stepped forward, stamped on the floor twice, and a red barrier rose up in front of him.`
`The crowd of goats dashed into it with a terrifying force.`
`While some goats were blown away by it, several of them slipped right through the magical barrier.`
`『...Ronove is a creature of magic, a creature of fiction...〝`
`『...Genji is Ronove's vessel...`
` He's an imaginary version of Genji...〝`
`"I see, ...so even my attacks will not affect some of them."`
`There was no longer any point in Virgilia trying out her magic spear.`
`Now that some of the goats had decided that her existence was fictional, she could no longer hurt them.`
`...Even these great demons and great witches, ...as well as high-level furniture and weapons, `
`...were overcome with fear of the crowd that surrounded them, a crowd that would not be affected by any of their attacks...`
`"...Wh-What are we going to do...?!"`
`"...W-We'll keep fighting until the end.`
` You don't have permission to die in battle...!"`
`『...Fantasy is all fiction... Fantasy is all fiction...`
` ...Fantasy is...all...fiiiiiiiiiictioon!!!〝`
`A shriek from one of the goats became a signal for the wall of them to break.`
`They pushed forward with gaping mouths and foul breath, each trying to reach their prey first,`
` trying to return these fictional creatures to nothingness.`
`"Look out...!!"`
`Virgilia leapt in front of and held several of the Seven Sisters, who had fallen on their butts, overpowered by the ferocity of the approaching goats.`
`However, even Virgilia was a fictional creature to these goats.`
`They could chew through her like cotton candy.`
`"Madam, quickly...!!"`
`Ronove threw himself at the oncoming goats.`
`Even he would be chewed apart easily.`
` Knowing this, Ronove leapt forward.`
`"...Even if my magic no longer functions,`
` ...I am still the fiercely passionate and loyal man I always was.`
` ...And furthermore, did you expect that I would simply sit by and watch a lady die?"`
`『...Ronove is fantasy... Ronove is fantasy...〝`
`Ronove slammed his right fist into the side of a goat's face.`
`As soon as he pulled it back, he swung his left leg into the goat's gut, then spun around into a reverse roundhouse that caught the goat again.`
`"......Hmph."`
`Ronove knew.`
` ...He could do less damage than a mosquito bite against those who didn't accept his existence.`
`This was the height of anti-magic defensive power, Endless Nine.`
`『......Ronove is fantasy...a fiction...an illusion...!!〝`
`The goat swung its log-like fist with a sound like a storm.`
`Ronove dodged by a hair.`
`...Had he been an instant slower, that massive arm would've crushed his head like glass.`
`"Ronove...!!`
` Stop this, run...!!"`
`"I, Ronove,`
` cannot help but rise to the challenge when I see a lady in a pinch.`
` A bad habit of mine."`
`Ronove grinned and tried to act tough.`
`He had already sacrificed all he had.`
`There was nothing he could do here and now...except become a shield to buy time.`
`He had already chosen to abandon his life for this.`
`『...Ronove is fantasy... He couldn't exist...he couldn't possibly exist...〝`
`『...Illusions do not exist... They do not exist...〝`
`『...Fantasy is all...ridiculous...ridiculous...〝`
`The goats kept coming, trying to feast on Ronove.`
`None had any pretensions of making this a one-on-one fight.`
`Nothing mattered except chewing apart fantasy.`
` Even just a nibble.`
`As they gnashed those ruthless jaws and fangs, they closed in around Ronove...`
`"...Ggh...!"`
`Ronove's foot hit something, and he stumbled.`
`At the same instant, several massive arms reached out and lifted him up.`
`"R-Ronove-samaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"What are you doing, Chiesters? Shoot them!!"`
`"...If that'd do anything, we would've done it already nyeh..."`
`"Everyone, please stand back.`
` ...I should be able to buy you some time as they savor my flesh.`
` However, I think they'll find that Ronove has quite a few little bones in him."`
`An elbow rammed itself into the massive, hideous jaws that were trying to chew Ronove's head.`
`Of course, the goat did moan, but that did nothing but deprive just one goat of his right to the first bite of Ronove's head.`
`Many jaws opened wide,`
` ...trying to crush him and throw him down into those heartless stomachs, which would permit no cheerful illusions to exist...`
`『...I won't accept fantasy...won't accept...〝`
`『...It's possible to explain everything with mystery...possiblllle...〝`
`『Fantasy is faaaaaaake, everything is mysteryyyyyyyy...!!〝`
`All of the many arms that lifted Ronove up were sliced off.`
`The Seven Sisters used this chance to fly forward and grab Ronove, dragging him back.`
`"...Which of you...mentioned MYSTERY?"`
`"Does Dlanor's blade work on them?!"`
`"I see, if our foes are calling it a mystery...!"`
`Blood-red longsword in hand, Dlanor slowly walked forward.`
`Behind her walked Will, tapping his back with his black blade.`
`"...If you don't think this is a fantasy,`
` ...then let's have your theories."`
`"I cannot wait to hear your EXPLANATIONS."`
`The crowd of goats stepped back.`
`Though they had been so vicious against the Illusions, they stepped back when faced with this pair wielding swords of mystery.`
`"...There have been a great many closed room murders on this game BOARD.`
` Choose whichever you please, and we will parry all of your ATTACKS."`
`"No.`
` ...We don't have to defend anything."`
`"...INDEED.`
` ...The purpose of a mystery is to offer a CHALLENGE.`
` ...There's no need for us to play DEFENSE."`
`"Do you get it yet?"`
`You're the ones in the hot seat now.`
`Blue truth cut the goats apart.`
`That blue truth dwelt within each and every one of the riddles from Beato's games so far.`
`What about the closed room with the chain, first game, second twilight?`
`What about the closed room of the chapel, second game, first twilight?`
`What about the trick to killing Nanjo, third game, ninth twilight?`
`There was no end to the blades.`
`The countless riddles Beatrice had left behind became blades, 'challenges' that tore the goats apart.`
`If they wanted to deny fantasy, ...they would have to make a counterargument.`
`They would have to deal with every single trick as a mystery.`
`However, while most of the goats called themselves anti-fantasy, they hadn't thought up any answers for the mystery.`
`Though, every now and then, goats with answers did appear.`
`『...S-Someone outside the Ushiromiya family was hiding on the island, and...〝`
`"Knox's 1st, it is forbidden for the culprit to be anyone not mentioned in the early part of the STORY!!"`
`『...There were multiple culprits all working separately, and it just happened to look like a single culprit...〝`
`"Van Dine's 12th.`
` There must be but one true culprit."`
`『...Y-You mean...everything but that is...f-forbidden...?!〝`
`"Boring, right? To have a genre like that.`
` Personally, I think `
`mysteries should be more flexible."`
`『...The Ten Knox Commandments...and the Twenty Van Dine Rules...a-are behind the times...〝`
`『The definition of the mystery genre...should change with the era...〝`
`"Tch.`
` And now they get uppity."`
`"Perhaps we are behind the TIMES."`
`"In that case, let's see if you have any theories that can satisfy us."`
`"...COME!!"`
`The whole crowd of goats charged them.`
`In their fangs, each of them carried theories to crush Beato's closed rooms.`
`The bodies of these goats differed from those who had become corpses so easily.`
`They had mystery-style answers to several closed rooms.`
`So, it would take several blade hits to give them a fatal wound.`
`However, Beato had left many blades behind.`
` All of them were exceedingly sharp.`
`So, the pair of inquisitors didn't think this would be a desperate battle.`
`This is mystery.`
`The goal is to use all your imagination and knowledge to challenge each of the riddles head on.`
`Doing so is the greatest pleasure of the mystery genre.`
`So they laughed.`
` Both Will and Dlanor laughed.`
`With smiles of admiration at the theories the goats had put everything they had into, they countered with blades from all the closed rooms.`
`The crowd of goats was no longer an encirclement, but a great wave threatening to swallow the pair up.`
`And yet, the pair repelled the enemy without giving an inch.`
`They resisted firmly, cutting through the wave of wailing goats.`
`It was like an ice-breaking ship knocking a path through a frozen sea.`
`『...They entered the closed room through a hidden passage that no one else could use, and...〝`
`"Knox's 3rd, it is forbidden for hidden passages to EXIST!!"`
`『...After the hidden passage was used, it was welded shut and became unusable, so no hidden passages existed at the time of the inspection...〝`
`"Knox's 8th, it is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not PRESENTED!!"`
`『...These are all fake murders, so no one is actually dead...`
` So, all closed rooms were constructed by the so-called victims...〝`
`"?!"`
`Dlanor hesitated for just an instant.`
`After all, this cliched and simple theory managed to get around both Beato's closed rooms and the Knox Commandments.`
`Dlanor saw nothingness inside the goats' massive jaws...`
`『...Nngghkkk......!!〝`
`"Van Dine's 7th.`
` It is forbidden to have a crime without a corpse."`
`The goat's jaws seemed to close around Dlanor's head.`
`However, the upper and lower jaws were no longer connected, ...so the upper half merely slid off to the side.`
`"I guess even the great Knox forgot to forbid fake murders."`
`"There are many splendid mysteries besides MURDER."`
`The goats weren't about to back off and let the pair have a nice, long chat about the mystery genre.`
`The next massive figure immediately enveloped them.`
`Will's blade drew a diagonal slash across its chest, but it only cut through its clothes, leaving no wound.`
`"......?!`
` The Twenty Wedges don't work on this one."`
`Dlanor also hit it with her longsword, but still, it just cut its clothes without leaving a mark on its body.`
`Could this goat...`
`have a theory that doesn't violate Knox or Van Dine...?!`
`『...Knox and Van Dine are meaningless...`
` All closed rooms can be explained by a single solution...`
` ...After all...〝`
`In an attempt to stop the goat from saying any more, Will and Dlanor hit it with blades from every closed room, as well as stakes from the Ten Commandments and the Twenty Rules, `
`but none of them had any effect.`
`Slowly, the goat clenched its massive fists together...and raised them up high.`
`『...After all, ...after all...!!〝`
`"Will...!!!"`
`With a roar, Will slammed into the goat giant with his body.`
`Though its massive bulk bent back slightly, Will was still leaping into a deathtrap.`
`However, if he hadn't done so, he wouldn't have been able to protect Dlanor.`
`The goat grabbed Will.`
`It lifted him up and held him high in the air.`
`It was like a little kid showing off his favorite toy and waving it around...`
`"Let's hear your theory.`
` ...If I'm to hear a great theory before I die, it'll be a fitting end for a Wright."`
`『...Van Dine and Knox are useless for making theories...〝`
`"Gyagg...gghh...gghhh...!"`
`The goat's massive hands closed on Will like a vise.`
`All the bones in Will's body were creaking.`
`"...Let's hear...your theory.`
` ...Guh, ...aah..."`
`『There is no need...for a theory...〝`
`"...What...?"`
`『After all, making theories for any of Beatrice's games...is a waste of time...〝`
`"What do you mean...gggyahh...!"`
`『...This isn't an orthodox mystery, so thinking about it is just a waste of time...`
` I won't...accept Beatrice's game as a mystery...`
` ...There are no answers to the tricks.`
` ...It's all...all...just an illuuuuusion...〝`
`"............"`
`『...?!?!〝`
`"...Thinking...is just a waste of time...?"`
`『...Gg...gwhh-〝`
`Will's head was lowered, so his face couldn't be seen.`
`However, the arm of the goat holding him was shaking.`
`The embrace of those log-sized arms with superhuman strength...was being slowly pushed away by Will's shaking arms...`
`"...Thinking is just a waste of time...?`
` You say that, ...and you call yourself a mystery novel reader...?"`
`『Gwah...ooh...〝`
`"...The mystery genre is like chivalry.`
` You fight with the noble rules you've created, with pride in the stance you've taken.`
` ...Is it worth being a coward if it'll help you win? Does losing make the whole fight meaningless if you fought with everything you had?`
` ...This isn't about winning and losing, ...it's about applauding the will to fight, even in the most dire circumstances..."`
`『...Guh, ghh, ghh, ...gggg!!!〝`
`The goat's arms were now spread wide, and it looked as though Will was now the one pushing it back.`
`Will's face was covered in shadow and couldn't be seen.`
`"...People like you, ...who call themselves mystery readers even though they never even try to solve mysteries...`
` You're the ones I really can't stand!!!"`
`Will slammed his forehead into the goat's now unprotected head.`
`"If you call yourself a mystery reader, be proud to join in on a battle of wits!!`
` If you call yourself a mystery reader, it's about time you realized!`
` Giving up is nothing to brag aboooooooooout!!!"`
`Will hit it with his head over and over again.`
`His forehead had been torn apart by the goat's fangs, but he kept on hitting it.`
`Van Dine and Knox may be behind the times.`
`The mystery genre does progress with time, just like the world around it.`
`However, there's one thing that never changes.`
`That is...pride.`
`What is a knight proud of?`
`Not victory.`
`He's proud of his courage, which lets him stand up to anyone without fear.`
`Will couldn't forgive the kind of coward who could turn tail from a fight and then brag about it.`
`People who call themselves mystery readers but who have no pride...are the only people Will just can't stand.`
`The goat, unable to put up with this anymore, threw Will down to the floor.`
`Then, he lifted his fists again, determined to crush Will to pieces this time.`
`"Come!`
` You probably will beat me to a pulp, `
`but that'll be no victory for you.`
` ...You'll destroy your own pride with your own hands!!"`
`『...Pointless, pointless...`
` ...This is no mystery, so why make theories? ...Thinking is just a waste of time, useless, useless, useless, die, die, die...〝`
`A fist like a cannonball swinging down towards him...was the very last thing Will saw before he shut his eyes.`
`"In this game, if you stop thinking-"`
`"...!"`
`"In this game, if you give up, that means you lose, right?"`
`Battler smashed his fist into the goat's mouth...and smashed teeth bounced off the celling.`
`"BATTLER-sama...!"`
`"If you stop thinking, it means you've given up on the story being a mystery.`
` Which means...as far as you're concerned, this game is a fantasy."`
`Battler lifted up his arm.`
` Realizing this was a signal, Lucifer and Chiester 00 jumped.`
`"If you've stopped thinking, you don't deserve to be an actor on the stage.`
` Stop trying to sound smart, and go eat some popcorn from the stands or something."`
`The goat lifted his fist again, then swung it down at Battler like a hammer.`
`"...If you've surrendered to fantasy!!"`
`"That just makes you another target nyeh...!"`
`"It's the same as acknowledging that we exist..."`
`"Begin recognition of hostile elements...!!`
` Mark all targets vulnerable to magical attacks in our HMDs!!"`
`"Kids who surrender to fantasy get to deal with us!!"`
`"...And if you have a theory, we will hear it OUT."`
`"We'll welcome those people with open arms.`
` ...Out of respect for them, we won't hold anything back!"`
`"Oh, but it would seem that this is BATTLER-sama's time to shine."`
`"......While I'd like to listen to all your favorite theories, both mystery and fantasy,`
` ...this isn't your game right now.`
` ...No matter how much you future Fragments try to deny us, this is no time for me to be defeated..."`
`A golden glint gathered in Battler's hand.`
`It was so bright that the whole hall was bathed in gold.`
`Golden butterflies flitted about, as though the whole room was being swallowed up by the Golden Land.`
`Battler lifted...his golden longsword high.`
`"......Feel free to challenge Beato's game as a mystery or a fantasy.`
` I welcome it.`
` But I'm not gonna let you deny this final game of mine.`
` ...Feel the shame of your indiscretion, ...of impugning the honor of those who have passed away."`
`A slice of the golden longsword flooded the hall with a sea of golden light.`
`Then, the whole group of goats clambering about the hall turned into clouds of gold butterflies and scattered.`
`...Even so, only about a hundred of them had been wiped out.`
`Before long, the massive crowds of goats outside would probably come pouring in.`
`"...The seal Gertrude and the others are working on will be finished in a bit.`
` Sorry, but I'll have to ask you to hold out here a little longer."`
`"Of course, Lord BATTLER!"`
`"Otherwise, we wouldn't get to show off!"`
`"You know, you two could try fighting just a little."`
`"But-"`
`"We're-"`
`""Just the MCs!!""`
`Their excessively blunt refusal drew a few strained smiles.`
`However, it had lessened the tension in the room just a bit.`
`"BATTLER-sama, leave this to us!"`
`"We won't allow the erosion to proceed any further!"`
`"And not one of us will be left behind."`
`"Of COURSE.`
` We are all precious pieces on Lord BATTLER's game BOARD."`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, the Chiester Sisters Corps, and everyone else nodded forcefully.`
`"Yeah.`
` I'm counting on all of you...!!`
` We'll definitely protect this final game I made for Ange!!"`
`"They're managing to hold their ground down below!"`
`"The door to the Golden Land continues to open slowly.`
` It will still take some time though."`
`"That's right.`
` We'd better start buying some time ourselves...!"`
`The sea of goats that covered the ground below them was jostling about more and more.`
`...By now, even the sea surrounding the island had disappeared.`
`The horizon was gone, ...and the chewed-up island was now floating on an eerie emptiness like space.`
`The goats that flooded the edges of Rokkenjima seemed to be spilling off the sides.`
`"Looks like that's it for this game board..."`
`"As long as there's a Game Master and pieces,`
` the game board can always be laid out again.`
` As long as you have two people together, you can create any sort of game."`
`"...True. ......Where on earth is Ange...?"`
`"Where did you hide 'that'?"`
`"That's right, ...the chapel...!`
` What's happened to the chapel?!"`
`"It's still there...!"`
`The chapel looked like a white building floating in the pitch-black sea of goats.`
`...Yes.`
` This was strange.`
`There was no way those goats, who consumed everything, would go out of their way to avoid just the chapel.`
`"That's where Ange is...!"`
`Outside the chapel was a sea of goats.`
`Very soon, the earth around the chapel would be eaten away, and it would probably end up floating on nothingness.`
`The rampage of the goats, as they devoured everything and recited the tragedies they had imagined,`
` was truly making a lot of noise.`
`However, none of that reached inside the chapel.`
`Ange finally broke the magic seal on the entrance and stepped inside...`
`The seal was supposed to be unbreakable by anyone.`
`However, in the face of ANGE Beatrice, Witch of Truth, the one who sought the truth and could sweep aside all forces that prevented her from finding it,`
` no barrier was absolute...`
`"......`
`...There it is."`
`A single book, tightly locked, rested on the altar.`
`It was the hidden diary that Ushiromiya Eva had continued to write in, even in her later years.`
`'The Book of the Single Truth'.`
`...It was the one Featherine had shown her in the world of 1998.`
`This time, I have the key.`
`I gripped the gold key that sat in my pocket, ...the key Onii-chan gave me.`
`As I approached the altar, I saw that the Book of the Single Truth was wrapped in a strange bending of the light.`
`"...So, this is that 'Seal of the Game Master' that Bernkastel talked about."`
`The Book of the Single Truth was sealed in something like a crystal.`
`It was a seal made by the Game Master's authority.`
`This was on a different level than the breakable magic seal on the chapel door.`
`No matter how Ange used her power as a Witch of Truth, this couldn't be broken by anyone except the Game Master.`
`...However, this time, Battler wasn't the only Game Master.`
`"Hmph.`
` ...So sorry, Onii-chan.`
` Bernkastel is a Game Master too.`
` ...I just need to take this to her and have her break the seal."`
`Ange slowly approached the altar...`
`"...Will Ange really do as you say?"`
`"This is my little sister we're talking about, ...so yeah, probably not."`
`"Then what will we do?"`
`"Looks like we've got nothing to go on but brute force...!"`
`At that moment, a fierce impact hit the pair of them.`
`Beato was flung away, and Battler was sealed inside a massive crystal that extended up to the heavens.`
`"Damn, what the hell is this?!!"`
`"Battler...!! Gghh, what is this?!"`
`It was a barrier, a massive cage of crystal.`
`Battler was shut inside a crystal cage like a tower, so large that you had to look up to see the top.`
`"Beato, I need you to take care of Ange...!"`
`"What will you do?!`
` Can you break free from this all by yourself, from the inside?!`
` Is this...a closed room barrier?!`
` Who could have-"`
`"...There's only one person who'd challenge me with a closed room.`
` ...Looks like our final guest has finally arrived."`
`"You don't mean..."`
`"Go, and take care of Ange...!"`
`Beato left Battler to handle this on his own and headed for the chapel.`
`Battler took a deep breath, then smiled daringly...`
`"...I've been waiting for you.`
` ...Was it boring in that depths of oblivion place?"`
`The answer was a laugh.`
`...Yeah, that's right.`
` That laugh is enough.`
`"Looks like you're doing well."`
`"...It wasn't boring.`
` ...After all, I believed."`
`"I'll bet you did.`
` ...I believed too."`
`Battler flung off the cape of the territory lord.`
`It would only get in the way.`
`And, it would be a rude way to welcome his final guest.`
`"Those dark depths...`
`were the perfect place to think up mysteries I could fight you with when we met again."`
`"So, this crystal cage is the ring for our duel.`
` A chain deathmatch with nowhere to run."`
`"...Now that you mention it,`
` we're always fighting over closed rooms with chains."`
`"Then let's use that.`
` Make it a real chain deathmatch."`
`"I'm prepared, but what about you?"`
`"...I am.`
` ...I told you, didn't I?`
` I believed too."`
`At the same time, they both brandished their mysteries, sealing the other in a chained closed room.`
`"Come, Furudo Erikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`"Entertain me, Bwattleer-shwaaaaaaaannnnn!!!"`
`At the same time, they were both sealed inside a closed room locked with a chain.`
`Of course, it was easy to set and unset the chain from the inside.`
`However, stepping into their opponent's chained room would be difficult.`
`They were fighting to the death with two chain closed rooms at once.`
`There could be no better closed room duel for these two, who had battled with theories concerning chained rooms so often.`
`"#5decffFurudo Erika committed suicide, died in an accident, died of an illness, died by some reason other than homicide!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000It wasn't a suicide, it wasn't an accidental death, it wasn't a death by illness! I really was killed by you, Battler-san!!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffIt was a murder committed by slipping poison gas through the crack of the door, by filling the room with water and drowning you, by sucking the oxygen out of the room and making you suffocate!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000There was no poison gas, there was no drowning, there was no death by suffocation!!#ffffff"`
`"Hahahaha, ahhahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` A closed room murder with poison gas? Death by drowning? Suffocation?!`
` *giggle*giggle* Ahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"Crazy, right? It's funny, isn't it?"`
`"<Good>!!`
` #5decffUshiromiya Battler committed suicide, he died in an accident, he was killed by an illness!!#ffffff`
` Time for me to test your closed room!"`
`"Red truth!!`
` #ff0000Ushiromiya Battler was stabbed to death!!`
` Let's say the weapon was a knife, stuck right into his back!!#ffffff"`
`"<Good>!!`
` Nothing beats a classic closed room!!"`
`"Then why don't you try it too?!"`
`"I'll take that challenge with the red truth!!`
` #ff0000Furudo Erika was stabbed to death!`
` The weapon was a knife, stuck right in her back!!#ffffff"`
`"Interesting!!`
` I'll tear your closed room to biiiiiiiiits!!"`
`"...What's this supposed to be?"`
`"Battler is busy at the moment.`
` For now, I shall be your opponent."`
`Beato had sealed the chapel with a closed room barrier.`
`Unless that riddle was smashed with blue truth, Ange wouldn't be able to leave.`
`After shrugging impatiently, Ange finally faced Beato.`
`"This might be the first time I've fought you directly..."`
`"Oh, is it now...?`
` Very well, let's see what you've got.`
` However, Battler isn't here at the moment.`
` ...When he's not around, I sometimes forget to hold back."`
`"What a coincidence.`
` I feel the same."`
`"#ff0000I killed you inside a perfect closed room, with windows, doors, and all other methods of entry or exit blocked!!#ffffff"`
`"Okay, I'll play along with your game. Repeat it!!!"`
`"And then, you see,`
` we'll set it up so that, among the works entered in Company X's mystery novel contest, yet another one of the great Hachijo's works will 'appear' under a false name..."`
`"Of course, we'll then move on with a movie version and a TV drama bundled in...!`
` We here at Company X would be honored to accept your manuscript...!!"`
`"And am I getting prize money out of this?"`
`"But of course...!`
` The 10 million yen prize for Company X's first mystery novel contest will all go to you!`
` And much more besides!!"`
`"Splendid.`
` You've caught my interest.`
` That's why I've decided not to write up a manuscript for you."`
`""Whaaaaaat?!?!`
` M-Madam Hachijo,`
` whyyyyyy...?!!!""`
`Everything had seemed to be going so smoothly up until then, so this sudden refusal made the people from the publishing company fall over in their sofa.`
`"This little scheme of yours is far more interesting than the manuscript I wrote.`
` In that case, it wouldn't be fitting to hand it over to you.`
` ...It was always a worthless story.`
` I wanted to lure my ignorant readers into lauding it, making them feel as though they'd performed some magnificent reasoning.`
` I was hoping that you children of men would recognize the irony and laugh at your own mistake, `
`but it looks like you've taken it seriously.`
` Yes, I can say I'm ashamed at my own failure as a writer."`
`"O-O-Of course not!!`
` Please, forgive us!! Please, let us use your-!!"`
`"...I have no need for money, but some pet food would be nice."`
`"Pet food?`
` O-Oh, for your cat...!!"`
`"Th-There was a rumor that you had a cat who liked dried plums!`
` Y-Yes, as you wish...!`
` Quickly, let's have a high-quality assortment of dried plums brought in here!!"`
`"She only eats the ones that are packaged separately, at 200 yen apiece.`
` ...At this rate, she'll die of high blood pressure.`
` She snacks on kimchi and spicy miso all the time too...`
` Really, there must be something wrong with that cat's tongue."`
`Meep!`
` The cat meowed an objection from where it lay on top of the bookshelf.`
`"I cannot give you this manuscript, but why don't I write up a new one for your company's contest?`
` However, I won't write it under my name.`
` It's estimated that thousands of manuscripts will be sent in for your contest.`
` If you manage to pick mine out from the pack, and if you also find it deserving of the prize, then I would be happy to continue our discussion just now.`
` ...How does that sound?"`
`""H-Haha--!!`
` Just the honor of receiving your manuscript is more than enough!!""`
`"You people truly are amusing, fawning and cringing all the time.`
` But I've grown weary of this for today.`
` Leave now.`
` Meeting with children of men can be so tiring."`
`""Haha--!!`
` We are deeply grateful for your kindness in allowing us this meeting!!!""`
`A servant guided the people from the publishing company to the door.`
`In the study that was now finally quiet, Hachijo Tohya let out a sigh, slumped down in the sofa, and gazed at the ceiling.`
`"It is tiring, but the stimulation of talking with a child of man isn't such a bad thing, in small doses."`
`"...It's good for you to talk to people every now and then.`
` ...You'll go senile if you stay shut in all the time."`
`The black cat leapt from the bookshelf and landed softly on the carpet.`
`Then its form silently twisted and became that of Bernkastel.`
`"Indeed.`
` They certainly can be entertaining.`
` Inviting them over now and then may go a long way towards alleviating my boredom.`
` ...At any rate, I think I will write that manuscript...when I feel like it.`
` It sounds like they'll even bring a gift for you."`
`"What's all this about pet food?`
` How rude."`
`"Well, that's what it is.`
` ...Here."`
`Hachijo picked up a jar from a shelf, then took a dried plum out and threw it into the air.`
`In an instant, Bernkastel turned back into a black cat, caught it in midair, and started munching away.`
`"...Madam Hachijo, your guests have departed."`
`A servant knocked on the door before making this announcement.`
`"Thank you.`
` ...Let me know if that one wakes up."`
`"As you wish.`
` ...Would you like some tea?"`
`"No.`
` I'm going to write for a bit.`
` Please do not disturb me."`
`"Yes ma'am."`
`After waiting for the servant's footsteps to disappear into the distance, Hachijo moved to her desk.`
`The desk certainly looked as though it belonged to a great writer, with pages of manuscript scattered across it.`
`"...Even though the century's almost over, you still write with a pen?"`
`The black cat spoke as it tore the dried plum apart with its mouth.`
`"Tales are to be written with ink.`
` To me, that is an unbreakable rule."`
`"...So, you write it once with ink, then type the whole thing over again with a keyboard.`
` ...Pretty stupid, doing the same thing twice."`
`"In that case, why does a child of man draw up a tale in their mind, and then spit the whole thing out again on a keyboard?`
` ...How foolish of them to do the same thing twice."`
`"Look at it that way, and you're doing the same thing three times."`
`"...Pft, ...*cackle*cackle*`
` That was a good one."`
`Even as Hachijo laughed, her fountain pen was already sliding across the page.`
`Beautiful letters appeared almost as fast and proficiently as a typewriter.`
`...Only Humans called her creations 'manuscripts'.`
`With her fountain pen and writing paper, she was creating a world...`
`As she did, the hands of the clock would spin around like a top.`
`The light and shadows that came in through the window changed their angle so fast, they might have been the hands of a clock themselves...`
`...Slowly, she drew a large X across the tightly packed words on the paper.`
`"...Having trouble?"`
`"...I can't draw it out well.`
` ...Writing a manuscript to please people is truly a pain.`
` ...After all, I don't usually write for other people to read."`
`"You should try writing down whatever it is you're saying on that manuscript paper..."`
`Bernkastel curled up on the sofa, a mocking smile on her face.`
`Normally, whenever Hachijo was writing, Bernkastel would never let herself be noticed, much less talk to her.`
`However, Bernkastel realized that the other was apparently getting bored with her manuscript, so she yawned and started talking.`
`"What is it you're writing, anyway?"`
`"......A tale to give to a child of man."`
`"Which child of man?"`
`"...It's a tale I promised to write for a miko who once Read for me."`
`"Ah...`
` You're still writing that?"`
`"I can't think of anything to write `
`that would give her satisfaction."`
`"...Looks like Auau's giving up yet again.`
` ...You always promise to write a story, then get stuck before you're finished and give up."`
`"If I had given up, I wouldn't be worrying over it like this."`
`"...There's only one tale that Ange's wanted from the beginning."`
`"The tale of the Single Truth..."`
`"Ange said she wanted to know what happened that day.`
` No matter how many tales you write distorting the truth, she'll never be satisfied."`
`"And yet, I do think my tales are far more interesting than the Single Truth."`
`"Ange doesn't want to read an interesting tale."`
`"...I promised that child of man that I would write a tale for her sake.`
` So, I'm writing a tale to please her."`
`"No matter how interesting or uninteresting it is,`
` everything you write is an illusion.`
` Ange doesn't want any of that.`
` ...Haven't you figured that out yet?"`
`"......The Book of the Single Truth...was written by Ushiromiya Eva."`
`Hidden amongst the pile of writing paper...was Eva's diary.`
`"Furthermore, the one who wrote this passed away without revealing it to anyone.`
` ...Being the humble writer that I am, I would like to respect that."`
`"...Don't make me laugh.`
` Is this coming from the person who entertains herself by taking a tale and tearing out its guts?"`
`"The truth...is uninteresting."`
`"Is that your opinion after tearing apart the guts of so many tales?"`
`"......`
`...You might as well say that."`
`With a self-mocking laugh, Hachijo set down her fountain pen.`
`"I certainly have aged.`
` ...The first thing age taught me was that 'not knowing' is more precious than 'knowing'."`
`"That definitely sounds like something an old person would say, but I'll bite.`
` What do you mean?"`
`"'Knowing' and 'not knowing'.`
` These two things have a one-way relationship."`
`"True.`
` ...It's possible to switch from 'not knowing' to 'knowing', but you can't do it the other way around."`
`"When I realized that,`
` ...I saw the noble purity resembling virginity...that exists in not knowing."`
`"............"`
`"In my attempts to escape boredom, I've torn apart and eaten the guts of as many games and tales as there are stars in the sky.`
` ...But always, my relief from boredom is short-lived. It's all so fleeting that I've started to ignore each tale as an individual story."`
`"...That's right.`
` If you eat a cat, then you only get to enjoy it for one night.`
` But if you let it live, it might start calling you names and getting sarcastic."`
`"Indeed.`
` ...Even the annoying way they break into your sweets cupboard or sneak into your bed can be part of their charm."`
`Hachijo looked around at the books covering every square inch of the room, then softly petted the cat's back.`
`"I might have been able to enjoy a single tale much longer and much more deeply.`
` ...As I've eaten my way through countless tales to escape boredom, I haven't really been eating them.`
` ...I've just been killing them.`
` ...And, in the end, they'll kill me back."`
`Hachijo laughed with self-derision.`
`"...Even in Beato's game, you tried to tear the guts out."`
`"I just wanted to check my answers.`
` I did try to do it in a way that respected Beatrice, the weaver of this tale."`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...I think it was pretty well Read, all done so that people who didn't understand wouldn't figure it out."`
`"Will it make for a better tale if Ange learns the truth, or if she doesn't?`
` ...To be honest, I don't know anymore.`
` So, fully aware that you'll scorn me for it, ...I've decided to stop writing the rest of this tale."`
`"...What do you mean?"`
`"I won't write it.`
` I will merely record it.`
` ...The tale that Ushiromiya Ange weaves herself."`
`"So, ...you're going to do that sort of thing again?"`
`"After growing tired of a thousand years of life, I've decided that choosing not to know the truth is the more noble path.`
` ...However, I now see that it isn't fair to force my opinion on Ange, who hasn't lived even a hundred years."`
`"So, ...you're going to leave it in Ange's care?"`
`"Yes.`
` I will silently record it as it plays out."`
`"...If you're leaving it to Ange, ...then the rest of this tale is pretty much set in stone, right...?"`
`"So it would seem.`
` ...Let it be so.`
` ...After all, in the end, a tale that a child of man weaves for herself will be more fun than any story I could create."`
`"In that case, why don't you lend a hand in Ange's tale?`
` You've already given yourself a role in it, haven't you...?"`
`"...Hmm.`
` ...So, is it my role to bring this tale to its conclusion?"`
`"Come on, that's no way for someone in Beato's game to talk.`
` ...It's your job to tear the guts out of the cat box."`
`Hachijo chuckled, pushed aside the pile of writing paper, and picked up 'the Book of the Single Truth'.`
`Then, she opened a locked drawer.`
`"...That is what Ange desires.`
` ...Perhaps this book's seal is fated to be broken.`
` ...Ange will reach the Single Truth, the Single Truth will break the seal on the cat box, and everything will then be exposed to the light of day.`
` And so, all of those countless message bottles and Fragments made up of delightful imaginings, which have been scattered across the ocean of the internet,`
` will fade away like foam on the sea. ...After all, even that person has surely tired of such Fragments."`
`"It's about time for that kid's journey to end too."`
`"...Yes, let us accept this task.`
` As our role demands, let's give this journey an 'end of the line'."`
`At that moment, there were sounds of someone in the hallway.`
`The instant someone knocked on the door, Bernkastel turned back into a black cat.`
`"...Madam Hachijo, please forgive me for interrupting."`
`It was the voice of Hachijo's servant.`
`"What is it?`
` If it's a phone call, tell them I'm busy."`
`"It isn't that.`
` ...Tohya-sama has woken up."`
`"Thank you.`
` Prepare a light meal.`
` Enough for the two of us."`
`"As you wish."`
`Hachijo stood up.`
`Then, she shut the open drawer and locked it again.`
`Inside that drawer...lay a glittering golden key...`
`"Repeat it!!`
` 'The definition of a closed room prevents all varieties of entering and exiting'!"`
`"I refuse!!`
` By definition, it's impossible for a closed room murder to take place inside a perfect closed room!"`
`"#5decffThe chain might have been repaired after it was destroyed!`
` The door might have been repaired after it was destroyed!`
` The wall might have been repaired after it was destroyed!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000My closed room doesn't involve anything being repaired!!#ffffff"`
`"<Good>!`
` This really is getting fun, Battler-san...!"`
`"Sorry, but I don't have time to play with you right now!"`
`"I'm sorry too, but as a fellow Witch of Truth, I can't let you get in Ange-san's way."`
`"...Come to think of it, you're a Witch of Truth too, aren't you?`
` I guess that makes you a sort of mentor to Ange."`
`"The Single Truth!!`
` It is the supreme, the ultimate!!`
` Only a Witch of Truth can break down all barriers that stand between her and that truth!"`
`"Is this Single Truth of yours really so important...?!`
` There are lots of things in this world that aren't worth knowing.`
` How important is 1986 to Ange, really?!`
` It isn't important at all!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*!`
` You're probably right!`
` No matter what happened or didn't happen in 1986,`
` it won't change anything for the Ange living in 1998!`
` There's no point in learning that truth.`
` However, there is just one thing that will change."`
`"What's that?"`
`"How she lives!!"`
`Erika transformed her reasoning into a scythe's blade and lashed out at Battler over and over.`
`Battler also created a blade from his reasoning and attacked Erika over and over.`
`In the middle of all this, he questioned Erika, the girl who, like Ange, called herself a Witch of Truth.`
`Just what is the point of exposing the truth?`
`"You're right.`
` 'Knowing' often changes how a person lives her life.`
` ...In that case, I have one hope as her blood relative.`
` I hope that, at the end of my game, Ange finds a better way to live her life."`
`"'Knowing' may change how people live, but not always in a good direction.`
` There are plenty of things in this world that you'd be more comfortable not knowing."`
`"The number of ticks living in the seats on a train.`
` Those urban legends about nasty stuff in the tap water.`
` The world's full of things you'd be better off not knowing...!!"`
`"The Book of the Single Truth probably can teach Ange what happened on this island.`
` But what's the point of her knowing that?!`
` It'll just increase the sadness she's felt for 12 years!`
` How many more years will it take for her to find happiness as an ordinary girl...?!`
` How many years will it take for her wounds to be healed...?!!"`
`Ange's desire to find the truth is hurting her, regardless of what the truth actually is.`
`Though her deep wounds were slow to heal, they did begin to do so during those 12 years.`
`However, Ange kept picking at the scabs.`
`In her search for the truth, she tore at those wounds herself, opening them up once more...`
`"It's time for Ange to be free of the sadness of 1986...!!`
` That's what all of us Ushiromiyas pray for!!"`
`"Who cares about that?!`
` The truth is everything! The truth is justice!!"`
`"It's a disease everyone gets at least once, usually in middle school...!`
` They just love to find out all those things adults are hiding!"`
`"But don't you think it's fun to expose things like that?"`
`"Yeah, totally.`
` Reading dirty books wouldn't be nearly so fun if you didn't have to do it in secret."`
`"...Pft-"`
`"Wahahahahahahahahaha!!""`
`"#ff0000I deny all of your blue wedges with the red truth.`
` None of the methods you suggest could defeat my closed room!!#ffffff"`
`"............"`
`Ange was breathing heavily.`
` The Book of the Single Truth was right before her eyes.`
`If she could just defeat Beato, she'd be able to take the book to Bernkastel, and then she could read what was inside.`
`...Even though the truth of the final family conference on October 4th and 5th of 1986 was right there, ...the Golden Witch stood in her way.`
`Her anger and hatred spun around inside her head, wiping out the composure necessary to theory-making.`
`Ange shook her head several times, clearing away everything that got in the way of calming her mind.`
`However, no matter how many times she thought it through, the closed room sealing her in the chapel was perfect.`
`Ange wasn't particularly familiar with the mystery genre.`
`However, she knew about all the Fragments containing Beato's games so far.`
`Her knowledge was shallow, but it should still have been enough to give her a good foothold.`
`However, ......no matter how many blue truths she shot at Beato, none of them even made the witch flinch...`
`Beato just blew them apart with the red truth and an elegant wave of her pipe.`
`"It's about time you gave up.`
` I don't even view this as a game between the two of us."`
`"...Are you implying that I could never solve this puzzle?"`
`"I'm just buying time until Battler finishes dealing with Erika.`
` He's the only one who can bring you to your senses."`
`"Bring me to my senses?`
` ...You're the ones making me do this by hiding the Single Truth!!`
` That's why I'm fighting you!!`
` This is my right!!`
` As the final member of the Ushiromiya family, I have a right to know the truth!"`
`"Indeed.`
` And that is the purpose of this final game."`
`"...That's right.`
` Without this final game, I wouldn't have been given a chance to reach the truth.`
` At least for that one thing, I'm grateful."`
`"But as for what happened in 1986...`
` As for who took your relatives and your family away from you...`
` As a Human, your desire to know the truth is quite natural.`
` ...However, even knowing this, Battler decided that it would be best if you didn't return to 1986."`
`"I know what Onii-chan's trying to say...!`
` He's telling me to look to the future and live, instead of being stuck in the past, right?!"`
`"Correct.`
` Battler wanted to use this final game `
`to show you that."`
`"In that case, there's no need to keep waiting for my answer.`
` The answer's 'no', Golden Witch...!`
` I died back in 1986.`
` I've wandered about like a ghost for 12 years since then...!`
` And when Aunt Eva died, I lost my only reason to stick around on this Earth as a ghost!`
` That's why I decided to do one last thing before ending my life!!"`
`"And that thing is learning the truth of 1986?"`
`"Yeah! Got a problem with that?!?!"`
`"Of course I do, you foolish girl!!`
` So, if you do reach the truth, you'll die...!`
` In that case, I can't let you have it...!!`
` I must trick you and blind you as much as I can...to keep you alive!`
` Battler wants you to live...!!"`
`"Living without truth is no better than dying!!`
` I'm trying to find the truth so I can live!!"`
`"You just admitted that you were searching for the truth so you could die."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` Then let me rephrase that...!`
` I'm trying to find the truth so I can die!!`
` I offered up my life when I made my contract with Bernkastel!!`
` All so I could learn what happened that day!!`
` That Single Truth will be the souvenir I take with me to hell!!!"`
`"#ff0000It's useless.`
` You cannot break this closed room.`
` This closed room is perfect...!`
` And yet, I will kill you in this closed room!!#ffffff"`
`She had tried every theory, idea, and every bit of nonsense she could think of.`
`However, none of it had any effect on Beato.`
`Powerless and frustrated, with the Book of the Single Truth right before her eyes, ...Ange bit her lower lip.`
`"At first, this was supposed to be a game in which you were given a key. A key that would let you decide your future."`
`"Liar.`
` You wanted to hide the truth in this chapel, then make me choose a door that leads to some optimistic future.`
` ...That's not a choice! You're trying to decide for me!!"`
`"Parents have the right to prevent their children from making unsuitable choices."`
`"I'm not a kid!!`
` I'm an eighteen-year-old woman, who can think and act for herself...!!"`
`"Fool!!`
` You're just a six-year-old girl, who can't think of anything except the past!!"`
`"And whose fault is that?!!`
` Because of you, ...I've been stuck as a six-year-old all this time!!`
` Now it's time for me to tear apart your illusion covering the truth!!`
` Yes, now that I think about it, it's not this chapel that you've locked me inside!`
` Since that day in 1986, for all these years, you've had me locked away in a closed room where I'm all alone, and where no one will tell me the truth!!"`
`"And now, ...I'll tear your closed room apart with my own hands!!`
` ...Yeah, it's useless, it's all useless.`
` I know the trick to your perfect closed room!!`
` Repeat it!!`
` 'You murdered me immediately after shutting me into this closed room!'"`
`"......!`
` I refuse."`
`"Of course.`
` ...You've been killing me for 18 years.`
` Thanks, Beatrice.`
` ...If you hadn't reminded me, I wouldn't have figured out the trick."`
`"...Ange,`
` you are young, and you have a long future ahead of you.`
` In fact, you are the Golden Witch who lives in the future, are you not?`
` Then live on in the future.`
` Just how much are past truths really worth?`
` Don't they pale in comparison to the truth of the future, the truth you'll create yourself...?!!"`
`"My life is trash.`
` My whole family died, leaving just me behind.`
` That's why I'm going back to them once I've gotten my Single Truth."`
`"If you learn the truth, you'll just have to accept your family's deaths...!`
` Haven't you ever thought about living on, hoping that by some miracle, one of them might have survived? And that someday, you might get a chance to see them again...?!"`
`"I'm not worried about that.`
` Even the Witch of Miracles couldn't find a Fragment like that."`
`In the Great Rokkenjima Explosion, almost none of the family's remains were recovered.`
`Some days, ...I hoped that this might be a sign that they had escaped the explosion and survived.`
` That hope gave me the strength to live on.`
`However, that hope wasn't strong enough to support me for 12 long years.`
`"So, even though I wanted to know the truth, I unconsciously averted my eyes.`
` ...I felt that learning of my family's deaths for certain would force me to deny any possibility of someone miraculously surviving.`
` ...But I'm tired of living on and on, with nothing but that impossible hope of a miracle to keep me going.`
` That's why I decided to accept my family's deaths.`
` I decided to accept the truth, no matter what it is.`
` That's why I became a Witch of Truth...!!"`
`"...How foolish, to be blinded by the truth of the past and unable to see one's own future...!`
` Forgive me, Battler.`
` ...I was not strong enough to guide your sister properly..."`
`A blazing blue wedge appeared in Ange's hand.`
`It was long, thick, and shaped like a spear.`
`"This is the end, witch of 1986.`
` ...#5decffThis closed room is perfect!!`
` Therefore, I can't get out, and you can't lay a finger on me from the outside!`
` However, you 'locked me into this room'!`
` So, we can say you killed me with this simple trick...!!`
` You shut me in this perfect closed room and made me starve to death...!!`
` Since you intentionally did this, it's totally fair to say 'This is a closed room murder with you as the killer'!!#ffffff`
` It looks like being overly vague with the cause of death backfired on you.`
` ......So long, witch of illusions.`
` <See you in hell>."`
`With the stained glass window behind her, Beato spread her arms and let the spear of the blue truth pierce her.`
`The blue spear seemed to crucify Beato against the window.`
`"......Nng...gah......"`
`"Game set.`
` ...So, this is Aunt Eva's diary, ...the Book of the Single Truth."`
`Ange picked the book up from where it lay on the altar, sealed in crystal.`
`"...If you read that, then by your contract with Bernkastel, you will die...`
` ...Learning the truth just to die?`
` Ridiculous...!!"`
`"That's right.`
` I'm looking for the truth so I can die.`
` ...At least let me choose how I go.`
` ...I'm not an idiot.`
` ...I know the real me is still floating in that starry sky."`
`Bernkastel acknowledged me as the final Beatrice and invited me on a journey to learn the truth of 1986.`
`I won't be able to return here again.`
`When Bernkastel told me that and walked off the roof into the black sky, ...I followed her into the empty air.`
`That was the contract.`
`I wanted two things from Bernkastel.`
`One was for someone from my family to come back.`
`The other...was revenge.`
`I wanted to destroy the Illusion of the Witch that hid the events of that day.`
` I wanted to reach the truth.`
`However, the first of my wishes couldn't come true.`
`After all, even the Witch of Miracles couldn't find a Fragment where my family came home.`
`So, she wordlessly questioned me.`
`She told me that I couldn't reach the truth unless I had the courage to end this worthless life, `
`where I lived like a ghost, hoping someone might come back.`
`So, she walked out into the open air, and I followed her.`
`Yes, now I can understand.`
`When I offered to trade away my life, I made one wish and gave up on another.`
`I wished for revenge against the illusion hiding the truth.`
`And now, I've succeeded in that revenge, defeating the master of that illusion and obtaining the Book of the Single Truth.`
`What I gave up was my naivety, my continuing belief that someone from my family might come back.`
`And now, I can accept that my entire family is dead.`
`"...Can you make someone alive just because no one knows any different?`
` These cat boxes you talk about are just naive delusions.`
` The idea that a corpse can live as long as you keep it hidden! But even if you hide a corpse, it's still dead...!!"`
`"Do you really think you can heal my wounds by saying they'll always be watching over me from the clouds, like some kind of fairy tale?!`
` I'm ANGE Beatrice, a Witch of Truth!!`
` I'll free myself from that life as a ghost, waiting for a miracle that'll never happen! I'll end my life as a noble martyr who's reached the truth...!!"`
`"...Didn't you once come to understand the power of magic through Maria's grimoire...?"`
`"Yeah,`
` I understood it.`
` And then I despaired when I realized how powerless it was.`
` ...And that's what Onii-chan is trying to force me to use now, isn't it?`
` ...If I believe, if I use magic, ...then my family will always be by my side."`
`"...Don't take me for a fool!!!`
` You think that kind of magic, an illusion, a daydream...can heal those 12 years?!`
` And how am I supposed to go on for decades and decades into the future?!`
` Someone, come back to me, someone!!`
` But no one's coming back!!`
` So, at least tell me what happened that day!!`
` Bernkastel said she'd tell me...!!"`
`"My master, I have the Book of the Single Truth...!`
` I'll take it back to you, so give me the truth!!`
` For so long, I've been prepared to throw away my naive hopes for a miracle!!`
` Now, tell me the truth of that daaaaaaaaaaaay!!!"`
`A blinding light poured out of the chapel.`
`It seeped from the windows and the cracks of the door, even reaching as far as Battler's and Erika's eyes.`
`"...What...?!"`
`"It seems comrade Ange has completed her task.`
` It looks like you've set up some pathetic seal, but to my master, that'll be easier than thawing frozen saury fish."`
`"...D-Damn...!!"`
`"Master said I could play with you until Ange finished her task.`
` I've had enough fun from this reunion, so I think it's time for me to leave."`
`Erika gave an elegant curtsey.`
`"Why did you talk Ange into looking for the Single Truth?!`
` Your master must know...!`
` That truth doesn't mean anything to Ange!"`
`"Yes.`
` All truths in this world are meaningless.`
` In the end, 'meaning' comes from the mind of each individual human.`
` ...Even when there is a Single Truth, it can mean different things to different people!`
` The truth has no meaning in itself!`
` There's just one reason why I'm still stuck on the truth despite it all!"`
`"Because you're the detective!"`
`"<Good>!!`
` But Ange-san isn't a detective.`
` To her, the truth itself is the finish line.`
` ...A way to mark the end of her unhappy life.`
` Now, she's finally finished the final purification ceremony...!!`
` She's a one-night Witch of Truth, focused on learning a certain Single Truth before she dies!`
` A temporary witch for the short time until she slams against the ground!!"`
`"I won't let Ange die!!`
` No matter how tough it gets, she has to live!!`
` That's the only thing all of us want...!!`
` If she lives, all sorts of magic and miracles would be possible...!!"`
`"If only you had put your arm around her shoulder and told her that directly, you might not have lost.`
` ...What do you think?`
` Just by hearing you howl, this level of reasoning is possible for Furudo Erika."`
`"Live! Angeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`He yelled towards the chapel, but Ange probably wasn't even there anymore.`
`Battler's yell was swallowed by the empty pitch-black sky and the sea of rampaging goats...`
`"Comrade EVA,`
` our mission is complete. Let's withdraw."`
`"Oh, are we done already?`
` And I was just about to tear the island apart with my own Eva culprit theory...!"`
`EVA appeared in midair and cackled.`
`"Sorry, Battler-kun,`
` that I wasn't strong enough.`
` ...For 12 years, I protected that kid in my own way."`
`"...I'm grateful."`
`"However, she's decided this for herself.`
` She's 18 years old now.`
` Don't you think people should decide how they live their own lives?"`
`"...Sorry `
`for being a doting big brother."`
`"Later.`
` I'm Lady Bernkastel's piece at the moment.`
` It's time for me to go."`
`"I'll see you later, comrade EVA."`
`EVA held her palm open...and a small, pointy, blue Fragment appeared there.`
`The Fragment burst, and with a blinding flash of light, EVA vanished.`
`It was the same light that had seeped out of the chapel earlier.`
`...Pieces cannot leave the game board.`
`However, the Voyager witches alone could come and go.`
`This was probably some sort of magic that Bernkastel had given them.`
`Erika opened her palm as well, and the same sort of Fragment appeared there.`
`"That's enough for now, I think.`
` Who knows? This might be the last time we meet."`
`"...Wait.`
` We haven't settled our fight yet."`
`If he could steal the Fragment in Erika's hand, ...he would be able to go to where Bernkastel was.`
`The seal surrounding the Book of the Single Truth would probably be melted easily with Bernkastel's power.`
`However, even so, it would take her some time.`
`If he could steal that Fragment, ...he would have a chance at bringing Ange back...`
`"What is there to settle?`
` Time's up.`
` ...However, `
`...if you feel like taking one last hit, I'd be happy to oblige."`
`Battler had known that Erika wouldn't be able to resist the challenge.`
`...After all, he already knew what her trick was.`
`He'd figured it out just a second ago.`
` Even while he spoke with Erika, he had been thinking about it inside his mind.`
`He could finish her with this last strike...and take the Fragment...`
`"Let's go, Erika.`
` ...This'll decide it...!!"`
`"This clash will be the last before I go,`
` so go ahead and give me the craziest of your hilarious theories."`
`"Your closed room definition stated that the walls, windows, floor, ceiling, and chain were all unbeatable!!`
` However, there was one possibility that I didn't check, because it was too ridiculous!"`
`"And that was whether or not the chain could be set from the outside!!"`
`"...!"`
`"Blue truth!!`
` This is the answer to your closed room!!`
` The length of the chain!!`
` #5decffThe chain for your closed room was extra long, so it was possible to set and unset it from outside the room!!!#ffffff"`
`What a ridiculous answer.`
`However, if you blindly assume that a lock made by an unbreakable chain makes a closed room unbeatable, then this truly would be a perfect closed room.`
`The blue wedge flung from Battler's hand plunged straight into Erika's chest.`
`As she winced in pain, her hand shook, ...and the Fragment she held flew into the air.`
`"......Your closed room definition stated that the walls, windows, floor, door, and chain were all unbeatable!!`
` However, wasn't there one really ridiculous thing missing?!`
` Blue truth!!`
` #5decffYour closed room had no ceiling, so it was possible to enter by climbing over the wall!!!#ffffff"`
`Erika's blue scythe swung out from behind her back, catching Battler in the side as he stretched his hand out towards the Fragment.`
`Battler's hand...didn't reach it.`
`The Fragment returned to Erika's hands once more.`
`"It looks like our tricks were equally ridiculous.`
` ...The mystery nuts would've been furious, don't you think?"`
`"But I disagree!`
` To me, the process of exposing that ridiculousness is ecstasy!!`
` That's why I'm Furudo Erika, the detective!!"`
`"...Dammit... You figured out the answer a while back, didn't you...?"`
`"Not true.`
` I thought it up between the time you let loose your blue truth and the time you stretched your hand out to grab the Fragment.`
` I've just been buying time since the beginning.`
` I only started reasoning a second ago!"`
`Erika broke the crystal barrier that surrounded them.`
`Then, she flew high up into the sky, looking down on Battler and laughing at him as she gave a final bow.`
`"So long, Battler-san...!!`
` Even if this has been my only time to shine!`
` Even if I've outlived my usefulness and am about to be thrown back into the depths of oblivion!`
` Even so, I have no regrets!!"`
`"W-Wait!!!"`
`Like she'd actually wait just because I told her to.`
`With a blinding flash, Erika vanished.`
`Ange had retrieved the Book of the Single Truth and returned to Bernkastel.`
`...Battler and the others had no way to leave the game board.`
`Everything...had come to an end...`
`A gold butterfly flitted by, and Beato appeared.`
`"...My apologies, Battler...`
` ...I let Ange get away..."`
`"I'm sorry too.`
` ...We've let them escape. It's all over..."`
`Battler had created this game for Ange.`
`Now that Ange was gone, the game board no longer had any purpose.`
`...And even if that hadn't been the case, the game board itself had been chewed to bits by the goats...and was now like a single leaf floating on a sea of nothingness...`
`Thanks to Gertrude and Cornelia's seals, the mansion was protected from the second floor up.`
`The door to the Golden Land was now open wide enough for a child to slip through.`
`The smaller people, like Maria and Sakutarou, went through it.`
`"...My friend,`
` I believe the door is opening at a quicker pace."`
`"Indeed.`
` To my eyes as well, it seems to be so."`
`"............"`
`"F-Father...!`
` Is the door open yet...?!`
` It looks like they're about to break in through the windows...!!"`
`"Krauss-sama, there is no need for you to fear.`
` An Eiserne Jungfrau barrier is not so easily broken."`
`"Very soon, it'll be big enough for adults to go through too.`
` Don't worry. We'll make it in time."`
`"B-But...there's knocking and banging everywhere, and-"`
`"Stay calm and wait.`
` After all, there is nothing else we can do."`
`Even the outer walls of the mansion were covered with goats.`
`And they were plunging their fangs and fists into the walls and windows, trying to crush them.`
`So, anyone watching the goats stuck to all the windows in the hallway, `
`smashing their thick arms against the windows, ...couldn't help but be terrified, even if they knew about the barrier.`
`However, anyone watching the group of goats gathered at the top of the big staircase on the other side of the barrier would probably feel a different emotion.`
`Rather than terror, ...it was a sad, empty sort of emotion.`
`The barrier was drawn across the landing at the top of the hall's great staircase.`
`Beyond that barrier, ...everything had already been eaten away.`
`Was it even possible for those who stood in the hallway of the upper floors to believe that this was the Rokkenjima mansion?`
`By now, ...no one looking at this scene would be able to imagine such a thing.`
`Forget the hall or even the whole first floor...`
` Even the ground itself was almost gone.`
`The sea of goats had eaten everything apart long before this.`
`They had eaten apart the hall, the pillars of the mansion, the floor, the ground, the sea, the very concept of the island...`
` Every part of the game board Battler had created.`
`And now, the only leftover was the upper part of the mansion, which floated along in empty space.`
`"...How PITIFUL."`
`"To what do you refer?"`
`"...The goats, in their eagerness to chew this island apart, `
`have eaten up even the ground they stood on, dropping themselves into NOTHINGNESS."`
`This had once been a huge entrance hall.`
`Beyond it had been a vast rose garden.`
` ...There had been so many places to stand upon.`
`However, now, ...holes had been dug everywhere, and nearly everything outside the mansion was completely gone.`
`Some goats were clutching to the few remaining footholds and pillars, still eating away at them.`
`"...Let it be known that exposing the truth is murder."`
`"Why can't humans live without killing, I WONDER?`
` ...Throughout their long history, so many have prayed for miracles,`
` ...but in the end, they eat up their own chances at receiving them, eating up the very ground they stand on and falling into the ABYSS..."`
`They saw a goat chewing the same pillar that was holding it up,`
` ...which, unsurprisingly, fell into empty blackness along with the goat...`
`"Humans are...sad creatures, fated to live in order to learn."`
`"............"`
`"...If learning means eating away at the same hopes and dreams that keep you alive,`
` ...that would mean humans are born just so they can die.`
` ...We're taught that we have to live.`
` However, almost everything that we accomplish in life ends up killing us..."`
`"......Don't think about it.`
` You'll just get a headache."`
`"As a single human, I want to ask.`
` ...Is learning a sin?!`
` Is living in ignorance the only way we can have hopes and dreams...?!"`
`"...Both living with knowledge and living in ignorance have their benefits, as well as their shortcomings.`
` You're even free to choose which path you take.`
` ......That's what makes Humans powerless."`
`"While people can learn, they cannot 'unlearn'..."`
`"And so, the all-knowing god has stepped in for the sake of Humans who cannot unlearn,`
` marking out things that should be learned and things that should not be learned."`
`"...Too much curiosity...can kill...your hopes and dreams."`
`"Humans are pitiable beings, who are unable to simply avoid those things which should not be LEARNED.`
` ...Lord BATTLER can hardly be blamed for failing to teach Ange THIS."`
`"...And now Ange's gone.`
` ...This game...is over."`
`Struck dumb by Will's words, everyone fell silent.`
`Only the sound of the goats eating everything away rang out hollowly...`
`Even if they escaped to the Golden Land, the goats of emptiness would probably chew into that realm as well.`
`Even if they got away for the time being, nothing would be resolved.`
`It was all set in stone now.`
`They had no way to resist the future's violent attempts to tear the cat box of the past open.`
`"In that case, ...we must stay alive."`
`"............"`
`"If a human's foolishness makes them throw away their own hopes and dreams in the end,`
` ...then I want to believe in those things until the last second."`
`"......Your resolve is impressive."`
`"I'm the one hope held by Beatrices of a million worlds.`
` ...So, even at times like this, I have to be everyone's hope.`
` I'm not giving up on this game yet."`
`"...By which you MEAN?"`
`"I'll keep waiting, believing in a miracle until the last second."`
`"So, you'll keep struggling on and on until it's all over?"`
`"That's right.`
` After all, last time, when we were surrounded by that pack of terrifying cats, we were prepared for death, weren't we...?!`
` But Lambdadelta-san saved us...!`
` If we had given up, if we hadn't had the strength to believe in a miracle, then I'm sure we would've been erased before help could come."`
`"Well, it's not like I really saved you. More like Bern just failed to kill you properly.`
` Or, it might've been some whim of hers.`
` A miraculous whim from the Witch of Miracles.`
` *giggle*giggle*..."`
`How long had she been there?`
`Lambdadelta was leaning on the handrail of the staircase, eating popcorn.`
`"...Battler-kun told us.`
` ...He said Ange-chan made a contract, by which she would learn the truth in exchange for her own life."`
`"Going by your conversation just now, that was no contract.`
` ...After all, living and seeking the truth so they can die is what humans do anyway, right?`
` In other words, Ange has spent all of her life trying to learn the truth.`
` ...All Bern did was shorten that time to a single instant."`
`"...When Ange-chan lost her hopes and dreams, she stopped valuing her own life.`
` ...How can she be given hopes and dreams again?`
` ...What can be done to help her find a reason for living?"`
`"...Are you asking me?`
` I'm paper, right?`
` Double-twisted, curly super-paper.`
` I don't understand complicated stuff."`
`After tossing the last bits of popcorn into her mouth, Lambdadelta threw the empty cup into the abyss of nothingness...`
`"...Bern wasn't really pushing that kid to do something she didn't want.`
` She was giving Ange a chance.`
` Or should I call it a choice?`
` Then, Ange made the choice she wanted, appeared on the game board, ...and now, in her game against Battler, she's making her own choices again.`
` ...From start to finish, Ange's game has always belonged to Ange.`
` Right now, I'm just a casual observer."`
`"...So, not a particularly enthusiastic observer."`
`"Maybe.`
` It's a play with an obvious ending.`
` ...So, I've decided I might as well take my leave."`
`"...You mean you'll stop watching a play just because you think you know how it will end?`
` Even though it might reach a climax you didn't expect?"`
`"............"`
`Lambdadelta licked her salty fingers.`
`Then, she stared at Lion challengingly and grinned.`
`"I know...that Ange's game won't end this way.`
` ...I know Battler-kun's feelings will reach her.`
` ...She'll understand that he wants her to live in a better future, ...and she'll choose that future of her own accord.`
` ...I'm certain that's how this tale will end."`
`"...Huh...?`
` Are you talking to me, the Witch of Certainty, and saying that the outcome is certain...?"`
`"That's right.`
` I guarantee it.`
` ...Ange-chan's game won't end like this.`
` So please, don't leave your seat.`
` We won't leave either.`
` There must be something we can do.`
` And...that will surely lead her to a better future.`
` ...This tale will definitely have a happy ending.`
` So keep watching until the end.`
` I beg you."`
`"......`
`...Even though I've already announced as the Witch of Certainty that this tale won't have a happy ending...?"`
`"The definition of a happy ending is something everyone watching gets to decide for themselves, right?"`
`For a while, there was a tense silence.`
`With a confident gaze that seemed to be saying 'Are you serious?', Lambdadelta stared at Lion.`
`However, Lion's eyes didn't even twitch.`
`For some time, they both stared into the other's eyes without flinching...`
`"......Haah...!"`
`Suddenly, Lambdadelta let out a large sigh and stretched.`
`"Well, I have nowhere better to be.`
` ...Sure, I'll stick around a bit longer.`
` If you get me some more popcorn, that is.`
` I'm feeling like caramel flavor this time."`
`"If you come to the Golden Land, we'll serve you as much as you like."`
`Lambdadelta waved at them with a thin smile.`
`No one was quite sure what this meant, but it apparently signified her surrender in her own way.`
`"Okay.`
` If you'll guarantee your own flavor of happy ending with certainty,`
` ...then I, the great Lambdadelta, will stick around for a while longer.`
` See how big my heart is?!`
` As wide as Lake Biwa!"`
`"...That's pretty thin, actually."`
`"And as gentle as the Sea of Japan!"`
`"That is a very rough SEA."`
`"...Please, allow us to speak."`
`"It would seem she meant it the other way around."`
`There was some muffled laughter.`
`Lambdadelta is the witch who gives strength to those who possess unshakable willpower.`
`Lion believed in a happy ending, and that certain enthusiasm might have been enough to earn a small miracle from Lambda.`
`"You'd better not let me get bored, okay?`
` If you do, I'll leave right away."`
`"Of course.`
` I'm sure Battler-kun will be glad to welcome you as well."`
`Lion understood.`
`In order to fight back against Bernkastel, who had taken Ange outside the board, `
`they would need the power of another who was capable of leaving the board.`
`Their last hope was to make sure Lambdadelta didn't abandon this game.`
`However, judging by Lambdadelta's expression as she hummed to herself cheerily,`
` actually asking her for help was probably going to be a problem...`
`"Look, Zepar!`
` Everything from the first floor down is gone!"`
`"What a spectacle!`
` Not a sight you see every day!"`
`"...How have matters progressed UPSTAIRS?"`
`"Ah, right, we came here to tell you that!"`
`"Hey, everyone, sorry to keep you waiting!"`
`""They say the door to the Golden Land has opened...!!""`
`"...Finally."`
`"Let us GO.`
` This place will not be safe for LONG."`
`Everyone who had been sitting on the staircase got up.`
`"I guess this is goodbye, Rokkenjima the beautiful."`
`"...True.`
` ...It may be a shadow of its former self, but this is the last time we'll see it, isn't it?"`
`"Heheheh, what's with that gloomy attitude?`
` C'mon, show me, okay?!`
` Let's see a happy ending!"`
`The Book of the Single Truth was sealed in crystal by Battler.`
`Until this seal is undone, I can't even stick the key in the keyhole.`
`"...You can remove this, `
`right?"`
`"Of course."`
`They were in a vast, dimly-lit space.`
`To sum it up in a phrase, ...it was like a trench in the ocean floor.`
`No, that's not quite right.`
`It was...a library.`
`However, the number of books and the height of the shelves vastly surpassed all of those that existed in the world of humans.`
`If height is the measure of greatness,`
` ...then the gods must surely be giants taller than mountains.`
`This place appeared to be a library big enough and grand enough for such gods.`
`Each individual book was no larger than those from the human world.`
`However, the shelves holding them stood like the walls of a valley...or rather a deep-sea ocean trench.`
`So, ...Ange and the others looked like little more than a few small butterflies who had wandered into this vast library.`
`...Like miniscule deep-sea fish swimming about all alone in an ocean pit.`
`"This is more like ice than a seal.`
` ...If you just steal it away from Battler and put it under the rays of the sun, it will fade away by itself as time passes."`
`"Isn't there some way to just smash it open?"`
`"...Do you thaw your frozen fish by smashing it with a hammer?"`
`"Sorry, I was always terrible in cooking class."`
`"...Kitties,`
` thaw this seal."`
`When Bernkastel whispered, from the dark ocean pit deep below them, `
`...several emerald green glints appeared and gathered like a school of fish.`
`Bernkastel threw the Book of the Single Truth down to them, `
`and only after several seconds passed, the school of fish seemed to gather around it and carry it away.`
`Those few seconds made it clear just how deep this bookshelf trench went.`
`Ange was once again dumbfounded by this unimaginably vast and godly library...`
`"We can just let them handle the rest."`
`"...And you really will let me see what's inside?"`
`"If that is your wish, I'll grant it.`
` And, of course, I won't be able to read it myself without that key of yours."`
`Ange silently gripped the golden key in her pocket...`
`This journey has been so long...and so strange.`
`In search of the truth from 12 years ago, I left my home, ...met President Okonogi, met Amakusa...`
`...And, at some point, that adventure became wrapped in the Illusion of the Witch.`
`However, here I am.`
`Ushiromiya Eva's diary is here.`
`The truth inside it is sitting right before me.`
`"Rest for a while.`
` ...Even I don't have enough free time to spend it all with you."`
`"...Well, I'm not really tired."`
`"Erika,`
` ...serve Ange some tea or something."`
`"Yes, my master!"`
`Erika popped into existence out of nowhere and bowed to her master.`
`"......Bernkastel,`
` if you're planning to use me to steal both the key and the book, ...you won't get off easy."`
`"H-How dare you say such a thing to my master?!"`
`"Sorry.`
` After my long experience with witches, I've decided not to trust normal words."`
`"...Very well.`
` I'll promise it with the red truth.`
` ...`
`#ff0000When the seal on the Book of the Single Truth is dissolved, you, Ange, will be the first to read it.#ffffff`
` ...Is that good enough for you?"`
`For some time, Ange considered the witch's words, searching for some sort of trap hidden within them...`
`There's no guarantee greater than a witch's red truth.`
` Ange understood this well enough.`
`If she started to doubt even this red truth, ...there would be nothing left to trust in this entire world.`
`If she began to suspect even this, ...then even the truth would no longer be truth.`
`"...Is there something more you want?"`
`"Nn...`
` ...No, I'm fine."`
`If she wanted to read the Book of the Single Truth, she would need Bernkastel's assistance.`
`Ange finally realized that she had nothing to gain by complaining more and annoying this witch further...`
`"...Once you've dissolved the barrier, call me right away."`
`"Of course.`
` I also want to read it as soon as possible.`
` I'll call for you at once."`
`Bern spun away from them, then vanished into the dark bookshelf trench.`
`Ange saw a school of emerald green fish appear and follow behind Bernkastel.`
` ...Could those be her familiars?`
`As she stared at the emerald lights that resembled some sort of deep-sea fish, Ange was poked from behind.`
`"Let's go, `
`comrade Ange."`
`"...You're creeping me out, so please just call me Ange."`
`"Then you can call me Erika-sama."`
`"...Let's get going, comrade Erika."`
`The pair began to swim in the direction Erika indicated.`
`'Swim' seemed a better word for it than 'fly'.`
`"...Just what is this place?`
` It's way too big to be called a library."`
`"It's not like you'll be able to remember its name, so why not just call it the Library?"`
`"I'll decide what I can or can't remember. Tell me."`
`"It's 'the Great Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating's Noble City of Carefully Selected Books'."`
`"...Yeah, the Library works fine."`
`"Knew you'd say that."`
`The City of Books.`
`Yeah, the name fits.`
`The bookshelves on either side of this canyon are skyscrapers.`
`If I think of those emerald green lights flowing beneath us as headlights on a highway, `
`then this really does seem like a city of books.`
`"These aren't normal books, are they?"`
`"That's right.`
` Each volume is packed with an ensemble play.`
` ...They look like books from here, but if you open one up, you'll find a whole world inside."`
`"...So, even our long tale is only one of these."`
`"Great witches who live on a far, far higher plane than we do are hardly any different from a Creator, or God.`
` ...From their perspective, our little tale is worth little more than a single book, if it's even worth that."`
`From a theatergoer's perspective, our individual lives are hardly worth anything at all.`
`If they're recording an entire world in a single volume, ...then my life probably isn't even worth a single line.`
`"But we're the main characters.`
` ...I am, and so are you."`
`"That's right.`
` Even if the tale of the gods doesn't mention us,`
` ...we're always the main characters in the stories we write for ourselves.`
` ......Becoming aware of that fact is the first thing that separates witches from Humans."`
`They were on a balcony, which was really a room-sized section that had been dug out of the bookshelf, with no guardrail along the cliff.`
`It didn't go in very deep, so it looked like a room that had been cut in half.`
`It was filled with the tools of everyday life, as though this was Erika's hidden house.`
`"My master has ordered me to serve you some tea,`
` so if you don't feel like drinking, I'll have to pour it into you with a funnel."`
`"...If you try, I'll have to serve you some matcha."`
`"Matcha?"`
`"...Nothing. Just talking to myself."`
`Ignoring Erika as she made tea, ...Ange looked down upon the bizarre, otherworldly scene below.`
`Until Erika finished getting the tea ready, the scene held Ange's gaze like it was sucking out her soul...`
`"This might sound strange, coming from me."`
`"...What?"`
`"You actually made a deal to throw away your life to learn the truth, huh?`
` That's impressive."`
`"...I had nothing to gain from life.`
` It was easy for me to trade away the time I had left."`
`"My master really does take to idle whims.`
` To think she would make a contract for the meaningless life of a powerless girl."`
`"......Heh."`
`Ange chuckled, not bothering to argue.`
`That was exactly right.`
`How incredible that Bernkastel would lend her power to a worthless life that was trying to throw itself away.`
`"Well, my master is the witch who controls miracles.`
` ...So, it makes sense that she'd appear even for a worthless girl like you."`
`"Good point.`
` ...Even if Bernkastel hadn't appeared, I still would've taken that step off the edge that day."`
`"...You really are a cheap and easy woman, aren't you?"`
`"Well then, just how much are you worth?"`
`"Me?!`
` Hahaha, ahahahahahahahahahaha..."`
`The way Erika cackled was disturbing.`
`Still, Ange realized that this was her way of answering the question.`
`People don't become witches of their own choosing.`
`If they're capable of living, all people want to live their lives as Humans.`
`...When something comes along to trip up that life, ...that's when the road to living as a witch opens.`
`Even Furudo Erika, who calls herself the Witch of Truth, must be like this.`
`The two Witches of Truth, sitting here drinking tea without even looking at each other, ...are exactly the same.`
`"I...like exposing the truth."`
`"I know that."`
`"I like exposing secrets, then watching those people turn pale as they wonder how I figured it out.`
` ...That's when I know I've reached the truth, and it's a moment of ecstasy."`
`"There's something seriously wrong with you."`
`"Well then, what does the truth mean to you?"`
`"............"`
`Ange was about to give an immediate answer, but she bit back her words.`
`Then, she gulped, not knowing how to respond.`
`After all, to Ange, the truth itself was the goal.`
`At first, it was out of hatred.`
`Could Ushiromiya Eva, the sole survivor of Rokkenjima, be the culprit behind everything?`
`She hated Eva, but she had no proof that her aunt was the culprit, `
`and of course, Eva never talked about what happened on that island.`
`...So, at first, 'the truth' meant proof that Eva was the culprit, in Ange's eyes.`
`However, that feeling withered away with Eva's death.`
`Now that Eva was dead, even if Ange did find some kind of proof, ...it wouldn't mean anything.`
`So, eventually, the truth Ange wanted to find...became nothing more than the simple desire to know what happened on that island that day.`
`However, one thing was obvious.`
`Even if she did find out the truth, ...that wouldn't bring any of her family back to her.`
`"...It might not mean anything at all."`
`"You're going to expose the truth your beloved Onii-chan is hiding, even though it's meaningless?`
` You're the one who's not making sense."`
`Erika laughed mockingly.`
`Ange laughed too, as though she agreed.`
`"And so,`
` my own truth became my goal.`
` ...Maybe you could even call it my reason for living."`
`"So, once you do reach the truth, there won't be any point or purpose to you living anymore, right?"`
`"That's right.`
` So, I'll die.`
` ...Hasn't it been long enough?`
` I've already lived 12 years too long.`
` Don't I at least deserve to have a witch appear and grant my wish in my final moments?"`
`"...Or, to put it simply, you're just tired of life.`
` Does that sum it up?"`
`"Yeah.`
` So, both my reason for living and my very existence...are completely meaningless.`
` ...That's why this goal of finding the Book of the Single Truth has put a little sparkle back into my life, now that it's nearly over.`
` ...At least on that score, I'm grateful to Bernkastel."`
`"I see.`
` ...Battler wants you to live, so he hid the goal line that would lead you to death.`
` ...I think I pity Battler-san for the first time.`
` After all, you can't choose your little sister."`
`"............"`
`Sorry, Onii-chan.`
`I'm...tired of life.`
`For 12 whole years...`
`I've been living off nothing but the illusion that someone might come home someday.`
`Just let me find peace already.`
`Finding the truth of that day...`
`is how I've chosen to mark the end of my life.`
`For 12 years, I've believed in a miracle, but there was no miracle...`
`I won't...believe in miracles anymore...`
`"...The Book of the Single Truth, huh?`
` Of course, I'm also dying to find out what's in it,`
` but from what I hear, it doesn't sound like the truth inside is something spectacular enough to mark the end of your life with."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...At first, I hoped there would be something earth-shattering in it.`
` But now, ...I've calmed down, I guess you could say."`
`"Any truth searched for by a worthless person is bound to be worthless.`
` It'll probably make for a fitting end to your worthless life."`
`"...Yeah.`
` I'm...sure it will."`
`Ange was already starting to realize something.`
`Regardless of Eva's reason for staying silent...`
`......The real events of that day...probably weren't anything earth-shattering.`
`Some sort of malfunction made the bomb in that secret underground base explode.`
`Yes.`
` ...It was just...an accident.`
`But, ...the public already believed that some sort of conspiracy surrounded the events of that day, so that's what they expected.`
`Eva was a suspect herself, so of course no one would believe her claim that nothing strange happened.`
`...Naturally, Ange didn't believe her either.`
`In that case, ...shutting up like a clam would be better than the alternative.`
`It was hardly surprising...that Eva chose to say nothing.`
`"...Right now, I don't feel any sense of accomplishment.`
` ...I just feel...sort of worn out and listless."`
`"Being able to withstand the truth is what makes someone a Witch of Truth.`
` ...Comrade Ange,`
` it looks like you don't possess that strength after all.`
` If you did, you wouldn't be thinking about dying."`
`"......`
`...You're right.`
` ...I've dreamed that someone might come back for 12 years.`
` ...I've just used Beatrice's cat box to shut away the truth, denying it for all that time."`
`"...When you read the Book of the Single Truth,`
` I wonder what'll happen to you."`
`"Who knows.`
` ...Won't Bernkastel carry out the contract by slicing my head off with a scythe or something?`
` Or will I be turned into chunks of meat again?`
` ...Maybe I'll get some salt and pepper this time."`
`"......`
`...I see, so that's where the chunks of meat thing came from."`
`"Did you say something?"`
`"Nope, nothing at all.`
` Anyway, would you like some more tea?"`
`"<No, thank you.>"`
`Ange listlessly gazed down from the balcony with no handrail,`
` ...down into the darkness of the abyss at the bottom of the bookshelf ravine...`
`no, the gap between the bookshelf skyscrapers.`
`...From the beginning until the end of my journey, I haven't taken a single step away from this spot.`
`This journey of mine, not even a single step long, ...will end soon...`
`"...Um, what are those lines of lights flowing around at the bottom?"`
`"Oh, those?`
` Probably a group of guests coming to the Great Lady Aurora's party."`
`"Guests...?"`
`"Great Witches from the Senate, Voyager witches who are trying to escape boredom in their endless travels,`
` powerful witches who have woken from century-long sleeps, as well as witches who control the future world and noble witch hunters.`
` It seems she's planning to hold a grand party tonight."`
`"...What, is it a birthday party or something?"`
`"From what I've heard, while the Great Lady Beatrice, the Endless Witch, is an outsider among witches,`
` she's also the genius who created 'Beatrice's cat box' out of her formidable magical compendium, an endless factory capable of producing endless tales.`
` ...From my point of view, she's just stupid and a weak finisher, but in the world of great witches, she's apparently pretty famous."`
`"So this is Beatrice's birthday party?"`
`"My master says she'll be holding a dinner party with Beatrice's guts.`
` ...After all, it's only natural, right?`
` The cat box was only able to generate infinite tales because there was no Single Truth.`
` ...However, tonight...`
`the Single Truth will be revealed, thanks to your key.`
` And that means the cat box will be opened.`
` Really, it's no different from slicing open her chest as she still lives and tearing out what's inside."`
`"...Everyone in that huge crowd that looks like a packed freeway is going to one dinner party?`
` ...I'm not sure what's stronger, my shock at how famous Beatrice is, or my revulsion at those sleazebags."`
`"For you, the Book of the Single Truth is nothing more than an end.`
` ......However, for all of those enjoying the mystery of Rokkenjima, this is an event that can't be missed."`
`"I see.`
` ......So, that's a crowd of those goats who were chewing Onii-chan's game board apart."`
`Ange's analogy was an accurate one.`
`The crowd far, far below them...was made up of nobles wearing beautiful outfits and goat masks.`
`They were all so intent on tearing the guts out of Beatrice's cat box that they couldn't even hide the drool trickling from their mouths.`
`Those gluttonous goat nobles, who derived pleasure from the violene of exposing the truth, were in a line of cars heading towards the meeting place.`
`"...Looks like this is the end for Beatrice and the cat box."`
`"...Beato and the others have holed up in the Golden Land, the last remnants of the game board.`
` Battler and Beato have strengthened their defenses and have destroyed the first wave, but they won't be able to stop the second.`
` ...My master has given me an armada capable of destroying the very concept of defensive measures.`
` The Golden Land's ramparts are as good as gone."`
`"......Those goats who appeared all over the island... They're the personification of random opinions in the future, and all of them want this island's tale to be a tragedy."`
`"That's right.`
` Those goats keep getting born from the sea of the internet.`
` That first wave was just the riffraff.`
` The second wave will be entirely different.`
` It's made up of the best of the best, elite goats selected from the crowd that are capable of denying all the cowering pieces one by one.`
` In total, they number in the hundreds of thousands.`
` ...A hundred thousand people to deny the existence of a few dozen hiding on an island."`
`"...Looks like...this is it for Onii-chan too."`
`"Are you sure you're ready?`
` You understand that Ushiromiya Battler died in 1986, ...and that this man is an illusion created by the cat box?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` ...I understand."`
`Regardless of whether he's my real brother or an illusion...`
` Regardless of whether he's who I'd like him to be or not...`
` The Battler who created this game board for my sake...will die.`
`No, I'm just going to accept the fact that he already was dead, so it's not like he's actually going to die......`
`Ange thought to herself.`
`Shouldn't performing her brother's last rites...be her responsibility?`
`This was her final trial, which she had assigned to herself.`
`All of those people down on the game board...were the personification of Ange's naivety.`
`By denying the existence of all of them, wouldn't she finally be able to accept the truth?`
`.........`
`No, that's not right.`
` ...I'm not being honest, even with myself.`
`That bizarre Halloween party may have been an illusion, ...but that didn't make it any less heartwarming.`
`...Onii-chan said it himself.`
`True, that Halloween party may have been an illusion.`
`However.`
`He was trying to use that party to tell me something...`
`.........`
`"About that second wave..."`
`"My master has appointed me to be their commander.`
` ...Leave it to me, Ange-san.`
` My master isn't so malicious that she'd make you dirty your own hands."`
`"............"`
`Yes, that might be kind of her.`
`...These are...my lingering attachments we're talking about.`
`I should be grateful to Bernkastel.`
`If she really were cruel,`
` she would probably have ordered me to take charge of the second wave and execute my own family.`
`"Comrade Ange,`
` you're a Witch of Truth, aren't you?"`
`"......`
`...That's right.`
` ...Probably."`
`"Then accept the truth, okay?`
` Finally, after 12 years, the Single Truth lies before you."`
`"......`
`...I'll just sit around here until Bernkastel breaks the seal."`
`"You'll probably be summoned as a guest for the party.`
` ...We've got a mirror, so maybe you should wipe the sleep from your eyes."`
`"And maybe you should shave before heading out to battle."`
`It floated there in the empty air.`
`...The door to the Golden Land.`
`At its base, there was nothing except some floor tiling about as thick as a rug, so it was fairly hard to imagine that this was Kinzo's study.`
`...By this point, all of the game board except the Golden Land had been eaten away, leaving only this door floating in a sea of nothingness...`
`There were two shapes in front of that door.`
`They were Battler...and Beato.`
`They may not have been literally covered with wounds, but they definitely seemed to be dead tired.`
`Battler, leaning against the door, seemed to have finally caught his breath.`
`Beato was also sitting against the door, letting her legs dangle gracelessly.`
`Could the battle against that force really be called a battle?`
`It was more like a mere pushing contest on the increasingly small bit of ground that remained.`
`...They had wanted to protect at least Kinzo's study no matter what.`
`And, the only fruit of their desperate struggle was the thin bit of flooring that they were sitting on now.`
`Those goats fell into the abyss whenever they had nowhere to stand.`
`So now, with so much of the floor gone, there was no way for them to attack anymore.`
`If Battler thought this, his naive hopes were quickly crushed.`
`"...Looks like we're surrounded."`
`"They probably plan to gather their forces and crush us in a single stroke..."`
`Stretching across the ocean horizon that surrounded the door at their backs...`
`...was an encirclement of countless large sailing ships.`
`As they could clearly see, the decks of those ships were packed with goats,`
` with some of the more foolish and overeager ones spilling over the edges into the emptiness below.`
`"Dang...`
` I've gone through a lot of crazy stuff in your games,`
` ...but being surrounded by pirate ships is definitely a first for me."`
`"...They probably do possess the strength to break through the Golden Land's perimeter.`
` Those cannons are no bluff.`
` Doubtless, they will be able to use those to smash through this door and pour in."`
`Along the sides of each ship were several open gun ports, each with a cannon pointing at the door.`
`If this many ships all around them fired all of those at once...`
`...There was no point trying to imagine what would happen next.`
`Battler and Beato grimaced and hung their heads.`
`"...How long will the Golden Land perimeter hold out against those cannons?"`
`"I do not know.`
` ...However, since they are still awaiting reinforcements after amassing that many soldiers, ...I doubt the barrier will break that easily."`
`"True.`
` I can't think of any other reason to delay your attack without even sending terms for surrender..."`
`"I hope we can take advantage of this time they give us."`
`"...Time is always the ally of the weaker side.`
` After all, we can always hope for a miracle."`
`"Though it might just lead us further into despair."`
`At that moment, something small and hard hit Battler in the forehead.`
`"...Ow!`
` The heck is this? Konpeitou...?!"`
`"It's me!`
` I know where Bern and the others are!"`
`The candy was Lambdadelta's transformed body.`
`She was the only one of their allies capable of crossing the sea of Fragments.`
`"Spectacular!`
` That's the Great Lady Lambdadelta for you!"`
`"They can see us here.`
` Let's talk inside.`
` ...This is starting to get messy."`
`"Got it.`
` ...Is anyone there?!"`
`When Battler knocked on the door, it opened, and Shannon and Kanon came into view.`
`"You called for us?"`
`"My apologies, but we need you two to keep a lookout."`
`"Leave it to us."`
`"...When they begin their attack, don't worry about fighting them.`
` Escape to the Golden Land as soon as they start.`
` Don't worry about closing the door."`
`"But that means..."`
`"They're planning to ignore the door and smash the Golden Land directly.`
` Making a last stand here won't do anyone any good."`
`"...I understand."`
`"We'll take care of things here, so go inside and work on a counterattack."`
`"We shall.`
` We're counting on you."`
`Battler and Beato traded places with Shannon and Kanon and returned to the Golden Land.`
`A gentle rain poured down over the Golden Land's rose garden.`
`...The weather here reflected the hearts of those inside it.`
`The quietly falling raindrops spoke for the pain felt by those who could do nothing but hide here, waiting for the enemy's final assault...`
`When they returned to the arbor, that piece of konpeitou flew out of Battler's pocket, `
`jumped onto the table, and returned to its original form.`
`"I haven't had a thrill like this for years!`
` Hard to believe I'd find myself in such a tense situation, even after becoming a witch."`
`"Let's get down to business...!`
` Where the heck are Ange and Bernkastel...?!"`
`"They're in the City of Books."`
`"...I've heard of it.`
` ...They say it's a place where great witches--travelers of the sea--store countless Fragments in the form of books."`
`"You mean the Great Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating's Noble City of Carefully Selected Books, yes?"`
`"The Great Lady Aurora is the ruler of the City of Books.`
` Indeed, that would be a fitting place for those two to go."`
`"Nice going, Lady Lambdadelta.`
` ...Hard to believe you could pick out that spot so quickly from all the other possible hiding places."`
`"Actually, it was pretty easy.`
` ...I didn't even have to search, since they're advertising it as loud as they can.`
` They're planning a huge party to celebrate the announcement of a great secret. The secret to the cat box of the Great Lady Beatrice, the Endless Witch."`
`"......Hmph.`
` I see, they haven't been delaying their attack because they await reinforcements, but because the party has not yet begun."`
`"So, in this party, they plan to use Ange's key and reveal the contents of the Book of the Single Truth?"`
`"You've got it.`
` Aurora hasn't held an event like this for ages, and she's gathering VIP guests from all over the place.`
` ...The Book of the Single Truth will probably be the party's final showpiece."`
`"...That means we still have a shot at taking Ange and the key back."`
`"Time-wise, that may be true.`
` However, there's a really simple and obvious problem."`
`"What?"`
`"The City of Books is a sacred realm under the supervision of the Senate.`
` It's protected by a holy barrier.`
` Only a witch of the Senate can enter it."`
`"...Have they invited any non-Senators to the party?"`
`"They have.`
` It looks like they're being given special 'invitations', which allow them to enter the sacred realm for a limited time.`
`"...Invitations."`
`"My, my, ...now this could be interesting."`
`"That's what I thought...!`
` However, there's a strict policy on punctuality, so these invitations automatically become useless unless you present them before the party begins!`
` And, I'm afraid to say...that the party started a short while ago."`
`"In other words, it's too late to try stealing an invitation from a guest who's running late."`
`"That's right.`
` ...So, what do we do now?!`
` Could someone get me popcorn?`
` I'd like some candy flavor this time!"`
`"As an outsider, I hate to barge into this conversation, ...but we seem to have no options left."`
`"...We're already done for, aren't we..."`
`"Can't we do anything except sit here until they attack?!`
` There must be something we can do...!"`
`"That's right.`
` ...There is just one thing we can do."`
`"...What's that?"`
`"We can keep on strugglin' for each second of survival...and hope for a miracle."`
`"A miracle...?!"`
`"So, we're stuck defending the Alamo."`
`"Surrender isn't an option.`
` ...We can only hold out as long as we can, waiting for a miracle."`
`"...Uryu-.`
` What kind of miracle?"`
`"There is a chance, maybe one in a million,`
` ...that Ange will change her mind for some reason and come back."`
`"...Hmph.`
` With a probability such as that, it truly would be a miracle."`
`"We are here to await Ange-san's return."`
`"Yes.`
` ...This right here is the only place Ange-san can call home.`
` So, we must defend it to the last minute, waiting for her to come back."`
`"Awaiting the return of one's master is a servant's duty...!`
` N-N-N-Now that we are here, I, Gohda, am prepared for whatever may come...!"`
`"......Battler-sama,`
` all of us are prepared."`
`"We of the Chiester Sisters Imperial Guard will fulfill our oath and remain by the Great Lady Beatrice's side until the bitter end!"`
`"45 here, no problems!`
` I will fight until the end."`
`"...Finally, a fitting place to die nyeh.`
` ...No problems from 410 nyeh."`
`"The Seven Sisters of Purgatory will stay with Beatrice-sama and Battler-sama until it's all over!!"`
`The six younger sisters also showed their resolve with their eyes.`
`"Eiserne Jungfrau `
`will serve until the END."`
`"The former SSVD's got your back too."`
`"...And I ask that you lend us your power as well."`
`"Me?!`
` No way.`
` Didn't I just give you some excellent intel?`
` I think I've done more than my fair share, don't you?"`
`"How do you know that Ange-chan is in the City of Books?"`
`"I saw her with my own eyes, of course.`
` I never trust anything unless I see it for myself."`
`"Which means you're qualified to enter this sacred realm called the City of Books, right?"`
`"......Indeed.`
` The Great Lady Lambdadelta is a witch of the Senate, after all."`
`"Lambdadelta..."`
`"...What's with you guys?`
` ...You aren't gonna tell me to do more work, are you...?"`
`"My, what an unexpected development...!"`
`"Lady Lambdadelta is the only one who can enter the City of Books!"`
`"Could that possibly mean..."`
`""That this is Lady Lambdadelta's time to shine?!!""`
`"Enough kidding around! Are you people crazy?`
` ...You're telling me to go, all by myself,`
` and sneak into there one more time,`
` and then bring Ange back out here?!"`
`The several dozen people surrounding Lambdadelta all nodded in unison.`
`"How stupid can you be?!`
` If I save Ange, I'll be crashing the great Aurora's party, get it?!`
` I'd have the whole world as my enemy!`
` And what's in it for me?! Nothing, obviously!`
` There's nothing you could possibly offer me `
`that'd be worth getting on the bad side of Aurora and her monster friends...!"`
`"You'll get to see a happy ending, where Aurora and Bernkastel's schemes are crushed, `
`Ange comes back, and everyone makes peace with one another."`
`"...What do you say, Lady Lambdadelta?`
` There could be no greater thrill.`
` ...If you pulled off such a marvelous feat, you would be able to forget your illness for a thousand years, would you not?"`
`"We're begging you, Lambdadelta...!!`
` Lend us your power!!"`
`Please, please, we're begging you!`
` Help us save Ange...!`
`Everyone surrounded Lambdadelta, asking for her help.`
`"Please, Lady Lambdadelta...!!`
` Only you can do this...!!"`
`"Give us your strength!!`
` I'll show you the greatest of tales!!`
` And you'll get to see it from the front row!!`
` So please, lend us your strength!!"`
`"Shut uuuuuuuuuuuup!!`
` Shut the hell uuuuuuuuuuuuuup!!!"`
`Lambdadelta leapt to her feet and crushed the cup of popcorn in her hands.`
`Sweet, candy-flavored popcorn flew all over the place, hitting everyone in the face.`
`It might have looked funny.`
`...However, no one laughed.`
`Lambdadelta's face was filled with a rage that none of them had seen before.`
`"Please, stop getting the wrong idea!`
` I'm a spectator, ...a spectator!!`
` I'm just a guest who was invited by Beato to come and watch this game!`
` So why should I risk my life for you people?!`
` You think you'll get a happy ending if Ange comes back?!`
` Are you really that stupid?!`
` Bern and her forces will come sweeping through here, mad with rage, and wipe us all out!"`
`"There's only one reason I'm here, `
`and that's because Lion over there said I'd get to see an interesting show!!"`
`"Yeah, and now I'm sure I'll get to see a sublimely interesting tale very soon...!`
` A sad, sad tragedy as you fight desperately against Bern's forces and get wiped out one by one!`
` Oh, I'm sure you'll each get one last time to shine as you're torn apart!"`
`"If I just wait a little, I'll get to see all that, won't I?`
` Pretty soon, all of you will be dead!!`
` But not me!`
` I'm a spectator, a guest!!`
` There's absolutely no reason for me to die with you!!!"`
`......No one was able to say a word.`
`In the still silence, where there was no sound except that of the rain, `
`...even Lambdadelta finally hung her head in dismay.`
`"......I'm sorry.`
` I'm totally lame, aren't I?`
` ...Sure, if I stood up right now and said 'Leave it to me', my popularity would surge and I'd probably make it into the top 3 in the next character ranking contest.`
` ......But still,`
` ...unlike the rest of you, ...I'm not 'a character who appears in the story'.`
` ...I can't die.`
` ...It's like it's midnight, and you're telling me that the climax of the show is coming up next.`
` But tomorrow's Monday, and I've got early cleaning duty at school...!`
` We live in completely different worlds...!!`
` And so, ...and so...`
` ......Haaaah......"`
`Lambdadelta staggered as though dizzy, ...then plopped down into a chair.`
`Then, she became expressionless like a doll, just staring at a single point in space, silently...`
`"...Sorry."`
`Battler softly apologized.`
`However, Lambdadelta remained expressionless.`
`"...It's not fair for us to force you to risk something on your own,`
` not when we haven't yet exhausted all our options."`
`"............"`
`"We'll fight here and defend this spot until the last moment.`
` ...We'll believe in the miracle of Ange choosing us over the Single Truth.`
` ...If we weren't prepared to do that, we could hardly ask you to give up your life along with the rest of us."`
`Battler rose from his seat and span around.`
`"...Battler..."`
`"I'll switch places with the pair outside.`
` ...When the enemy comes, I want to be in the front lines.`
` That's the fastest and most direct way I can show Lambdadelta my determination."`
`"............"`
`"I shall go as well.`
` Teacher, please find Lady Lambdadelta some more popcorn."`
`"...Beato..."`
`"I know Ange will return.`
` Without belief, even miracles that might have occurred will not.`
` You can't win a lottery unless you buy a ticket."`
`Beato also stood up and followed Battler.`
`"...Everyone,`
` let's do what we can to prepare for the fight."`
`"Yeah.`
` It'd be stupid to just sit around here doing nothing...!"`
`"Good point.`
` Let's at least give 'em a good show at the end."`
`"......We've got to make sure there's a place Ange-chan can call home."`
`"We should hold a strategic conference TOO."`
`"Yeah.`
` We have furniture, weapons, demons, and inquisitors on our side.`
` There's got to be some way for these mismatched forces to cooperate."`
`"Let's go, little sisters.`
` Break time is over."`
`"Chiester Troops, rise."`
`The Humans and Illusions all rose to their feet and left the arbor.`
`Afterwards, only Lambdadelta remained, still staring blankly at a point in empty space...`
`"That black tea smells nice.`
` Is it instant? Or from a tea bag?"`
`"...Oh, would you like some too, comrade EVA?`
` We're out of cups, so you'll have to use a funnel."`
`A gold butterfly drifted onto the balcony and turned into EVA.`
`"How's Bernkastel doing?`
` Will it be a while longer before she breaks the seal on the Book of the Single Truth...?"`
`"That's what I came to talk about.`
` She says the seal has been broken."`
`"............"`
`"Congratulations. So, the time has finally come.`
` ...The period to mark the end of your life."`
`"Take the key and go to Lady Bernkastel.`
` ...One of her cat familiars will guide you."`
`Two emerald sparkles flew in.`
`They were the green, glinting eyes of a black cat.`
`The cat flicked its tail elegantly, with the dignity of a high-class attendant.`
`"...Got it.`
` Then, I'll be back in a bit."`
`Ange rose from her seat.`
`She did it casually, as though she really was just heading out for a short trip.`
`However, her lips would probably never touch her half-finished cup of tea again...`
`"We weren't together long, but I enjoyed it.`
` Getting to learn what disgust for your own kind is like was an enlightening experience."`
`"Same here.`
` ...Next time we meet, you'll have to teach me the trick to making tea this terrible."`
`"...Are you happy?`
` Now, you'll finally get to learn that secret I've been hiding from you these past 12 years."`
`"I'm happy.`
` ...Yeah, now I can understand how Erika feels.`
` ...It's like I'm taking a shot back at you, exposing the secret that you kept until your death."`
`"And is it a good feeling?"`
`"...Well, it's better than nothing."`
`Ange nodded towards the black cat to let it know that she was ready.`
`The cat nodded back in a refined manner, indicated that it wanted Ange to follow, and leapt from the balcony.`
`Without turning back, Ange followed it, jumping out into the air as though swimming...`
`EVA watched her go.`
`An expression of ridicule and scorn...failed to cross her face...`
`"Good luck, Ange.`
` ......This is the path you've chosen.`
` You aren't six years old anymore.`
` You're 18.`
` ...Choose how to live your own life."`
`"......What an overprotective aunt you are."`
`"I'm going to watch the ceremony.`
` What about you?"`
`"It's almost time to begin the attack, so I'm heading for the ships.`
` ......I've got to go pick up Beato's corpse.`
` Everyone at the party can have her guts,`
` but I get to keep her skin, so let's stuff and mount it."`
`"So, even Rokkenjima's tale, which was wrapped in a veil of mysteries, is about to meet its end."`
`"......Which means it's also the end for you. I mean, you are a piece from there, right?"`
`"A piece is all I am.`
` The role of a piece is to remain faithful to its role until the game ends.`
` ...It's not a piece's place to worry about what happens after the game is over."`
`"True.`
` ...And it's the same for me.`
` ...Let's both enjoy this time while we have it.`
` Well then, allow me to take my leave."`
`"Later. Good luck with your work."`
`After exchanging elegant bows, the two witches vanished at the same time.`
`Nothing remained except some half-finished tea cups and the aroma of the tea itself...`
`One after another, luxury cars stopped in front of a high-class hotel in the city, and guests began to step out of them.`
`"Hey, Professor Ootsuki...!"`
`"Oh, what a surprise!`
` I haven't seen you since the last convention!"`
`All of the guests gathered here were very rich and cultured.`
`A single hobby tied all of them together.`
`They were Witch Hunters.`
`Like-minded people who enjoyed exploring various interpretations of the Rokkenjima mystery.`
`"Still, I wonder if it's really true.`
` To think that this diary of Ushiromiya Eva's actually exists...!"`
`"True, true, I have heard the rumors myself.`
` This is that legendary secret diary, which Ushiromiya Eva hid away just before her death...!`
` It is said that she recorded the details of Rokkenjima's truth in there.`
` Just like that fable of the king with the donkey's ears.`
` Humans are tragic creatures, incapable of keeping truly silent regarding secrets only they could know."`
`"Wahahahahahahahaha.`
` From what I've heard, a collector from Dubai offered to buy it for ten million dollars...!"`
`"Incredible...!`
` More evidence of the fascination that the Rokkenjima mystery is capable of stirring!"`
`Conversations like this were breaking out passionately all over the place.`
`Furthermore, it wasn't just guests who were allowed to enter.`
`The press was also there in force.`
`The Rokkenjima mystery was such a large movement that it became a social phenomenon at one point.`
`Though it had died down slightly in recent years, it was still a topic fiercely debated across the internet.`
`It was hardly any surprise that the discovery and eminent release of Ushiromiya Eva's diary, which contained the truth of that mystery,`
` had caused an uproar.`
`And on top of all that, the mysterious Forger Itouikukuro was to appear publicly for the first time.`
` In fact, it seemed that Itouikukuro and Hachijo Tohya, the up-and-coming mystery novelist, were the same person.`
`Of course, this meant that Hachijo Tohya would also be appearing in public for the first time.`
`Though she was thought to be a male author, the fact that she was actually a mysterious woman author alone was enough to cause a stir.`
`Before the diary unveiling party, a press conference was held in one of the rooms of the hotel.`
`"...Indeed.`
` I am Hachijo Tohya."`
`"Madam Hachijo, we now know that in your previous book signings, you were so determined not to show yourself that you even used a body double,`
` so what has caused you to change your mind and appear before us this time...?!"`
`"The legend of the Rokkenjima witch has given birth to endless tales.`
` ...Considering the weight of such a legend's demise, `
`and being the mere writer that I am, I felt obligated to show myself as a sign of respect."`
`"As a Forger, you announced on the web that you had reached the truth!`
` Does that mean you've already read the contents of that diary?!"`
`"...And, very soon, those contents will be revealed to everyone."`
`"Pardon me for asking,`
` but is there any guarantee that the contents of this diary are the truth?`
` One might view it as nothing more than a personal account from a single deceased person."`
`"Not at all.`
` I guarantee it.`
` #ff0000The truth is recorded in this diary.#ffffff"`
`Oooooohhh.`
` A stir passed through the crowd, and the room was suddenly filled with camera flashes.`
`"This ends Madam Hachijo's interview...!`
` Allow us to express our deep gratitude towards all members of the press for coming on this day!`
` And now, we would like to move on and allow you to take photos of Madam Ushiromiya Eva's diary."`
`A hotel worker pushed forward a cart covered by a veil.`
`Then, after looking to Hachijo for approval, he removed the veil.`
`There lay...Ushiromiya Eva's diary.`
`The Book of the Single Truth sat there, waiting for its seal to be released.`
`Hachijo held it to her chest and laughed enigmatically.`
`Camera flashes came from everywhere, making the Book of the Single Truth glint...`
`"And that is all for now!`
` If you would all please move to the assembly hall...!"`
`Still holding the diary, Hachijo left the press conference room, escorted by men from the hotel.`
`Until she went through a door that said 'Authorized Personnel Only', `
`the journalists continued to surround her and ask questions, hoping to gather just one more comment.`
`When the door slammed shut, ...the world twisted.`
`The hotel employees became black cats wearing capes.`
`Hachijo had turned into Featherine...`
`"Things are getting pretty crazy out there.`
` ...Did you enjoy it?"`
`"...How tiring.`
` ...Still, that went well.`
` And yet, this diary truly is heavy."`
`Featherine tossed the diary, and Bernkastel caught it.`
`"I will rest in one of the waiting rooms."`
`"You're going to be up again pretty soon.`
` There's no time to rest."`
`"...In that case, call it a short break so that I can properly enjoy this long-awaited excitement."`
`"I need to borrow that book.`
` I promised Ange that I'd show her first."`
`"I see.`
` In that case, do as you please."`
`Featherine left, followed by her cat attendants.`
`After watching her until she was out of sight, Bernkastel disappeared as well.`
`Like Erika's room, Bernkastel's was a balcony without a handrail, dug out of a bookshelf cliff.`
`Ange had been kept waiting for some time, but she had waited patiently, looking down at the world below her...`
`"...I'm late, aren't I?`
` Sorry about that."`
`After Bernkastel appeared, the black cats gave a bow and vanished.`
`"Here you go.`
` I've brought it with me.`
` The Book of the Single Truth."`
`"......`
`...Can I touch it...?"`
`"Do as you like."`
`Bernkastel set it on the table and beckoned Ange forward.`
`Slowly, ...Ange approached it.`
`"So, ...this is Aunt Eva's diary..."`
`"That's right.`
` ...Inside it, you'll find the Single Truth that you wanted.`
` ...You do have the key, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` Right here."`
`Ange took the key out, looked at it there on her palm, then gripped it tightly.`
`Even the heavy lock that held the diary so securely...was fated to be swept aside easily as soon as Ange readied herself...`
`"I won't rush you.`
` You don't have to open it until you're ready."`
`"This...includes the truth of what happened at midnight on October 5, 1986, right?"`
`"......Yes.`
` It has everything that you wanted to know so much, you offered up your life."`
`In that instant, two Anges appeared inside of her, taking control of her body at the same time.`
`On the one hand, she knew that she had already paid a great price to learn the truth.`
`This part of her gripped the key, wanting to avoid a second of hesitation that might lead her to refuse to learn the truth now,`
` at the final moment, with the Book of the Single Truth right before her.`
`On the other hand,`
` ...a feeling as though she was betraying the brother and family who watched over her warmly...made her bite her lower lip.`
`However, though she shook, she could do nothing but watch as her right hand slowly brought the key towards the lock.`
`"........."`
`"............"`
`What am I hesitating for...?`
`Inside this diary is the final destination of my sad, painful, 12-year-long journey.`
`Wasn't 12 years enough? Do I want to keep living that way...?`
`That brother is an illusion created by my heart.`
` ...My naive hope that a miracle might still occur.`
`If I put my two options on a scale, then the path I should choose is clear.`
`Slowly, ...I pushed the key into the lock...and twisted...`
`The lock opened with a click, ...and at the same time, it felt as though a crack ran through the key in my hands.`
`Maybe a part of that intricate design had fallen off.`
`I couldn't tell where it was broken just by glancing at it.`
`However, for some reason, its golden glint seemed dulled somehow.`
`"...It's because you've made your choice with that key.`
` A bit of magic has disappeared."`
`"What kind of magic?"`
`"Didn't Battler tell you?`
` He said you couldn't hand that over to anyone else.`
` ...That magic, which 'left the decision to you', has just fulfilled its role and disappeared.`
` That key is just a key now.`
` It can't do anything but lock and unlock that diary."`
`"...I see.`
` Then, I guess I have no more use for Onii-chan's key."`
`"Can I have it?`
` Once you've read the diary, I'll lock it up again.`
` Opening that lock will be a big part of tonight's ceremony, it seems."`
`"...I see.`
` Do whatever you want."`
`I don't give a damn what happens after I find the truth.`
`Bernkastel slid the key from where it lay on the table and put it into her pocket.`
`"Go ahead, then.`
` ...Before the courage that led you here fades."`
`"........."`
`I lifted up Aunt Eva's now unlocked diary.`
`The lock was unset.`
` Even the hinge had been released by now.`
`...Nothing stands in the way of me opening to the pages within...`
`I thought of taking a deep breath.`
`However, I decided against it.`
`...I prepared myself for this long ago.`
`It'd be so stupid to fuel my reluctance further.`
`I opened it.`
` Violently, ruthlessly.`
`I knew...that this was the right way to open to the pages that held the truth.`
`As soon as the cover was opened, ...a brilliant light poured out, and my mind went hazy.`
`The truth was sent to my mind directly, without letters or words...`
`Tell me...what happened that day...on Rokkenjima...`
`My consciousness returned gradually.`
`Nothing was written in the open book before me.`
`Of course.`
` This was...my own blank and empty notebook.`
`I was at school, just sitting idly with my notebook open.`
`The world had stopped.`
`The hands on the clock had stopped too.`
`In that case, the auditorium should have been filled with silence.`
`However, I could hear a small commotion.`
`In this world of suspended time, ...I could see dark shapes sneaking about in the shadows of the unmoving students.`
`They were...students with goat heads.`
`They were sneaking glances at me from behind the frozen students, whispering something to each other.`
`I know.`
` I can hear them.`
`Everybody...everybody knows.`
`One after another, students with goat heads grew out of shadows all over the room.`
`They slipped around all the students stopped in time...and gathered around me.`
`Then, they all jeered out something in unison, and, as if they knew I could hear, showered me with giggles and gossip and sneers.`
`However, nothing that came from the goats' mouths reached my ears as words.`
`This was a world without letters or words, ...so no words reached me.`
`However, their emotions and meanings did reach me.`
`So, I knew what it was they were saying.`
`And then, when I was able to visualize it...`
`One after another, the goats opened their massive jaws, showing their fangs that dripped with saliva,`
` ...and came forward to bite me.`
`Time was stopped for me.`
`I was aware, but I could not move.`
`...That wasn't literally true.`
`However, I was pretending that I couldn't hear, ...so I couldn't move.`
`The goats bit me all over my body, leaving their fang marks, licking me.`
`Maybe they didn't like the taste of my clothes.`
`Taking advantage of the fact that I couldn't move, ...they chewed through my clothes one by one.`
`Over and over again, ...the goats stuck their tongues, their jaws, their fangs into my naked body.`
`I was covered with drool and bitten all over.`
`Bright red teeth marks were left behind as sharp fangs pierced my skin, leaving trails of blood.`
`They licked up that blood like real goats, ...hurting and humiliating me.`
`As I hung my head, one of the goats pulled on my hair, forcing me to look up, and spoke.`
`They didn't say it with concepts, but with words I could hear.`
`However, they weren't words of the human world.`
`They were a witch's words.`
`The red truth, which signifies truth that is certain.`
`『This is...#ff0000the truth of the Rokkenjima incident!!#ffffff〝`
`"......I won't accept it."`
`『It doesn't matter if you accept it or not!!`
` This is the truth!!`
` #ff0000After all, *********, ******************!!`
` *********************************!!!#ffffff〝`
`"...I won't accept it, I won't! ...I won't accept a truth like that...like that..."`
`『#ff0000Whether you accept it or not, that doesn't change the truth!!`
` After all, this is the Single Truth, proven in reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeddd!!#ffffff〝`
`*giggle*giggle* ...Heheheheheheheheh, hahhahahahahahahaha...!!`
`Who cares about the truth?! So stupid, so pointless...!`
`I'm the one who gets to decide if that's the truth or not, right?`
`Even if it's red truth, I won't acknowledge it, won't forgive it, definitely won't accept it...!!`
`"The red truth is absolute?!`
` Who for?!`
` It's absolute for you guys, right?`
` Not for me!!`
` I won't let you contaminate my truth with yours!!"`
`"......Ange, calm down.`
` You're the one who wanted to know, right?"`
`"Hahahaha, ahhahahahahahahaha!!`
` My truth is that Aunt Eva's the culprit!!`
` Aunt Eva killed everyone!!`
` Everything's her fault!!`
` Dad and Mom and Onii-chan and all the others are just victims...!!`
` It's no one's fault, no one's fault...!!`
` Of course it isn't, of course it isn't!!"`
`--Your aunt will always be on your side, Ange-chan.`
`"Hahahaha, ahhahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Yeah, I get it now, I know what you meant!`
` Heheheheheh, ahhahahahahahahahahahahah!!`
` That's right, Aunt Eva, you're the culprit, you're the culprit!!`
` It's the world that's messed up and broken for not realizing that...!!`
` I'm the right one, I'll deny the red truth, deny the whole world...!!!"`
`"......I see.`
` ...In that case, try writing a red truth only you can write.`
` ...But how is it possible for a Human to write with red truth?"`
`"It is possible!!`
` There's a red ink that only Humans can write with!!"`
`Ange-san, please calm down.`
`"I'm the right one!! The world's wrong!!`
` I'll write it!!`
` I'll record the truth with the real red truth!!`
` Hahahahahahahah, ahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`20, requesting urgent support on the roof!!`
`Ange-san!!`
` Hold on!!`
` Please think this over, look ooooooooout!!!`
`"<Goodbye, Ange. Have a nice day.>"`
`"I'll write it out! This is my blood-red truth!!`
` I'll never accept the truth of your woooooooooooooooorld!!!"`
`Ange's body went past the edge of the balcony.`
`The air, which she had once been able to swim through, was now completely merciless for some reason.`
`Ange's body...plunged straight into the darkness below.`
`"........."`
`Bernkastel just watched the scene play out in silence...`
`Behind her, men in black suits rushed up to the fence, clutching it and screaming...`
`"...T-Twenty...!`
` ...A-Ange-san...j-jumped off...!"`
`"Damn, ...I can't see her from here..."`
`"Q-Quickly, investigate the ground area...!!`
` It's no use, there's no way...!!"`
`"M-Maybe she was caught by that safety net...!`
` L-Let's make sure...!"`
`What fools.`
`If you jumped straight down from this height, ...do you really think such a flimsy safety net could possibly save you...?`
`"As the Witch of Miracles, I, Bernkastel, guarantee that such a miracle certainly won't occur.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*, ...hahhahahahahahahahahaahahaha!!"`
`Ange's body...fell from the skyscraper-like bookshelf and slammed against the floor of the City of Books.`
`Looking down from Bernkastel's balcony, which was as high as a skyscraper's roof,`
` ...did it look like a lovely red pressed flower?`
`No. You couldn't see it at all.`
`Just like how the death of a single lonely girl who rejected the world...didn't matter to anyone in the world.`
`She probably died instantly.`
`It was only natural.`
` She had fallen straight down from this height, after all.`
`...Is it even conceivable that she wouldn't die instantly after something like that?`
`The index finger on the right hand of her corpse stuck out, as though it was tracing something.`
`Could it be that, by some impossible miracle, she really had escaped an instant death?`
`And could the red blood that had drained from her at the moment of her death...have been the ink that drew her own personal red truth?`
`However, no one would ever be able to tell what she had written.`
`After all, ...the red blood pouring from her corpse had run over it all.`
`"......Even this...was one of your choices,`
` ...Ange."`
`EVA was looking down at the beautiful flower of blood radiating from Ange's corpse.`
`"...I tried to keep you alive.`
` ...However, you never tried to live in the future that began after the age of six.`
` ...And so, after 12 years, you've finally returned to where you started."`
`The eyes on Ange's corpse...were closed.`
`...However, there was no way of knowing if this was a peaceful thing.`
`Eventually, the corpse began to melt away.`
`At the end, it had become a messy lump of flesh, with only a few parts recognizable as human.`
`...It was hardly surprising.`
`How else would she look after falling from that height...and slamming against the asphalt?`
`"You managed to die.`
` ...However,`
` this doesn't mean that everyone will be waiting for you in heaven.`
` ...After all, you reached this place by rejecting all of those in heaven.`
` ...<See you in hell.>`
` No, that's probably where we are right now.`
` ...So long, Ange."`
`"Ah, EVA.`
` Perfect timing."`
`"Did you call for me, my master?"`
`"Clean up this scrap meat for me, if you wouldn't mind.`
` I'm going to take this back."`
`In Bernkastel's hands were the key, which had lost its magic when Ange made her decision, and the Book of the Single Truth, which had been locked up again.`
`"As you wish, my master."`
`After looking down one more time, Bernkastel vanished.`
`Once she had gone, EVA summoned some cat familiars and ordered them to clean up.`
`The black cats gathered Ange's flesh and scattered limbs and threw them into a tin bucket.`
`...Even in this miserable form...`
`Ange's soul...was still living.`
`Perhaps 'living' is a poor description.`
`She...was unable to die.`
`From now on, forever.`
`She would drift along in the deepest depths of oblivion, covered by the dust of oblivion, until she finally...disappeared.`
`She continued to question herself.`
`What did the truth mean to her?`
`What was right, and where was the place she could call home...?`
`As her flesh began to cool, even the energy to ask these questions...began to fade...`
`Eventually, ...she would forget her everyday memories, and even the reason why she was suffering.`
`However, there was one thing she would never forget.`
`That was...the anguish.`
`From this point forth, ...she would suffer endlessly without even knowing why.`
`By the time the cats finished flinging her corpse into the bucket and dumping it into the sea of nothingness,`
` ...Ange had forgotten even her own name......`
`...What's this sound I keep hearing?`
`Yes, it must be......the sound of rain...`
`In that case, what are those two bright lights coming towards me?`
`...I don't know.`
`However, they came at me with a screeching sound...and stopped right in front of me.`
`A blaring noise came at me over and over.`
`Whatever's shining those bright lights...is threatening me.`
`It's probably telling me to get out of the way.`
`However, I was incapable of moving even a finger...`
`There was sound...and a car door opened.`
`Car.`
` ...Door.`
`Apparently, I was lying on asphalt under the pouring rain.`
`I saw a shadow, which was apparently the driver, open an umbrella and come towards me...`
`"...Is this your backyard?"`
`The shadow questioned me.`
`Of course, I couldn't answer it...`
`"...If it is, then I must apologize.`
` Yes, on a day with such fine weather, anyone would want to take a nap in such a lovely backyard as this.`
` ...And yet, unless my memory fails me..."`
`The shadow crouched down and looked into my face.`
`...It was a woman.`
`"This is a public highway you're sleeping on.`
` Do you want to become roadkill?`
` ...Or maybe you already are roadkill.`
` Well now, which one is it?"`
`I...clenched my chest.`
`I felt I needed to answer somehow and communicate my intentions.`
`So, finally, ...I managed to let a short groan escape my lips.`
`"...I see.`
` So you aren't roadkill yet."`
`And that...was how I met Ikuko.`
`"...The patient's body is in a very frail condition.`
` Some sort of memory loss is very probable as well.`
` We won't know for sure until the CT scan, but there may even be brain damage."`
`"It's lucky that 'damage' is all we have to deal with.`
` Any longer in a spot like that, and it would likely have been much worse."`
`"...True.`
` In any event, I recommend getting this checked at a large hospital."`
`"Thank you, doctor.`
` ...Please keep this off the record.`
` It may not be much, but here's some money for your troubles."`
`"I see no reason to speak of this needlessly, but...`
`...no, no, I couldn't possibly accept that much..."`
`In the end, the doctor took the money and swore to keep quiet about the matter.`
`Eventually, Hachijo returned.`
`"Oh, you were awake.`
` How do you feel...?"`
`I nodded weakly, letting her know that it wasn't so bad for now.`
`...But...where is this place?`
`A room I have absolutely no memory of, ...in a house I don't remember at all.`
`And, first and foremost, here's a woman I've never seen...`
`"To start off, let me introduce myself.`
` I'm Hachijo Ikuko.`
` Feel free to casually call me Ikuko, or act more formal and call me Hachijo-san."`
`...Hachijo...Ikuko.`
`"The Hachijo family owns a large amount of land and is fairly famous in these parts.`
` ...Unlike my accomplished brothers, I'm what you might call a little eccentric.`
` I got into a bit too much mischief, and my parents finally ran out of patience and kicked me out.`
` I'm now confined to this house.`
` ...As a hobby, I like to read detective novels...and also to write them.`
` My age...is a single woman's secret.`
` My heart is that of a girl, but I'm approaching the point where calling myself one becomes increasingly absurd.`
` Heheheheh."`
`With the haze my mind was in, it was extremely hard to make out what she was talking about.`
`However, ...I was able to pick up on the fact...that she was trying to cheer me up.`
`"...So, what's your name?"`
`.........My...name...`
`.........`
`Logically, I know that, being a human, I must have a name.`
`And, I do have the feeling that I did indeed have a name.`
`...However, no matter how hard I tried to remember what it was, it just made my head hurt...`
`"Can you remember anything besides your name...?"`
`"............"`
`Who...am I...?`
`My head...`
`...no, even my heart was a mess of torn flesh,`
` ...and I couldn't remember a thing, not even who or what I was...`
`But I must remember.`
`I had some kind of purpose...or maybe a mission.`
`In order to remember that, ...I first have to remember who I am.`
`Who am I...?`
` What is my name...?`
` Where was I born...and what was my birthday...?`
`I need to remember something, anything......`
`...............`
`"......Age..."`
`"Age?`
` *giggle*`
` That's my little secret."`
`"......18..."`
`"I look like I'm 18...?!"`
`"...I'm......18......"`
`"O-Oh, so that was your age...!`
` Well now, I thought you were being a bit too flattering.`
` Hahahaha."`
`When I asked myself how old I was, the number 18 floated into my mind.`
`To be honest, the number 18 felt a bit out of place.`
`...My mind felt much younger than that, ...and my pathetic body felt much older.`
`"I see.`
` So you're 18.`
` And, that's all you can remember."`
`I nodded weakly.`
`I never knew that knowing nothing about yourself could make you feel this powerless.`
`"In that case, until you remember your name, `
`let's give you the name 'Tohya', written with the characters for 18, until you remember.`
` ......Hachijo Tohya.`
` What do you think?`
` That sounds pretty cool.`
` Yes, I must say I've impressed myself very much with that one."`
`Hachijo...Ikuko gave a satisfied laugh.`
`From then on, I took the name Hachijo Tohya.`
`My inability to move my body was apparently due to a traffic accident.`
`On that day, I had been hit by a car, and Ikuko had picked me up from where I lay on the street.`
`If she hadn't hit the brakes...`
`She probably would've driven straight onwards, thinking she'd run over a dead dog or something.`
`...Later on, perhaps rudely, I suspected that the one who hit me might have been Ikuko herself,`
` but when I saw her completely undamaged front bumper, I gave up on that theory.`
`Hachijo Ikuko lived in a small but lovely mansion on the top of a small hill, in a village with a view of the sea.`
`She also owned the hill behind her and was more than capable of enjoying the four seasons in privacy.`
`As time passed slowly, my rehabilitation continued, and my ability to move improved little by little.`
`However, ...it seemed I really did suffer some form of brain damage.`
`Finding out who I was...looked like it would be a very difficult task.`
`In the beginning, when I couldn't bear not knowing my identity, my head often hurt so much it felt as though it would explode.`
`...However, as I slowly accepted the fact that I was a new person, with the new name of Hachijo Tohya, `
`...the headaches became less frequent.`
`That whole time, ...no memories returned to me except the fact that I had been 18.`
`However, I was unable to remember any more, unable even to be sure that 18 was my true age,`
` ...and eventually, I stopped trying to remember my former self.`
`"Good morning, Tohya.`
` That was quite the storm last night. Were you able to sleep well?"`
`"......I had some trouble falling asleep.`
` So, I decided to read your manuscript."`
`"My, my.`
` How far did you manage to get?"`
`"I finished it."`
`"...Now there's a surprise.`
` You managed to read through all that in a single night?"`
`"I was surprised too.`
` ...Once I got into it, I'd finished before I knew it.`
` ...It was like I was just skimming it, ...or maybe like I was taking in each page with just a glance..."`
`"It sounds like you have some talent at speed reading.`
` ...So, how was it?`
` What did you think of it?"`
`"I liked it a lot.`
` Still, if you don't explain that part about the ocean currents a bit more clearly, it might be a little unfair for a detective novel...`
` Oh, but I thought it was great that you had the foreshadowing with the ring right there at the beginning.`
` ...After I finished, I had to go back to the beginning and slap myself for being so easily tricked.`
` I think giving people that feeling is what detective novels do best."`
`"........."`
`"...Um, ...did I say something to offend you?`
` ...If I did, you have my apologies."`
`"Of course not! Why are you apologizing...?!`
` I'm just shocked, that's all.`
` Your detailed opinions are worthy of praise, I believe...`
` It seems you have some talent as a critic or a detective novel writer too."`
`.........A detective novel...writer.`
` ...A critic.`
`............`
`From across the fog of oblivion.`
`I seem to remember myself...fighting and arguing about mysteries, or something like that.`
`That way of fighting, which I must have learned in the past, ...sent a surge of excitement through me.`
`...Mystery.`
` ...Fighting...`
`My head...hurt......`
`I took a painkiller and swallowed it with fresh water brought up from the well.`
`Who am I...really...?`
`...But no matter how much I thought, I couldn't remember.`
`From what I've been told, the frequency of the headaches might be lessened by brain surgery, but there was no guarantee that it would do my memory any good.`
`Ikuko said that she would let me have surgery if I wanted it.`
`However, I refused.`
`Even if I can't remember it, ...the real me is still there, sleeping inside my head.`
`I was scared...that the surgery might harm that 'me' somehow.`
`By now, I've gotten used to dealing with headaches.`
`...As long as I don't force myself to remember the past, the headaches don't torment me every day.`
`So, ...bit by bit, I became free of the headaches...and got used to my new life as Hachijo Tohya...`
`Gradually, my interests shifted from myself to Ikuko.`
`Hachijo Ikuko.`
`A very strange woman.`
`First off, she was apparently the daughter of a very well-off family, just as she had said.`
`However, she was considerably eccentric, `
`and the 'various mischievous incidents' she spoke of had apparently gotten her within an inch of being disowned.`
`As a result, she had been given this house, and had been ordered to live here quietly and alone.`
`She had never been a particularly social person, so she happily accepted this new state of affairs,`
` living however she pleased with servants to take care of her.`
`She had no friends.`
` No one ever came to visit.`
`When I wasn't around, she only ever talked to an old black cat she kept as a pet, named Bern.`
`I don't know her real age.`
`She doesn't seem to be too old to marry yet, but with an isolated life like this, she isn't likely to meet people.`
`She sometimes says that she just hasn't met anyone worth the trouble, but I think she's already given up on marriage.`
`Her everyday life was very simple.`
`She would either read through the many detective novels that were brought to her, or else write detective novels herself.`
`At first, I thought she was some novelist at a private retreat, plugging away at a new book.`
`However, the manuscripts she finished just ended up clipped together in a pile.`
`With me as the sole exception, it didn't look like she ever let anyone read them.`
`A novelist is someone who writes novels for people to read.`
`So, I figured you could hardly call her a novelist when she kept writing novels no one would ever see.`
`"...Ikuko-san, why don't you ever show these to anyone?"`
`"I show them to you.`
` Only the better ones, of course."`
`"Haven't you ever thought of sending one to some publishing company?`
` ...It's a waste otherwise, when your works are so interesting."`
`"My works can't stand up against the pros.`
` I sent one in once, but it was absolutely no good.`
` I understand my position.`
` This is just an amateur's pastime."`
`"I don't think amateur is a fitting word for someone who's so well-versed in detective novels from all times and all across the world."`
`"Being a big eater doesn't mean you'll make a good cook.`
` Reading every detective novel you can get your hands on is no guarantee that you're a good detective novelist.`
` That's how it is.`
` That's why this is nothing more than a pastime."`
`"...Is it really fun to write novels that you won't show to anyone?"`
`"It used to be.`
` ...Once."`
`"What about now?"`
`"I like getting to hear your opinions.`
` ......At any rate, I've finished writing the chapter.`
` I'll go make some tea, so would you mind reading it again and sharing your thoughts with me?"`
`Saying this with a smile, Ikuko thrust a pile of manuscript paper at me.`
`I'm convinced that, whether you read detective novels or write them...`
`They're boring if you're all on your own.`
`You can only find something really precious when you share that world with someone else.`
`......Headache.`
`"Tohya?`
` ...Are you okay?`
` I'll go get some headache medicine."`
`"I'm fine.`
` I'm more interested in this manuscript.`
` I can't wait for the new chapter."`
`The seasons passed.`
`Together with Ikuko, in this town whose name I didn't even know,`
` we spent our days debating detective novels and talking about ideas for new plots.`
`At a glance, they may have appeared to be stale and unproductive days.`
`However, ...Hachijo Tohya found satisfaction with this new life.`
`"...And so, the curtain closes on the strange tale of Kurokubi Island.`
` ...The End."`
`With a dramatic flourish of her pen, Ikuko signified that her manuscript was now complete.`
`"What do you think...?!`
` I tried using your plot to make Tsujiko's tragic love scene at the end a bit more moving."`
`"I think it's very good...`
` I'd say the last farewell is sad enough to make it moving as a story, not just a reasoning puzzle."`
`"...That's all thanks to your plot.`
` ...Compared to this work, everything I've written before now is worth little more than scrap paper.`
` ...Even as I was writing it, I was excited to be the first person in the world who got to read it.`
` ...I've never felt that before."`
`"I just mentioned some ideas.`
` You're the one who turned them into such a fascinating story, Ikuko-san."`
`At some point, she roped me in as well, and I too started my journey in the world of writing detective novels.`
`...Apparently, the old me had some talent for mysteries and detective novels and the like.`
`And, my talent seemed to be of a fairly unorthodox kind.`
`I tried turning famous mysteries from across the world on their head, twisting those ideas into something new.`
`However, a few ideas aren't enough to make a book.`
`No meal is complete if all you can do is chop up vegetables.`
`Thanks to Ikuko's writing, a skill she had built up over many years, my ideas were transformed into a work of fiction.`
`In this work, 'the Strange Tale of Kurokubi Island', the two of us merged the best of our respective personalities,`
` ...and, though I hate to brag, it had turned into a masterpiece that we could show to anyone without shame.`
`"Hello?`
` Please bring us some champagne.`
` ...Bring a glass for yourself as well.`
` This is the best job we've done so far,`
` so let's celebrate."`
`Ikuko called for some champagne over the internal phone line.`
`Joined by the servant who happened to be working that day and the cat Bern, we raised our glasses high and toasted our accomplishment.`
`"......Ikuko-san,`
` I have an idea, if you don't mind."`
`"Let's hear it.`
` I love hearing your ideas, as long as I'm not in the shower or on the can...!"`
`"Why don't we try submitting our book?`
` ...I've never read anything this interesting before.`
` I'm sure lots of other people will want to read it."`
`"...You think so?`
` I tried once in the past, thinking the same thing, but the result was..."`
`"I believe in your talent, Ikuko-san.`
` ...What about you?"`
`"Of course, I believe in your talent."`
`"Then it's decided.`
` ...To Ikuko-san's big debut."`
`"To Tohya's big debut!"`
`We clinked our glasses once more.`
`And on and on it went...`
`We must've had way too much to drink.`
`Before I knew it, I must have passed out on the sofa.`
`There was a blanket covering me.`
` ...Ikuko-san must've put it there.`
`The lights were out in the study, but it wasn't dark.`
`The computer's monitor was glowing.`
`Outside, it had started to rain.`
`...It reminded me of the day Ikuko-san found me and took me in.`
`Because of that, ...whenever it rains, I find myself wondering who I was, ...and I usually get headaches.`
`So, I wasn't sure whether the pain was because of the rain or because I drank too much.`
`"...Ikuko-san,`
` turn on the lights.`
` ...Using a computer in the dark is bad for your eyes."`
`"Oh, did I wake you up?"`
`"No, I slept well.`
` I feel refreshed now."`
`I turned on the light and looked out through a gap in the curtains.`
`...As I'd thought, it was the sort of pouring rain that always reminded me of that day.`
`"It's raining pretty hard out there.`
` The wind looks pretty strong too.`
` I hope the rain gutters don't get clogged with leaves again."`
`"...I just cleaned them the other day, so they should be fine for a while."`
`Her answer sounded a little abstracted.`
`Apparently, her attention was absorbed by the computer.`
`"You've been pretty hooked by that computer lately, Ikuko-san.`
` Did you find an interesting article or something?"`
`"...It may be a bit juvenile, but it's still pretty interesting.`
` ...It's about that Rokkenjima incident."`
`"...Rokkenjima......?"`
`"I told you about the Rokkenjima mystery a few days ago, remember?`
` It's been really huge on the net lately.`
` The discussions, theories, and even the Forgeries have been quite entertaining.`
` ...Forgeries are stories, all based on the premise that yet another message bottle signed by Ushiromiya Maria existed and drifted to one of the nearby islands..."`
`Ikuko kept showing off her knowledge of the subject.`
`...However, ...a huge bell was clanging inside my head.`
`The noise was so great that I thought my head would split open.`
`Unable to tell what was the floor and what was the ceiling, ...I crumpled and clutched at my head...`
`"Tohya, ...are you okay...?!"`
`"...My head...hurts......"`
`The Rokkenjima Explosion Accident.`
`The many disquieting rumors surrounding it.`
`The scheming of the relatives who were after Ushiromiya Kinzo's vast wealth and the hidden gold...`
`And the truth?`
`Ushiromiya Eva, the sole survivor, said nothing.`
`Eventually, everything would be inherited by the granddaughter, Ushiromiya Ange, who escaped harm because she was absent on that day...`
`Ange, ...Ange... ...Ushiromiya...Ange...`
`...I am...Ushiromiya......gyahh...`
`No good...my head's...getting split open...`
`Incomprehensible scenes pierced my eyelids from the inside like blades of light.`
`Just what...am I looking at...?`
`Who...are these people...calling to me, ...but not by the name Tohya...?`
`...Who......am I...?`
` Who are these people...?`
` What is...this memory...?`
`Help me, Ikuko...`
` ...Someone else's memory...is hurting me...`
`My...head's...splitting...`
`...I could hear the sorrowful sound of wind...`
`And...that must be rain.`
`...Who...was I, again...?`
`I am...Ushiromiya...`
`"Ange! ...Ange...!!"`
`"Please, please say something...!!"`
`Voices...`
`Voices calling to me.`
`Dad...and Mom...`
`...It can't be...`
`In 1986, ...on Rokkenjima, ...Mom and Dad...`
`"...Ange, hang in there...!`
` Can you hear Daddy's voice...?!"`
`"Please, say something!! Ange!!"`
`...Dad, Mom...`
`I'll...say it out loud...`
`...Dad...Mom...`
`"Ange...!!`
` Ange, thank goodness...!!"`
`I could feel my body being lifted up firmly...and hugged roughly.`
`...Mom and Dad...were hugging me...`
`My eyelids have been open for a while now.`
`I could feel the light slowly returning to my eyes.`
`Just like your eyes get used to the dark, ...my eyes got used to the light, ...and bit by bit, the scene around me came into view.`
`However, it was an unusual sight, which seemed to be very far away.`
`My body...was being hugged by Dad and Mom.`
`Dad was sniffling, his face covered with tears.`
`There were tears in Mom's eyes too as she held me tight.`
`It was...so strong that it hurt a bit.`
`They held me with all their strength.`
` Me, the bad kid who wasn't obedient, who always had an excuse, ...and who always tried to do the opposite of what her parents said.`
` ...They held me tight, to make sure I didn't head down the wrong path...`
`As my eyes adjusted, I could see other people besides my parents.`
`Everyone was there.`
`George onii-chan, Jessica onee-chan, Maria onee-chan.`
`My uncles and aunts.`
`...Even Sakutarou.`
` ...And there was the witch Virgilia, and Ronove, and......`
`"...Where..."`
`"You were fortunate.`
` ...By chance, we found you drifting in the waves of the sea of emptiness.`
` ...You were in a terrible state.`
` ...It took quite some time to make you remember your true form."`
`"...Beatrice...`
` ...So, this is..."`
`"The Golden Land.`
` ...Your whole family has been waiting here for you to return."`
`"...We knew you would come home."`
`Did I...come home because I was supposed to...?`
`...I've...gone back to how I'm supposed to be, and now...`
`"No, you did come home."`
`"That's right.`
` You made it back here because you wanted to come home to us."`
`"...Dad, ...Mom...`
` ...I..."`
`"You don't need to say anything.`
` ...You've been on a great and terrible journey, haven't you?`
` ...A journey where you were all alone..."`
`"You understand now, don't you?`
` You won't forget again?"`
`I understand, ...Dad...`
`"...This is...a place you can always call home..."`
`"......I know..."`
`When I gave that answer, Dad and Mom hugged me again.`
`Hot tears fell onto my face.`
`They were Dad's and Mom's tears...`
`"...I can tell by looking that you're far from 'all right',`
` ...but I'm so glad.`
` Glad you came home."`
`"...Aunt...Eva..."`
`"Feel free to hate me as much as you want.`
` ...Give your Dad and Mom a million kisses.`
` ...Give a kiss to everyone who cared about you so much."`
`"Aunt...Eva..."`
`"...And say 'I'm home' to your other mother."`
`Mom gave me a push from behind, ...and I stumbled forwards.`
`Towards my...other mother.`
`"......Eva, ......Mom..."`
`"...Ange-chan......"`
`"If only...I'd called you Mom on that day,`
` ...I might never have messed up...`
` ...We might've been able...to create a new world together..."`
`"That's enough.`
` ...You've come home.`
` ...You don't need to say anything else..."`
`"Mom...`
` ...Mom......"`
`"Welcome home, Ange-chan...`
` ...You're my adorable daughter..."`
`"Mom...`
` ...Always, ...and until the end, ...you were my closest friend......"`
`The two of them hugged each other quietly, ...burying their faces in the other's shoulders and sobbing.`
`The truth...wasn't worth anything at all.`
`In the first place, ...the truth is always in the past.`
`The point of the future isn't to learn what happened in the past.`
`What really matters...is whether I can truly live and prosper in the truth that is the now.`
`If I truly live and prosper, that is the truth.`
`Back when I only ever tried to see the truth of the past, `
`I was nothing more than a ghost trapped in that past.`
`Since that time, I haven't lived a single day.`
`...Now, I truly understand.`
`This is what...the real truth is...`
`"I will...live...`
` ...And I've remembered how much everyone loved me..."`
`Because I was young and selfish, I didn't even remember until now.`
`The kind Grandpa, who always spoiled me.`
`The entertaining aunts and uncles.`
`All of the kind and gentle servants.`
`...It was always...warm.`
`And yet, because I was young and cruel, I never tried to remember any of that.`
`Everyone got distorted by my irresponsible imagination, ...and I completely forgot the truth...`
`Now, I can remember clearly, and I understand.`
`That Halloween quiz party...certainly was an illusion.`
`It never happened.`
`...However, didn't we do all kinds of fun things when the relatives gathered,`
` ...things that were no more or less fun than that party......?`
`And, ...for the first time since the start of the game...`
`I went up to each and every one of them...to greet them, thank them, and apologize.`
`To thank Grandpa for always pampering me.`
`To thank my aunts and uncles.`
`To thank the cousins for always playing with me even though I was so selfish.`
`...And, I thanked and apologized to the Illusions.`
`I think I said something horrible to Sakutarou once, in the past.`
`And to Maria onee-chan too.`
`"...Maria onee-chan, you really were a witch, weren't you?"`
`"I've always been a witch.`
` ...You approached that level yourself once, didn't you?"`
`"No.`
` I never really understood.`
` ...Pitiful Maria onee-chan with her pitiful magic.`
` ...That's all I thought of it...`
` ...So, ...I couldn't pick up a Fragment of happiness, couldn't even find one.`
` ...You told me that yourself once, ...Onee-chan..."`
`"...It can't be helped.`
` It takes two to create a universe.`
` ...I had Beato, but you were all alone."`
`"No.`
` ...If I had called Aunt Eva 'Mom', there would've been two of us.`
` ...I'm sure I would've been able to create a new world with the same magic you used, Maria onee-chan."`
`"...All of it is my fault.`
` The message bottles I threw away half-jokingly distorted your future and wore you down.`
` ...I bear responsibility for that."`
`"...Yeah, seriously.`
` It's all because of your message bottles.`
` Because of that, people started copying you and making Forgeries, growing the story into something crazy."`
`However, the message bottles thrown away by Beato did not name a specific person as the culprit.`
`...One of the Forgers wrote a plausible forgery that had Ushiromiya Eva as the culprit, and it spread like a wildfire...`
`Even though I should've known better than anyone else that it was impossible, ...I accepted it in the end.`
`"......It isn't your fault, Beato.`
` ...No matter how many people around me had baseless suspicions, `
`...there should've been only one truth inside me.`
` And yet, so easily, ...I abandoned my warm memories of you all...`
`and surrendered my heart to them."`
`"No, no.`
` If I had not thrown away the message bottles, the future of Rokkenjima would never have become the center of such bizarre misconceptions.`
` I bear responsibility for it all."`
`"...True.`
` That's right, it really is your fault after all."`
`"Mu.`
` ...Put that way, it's a little irritating.`
` ...You do have your share of the blame as well."`
`"......`
`...Yeah, you're right.`
` You were at fault, and so was I.`
` ...Still, it'd be stupid for us to attack each other.`
` ...After all, I'm a witch of the future.`
` You're a witch of the past.`
` ...I should be using that magic to build my future.`
` ...We both bear responsibility in some way,`
` but neither of us has the right to blame the other."`
`"...I knew `
`you'd be able to understand Mariage Sorcière's teachings, Ange."`
`"That's right.`
` ...As the final member of Mariage Sorcière, ...it's my responsibility to pass on Onee-chan's magic."`
`"My magic can make everyone happy."`
`"Indeed...!`
` You have both pure magic and wicked magic at your fingertips...!"`
`"...That's true.`
` Magic can change completely depending on your heart.`
` ...If you aren't properly guided, you can't use magic properly.`
` ...And proper magic can bring people happiness."`
`"It is a wonderful thing...`
` ...Bringing people happiness is the sole reason that witches wield magic.`
` ...I am very pleased to know that those teachings have been passed down through the Endless Witches, all the way to the final witch..."`
`"Sorry for failing to pass it down myself at all."`
`"Witch of the Future, ANGE Beatrice,`
` ...I will now retract your expulsion from Mariage Sorcière."`
`"Uryu-!`
` I knew Ange would come back...!"`
`"Congratulations, Ange-sama."`
`"...I thought I knew what the time we spent travelling together meant, and yet I...`
` ...Sorry.`
` I'm so sorry..."`
`"Witches cannot create a universe unless there are two.`
` ...In the future, you will be alone. Will you really be okay...?"`
`"Yeah, I'll be okay.`
` ...I'm not alone anymore.`
` ...I'll...live.`
` ...With everyone.`
` And I'll live in the future.`
` I swear to keep living, so that I can pass on the magic of Mariage Sorcière."`
`"Maria onee-chan's magic has saved me too.`
` ......There are a lot of people out there who need magic.`
` As the final witch of Mariage Sorcière, `
`...it's my duty to teach it the right way and save as many people as I can."`
`"Will you truly be able to do so...?"`
`"Of course. I have the power to do it.`
` There's the golden magic that my predecessor, EVA Beatrice, spent so much time building.`
` I've inherited all of that. Right?"`
`"*giggle*`
` ...Well, if only my health had held out a little longer, I was planning to spend all of it on myself."`
`*giggle* ...Ahahahahahahahahahaha.`
`As Ange laughed, tears poured from her eyes again.`
`Everyone surrounded Ange with their kind, warm smiles...`
`Battler stood alone in the rose garden maze, letting the rain quietly fall on him...`
`After searching for some time, Ange found him.`
`"......Onii-chan..."`
`"........."`
`Ange, who was feeling guilty, sensed anger in her brother's expression.`
`So, ...she thought he was going to hit her.`
`She shut her eyes.`
`However, her brother touched her softly.`
`He patted her head gently.`
`"...Hey."`
`"............"`
`"The truth...wasn't anything important, was it?"`
`"......No, it wasn't.`
` ...Even though you were here, waiting for me to come home in such a warm world,`
` ...I had my back turned the whole time..."`
`"You learned the truth."`
`"......Yeah..."`
`"So, any hopes you had of someone miraculously surviving and coming back...have been crushed.`
` ...However, you now have a new mission, a hope for living in the future."`
`"...You kept that precious hope safe for me.`
` ...I was the one who opened the box and let it get away.`
` ...It turned out worse than Pandora's box.`
` ...A truth I didn't need to know flew out of the box, along with all my hopes, ...leaving nothing inside but empty space..."`
`"That's okay.`
` ...It's open now, and that's that.`
` If it's empty inside, that means it won't fester.`
` After all, false hopes can sometimes bring you pain."`
`Battler laughed heartily.`
`Then, with that same smile on his face, he told her.`
`"We're already dead."`
`"......Yeah."`
`"You've lived 12 years on the hope that we might still be alive.`
` Not anymore.`
` That's over and done with."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...I know.`
` Starting now, ...I'll step forward into a new life."`
`"Beato put Rokkenjima in the cat box.`
` The next witch, Aunt Eva, guarded the lid of that cat box her whole life.`
` ...You, the witch after her, opened that lid, ...but so what?`
` Why does the truth of the past matter?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` ...From now on, I'll truly live.`
` And I'll make my own personal truth prosper."`
`"Good luck,`
` final witch of Mariage Sorcière.`
` ...I've read Maria's grimoire.`
` It's a great book, with some really good stuff written in it."`
`"Even the Bible needs a translator.`
` So, Maria's grimoire probably needs one too.`
` ...You'll be that translator.`
` ...You've got to teach kids who are in the position you once were.`
` That's your mission as the new Witch of the Future."`
`"...Yeah."`
`"I'm...gone.`
` But I'll always be behind you, watching over you."`
`"I know.`
` ...And not just you.`
` Everyone else too..."`
`"...All of us...will love you forever.`
` Don't forget that..."`
`"...I won't forget...`
` ...Not ever, ...and that's for certain..."`
`Ange leapt into Battler's chest...and sobbed.`
`Humans are sad creatures, who can 'learn' but not 'unlearn'.`
`She had already learned.`
`It may have been a cruel, terrifying, merciless thing, capable of destroying even the miracle called hope.`
`...However, there was still one tiny Fragment left gripped in her hand.`
`Her family's...love.`
`If she can just remember that and hold it tight, ...then surely, Ange will live on...`
`She'll be able to stop before taking that single step into nothingness...`
`"Also, the Rokkenjima cat box hasn't been opened completely.`
` ...You've just taken a peek at what's inside.`
` So, you must be the lid yourself."`
`"And, this time, you'll protect everyone inside the cat box.`
` Me and Dad and Kyrie-san, the cousins and the uncles and the aunts.`
` Grandfather and the servants.`
` ...And all of the Illusions."`
`"......Yeah.`
` ...This time...I have to...protect everyone..."`
`"Then shouldn't you hurry up a bit?"`
`The sound of popcorn being eaten rang out from beyond a rose bush.`
`...It was Lambdadelta.`
`"I think you know this already,`
` ...but Bern is just about to hold a big party for the Book of the Single Truth.`
` She's gathered beings from heaven and from hell, from the spirit world and from parallel worlds.`
` If she announces what's in that book in a place like that, it'll all be too late, won't it?"`
`"......I'm...going.`
` ...I gave Bernkastel that key.`
` It's my responsibility.`
` I'll go and take it back."`
`"The City of Books, huh?`
` But there's no way for us to get in.`
` There's a barrier around that place."`
`"...She gave me this.`
` With it, I can come and go as I please.`
` ...What an idiot.`
` She forgot to collect it when she threw me away."`
`Ange fished through her pocket, and there was a jingling sound.`
`It was a bell with a blue ribbon tied to it.`
`"...That's it.`
` One of those temporary entry passes that you get when you turn in your invitation.`
` As long as you have that, at least one of you will be able to get into the City of Books.`
` Well, as long as someone takes you across the sea of Fragments first."`
`"Lambdadelta,`
` take me to the City of Books."`
`"...Ange."`
`"This is my way of taking responsibility.`
` ...I'll see to it that the Book of the Single Truth isn't made public."`
`"...Are you serious?`
` That place is a den of monsters among monsters.`
` Now that you've lost Bern's protection, you'll be weaker than a fly.`
` Squish. The end."`
`"Ah-"`
`The bell was snatched from Ange's hands.`
`"Lambdadelta,`
` I'll go.`
` ...I just need you to get me in there.`
` After all, I'm an empty creature, unable to exist outside the cat box.`
` Ange, on the other hand, must live on into the future.`
` And you're a person with a future too.`
` ...So I'll go.`
` I have nothing to lose."`
`"No! This is my responsibility, my way of making up for what I did!`
` If I don't do it myself, the future won't change at all, and I won't be able to save any future cat boxes...!"`
`Ange tried to snatch the key from Battler's hand, but Battler had no intention of giving it up.`
`The two of them were grimly serious, but from the sidelines, it looked like an ordinary squabble between two close siblings.`
`Lambdadelta watched this conversation and shrugged.`
`...If she just took one of them to the City of Books, she wouldn't have to make any enemies, and there was no risk to her.`
`All she cared about was which one would make the story more interesting.`
` Nothing else.`
`But then, she finally noticed.`
`"Hold on.`
` ...Hold on a sec, you two. Hold on!"`
`"What's your problem?! Save it for later!!"`
`"We're having an important sibling discussion here!"`
`"Okay, first off,`
` let go of each other's hands.`
` ...Battler's holding the bell now, right?`
` Jump, Battler."`
`"...Jump?`
` Like this?"`
`*jingle*jingle*.`
`"You next, Ange.`
` Try jumping."`
`"...Why the hell should I..."`
`*jingle*jingle*.`
`"Huh...?`
` ...Why...?"`
`If Battler was holding the bell, where did that sound come from...?`
`Ange hurriedly searched through her pockets.`
`When she did, ...another blue-ribboned bell came out of a different pocket than the first one.`
`"These are...the same, aren't they...?"`
`"...No way...`
` Why are there two?`
` I was only given one of them!"`
`"I don't know why.`
` At any rate, you've got two bells that'll get you into the City of Books.`
` Now I don't have to sit here and watch the two of you play around with each other anymore."`
`The pair of them gripped their bells and looked at each other.`
`"From the very beginning,`
` this game has belonged to the two of you.`
` ...There's just been a slight change in who the opponent is.`
` ...This isn't a competition between you two.`
` It's a fight between Battler and Ange, who want to close the lid on the cat box, `
`and Bern, who wants it opened. Ange has moved from Bern's team to Battler's team.`
` That's all there is to it."`
`"Lambdadelta,`
` take us to the City of Books."`
`"...Okay, okay, I'm just taking you there, got it?!`
` After that, I'm done being anything but a spectator!`
` I just wanna have the best seats, to see exactly how you fight, what you do, and how Bern makes mincemeat out of you all...!"`
`"Lambdadelta, ...thanks!"`
`Shannon and Kanon stood guard in front of the door to the Golden Land.`
`They glared quietly and fearlessly at the eerie fleet of ships across the horizon.`
`Shannon slowly lifted her hands.`
`Kanon raised his right hand, and a red blade appeared there.`
`"Stop right there.`
` I forbid you to come any closer."`
`"...If you do, ...I'll kill you."`
`They could see a single dinghy leaving the fleet and approaching them.`
`They couldn't tell if it was a messenger or the first wave.`
`Shannon and Kanon watched it cautiously...`
`At the head of that dinghy rowed by goats...stood Erika.`
`...Where the heck did she get that thing from?`
` Maybe she's trying to act the part of the fleet's leader.`
` ...Erika was glaring at them and smiling aggressively, with what appeared to be a pirate hat on her head.`
`"I've come to deliver our terms.`
` There will be room for negotiation.`
` Please open the gate."`
`Shannon and Kanon looked at each other.`
`Erika was the one offering this deal.`
` It wasn't likely to be anything agreeable.`
`However, if they turned her away, the attack would probably begin at once.`
`Since they were in a firmly inferior position, they wanted to buy time by any means they could.`
`At Shannon's nod, Kanon erased his sword...`
`The Golden Land was filled with a hard downpour accompanied by occasional thunder.`
`Erika, who realized that this weather spoke for their emotions, smiled even more boldly.`
`At the center of the Golden Land...was the arbor surrounded by the golden rose garden.`
`A large number of Humans and Illusions were there, arguing about something.`
`Even without asking, it was easy to guess the nature of the debate by their anguished expressions.`
`After all, in this life-or-death situation, they didn't have many options they could take...`
`In the direction Erika was being led, Beato stood waiting, accompanied by the Chiester Sisters Corps.`
`When Erika, accompanied by her goat guards, saw Beato, she gave a bow that only appeared graceful.`
`Beato followed suit and gave a graceful bow of the sort that was rarely seen from her.`
`"...I am Beatrice, master of the Golden Land and the Golden and Endless Witch.`
` ...Announce yourself."`
`As though implying that she was more than happy to go through with this farce, Beato introduced herself boldly and requested that Erika do the same.`
`"We have been dispatched from the Great Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating's Noble City of Carefully Selected Books.`
` I am the Witch of Truth, the commander of the Library Fleet, which is committed to bestowing honor and protection to books.`
` My name is Furudo Erika.`
` It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance."`
`"Shall we get down to business?"`
`"You ought to celebrate.`
` We of the Library Fleet, dedicated to offering honor and protection to books, have come to bring good news to you all.`
` First,`
` I would like to announce that, after careful selection, the City of Books has acknowledged and accepted the game board created by the Endless Witch Beatrice as a great and honorable book."`
`"Hoh.`
` That is indeed a great honor."`
`"That game board is a profoundly entertaining and original masterpiece, worthy of close study.`
` It deserves to be released for all of our subjects to read.`
` And so, the City of Books has ordered us to grant eternal honor and protection to this game board."`
`"This is all quite long and boring.`
` Get to the point."`
`"We demand that you hand the entirety of this game board over to the honorable City of Books.`
` Doing so will give this board and its pieces the greatest honor and protection imaginable."`
`"And if we refuse?"`
`"You will be prosecuted for the crime of monopolizing a great cultural artifact that ought to be shared among all of our subjects.`
` We are here to notify you of the impending assault, one which will be waged by us to protect the benefits that are the rightful property of all subjects, not yours alone."`
`"Are you not concerned that the shared property of all subjects might be destroyed in this assault of yours?"`
`"According to the Great Library Protective Regulations, when a criminal guilty of monopolization of a cultural artifact raises that objection as you have now done,`
` the executive fleet may prioritize arrest over its protective duties, as long as they obtain permission from the Great Court.`
`...Of course, we have already obtained the Great Court's written authorization."`
`"I imagine the word 'arrest' is closely followed by 'dead or alive'. Am I right?"`
`"My, my.`
` I'm impressed that you can read those tiny letters.`
` Now, enough fooling around.`
` ...Let's hear your answer."`
`"What do we have to gain by accepting your conditions?"`
`"Both of us will be saved a troublesome task.`
` Furthermore, your brave and noble acts will be recorded as a glorious final chapter in the City of Books."`
`"...You do understand, right?`
` You have no chance of winning.`
` This isn't even a fight.`
` It's just you, sitting there at the bottom of a well, while people throw stones at you."`
`"...So, you claim that I have the power to choose nothing except how the library witches will record my final moments?`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`"The rest depends on you.`
` If you treasure this game board, you ought to surrender.`
` The pieces will be treasured by our many loyal subjects for all time and will be able to continue their roles on into eternity."`
`"Hmph.`
` ...In other words, the tragedies I created at will shall repeat forevermore."`
`"How is that any different from what you've been doing so far?"`
`"......It isn't.`
` ...Is there anything else?`
` If not, allow me to give you my answer."`
`"Go ahead."`
`Erika tensed slightly.`
`After all, this was the Great Lady Beatrice she was dealing with.`
`She might shout 'Here is my answer!' dramatically and do something crazy.`
`They say a cornered rat is the most likely to bite a cat.`
`Furthermore, Erika had intel telling her that the Great Lady Lambdadelta, witch of the Senate, had been spending her time inside the Golden Land, though only as a theatergoer.`
`Erika needed to carry out this noble task that her master had assigned her, and she had to carry it out perfectly.`
`If she was honest, ...she wanted to make Beato raise a white flag, even by trickery if necessary.`
`So, even though this was a farce, she held back from giving any unneeded provocation.`
`She gulped and tried to size Beato up.`
`And then, ......with a pathetic expression on her face, ...Beato let out a sigh.`
`"I'll be honest.`
` The truth is...I am tired."`
`"...What do you mean by that?"`
`"My game had already achieved its purpose when my fight with Battler ended.`
` And yet, for various reasons, the game has repeated several times since then.`
` ...To be perfectly honest, I am tired of it."`
`"...To be honest, that isn't the answer I was expecting at all.`
` ...So, you want to surrender?`
` Really...?"`
`"Simply put, I don't care either way.`
` ...It doesn't matter whether I surrender or whether we're vanquished by you.`
` I simply wish to have the curtain closed on this game board and tale, regardless of who does the deed."`
`Of course, ...that was a lie.`
`She knew she couldn't win even if she fought.`
`For now, their best option...was to play for time.`
`They would fix Erika's attention to this spot, ...and during that time, Battler and the others would steal the key from Bernkastel while she was completely off her guard.`
`...Once they had the key, they would return to the Golden Land, use that key to let Ange open the door to the future, and see her off.`
`That was their goal line.`
`Everything that happened after that...would be inside the cat box.`
`Ange would live on into the future, with hope.`
` No one would know whether Beato and the others were alive or dead.`
` ...That was enough.`
`The only strategy Beato and the others could use to achieve this...was to buy time.`
`"...If you do surrender, it may be a bit of an anti-climax, but it will save me a lot of trouble."`
`"But, well, ...it is not quite so simple.`
` You see, and this is just between you and me,`
` ...as you may know, the Great Lady Lambdadelta is staying here.`
` She is, umm, pushing us to show her a dramatic climax."`
`"...That's a pretty cruel whim to force on someone.`
` How are a few wimpy people in what's basically an already-solved puzzle supposed to fight against our fleet, `
`with its hundreds of thousands of troops?"`
`"Very true, very true...`
` The gap in strength is overwhelming.`
` We told her that it wouldn't even be a fight, but...`
` Well, ...Lady Lambdadelta didn't listen, and just said she would bring some of her friends to support us, so we should fight with everything we had."`
`"...Lady Lambdadelta's...friends...?"`
`Unlike Bernkastel, who kept to herself, Lambdadelta had many friends.`
`Her friends and patrons were either territory lords of great influence who came from all over the place...or else monsters that had become legends in their own lifetimes.`
`In all seriousness, her so-called 'fan club' had enough size and influence that it could have suddenly declared itself a separate country in the sea of Fragments without anyone being overly surprised.`
`"...This is quite a problem for us, with Lady Lambdadelta all ready for action.`
` Without any regard for us, she keeps calling up friends and acquaintances on the phone from all over the place, telling them to come over..."`
`...Of course, this was all a lie.`
`Lambdadelta had turned into a small candy comet and was now shooting towards the City of Books, with Battler and Ange in tow.`
`So, to make sure that Lambdadelta's and Battler's absences were not noticed,`
` everyone was crowded around the arbor, pretending to argue furiously with each other...`
`"Battler-sama, give us your decision!!`
` We, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, are prepared for death at any time!!"`
`"I firmly oppose taking a last stand that would lead to our deaths!`
` What could possibly be gained by dying?"`
`"How can you be such a coward?!`
` It is inconceivable that we should live on in shame as prisoners!"`
`"There are times when the mere fact of being alive gives one opportunities."`
`"...Yes, indeed.`
` A short temper makes a bad leader..."`
`"Battler, if you call yourself a man, now's the time to act like one!`
` The Great Lambdadelta-sama is even willing to help out, right?!"`
`"I agree!`
` These are the times when a man has to make a tough decision...!"`
`"...In many cases, the timing of a decision is more valuable than the decision itself."`
`"I-If we surrender, they might not be violent..."`
`"You can't be serious!!`
` Weren't you supposed to be a male lion?!`
` Where are your fangs now?!!"`
`"If death awaits us regardless, I would rather die as a wolf than a pig."`
`"Are you stupid?!`
` Are you saying you want to die like a dog?!"`
`"......It all depends on the strength of the support Lambdadelta-san can provide..."`
`"Lambdadelta-san,`
` are your friends really strong enough to win against them...?"`
`"...It's a bet.`
` We'll either surrender and die, or we'll lose a bet and die."`
`"Interesting.`
` In that case, our chances for survival must be higher if we take that bet."`
`"...An honorable surrender will surely cause the Great Court to show MERCY."`
`"They're backed by the Senate, aren't they?`
` Sure, they'll hem and haw, but we'll all see the guillotine in the end."`
`"A-Anyway, let's all calm down...!`
` Cool your heads...!`
` I'm opposed to letting our emotions control us!"`
`"Why don't you calm down first?`
` ...We have another possible strategy: mutually assured destruction.`
` We might not be able to win, but if we can convince them that we plan on taking enough of them with us, that might force our opponents to show restraint."`
`"So, basically,`
` if they're determined to attack, we'll let them know we aren't going down without doing some damage first!!"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihi!!`
` All of Lambdadelta's friends are incredible...!!`
` She knows lots and lots of witches, beasts, demons and gods, all of which have really, really huge legends and histories!`
` Even if those ships outnumbered the stars in the sky, Lambdadelta's friends would wipe them out with a single blast!`
` Kihihihihi!!"`
`"......W-Will this really work?`
` ...She hasn't seen through our act yet, has she...?"`
`"It is working.`
` You must speak more forcefully as well.`
` Do not worry about politeness."`
`"Enough, you gutless swine!!`
` Do you lack the backbone to finish with a bang?!!"`
`"H-H-H-Hold on...!`
` Don't forget that some of us are opposed to fighting!`
` I think we should surrender!!"`
`"Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!`
` Gooooooooooohda, you loser-loving foooooooooooooool!!"`
`"Ah, ow, ouch, Master, it's j-just an act, gyaaarrrrgghhh!!"`
`"Well, it looks like the debate has gotten quite heated!!"`
`"So, will we surrender?!`
` Or will we fight back?! Which will it be?!"`
`""Nobody knows!!""`
`"Personally speaking, I would like to surrender.`
` ...If my role will end either way, I would prefer that my game board be preserved the way I made it.`
` ...I could not bear to have Lady Lambdadelta continue to use it however she pleases."`
`"...We don't want that either.`
` I came here to fight you, but I'm no match for Lady Lambdadelta's friends."`
`Secretly, Erika was getting worried by these complicated developments.`
`And, she was relieved that she hadn't pushed too hard earlier on.`
`She wanted to flatter Beato and end this with a bloodless takeover.`
`Even the Great Lady Lambdadelta probably wouldn't seriously think of picking a fight with the Senate.`
`Her motive was probably something much more trivial, a simple desire to watch the game board's final fireworks from a front row seat.`
`However, ...if she really did have some fireworks of her own prepared,`
` ...it was at least possible that this could turn into a ruckus that Erika would have no chance of quelling.`
`......Beato saw all of this going on in Erika's mind.`
`So, she continued to act with an even more pathetic expression on her face.`
`Even among witches, her acting ability was top-notch.`
`"...Might you be willing to lend us some of your strength,`
` so that my game board's beauty will be preserved?`
` ...Truly, it was a great error to invite that busybody as a guest.`
` ...Haha..."`
`"...I understand.`
` I'd like to end this quietly too, if I can.`
` So, how can we work together?"`
`"For some time now, we have been arguing over whether we should surrender or resist.`
` I intend to return to them and propose that we surrender and ask Lady Lambdadelta not to do anything that might destroy the game board."`
`"That would please me very much.`
` So, what should I do?"`
`"I would like you to guarantee that we have the necessary time to debate the matter.`
` ...After all, your ships are surrounding and pressuring us at the moment.`
` Everyone is so tense at the thought that we may be attacked at any time that they're falling apart.`
` So, if you guarantee that we will have enough time to discuss this amongst ourselves, everyone will surely be able to keep their composure during that time.`
` ...Furthermore, I will have enough time to convince Lady Lambdadelta."`
`".........`
`...Very well.`
` About how long do you need?"`
`"Would you be gracious and avoid giving a specific time limit?`
` ...If a time limit is imposed, everyone will just fall apart again as the limit nears, possibly leading to a more radical decision..."`
`"...You have a point there.`
` The most important thing about a fuse is whether it's lit or not.`
` The length of the fuse is a trivial matter."`
`"In that case, ...will you give us the time we need?"`
`"Understood.`
` I guarantee that you'll have time to discuss it.`
` However, that time won't be unlimited.`
` I'll wait here and listen in on your discussion."`
`"Well, as far as that goes, ...it is true that your mere presence here has everyone on edge..."`
`"I have already made my concessions.`
` Isn't it your turn now?"`
`"............"`
`They were some distance away from the arbor, but it was just close enough to give a general idea of what was going on.`
`It was far enough that they just might be able to hide the fact that Battler and Lambdadelta were missing,`
` ...just far enough for them to convincingly act like this was a white-hot argument in gridlock.`
`If it were possible, they would rather have kept Erika at an even greater distance.`
`They had planned to set up a seat of honor for their guest at one of the far corners of the garden maze...`
`"......Is there some sort of problem?"`
`"Okay, okay.`
` Don't make such a scary face...`
` In that case, please wait here.`
` ...This is a, um, confidential conference!`
` So, you must, uh,`
` come no closer than this line...!"`
`Beato drew a line in the ground with her foot.`
`"Help them see me in a good light.`
` If it's clear that I have obtained a generous agreement from you, that will be a powerful weapon in my hands in the debate."`
`"......Could I get a chair?"`
`"Y-Yes, yes, of course!`
` Chiester Troops, bring Lady Erika a chair and umbrella at once...!`
` And a hand towel too!`
` I'll wipe it nice and clean for you...!"`
`"........."`
`"Milady, have there been any developments in our negotiations...?"`
`"Wahahahahaha...`
` If anything's certain, it's that I'll be winning this year's prize for best actress...!"`
`"That's our Beatrice-sama!"`
`"All we can do is argue fiercely, squabble amongst ourselves, `
`and make it look like things will turn for the worse if negotiations break down."`
`"Indeed.`
` This is yet another fight to support Battler's group.`
` Get yourselves ready, everyone.`
` Let us argue and insult with all we have.`
` Got it...?!"`
`"Mmm, mmyes, Master!"`
`The sight of Gohda, his cheek red and swollen from being pinched, made everyone snort, `
`but they quickly covered their mouths and put fingers to their lips...`
`Then, everyone nodded at each other, and the fake argument resumed.`
`Erika was sitting in the chair that the Chiester Sisters had brought her, filling a goat in on the details of their discussions.`
`The goats would probably return and tell the rest of the fleet.`
`The fleet would tell Bernkastel,`
` and Bernkastel might think of some plan to deal with this situation or give new orders.`
`The conversation with the goat ended, and it spun around.`
`...It would return to the dinghy and report on this to the fleet.`
`It slipped out from a rose bush and passed through the garden maze, heading towards the door that led outside...`
`...Is it really okay to let that goat reach the boats...?`
`If it goes back, Erika's report will reach Bernkastel's ears...`
`The Chiester Sisters spoke through a secret channel that only they could use.`
`"......2 seconds nyeh.`
` Won't even be a sound nyeh..."`
`"...It's just about to leave Erika's sphere of awareness.`
` ...Estimated 10 seconds before it reaches the goat boatman's sphere, so assassination can be carried out successfully."`
`"Lady Beatrice,`
` your permission to assassinate, if you please.`
` ...We can do it. Erika will sense nothing."`
`"You do not have permission.`
` Did you think an envoy would leave their ship without setting a time limit?`
` The fleet probably has orders to attack if it isn't contacted within a certain period of time.`
` Let that goat go."`
`"00, understood."`
`The goat passed through the door.`
`Then, after receiving a silent bow from Shannon and Kanon, it got on the dinghy and returned to the fleet.`
`The fleet would probably follow Erika's orders and stand by until an attack order was given.`
`...That gave the residents of the Golden Land a chance to assassinate Erika, `
`...but of course, that wasn't going to be possible, practically speaking.`
`She was Bernkastel's greatest underling, and a witch who controlled truth.`
`Tricking her was all they could hope for.`
` Anything else would be overconfident...`
`"Why don't you all have a seat too?"`
`"...You need have no worries about us."`
`Without any hint that she had just been talking about assassinations,`
` 00 stood upright with her hands clasped behind her back...`
`Surrender, or resist until the end.`
`The false argument resumed.`
`Just how far and how long would they be able to trick Erika?`
`Yes. ...The final fight for the Golden Land...had already begun.`
`"......Battler,`
` you can count on us to handle things here.`
` ...It's time for you and Ange to take this final game back...!"`
`"...This is one freakishly huge library..."`
`"I've heard that each one of these books has a tale like ours inside it."`
`"After all, ...this is a world of gods."`
`"You can tell at a glance that it's no place for scum like you to be in, right?"`
`After passing through the barrier, the three of them had finally made it inside the City of Books.`
`For some time, they were overcome by the countless otherworldly sights before them, but they quickly remembered their original objective.`
`"Are you listening?`
` First off, don't get the wrong idea.`
` ...You two came here to fight Bern,`
` but that doesn't mean walking up to her and attacking her directly, okay?"`
`"......We know."`
`"In the first place,`
` you were only able to fight the Great Beatrice on an even footing because the game board protected you with rules that made it that way.`
` If you leave the game board,`
` ...you're more like something that'll leave a small stain on her palm when she swats you.`
` Don't forget that, got it?"`
`"...Makes sense.`
` ...This isn't the game board we're familiar with."`
`"We didn't come here to fight.`
` ...We came here to take something back with us."`
`"Exactly.`
` ...You're here to prevent the Book of the Single Truth from being exposed to the public.`
` That's your only goal, your only fight.`
` You'd better not be confused about that."`
`Battler and Ange nodded to show their understanding.`
`"The Book of the Single Truth itself is being displayed openly in the middle of the party, so stealing that'll be impossible.`
` ...However, bringing in the key is gonna be a big part of the ceremony."`
`"Which means the key must be stored in a different place."`
`"...But there's no guarantee that it'll be undefended."`
`"After that, it's all up to your luck.`
` I hope it's good, for your sakes.`
` ......! Hide!!"`
`Lambdadelta pulled her head back from around the corner of a bookshelf.`
`The others hurriedly followed suit.`
`...In the distance, they saw emerald green lights floating about and leaving trails.`
`"Those are Bern's cat familiars.`
` ...She's got them patrolling all over the place today."`
`"...Did she guess that we would come?"`
`"No.`
` Don't forget how huge this place is.`
` Those are staff cats, out looking for idiot guests who've gotten lost so they can be taken to the lost children area."`
`"And that's not where we want to go at the moment."`
`"...If it looks like one's about to find us, ...should we take them out...?"`
`"I'd advise against it.`
` ...Maybe if this were some other territory or game board,`
` ...but this is Bern's home base.`
` That single cat should make you as scared as being surrounded by a crowd of vicious beasts.`
` ...Plus, they're cats.`
` They've got good senses, and they'll call for their friends.`
` ...If they spot you, you'd better be prepared for what happens next.`
` I'm not going to save you.`
` ...Just getting you here has been troublesome enough."`
`"...If I surrender,`
` ...I might get off the hook with being stripped naked and thrown into the worst sort of crappy Fragment for just a century.`
` ...How wonderful. I think I can sympathize with Bern's feelings a bit now."`
`Lambdadelta wasn't laughing.`
` Most likely, even this punishment she spoke of was pretty optimistic.`
`Even though she keeps saying that she won't help anymore...`
`She's already risking everything.`
`Why?`
`"...Isn't it obvious?"`
`Lambdadelta brushed her hair back and grinned.`
`"It's because you're gonna show me the perfect happy ending!"`
`Lambdadelta hugged their heads at the same time, making their foreheads bonk together.`
`"You'd better show me, for certain...!"`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...We'll certainly show you a happy ending!"`
`"We'll...certainly take this cat box back...!"`
`"Let's go.`
` ...This way. And swim quietly."`
`The three of them swam out into the darkness of the deep ocean trench that was the City of Books.`
`In that massive, vast trench of bookshelves, they vanished into the darkness almost immediately.`
`The library defied the common sense of the human world.`
`...The City of Books.`
`The word 'city' was no exaggeration.`
`And, it was filled with the green, glowing eyes of Bernkastel's countless cat familiars.`
`Trying to count them would be almost as crazy as counting all the fish in the ocean.`
`They formed schools that swam all over the place,`
` ...on the lookout for any fools who might miraculously have managed to slip in and disturb their master's party.`
`If Battler's group was found, the cats would report it instantly.`
`They would probably form a pack, open their large mouths and swallow them in a single gulp.`
`...There would be no fight.`
`In this place, Battler's party would be swallowed like tiny fishes if they were discovered.`
`The warships surrounding the Golden Land were well more than a hundred strong.`
`Each of them had dozens of cannons pointing at the door to the Golden Land.`
`The goats that packed the decks of the ships numbered in the tens of thousands.`
`Each one of them carried enough anti-magic toxin in their fangs to completely deny one of the game board pieces.`
`This time, they would chew apart and eat away everything.`
` ...The crowd of goats unleashed their rotten breath and dangling drool.`
`At that time, Erika, who wanted to avoid trouble and hoped Beato would be able to convince Lambdadelta to surrender peacefully,`
` was sitting alone, calmly enjoying the tea Ronove had poured for her.`
`Of course, even Erika wasn't planning to give them unlimited time.`
` In her mind, she had already decided to allow them three yawns before stepping in.`
`"...This actually isn't so bad.`
` ...Getting to watch Beato try and convince everyone as they call her a coward and a loser."`
`"Indeed, it is impressive that our short-tempered mistress has managed to become such an adult.`
` ...Pu ku ku ku."`
`"...What's so funny?"`
`"Oh, pardon me.`
` ...Are you ready for another cup?`
` Please feel free to enjoy our collection of great teas from across the globe at your leisure."`
`"Lambda is leading Beato's side into an all-out resistance...?`
` And she's gathering her friends?`
` ......Is this a joke?"`
`The messenger cat shook its head, then continued to dispassionately meow its report.`
`"...Even Lambda isn't that stupid.`
` She should know what it means to have Auau as her enemy..."`
`Even as she said this, Bernkastel was chewing away at her thumbnail...`
`"Despite how she looks, that kid has a lot of strange friends...`
` And they're all idly curious, crazy monsters...`
` ...Even so, to take up arms against the Senate......"`
`......It was possible...`
`She could think of many monsters among Lambdadelta's friends who would love to see a losing side gain support and make a comeback victory...`
`Before she realized it, the finger Bernkastel was biting was covered with sweat.`
`"...She could do it.`
` ...She really is a moron sometimes, after all!`
` Get me a phone, quickly!!"`
`The cat leapt away, then flew back with a phone and receiver.`
`"I'm going to call up her friends...!`
` ...I have to warn them not to get involved in this stupid game...!`
` Umm, ...phone numbers, phone numbers...`
` ......Why don't I have any phone numbers saved in here...?`
` Oh, right, I have no friends...`
` Umm, ...how were you supposed to greet people over the phone? Does 'hello' work?!"`
`"Meow!"`
`The golden key was being kept in a room inside the City of Books.`
`However, perhaps 'room' wasn't a fitting word to use.`
`It was large enough that you could probably fit two domed baseball stadiums in it, if you tried.`
`Even so, in this city, these were called 'rooms'.`
`Floating in the center of this vast room...were several sacred magic circles.`
`Wrapped around by these magic circles...was Ange's gold key.`
`Surrounding these were countless emerald green stars, which looked like a slowly revolving planetarium.`
`The eyes that numbered the same as the stars...were all glaring in the same direction.`
`"...Come on, don't look at me like that.`
` I'm on your side. Did you forget?"`
`One of the cats cat-paddled towards EVA,`
` meowing that no one was allowed to enter this room.`
`"Lady Bernkastel has ordered me to guard that key.`
` So, why don't you leave this to me and get lost?"`
`After looking at each other with suspicious eyes, the cats glared at EVA again, `
`as though saying that they hadn't heard any such order.`
`"By the way,`
` ...cats have pretty soft bodies, don't they?"`
`"""......??"""`
`"Makes them much easier to chew."`
`EVA lifted up her golden staff...and the floor and ceiling of the vast room were covered with red lines.`
`The reaction from the cats was lightning fast.`
` They realized instantly that this was hostile behavior.`
`The entire emerald green constellation writhed and became a single, massive deep-sea fish, `
`which charged at EVA with its cavernous mouth open wide.`
`However, at the same time, the red lines on the floor and ceiling--the massive spiderweb--pinched itself together and crushed the fish, `
`twisted it, spun it around and around, ...and compressed it into the size of a small ball.`
`Then, that ball-shaped thing burst open, leaving nothing left.`
`It all happened in an instant.`
`"If only you'd just give up and diiiiiiie!`
` Ahhahahahaha!!!"`
`The Witch Hunters were holding a convention in the event hall.`
`After all, when Ushiromiya Eva's diary was opened, ...the endless cat box would be lost, along with the countless imagined stories that had entertained them for so long.`
`So, this final convention was a time for them to air their best theories one last time.`
`While the opening of the cat box did give them a slightly lonely feeling,`
` they couldn't contain their excitement as intellectual rapists, `
`not when they knew that the Rokkenjima mystery was finally going to be solved, once and for all.`
`...If that box were opened, ...a single girl would be hurt.`
`However, their jaws and fangs couldn't care less.`
`The witch-hunting goat nobles kept licking their lips, ...wanting to chew apart the guts of Beatrice's cat box as soon as they could...`
`Seated upon a solemn throne so tall it looked like a pillar,`
` Featherine listened in on the nonsense being spewed from the mouths of the goat nobles.`
`A black cat wearing a cape silently appeared and whispered something into Featherine's ear.`
`"......`
`No, that is fine.`
` ...Everything is going according to my plot.`
` ...You need not inform my miko."`
`The cat bowed humbly and vanished.`
`Featherine raised her wine glass high...and laughed as she looked through it to the light of the chandelier,`
` which was as beautiful and majestic as the moon.`
`"This should be enough to thank you for your excellent reading, child of man.`
` ...Well now.`
` ...Just who is weaving this tale?`
` ...Am I for you?`
` Or are you for me?`
` ...Heh, ...heheheheheheh."`
`"...What do you think?"`
`"A trap?"`
`...As Battler's group moved forward, darting from bookshelf to bookshelf and avoiding the eyes of the cats,`
` they found something strange.`
`Written with a faintly glowing, red substance...was a letter and an arrow.`
`K↝`
`That's what it looked like to them.`
`"...Do you think 'K' means key?"`
`"Those marks only appeared when we got close.`
`"Is there anyone here besides us who'd be willing to help...?"`
`"...I didn't think we had any allies."`
`Ange traced the red arrow with her finger.`
`...It was written with very faint, thin strings that had been tied together.`
`This red stuff, which stuck to your finger and tore away like cotton candy had to be...`
`"There is someone on our side.`
` ...Someone...who's always been on my side."`
`"...How can you be so sure?"`
`"......`
`...Yeah, I get it too now.`
` ...Lambda,`
` we can trust the person who wrote this.`
` She'll probably be able to guide us to the key safely."`
`"Are you sure?`
` Then let's go...!`
` We don't have time to be standing around!"`
`"......Thank you, ...Mom...!"`
`In the arbor, the argument over whether they should surrender or fight continued without signs of stopping.`
`Every now and then, a small fight would break out, which fortunately ended up delaying Erika's third yawn.`
`However, they didn't know how long they would have to continue this fake fight.`
`Keeping this high level of tension going was physically stressful.`
`The instant they tired out and the tension faded, Erika would probably demand a verdict.`
`They had to constantly appear to be trapped and agitated.`
`...It was a battle of weariness and tension.`
`This was their fight.`
`Erika waited patiently.`
`Now that she had tired of tea, she was watching Ronove perform some magic tricks, `
`and seemed to be enjoying herself considerably.`
`...Even Ronove, who was usually aloof from the world, was fighting.`
`If Erika got bored and had a tantrum, an all-out attack would probably begin at once.`
`He was also putting his life on the line in the fight to buy time for Battler's group...`
`As the fiercest leader in the argument, Beato wore out the quickest.`
`She breathed heavily, and her face was so pale, it seemed she might faint at any moment.`
`"...Beato, hang in there.`
` Your body won't hold out much longer at this rate."`
`"Pretend to suddenly burst into tears and rest for a while.`
` We'll pick up the slack."`
`"I am still...fine...`
` ...I can do this, ...just one more push.`
` Let's go...!!`
` So, who's up next? Who wants to be beaten down first?!"`
`"In that case, I, Gohda, am prepared...!!`
` W-We must fight!!`
` It would be outrageous to accept defeat without fighting!!`
` As I've said from the beginning, fighting with all we have is the only option!!"`
`"......Hold on a second."`
`Erika suddenly rose from her chair.`
`Ronove tried to coax her back into her seat, but Erika's attention was completely focused on those arguing under the arbor.`
`"......I am...the detective.`
` My memory of what I hear is as good as a recording."`
`"We are aware of that, of course...`
` You are quite an excellent detective, after all..."`
`"I'm not interested in you.`
` ...Gohda-san,`
` I have one question for you."`
`"...Y-Yes ma'am!`
` ...Have I done something to cause offense...?"`
`"'Hold on.`
` Don't forget that some of us are opposed to fighting.`
` I think we should surrender.'`
` ...Those were the first words I heard from you when I arrived here.`
` However, you just said this:`
` 'We must fight.`
` It would be outrageous to accept defeat without fighting.`
` As I've said from the beginning, fighting with all we have is the only option.'`
` ...That's what you said."`
`"W-Well, uh...did I say that...?"`
`"...It is hardly strange for an opinion to change in the course of a discussion."`
`"I-I-Indeed...!`
` All of us have been feeling doubts about our position lately, so an occasional change of opinion wouldn't be...!"`
`"No.`
` ...From beginning to end, no one has changed their opinion in this argument.`
` Just now, Gohda-san alone flipped his position 180 degrees.`
` ...Furthermore, I can't imagine that any of the statements made by the rest of you were sufficient to make Gohda-san switch his position."`
`An uncomfortable, moist wind blew by.`
`Everyone was silent, frozen as though time had stopped.`
`In that silence, Erika continued with a blank expression.`
`"......This can lead us to two conclusions.`
` First, ...it may be that Gohda-san has no opinion...and is just a loser who will say anything that goes with the flow.`
` Second, ...it may be that none of you has an opinion, and that this entire argument exists only for its own sake."`
`"Aren't you...overthinking this a bit...?`
` Here we are, in a desperate debate that will decide our fate.`
` I hardly think it strange that some people would act abnormally under such pressure..."`
`"The only reason for prolonging a meaningless argument is to buy time.`
` ...Do you have anything to gain by buying time?`
` ...Is it because Lady Lambdadelta's reinforcements will come?`
` ...That can't be true either."`
`"After all, for some time now,`
` I have heard all of you speak to Lady Lambdadelta and Battler occasionally, but not once have I heard them reply.`
` ...Taking all of this into account, we are left with only one conclusion."`
`That Lady Lambdadelta and Battler are not here now.`
`And, that these people have won Lady Lambdadelta's assistance, ...with Lady Lambdadelta and Battler probably planning to sneak into the City of Books.`
`In which case, their goal is probably to steal back the golden key...and Ange.`
`And your plan was to act as bait and buy time until their mission was complete.`
`"...But because of Gohda-san's single poorly-chosen line,`
` ...this level of reasoning is possible for Furudo Erika.`
` ......What do you think,`
` everyone...?"`
`With a blank...yet ruthless expression, Erika spoke these words and returned to her seat.`
`Everyone else was frozen, unable to move.`
` No one spoke.`
`...However, time was moving.`
`As evidence, ...a bead of sweat dripped down someone's cheek, fell, ...and hit the table with a tiny yet audible splat.`
`Then, frozen time shattered, and in the same instant, the white chair Erika had been sitting in broke apart.`
`The stakes of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory and the high-velocity rounds from the Chiester Sisters Corps hit the chair at exactly the same time.`
`And a few moments after that, the Erika sitting in that chair faded and vanished.`
`"...Afterimage!!"`
`"She's fast!! Kill her!!!"`
`In an instant, Erika had moved to a spot behind the chair.`
`Her expression remained as blank as it had been before.`
`However, there was now something in her hand that hadn't been there.`
`As the seven lightning strikes of the Seven Sisters raced at her once more, she batted all of them away with her scythe.`
`"That was one hell of a farce.`
` But the tea was good. Thanks for the meal.`
` ...Well now, it seems that you've all been in agreement since the start.`
` ...Allow me to ask for your answer once again."`
`Erika lifted her left hand, the one that wasn't holding the scythe.`
`"Very well, allow me to answer...!!`
` This Golden Land belongs to me, to all of us!!`
` If you enter with your shoes on, we'll give you a proper welcome!!`
` In other words, to put it elegantly..."`
`"......All cannons, prepare to fire.`
` Target: the Golden Land."`
`"Wash your face in miso soooooooooooooooooup!!!"`
`"Shoot 'em deeeeeeeeeeeeeeead!!!"`
`"...Yes, thank you.`
` ...See you around.`
` ...Meow."`
`Bernkastel set down the receiver and crossed out yet another name on a list of Lambdadelta's notable friends.`
`Something was wrong.`
` Not a single person she called had heard anything from Lambdadelta.`
`They weren't just playing dumb.`
` They really knew nothing about the strange ruckus Lambdadelta was trying to stir up.`
`Even Bernkastel was starting to suspect that something was fishy...`
`Then, a black cat leapt in and meowed a frantic report.`
`"Lambda and Battler aren't in the Golden Land...?!`
` ............`
`...Hah, ...hahhhhahahaahahahhhaah!!!"`
`She tore the phone receiver from its stand.`
`The number she dialed was short.`
` It was probably an internal line.`
`However, after listening to it ring several times, she slammed the receiver down again, finally managing to break the phone.`
`"...Gather all the cats who aren't busy. This is an emergency!!!`
` The cats I had guarding the key aren't responding!!!`
` ......Lambdaaaaaaaaaaagggaaaaaaaaahhhh!!"`
`Bernkastel, overwhelmed with emotion, kicked the table over.`
`Then, ...the room finally grew bright.`
`It was like green sunlight.`
`A bright green light waved about, giving the illusion that a green sun was rising and lighting the room up.`
`It was a sign that Bernkastel's army had been given an emergency summons...`
`"Come, my kitties!!!`
` It's time for a witch hunt!!`
` That kid always smells like candy, so you'll find her pretty fast!!`
` The first cat who finds her gets a human form and a witch's title!!!"`
`What was now an emerald green nebula let out a roar of delight that shook the bookshelf cliff...`
`"...Something's chasing us..."`
`"What...is that...?`
` ...A green...sun...?"`
`"...Hide!!`
` They know!!"`
`The three of them frantically hid behind a bookshelf.`
`The room with the key in it was straight ahead.`
`They could see something glinting faintly in the darkness of that room.`
`It was a glint different from anything else they had seen so far in this city.`
`The color of the glint...was gold.`
`They had almost reached the golden key.`
`However, if they went towards it, Bernkastel would be right behind them, along with her vast swarm of familiars.`
`In other words, they were trapped in a dead end.`
`They already knew that the emerald green color came from the eyes of the familiars.`
`However, ...it was almost beyond comprehension that this undulating green sun could be the same thing, `
`...and they could do nothing except stare in wide-eyed shock...`
`The countless cats were passing through the ravine of bookshelves, from the very top to the very bottom.`
` As they approached, they painstakingly checked the gaps between each book.`
`However, even this mind-numbingly huge task was accomplished swiftly, thanks to the sheer number of familiars.`
`With the speed of a gust of wind, ...they carefully checked every nook and cranny.`
`There was no way to hide from this green sun.`
`That would have been as foolish as trying to hide from water on a sinking ship.`
`"...Will we be able to hide until they pass us...?!"`
`"No...`
` At this rate, we'll be found no matter where we go...!"`
`Battler was just about to leap out from the shadows, but Lambdadelta grabbed him by the collar an instant before.`
`"Are you thinking of fighting?!"`
`"No, but we'll be found if we just stand here...!`
` So we have to move forward!`
` We need to reach the key as soon as possible...!"`
`"You really think there won't be cats guarding the key?!`
` We'll just be pinched between them!!"`
`"I believe in Aunt Eva...!`
` She's the one who guided us this far...!`
` I'm sure she took care of the guard cats too!"`
`"I agree.`
` If we're going to be found anyway, let's try and get there as fast as possible and grab the key.`
` If we can just do that, no one will be able to open the book!!"`
`"...So, you'll rush in there and grab the key.`
` And then what?!`
` That place is a dead end, right?!`
` You realize there'll be nowhere to run, don't you?!"`
`"We know that, but...!!"`
`"The key will be our trump card.`
` ...It's vitally important to Bernkastel too.`
` ...If worst comes to worst, we might be able to use the key as a bargaining chip..."`
`"Bargain with Bern?!`
` ...You're insane!!"`
`"But if we hide here, we'll definitely be found.`
` ...In that case, I'll take a bet on that billion-to-one chance.`
` We'll get the key and have that be our trump card."`
`"So, you're praying for a miracle...to win against the Witch of Miracles...?"`
`"Picking a winner out of astronomically bad odds.`
` That's the Ushiromiya family's magic...!!"`
`"......I've got good eyesight, so let me enlighten you.`
` Can you see those magic circles around the golden key?`
` ...That's a simple barrier, but a pretty strong one.`
` ...It'll break if you just touch it,`
` but it's the sort of annoying seal that'll take exactly one hour to fade, whether a great witch or a lowly Human does it.`
` It's still over an hour before the ceremony begins.`
` ...In other words, we won't even be able to touch the key unless we can buy time for a whole hour!!"`
`"When Aunt Eva took out the guard cats, she must've broken the magic circle too!`
` It probably won't take an hour...!"`
`"As far as I can see, the magic circle is still intact.`
` Sorry to say it, but even if Eva did touch it, it was less than an hour ago."`
`"Well, what's an hour?`
` At least we know we can grab it if we manage to stick around that long!"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...Sure, let's play tag for an hour.`
` I'm used to getting chased around by thugs."`
`"You two really are out of your minds...!!`
` You're really planning to play tag against Bern and all her cats?!"`
`"If there's even a 1% chance!"`
`"You can be certain that we'll grab it...!!"`
`The difference in enthusiasm between the siblings, who had everything to lose, and Lambdadelta...was immense.`
`However, Lambdadelta was no coward.`
`She was a great witch of the Senate.`
` ...If she surrendered, she wouldn't be able to escape severe punishment, but she would be forgiven after a few hundred years.`
`Why would she, after being thrown into a stormy sea while clutching a buoy that could save only her, decide to throw that buoy away?`
`No living person could be as determined as those siblings, who were already fighting for their lives.`
` No one could blame Lambda.`
`"......You two really are stupid, you know that?`
` ...Ah, well.`
` Why don't I tell you about a plan that's got a bit more than a 1% chance of working?`
` How does that sound?"`
`The two siblings looked at each other.`
`However, they both thought that any plan would be worth listening to, even if it would only raise their chances by 0.00001%.`
`"A sacrifice.`
` ...Bern is a cat. She'll chase fleeing prey, but she'll also kill prey that doesn't flee.`
` And only after toying with it first!"`
`"Cats are terrible people..."`
`"...Still, if that's true, ...it'll be worth betting on."`
`"Let's have one sacrifice.`
` We'll decide with rock-paper-scissors.`
` ...Whoever loses has to go taunt Bern, then get laughed at and killed, all to buy as much time as possible.`
` ...Does that work for you?"`
`"No need for rock-paper-scissors.`
` I'll do it.`
` You two go on to the key room."`
`"No way, Onii-chan...!!`
` I'll do it.`
` This is all my responsibility.`
` ...I was the one who listened to Bernkastel and trusted her.`
` ...So, I've got a thing or two to say to her!"`
`Both Battler and Ange decided to be the sacrifice and wouldn't listen to the other.`
`"See?`
` You need rock-paper-scissors to decide, right?`
` If you don't act quickly, we won't even have a chance to use this plan.`
` ...They'll be here any moment."`
`"...Okay.`
` ...Either Ange or I will be the sacrifice.`
` ...Lambdadelta, you'll take whoever's left, steal the key, and take them back to the Golden Land."`
`"I won't let you do it,`
` Onii-chan."`
`"Quit joking around.`
` You've got to let me act like a big brother at least once in a while."`
`"There's no time.`
` Rock-paper-scissors, single round!`
` I'm super paper, so of course we'll start with that.`
` Got it, you two?"`
`"Fine."`
`"No regrets, okay?"`
`"3, 2, 1, paper!!"`
`It really was a stupid kid's game of rock-paper-scissors.`
`Since they'd promised to start with paper, ...this was a chance to make a surprise attack and use something else.`
`However, both Battler and Ange chose rock.`
`...And yet, it wasn't a tie.`
`Because in addition to those two rocks...was one person who chose scissors.`
`After staring stupidly at their fists and those scissors, ...they looked at her.`
`"......Ah, dang...`
` ...We were supposed to start with paper, so I figured I'd use scissors and beat you both.`
` I guess paper should've stuck with paper."`
`There had been no reason for Lambdadelta to join in on the game.`
`This wasn't the time for a joke like that.`
`Battler and Ange, each trying to lose, ...chose rock.`
`Lambdadelta alone...chose scissors.`
`"Don't tell me...you intentionally..."`
`"If you die, we can't even get back to the Golden Land...!`
` It doesn't count!"`
`"Well then, you can just use this."`
`When Lambdadelta made a clenched fist, a palely glowing Fragment appeared there, and she gave it to the pair of them.`
`Battler had seen one of these before.`
` It was a magic Fragment, like the one Erika had used before disappearing, which would allow one to cross the sea of Fragments.`
`"With that, you'll be able to return to the Golden Land.`
` And anyway, I'm the best person for the job.`
` You two probably wouldn't last a handful of seconds against Bern.`
` If it's me, not only will an hour be no problem, but who knows? I might even win.`
` And I owe her one.`
` I've got to make this my victory and even the score.`
` ...Still, away games are such a pain."`
`Lambdadelta pretended to complain as she stood up straight.`
`"Anyway, see you in a bit.`
` ...I guess a show-off like me couldn't stick to being a spectator after all.`
` Sorry for stealing your time to shine.`
` ...It's sad that I won't be able to watch your game until the end,`
` ...but I've already been shown the script, so I'm not missing anything."`
`"......Lambda..."`
`Then, with her broadest smile and a wink...`
`"This is your happy ending!`
` I've already figured out what happens next, so there's no need to watch.`
` I'll see the two of you again.`
` In the credit roll of your happy ending, that is!"`
`"...W-Wait...!!"`
`Lambdadelta snapped her fingers, and the two of them turned into konpeitou candies.`
`She picked them up, ...took aim at the glint of the golden key, ...and flicked them away.`
`That way, they should be able to reach the key without Bernkastel noticing...`
`Dang, what terrible luck.`
`What were the odds of them both playing a rock against my scissors?`
`......Yeah, I know.`
`It wasn't nice of me to test you like that.`
` Sorry, you two.`
`And then, ...Lambdadelta's body was lit up by an emerald green light...`
`When she turned around, the cat's eyes and Lambdadelta's...met.`
`Lambdadelta grinned and waved...`
`There was a fierce roar and several bright flashes.`
`"What in the...?`
` ...?!?!"`
`A chain of explosions flashed by one after another, enveloping Bernkastel and her pack of familiars in an instant.`
`They were multicolored fireworks.`
` ...Or rather, multicolored candy that burst with a flash and scattered everywhere.`
`Countless stick candies, sugar sculptures, cookies and tarts flew in every direction,`
` and each one of those split and exploded into hundreds of candies,`
` each of which exploded again into a cloud of konpeitou.`
`However, these sweets weren't sweet.`
`The konpeito was heavier than lead, harder than steel, and sharper than any blade.`
`As the colorful cloud exploded outward, it blasted the entire pack of cats into little bits.`
`The emerald green glints were scattered everywhere and sparkled like the night sky,`
` and among them danced a cloud of pretty candies that looked like they'd go well on a Christmas tree.`
`It was sufficiently outrageous and beautiful and cute to mark the Great Witch Lady Lambdadelta's appearance on the scene.`
`"...Oh, if it isn't Lambda.`
` ...I was hoping to meet you in the party hall."`
`"I love you, Bern.`
` Isn't whispering of our love all the better if we're alone?"`
`"...I'll be happy to hear it, after I've plucked off all your limbs."`
`With a jerk of her chin, Bern ordered her familiars to attack.`
`"This is my dearly beloved and my only friend in the world.`
` Her arms from the elbow down. Her legs from the knees down.`
` You can chew those up however you please.`
` But not a scratch anywhere else on her."`
`The crowd of cats undulated again, reformed into a single mass,`
` and became the emerald green Leviathan that would swallow up any poor victims who snuck into the City of Books.`
`It was shaped like an impossibly vast whale.`
`However, would it look like a whale from Lambda's perspective?`
`She probably couldn't see anything except an immense mouth about to swallow up everything.`
`"Ah, simply wonderful.`
` I'm about to be overwhelmed by Bern's love, aren't I?!"`
`"...I do love you, Lambda.`
` Once your limbs are gone, I'll skewer you through your butt and hang you by my bed.`
` Every morning, I'll give you a good morning kiss, and every evening, I'll kiss you goodnight."`
`"Sounds great!`
` Then I'd better wrap you up in my love too!!!"`
`However, Lambdadelta's war cry was swallowed up by the glowing, writhing Leviathan in a single bite.`
`"......*giggle*`
` Yes, you are wonderful, Lambda.`
` I love that empty-headed way you just do things without looking ahead or worrying about your own life.`
` ......?`
` ...Wind...?"`
`At the same instant that Lambdadelta was swallowed and Bernkastel was sure of her victory, the latter felt a slight breeze playing with her hair.`
`The countless sweets that Lambdadelta had sent flying like fireworks, and which drifted about like the decorations at a Christmas party, ...were flowing.`
` No, ...they were converging on a single point.`
`It was like watching a firework run backwards.`
`Countless sweets rapidly contracted around the vast, closed mouth of the Leviathan.`
`A gigantic reverse explosion concentrated on a point inside it.`
`Or perhaps it was more like countless candies showering the Leviathan from all directions like bullets.`
`...Inside that mass of green...was a black swirl.`
`That swirl was on a palm.`
`On the palm of Lambdadelta, who wore a defiant smile.`
`It was...a mass of supergravity.`
`All of the sweets, the cats, the whale, and everything else was being sucked into that one point and crunched.`
`"I'll hold you tight. ...Get over here, Bern!!!"`
`"...You're trying...to suck me in...?!"`
`All of the candies Lambdadelta had scattered were getting sucked back into the black hole on her palm at unbelievable speeds.`
`The reverse explosion of the oncoming candy whittled away at the Leviathan, crushing it inwards.`
`"......Lamb...daaaaaaaaaaa...!!!"`
`"Come on. ...Let me give you a hug."`
`With all her strength, Bernkastel held her ground in midair, trying to resist this supergravity.`
`For the first time, all trace of condescension had left her face.`
`Even Lambdadelta's cocky expression was marred by the sweat trailing from her forehead.`
`...Because their power was so overwhelming, any victory would have to be instantaneous.`
`If either relaxed in the slightest, they would match each other's strengths and get dragged into another dizzyingly long fight that could last for centuries.`
`Neither of them had any desire to go through that again.`
` ...So, neither of them showed the slightest mercy for their most beloved friend.`
`By now, the Leviathan had been completely crushed and compressed inside the black hole.`
`Bernkastel was the only one still holding her ground.`
`However, a windstorm of candy asteroids like the asteroid belt repeatedly slammed into Bernkastel, wearing away at her girl's form bit by bit.`
`"...I've got to get away, ......or I'll...really......`
` ......?!?!"`
`The thing flying into Bernkastel's range of vision...`
`was a comet pelting straight for her, with a massive present box at its core and a cloud of candy surrounding it.`
`"Lambdaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!`
` Gyaaaaaaaaahh, my...body...gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!"`
`The candy comet wiped out Bernkastel along with her scream.`
`It burst into little bits, and within a blink of an eye, it was sucked back into a hole of supergravity.`
`Once it was all gathered into one place like a gem, it began to spin rapidly.`
`It was flattened by the centrifugal force, turning into something whose shape resembled a galaxy.`
`After swallowing all of the cats and their master,`
` it now looked like a wiggling, flickering, emerald green galaxy that floated just above Lambdadelta's palm.`
`The pocket of supergravity kept compressing it further and further,`
` ...until, at the end, it had become a single green, shining konpeitou.`
`Then, it fell down onto her outstretched palm.`
`"Sorry, Bern.`
` ...I wanted to play with you always, so I've always taken it easy and pretended to be in a pinch."`
`Lambdadelta held the konpeitou above her head and peered at it.`
`"But the truth is, I'm just impossibly strong.`
` ...Sorry about that."`
`Then, ...she pressed the konpeitou to her pink lips,`
` ...gave it a light kiss, ...and bit down.`
`"......This...doesn't taste like Bern."`
`Lambdadelta licked her fingertips, ...then turned to face the empty air behind her.`
`"...I already knew,`
` my beloved Lambda."`
`"Ahh, I love you, Bern..."`
`"Liar.`
` ...I knew...that you never took me seriously."`
`"In that case,`
` ...let's love each other for real.`
` ...Both of us, seriously."`
`"Ahh, I do love you, Lambdadelta.`
` ...I'm happy, ...so happy..."`
`"Ahh, I do love you, Bernkastel.`
` ......I'll turn you into candy and cuddle you with my tongue forever."`
`"No matter who wins, our love will never fade.`
` *giggle*giggle* Ahhahahahahahahahaha!!`
` That's wonderful, just wonderful...!!"`
`"Okay!!`
` Let's love each other right now!!!"`
`With a crash, crack lines appeared across the sky of the Golden Land.`
`Then, finally, the barrier of the Golden Land was breached by the fleet's assault.`
`It was a bizarre scene.`
` More ridiculous than anything anyone had imagined.`
`The sky of the Golden Land shattered like glass, and a fleet of sailboats flew in one after another.`
`They were crowded with goats pushing each other and spilling off the sides.`
`"Come, let us begin!!`
` This is the Golden Land's final banquet...!!"`
`A banquet.`
` ...It wasn't some fancy metaphor, but a simple statement of fact.`
`The overwhelming surge of goat troops came in like a tsunami.`
`The residents of the Golden Land who stood defiantly were like a forgotten sand castle on a beach.`
`A fight between a wave and a sand castle is not a fight.`
`This was a banquet...for the oncoming Vikings at a stand-up meal, the voracious, merciless goats.`
`"There's no way around it!!`
` Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiire!!!"`
`"<Good>!!`
` Come, goats!! Bring destruction to all that has form, stillness to all that moves!`
` Despair to all who liiiiiiiive!!!"`
`All those who could use magic fired it off at once.`
`With a shout like a thunderclap, the goat tsunami rushed forward.`
`Everything collided at once, and there was a brilliant and terrible explosion.`
`Sparks and smoke, flying splinters and screams.`
`For just an instant, the fierce magical cannonballs fired by Beato, Virgilia, and the Chiester Sisters Corps seemed to halt the goat tsunami in its tracks.`
`However, their numbers were so great that they didn't even flinch.`
`The goat wave continued to walk over the corpses that had been blasted away, or which had fallen to their knees in weariness.`
`The mound of corpses piled up, and still more goats were shot down as they tried to cross it,`
` ...so that, in a few seconds, it really was tall enough to be a tsunami.`
`"Pitiful!!`
` This Golden Land you've built is nothing more than a sand castle some kid left on a beach!!`
` Be swallowed up and disappeeeeeeeeeeeear!!"`
`"Perhaps you should liken it to ripples beating meaninglessly against a wharf.`
` ...A sandcastle getting swallowed by a wave?`
` Just you try swallowing my castle!!!"`
`Beato lifted her hands, telling the pair of battle towers that had been hidden deep in the ground that the day of glory had come again.`
`The goat tsunami looked up at it in shock.`
`After all, this time the tsunami that towered over everything...wasn't them.`
`"Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiire!!!"`
`A thunderstorm of rapid-fire ballista rounds leapt from the battle tower gun ports.`
`The goats let out a confused scream at the furious tempest that was bearing down on them.`
`However, they saw something else too.`
` ...In the sky high above the tower...was a reaper astride a divine horse and backdropped by the moon,`
` ...a massive spear the size of a tower in its hand.`
`The great witch sitting on the horse by the reaper spoke.`
`"Welcome back.`
` This world does not belong to you."`
`"Do it, Teacheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!"`
`The heavenly spear pierced the ground.`
`For an instant, it looked like some divine tower was sticking out of the ground.`
`However, that was the very last thing those eyes ever saw.`
`The sacred spear was the embodiment of heaven's wrath, and the strength to bury an unclean city in a single stroke was unleashed upon the pack of goats.`
`With a massive explosion that resembled a volcanic eruption, goats were sent flying all over the place.`
`"...Not bad. I guess they really are witches!"`
`"But is it enough?!"`
`"The enemies keep on coming!`
` It looks like we'll be the ones swallowed up after all!"`
`"At least you two seem to be enjoying yourselves."`
`"Wahaahahahahahaha!!`
` How could one fail to enjoy such a festival?!!`
` It seems our time in the limelight shall not be stolen from us after all!!"`
`"Looks like it!!`
` I'm all fired up!!!"`
`Yes.`
` The crowd of goats truly was like a wave pressing in from the sea.`
`You might be able to split a ripple on the beach with your feet, but you can't split the sea.`
`Witches could.`
`However, that meant the other side also had someone who could split seas.`
`Suddenly, smoke poured from one of the two towers, and the ground shook as it crumbled.`
`"...Wh-What the hell happened?!"`
`"Over there!`
` On top of the other tower!!"`
`"Erikaaaaaaaaaaaaa...`
` But of course, it is your turn now, is it not...?"`
`At the top of the other battle tower, ...Erika stood gracefully, wielding her scythe.`
`"I'd say that's enough to show the witches of the Golden Land proper respect.`
` ...All magic is fake.`
` It's just a fantasy sand castle that'll always vanish when mystery swallows it up.`
` ...Playing witches was pretty fun, though.`
` I think I remember playing something like this with some older girls from the neighborhood, when I was younger.`
` So, let's bring this to an end.`
` ......Now it's time to hear you scream."`
`Erika threw that pretentious pirate hat she had been wearing this whole time into the sky.`
`With the moon behind it, Erika's form...her afterimage...vanished from the tower's peak.`
`"Where is she?!!"`
`"We have her on radar!`
` She's on the side of the tower!"`
`Shaking with a wild, joyous laughter, Erika dashed straight down the tower.`
`She swung her scythe like a baton, and as she passed along the tower's wall, its gun ports, walls, pillars, and everything else was crushed, leaving a trail of smoke.`
`So, from the sidelines, it looked as though a line of smoke suddenly split the tower from top to bottom.`
`The golden arrows of the Chiester Sisters Corps chased after Erika like golden threads in a sewing machine.`
`"You monster...!!`
` Get yourself sewed and embroidered nyeh!!"`
`"Hahahaha, ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` <Good>!!`
` <Good, good, good>, ahhahahahahaaaaaaaah!!"`
`Even the golden arrows couldn't catch up with Erika.`
`Finally, Erika reached the bottom of the battle tower and empty cartridges were ejected from the golden bows.`
`"Burst, useless tower!`
` ...Isn't that the phraaaaaase?!"`
`Erika, who had now landed on the ground, `
`slowly stood up and tapped the tower behind her with the handle of her scythe.`
`That tiny tap cut the final string that held the tower together, and the whole thing fell in on itself with an earth-shattering crash...`
`Once again, the dark tsunami rumbled forward through the rubble and smoke.`
`"I am Furudo Erika, Witch of Truth!!`
` This moment marks the dismantling of the Golden Land by the truth!!`
` Dust to dust, illusions to illusions!!`
` I'll end your daydream for you!`
` Come, try and remember, ghosts! Remember how you died so long agoooooooo!!"`
`The goat tsunami swallowed everything up.`
`When she saw them sink under the black sea of goats, ...Erika guffawed from atop the debris of the tower.`
`"Come on now, kill them! Massacre them all!!!`
` Cut off all their heads and stick 'em on spears!!`
` Ghosts of 1986, the time has come for the whirlpool of truth to swallow you whole and erase you!! So long!!!"`
`EVA had broken the magic circle around the key beforehand after all.`
`By the time Battler and Ange reached it, it was falling apart like the sand in an hourglass.`
`They tried punching and kicking it to make it break faster, but nothing they did hastened the process.`
`"...It looks like she broke it a while ago,`
` ...but it'll probably take some time before it's gone..."`
`"Just a bit longer, I think.`
` ...If we could just buy time for five minutes..."`
`Judging by the speed the magic circles were crumbling and the general appearance of the whole scene, it looked like it would be over soon.`
`However, right now, could even five minutes be considered 'soon'?`
`They turned around.`
`...Beyond the bookshelf ravine...was a universe.`
`Even for Battler, who had seen Beato's fights many times over,`
` the battle between Lambdadelta and Bernkastel was so mind-defying that he couldn't think of a single word to describe it.`
`When he finally managed to find a word, it was 'a universe'.`
`Each time a battle between Lambdadelta and Bernkastel unfolded, a universe was created between the pair of them.`
`Big Bangs would take place, universes would be created, galaxies beyond number would be born and erased, born and erased.`
`Then, just when it seemed that a Big Crunch had occurred and that the universe had met its demise, there would be another Big Bang, and another universe would be created.`
`It was like watching gods playing.`
`The two witches created and destroyed worlds over and over again,`
` almost as though two Creators were fighting to prove that their universe was the right one.`
`If you let your guard down in the slightest, ...then just watching this would steal your soul. That's how it felt.`
`"...We'll be able to get the key back any second now.`
` ...Then, it'll be possible to go back to the Golden Land with the Fragment Lambdadelta gave us, right...?"`
`"Go back as soon as you get the key.`
` I can't leave Lambdadelta on her own."`
`"You're going to jump into that fight?!"`
`"I can't leave her on her own."`
`"............"`
`"Their fight may defy common sense.`
` ...However, they're perfectly and evenly matched.`
` So,`
` ...if anyone jumps in, even a single weak Human like me, ...something might break."`
`A perfect balance maintained by two great powers can easily break by adding even a little strength to one side.`
`However, actually rushing in there to add that little bit of strength would be literally suicidal.`
`Like a moth flying into a furnace.`
`It might burn up before it even reaches it.`
`"Once you get the key, go straight back to the Golden Land.`
` ......We don't know how long they can hold out, remember?"`
`"...I can't go back alone, ...not when everyone is fighting."`
`"That's right, this is your fight.`
` So fight.`
` ...I know you regret not dying with everyone else, but you've got to overcome that feeling and live in the future.`
` That's what you decided to do, right?"`
`".........!"`
`Ange had no words to respond with.`
`......Her brother and everyone else would probably die.`
` So, she wanted to die in the same place and at the same time as everyone else.`
`However, that could not be allowed, and she mustn't wish for it.`
`She had already made up her mind.`
`She had sworn...to live in the future, without turning back to look at everyone's deaths.`
`"When you get back to the Golden Land, show the key to Beato.`
` Beato will show you two doors.`
` ...Then, she'll give you an easy puzzle and tell you to open one of them.`
` ...That's...the last game on my game board."`
`"......Two...doors..."`
`"Of the two, one will lead you to the future.`
` ...Don't worry.`
` I'm sure you won't choose the wrong one now.`
` Also, once you go through it, don't turn back until the door closes."`
`"Why can't I turn back?"`
`"When the door closes, you won't be able to see our fate anymore.`
` ...In other words, we'll be shut inside the cat box."`
`"A fate inside a cat box...has endless truths."`
`"That's right.`
` We might've lost pathetically, or we might've made a miraculous comeback and survived.`
` In other words, if you, the Witch of the Future, are sent into the future without witnessing the end of our conflict, we'll still have a chance at victory."`
`"However, if you keep on looking at us, you'll see when we get annihilated.`
` That'll put the odds of our defeat at 100%.`
` So, to give us a miraculous victory, you must not turn back once you go through that door!`
` Got it?!!"`
`"...Y-Yeah..."`
`"So, I'll go and help Lambdadelta.`
` If you go back to the Golden Land after seeing me walk off like a hero, that's how my story will end for you."`
`"...The end of your battle will be sealed in the cat box.`
` ...So, you certainly won't 'lose'."`
`"Exactly.`
` So don't look back.`
` You'll have the key soon.`
` You've got to go back to the Golden Land like your life depends on it.`
` ...So, real quick, I have one message for the 'you' of the future.`
` Don't forget it, and engrave it into your heart!"`
`"Okay, ......okay...!!"`
`"...No matter what happens, never abandon the hopes that keep you alive.`
` All of us are always behind you.`
` ...If you just believe, we can even speak to you!`
` Believe it!`
` If one thing is certain, it's that miracles happen when you believe!"`
`At that moment, Lambdadelta and Bernkastel were wrapped in a massive explosion.`
`Surely, one of them had delivered a powerful blow.`
`There were no further explosions, ...so that strike must have decided the match...`
`When the smoke clears, ...who will be left standing...?`
`The magic circle sealing the key still needed several minutes to dissolve...`
`"......Are you...still there...?`
` My beloved...Lambdadelta...?"`
`All that came into sight...was Bernkastel.`
`There was no answering voice from Lambdadelta.`
`If this was a sign of her victory, it did not cause Bernkastel's expression to grow any brighter.`
`"......Too bad, Lambda.`
` ...And I thought we'd be able to build a universe together.`
` ...It's too bad, really too bad."`
`...Bernkastel was still focusing all her nerves on the battle.`
`So, she took no notice of Battler and Ange by the key.`
`...However, she would probably notice soon.`
`And then, there would be nowhere to run.`
`The last section of the magic circle was starting to fade away.`
`However, almost cruelly, the final circle went slower than the rest...`
`Seeing that, any hopes that it would dissolve in a minute, or maybe a few dozen seconds,`
` ...were crushed absolutely.`
`Battler readied himself.`
`"...Well, this fight probably won't work out as well as the last one,`
` ...but it looks like I'm up now."`
`"Onii-chan..."`
`"You're great, Ange.`
` I'm proud that you didn't try to stop me."`
`With tears still pouring down her face, ...Ange lovingly rubbed her cheek against the hand that had been patting her head.`
`"......I've got to gather the kitties again.`
` ...I thought Battler would be with her, but I don't see him for some reason.`
` ...After all, one guy like him would be about as annoying as a pebble in my shoe."`
`The smoke cleared completely, ...and they saw a huge cloud of candy bits floating around, ...like it was Lambdadelta's corpse.`
`A star-shaped cookie bounced off of Bernkastel's head.`
`It was missing one of its points, giving it a lonely feeling.`
`"......Lambdadelta.`
` ...Live with me.`
` ...We'll become a single universe, with you inside me."`
`Bernkastel chewed the cookie...and swallowed it.`
`"This way, we'll always be together......`
` I love you, Lambda."`
`"Me too, Bern."`
`Bernkastel's stomach suddenly swelled like a balloon.`
`The bulge rose from her stomach to her throat, then exploded like a firework from her mouth.`
`From Bernkastel's mouth spewed fireworks, sparks, fragments of candy.`
`"You really should fix those habits you've had since you were a cat.`
` ......Here's a hint: if you find a piece of candy lying on the ground somewhere, don't pick it up and eat it."`
`"Lam...gugaaah, dah, ggaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!"`
`Bernkastel doubled over even more, still spitting up an exploding firework.`
`The birth of a small universe from that sweet had hit her directly from the inside of her stomach.`
` Even Bernkastel couldn't withstand that.`
`As Bernkastel repeatedly vomited fireworks so violently that it seemed her guts would spill out, her body flickered in and out of existence, and she glared at Lambdadelta with a terrifying expression.`
`Her body was flickering because she had taken so much damage that even maintaining her form was now difficult.`
`"How slovenly, Bern.`
` Your body's falling apart."`
`"*cough*, *cough*cough*, uuuggghhh, ...Lambdaaaaaaaaaaaa, *cough*!!"`
`"I sort of felt like losing for a bit.`
` ......But I changed my mind.`
` If I became a single universe with you,`
` you wouldn't whisper to me of your love anymore."`
`"......True.`
` ...I'm not the type to give food to a fish I've already caught."`
`"I know.`
` That's why you shine so beautifully.`
` ...You'll lead someone on, but never actually dote on them, just like a proud queen of cats."`
`"I'll turn you into a cardboard box and make you my scratching post!!"`
`"And I'll make you a shamisen, get bored after plucking one string, then put you in a cupboard and let the dust pile up on you!!!"`
`The goat tsunami had swallowed up everything, but sea spray was still flying about.`
`The reefs resisted the ocean that was trying to cover them...and were smashing waves left and right.`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory and the Inquisitors of Heresy specialized in close-range combat and were rapidly building a mountain of corpses.`
`The witches fought hard too, but they would have preferred to fight at a distance if they could.`
`Illusions alone wouldn't be enough.`
`In these battle conditions, all of the Humans were thrust right into the center of the fight.`
`Everyone in the Ushiromiya family displayed a fighting spirit equal to the witches and guarded their backs.`
`Even Humans are not powerless.`
` They have guns.`
`If the goats supported fantasy, they could use these as the ultimate anti-magic weapons.`
`If the goats supported mystery, they could use these in a much more obvious way.`
`Those .45 Long Colt bullets delivered fatal wounds to each and every goat they struck.`
`"Just die already!!`
` How long are you going to resist? Give up and sink, Ushiromiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"Telling an Ushiromiya to sink makes him fight all the harder!!`
` Little girl, you have no idea what the Ushiromiya family is!!"`
`"You were dead even before 1986, weren't you?!!`
` It's about time you stopped moving, gramps!!"`
`Erika's razor-sharp scythe buried itself in Kinzo's chest.`
`It dug straight into his heart, but the daring smile on Kinzo's face didn't even falter.`
`"Hoh, ...was my death ever witnessed by anyone outside the cat box?`
` I am indestructible...indestructible!!"`
`A punch containing the entirety of Kinzo's last spark of life sent Erika flying.`
`"Father, Father, are you okay?!!"`
`"Overcome my corpse!!`
` The Ushiromiya family never turns back!!"`
`As Erika tried to deliver the finishing blow, Krauss stepped in between them, blocking the way.`
`"...I will be your opponent in Father's place."`
`"Oh?`
` If it isn't the incompetent investing expert.`
` It's pretty impressive how you managed to find all the worst bets, losing your money so quickly."`
`"And yet, even I remember to tie my shoes."`
`"Huh?"`
`Erika tried to look down at her feet, ...but what she saw was Krauss's left fist.`
`"?!?!"`
`Krauss's left uppercut made Erika float in the air.`
` Not by magic, but by the simple laws of physics.`
`For an instant, Erika saw the moon...`
`"Maybe I was incompetent as an investor!!`
` However, any of my college friends will attest to my talent as a boxer!!`
` I will not allow you to discredit every part of the Ushiromiya family, little girl!!"`
`"Y-You...damn small fry!!!"`
`『...Kanon is an illusion...`
` An illusion created by a lonely Jessica...〝`
`"At the school festival,`
` I introduced Kanon-kun to everyone!!`
` Saku, and Hina, and everyone else!!`
` All of my friends can testify to that!!`
` Don't make assumptions about our relationship based on your own imagination!!"`
`Jessica's body blow made the goat's massive body cave in.`
`"Splendidly done, Milady!`
` To think that you could wield such power in a tight spot like this...!"`
`"Well of course.`
` After all, I'm thinking I don't really care if I die.`
` ...This is the first time we've worked together, with you at my back.`
` Too bad it isn't cutting the cake...!"`
`Jessica laughed embarrassedly.`
` ...She looked even more relaxed than she had on stage at the school festival.`
`"We have plenty to cut here besides cake."`
`"You always try to sound so cool...!"`
`"But that's what I like about you!!"`
`The massive bodies that rushed at them, trying to deny their relationship and their very existence, had two choices: be sliced or be struck.`
`Each time one of those bodies hit the floor, it became proof that the two of them existed.`
`『...Shannon is an illuuuuuuusion!`
` George is an anti-social shut-in!`
` Their love itself is an illusion and doesn't exiiiiiiist!!〝`
`"George-sama, look out!!!"`
`The goat's log-sized fist buried itself in George's face.`
`This was the middle of a massive, confused battle.`
` There was no way to dodge an unexpected attack like that.`
`『......?!?!〝`
`"...An anti-social shut-in, huh?`
` ......Very well.`
` Say what you wish about me."`
`George had indeed been hit with a fist right to the center of his face.`
`However, he didn't bend over backwards. Not even an inch.`
`The goat started to wonder what it was he had hit.`
`Hadn't he punched a Human made of flesh...?`
`It was as though...he had slammed his fist into a steel wall, ...and it was his fist that was hurting...`
`However, ...the goat was too scared to move his fist from George's face.`
`After all, if he did, ...the expression on that face would probably be too terrifying.`
`George...pressed his hand against that fist.`
`"You probably could get testimony from my old classmates from school.`
` ...Yes, I was an anti-social person.`
` ...However, there's one more thing that they'll tell you, something far more important."`
`George was only grabbing the goat's massive fist in his tiny hand.`
`However, that fist was being crushed as though it had a vise around it...`
`Even though the other hand was tiny, ...the goat couldn't even move its fist.`
`"...Ushiromiya George never fought for himself, no matter what happened to him.`
` ...He was a coward, who ran away from all threats.`
` ...Everyone will tell you that.`
` ...However, they won't tell you that he never got into a fight."`
`I accepted the fact that someone as pathetic as me would be bullied.`
`"However!!`
` Never`
` have I let anyone`
` provoke or challenge`
` anyone who treated someone as pathetic as me...`
`like a friend!!!!"`
`The goat's broken teeth flew through the air.`
`George's furious feet split the heavens.`
`『...Sh-Shannon approached George for his money, and...〝`
`A goat's filthy finger touched Shannon's back.`
`That finger...exploded and boiled away.`
`"My love for George-san is true and pure.`
` ...George-san must have kept all the letters I wrote him.`
` Read those, and you'll have your proof."`
`『...Y-You can write anything in a letter...`
` ...The contents of a letter are no proof of true lo...〝`
`A blazing red light charred the goat's entire body.`
`...Shannon slowly turned around, her face full of rage and contempt.`
`"Pitiful spectator, ignorant of love.`
` You have no right to read a mystery, much less a person's heart.`
` ...Disappear...!!"`
`An absolute barrier rose up around Shannon, burning up the goats around her with its flames.`
`"Kihihihi!`
` Yeah, maybe we are dead.`
` But that doesn't give anyone the right to criticize us!`
` No one can deny the love Maria and Mama shared...!!"`
`Maria smiled, showing her teeth, and performed her job without even looking at her hands.`
`Then, she tossed the fully loaded rifle straight up into the air.`
`"......Come and get some."`
`Rosa, who stood back-to-back with Maria, caught it without turning around.`
`No, that wasn't all.`
` Maria had passed the gun to her mother perfectly without even looking back.`
`Rosa's head was pointed at the ground...as she stroked the frigid trigger with her index finger.`
`"If any of you doubt my love for my daughter, ...step forward."`
`The crowd of goats, cowed by Rosa's ferocity, ...didn't get any closer to her.`
`"Then I'll deny it.`
` ...Being the serial cheater you are, you were always off playing around with some man and leaving Maria all alone!!"`
`"Nothing like that is written anywhere in Maria's diary.`
` Kihihihihi."`
`"Y-You should know better than anyone else...!!`
` Rosa didn't love you!`
` She was a crappy mother who regretted even giving birth to you!!!!"`
`Erika was peering at the unfeeling moon, ...the taste of metal in her mouth.`
`For a moment, she didn't realize what was happening.`
`Was that cold feeling on her back...the ground?`
`Huh?`
` ...Why am I...lying down...?`
`And wasn't the moon full?`
` Why isn't it now...?`
`Come to think of it, ...my teeth...hurt.`
` ...There's something cold...and hard there.`
`Then, she figured it out.`
`She was lying sprawled on the ground, with a gun barrel shoved into her mouth.`
`And the thing splitting the moon...was the angry king of wolves protecting its child.`
`"......Gahah......"`
`The gun barrel exploded inside her mouth, shattering her medulla oblongata.`
`...But it was only her afterimage.`
`"What a terrifying woman you are. Are you really Huma-, ......"`
`Erika, who had escaped death at the last moment by leaving an afterimage, `
`...found a metallic flash right before her eyes, which had been there even before she reappeared.`
`The fountain pen went right through Erika's eye, crushing it.`
`Of course, that was another afterimage.`
`However, when Erika escaped and reappeared somewhere else, a heel was already there waiting for her...`
`From the goats' perspective,`
` ...several afterimages of Erika seemed to be appearing at once, ...all of which were pierced by Rosa at the same time...`
`"...If you say that again, I'll have to get serious."`
`"Mama's really strong, kihihihihihihihi!!"`
`"...Wh-What the hell..."`
`And so, Erika couldn't reappear anymore.`
`At the very least, not within Rosa's range of attack.`
`Erika put a lot of distance between her and Rosa, reappearing in midair.`
`"...What...are these people?!`
` What...the hell?!!`
` ......?!?!"`
`Erika's animal instincts made her turn her head slightly to the side just in time.`
`Where her head used to be, there was an odd shower of sparks.`
`It wasn't magic.`
` It was a real physical phenomenon caused by lead smashing against lead.`
`To think that two bullets shot from different angles...could have flown with impossible precision at where her head once was,`
` ...so that both of them hit and bounced off each other like billiard balls.`
`"...Aw, so close."`
`"Sorry about that.`
` We're big fans of the whole 'take out the boss first' strategy, you see."`
`"Clay pigeons are our specialty.`
` Flying along in a straight line probably isn't a good idea."`
`The two of them spun their rifles in exactly the same way at exactly the same time, reloading them in a manner that put old westerns to shame, `
`then pointed them back up at where Erika was in the sky.`
`"...Y-`
`You monsteeeeeeeeeeeers!!"`
`Once again, their accurate shots plunged through the forehead of Erika's afterimage, bouncing off each other like billiard balls with a shower of sparks.`
`This time, Erika appeared far behind them.`
`She had to admit it.`
` She had been forced to escape to a place outside the range of those guns fired by Humans.`
`Then, the light from the moon was blocked.`
`The place she had fled to so rapidly exploded, sending chunks of rubbish flying.`
`A massive long sword had been plunged into the ground.`
` ...It was Dlanor's.`
`"...Oh...`
` If it isn't my old friend...!"`
`"............"`
`She had dodged by a hair, ...but this bulky, brutal longsword was more of a cannonball shaped like a sword than something for cutting with.`
`Even though she dodged it, the blast of air pressure made her eardrums throb.`
`Dlanor was serious.`
`She seriously intended to smash Erika to bits.`
`"What's with the scary face?!!`
` Can't you try and act a bit, I don't know, cuter?!"`
`"...Do you find this ENJOYABLE?`
` Destroying people's dreams and ILLUSIONS?"`
`"Of course it's enjoyable!`
` What do you expect an intellectual rapist to do?!"`
`"You are an EVILDOER.`
` ...And yet, I used to believe you were the sort of evil worthy of SYMPATHY."`
`"I never asked for your sympathy."`
`"...Not cutting you down immediately upon our MEETING...`
` That sin of mine is what brought this day to PASS!!"`
`Dlanor's hair bristled with rage.`
`The sight this expression on one of her old friends...pinned Erika to the spot.`
`"My FRIEND,`
` ...allow me to free you before you can SUFFER.`
` I will not let you bear any further SINS!!!"`
`"Whoa, ...wai-, .........!!!"`
`The force of anger that welled from Dlanor's whole body struck Erika.`
`Or rather, the swirl of blasting wind from Dlanor's massive longsword sent her flying.`
`The cannonball with a blade repeatedly cracked the ground just after Erika leapt away.`
`So, it almost looked as though Erika was jumping backwards, smashing the earth beneath her with each jump.`
`"Dlanor......"`
`"...Friend of MINE,`
` rest in PEACE!!!"`
`The great longsword split the air again, pulverizing the ground.`
`However, this time, Erika was nowhere to be seen.`
` ...Where did she escape to?`
`Erika had broken the barrier of the Golden Land, landing on a ship whose bow was barely in sight.`
`...Practically speaking, she had run away.`
`Fully aware of this, Erika howled, her face contorted with humiliation.`
`Her shoulders heaved with her breathing, ...and she even forgot to fix her hair...`
`The scythe fell from her hand and landed with a clank to the floor.`
`That sound brought her back to her senses.`
`"Stupid goats!!`
` What are you standing around staring for?!!`
` Open Gun Ports!!`
` Load Concept Negation Explosive Rounds!!`
` Disregard Aiming Procedures, just fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiire!!!"`
`The warships that had flown into the Golden Land opened their gun ports one after another, and then they all fired at once in a scattered mess of cannonballs.`
`The hundreds of explosive rounds they fired would negate the concept of any thing or person they touched, smashing them into little bits and setting them ablaze with flames.`
`The battlefield full of writhing goats became a fiery hell.`
`A cannonball smashed the arbor.`
` The once-beautiful garden maze was burned down bit by bit, and the fleeing gold butterflies were wrapped in flames, burning into nothingness like little scraps of paper.`
`This was no longer a battlefield where two sides fought for victory.`
`It was just a confused, hellish pot of boiling water.`
`The Golden Land...was being torn apart.`
`The once-beautiful rose garden was filled with explosion craters, and its rose petals were scattered about without pity.`
`There were flying bits of flesh, blood, fangs, jaws.`
` Shrieks and half-crazed screams.`
`And even amidst this hellish swirl, the goats and the dead continued to fight.`
`As seen from atop the boats, ...this was hell, without a doubt.`
`"All ships!!`
` Drop anchoooooooors!!"`
`When Erika yelled, the goats on the boats ran around frantically,`
` and one by one, massive anchors hanging by chains were thrown from the ships' bows down into the earth below.`
`Those anchors smashed through not only the ground, but the bottom of the Golden Land itself, digging in with their wedge-shaped tips.`
`"Erikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`"Oh, Beatrice-san!!`
` This battle's so huge, it had me worried!`
` I thought I might not be able to find you before the whole thing ended!"`
`Beatrice landed on the front tip of the warship, facing off against Erika, who stood on the bow.`
`"You will not be forgiven! I'll finish you myself right here!!!"`
`Beato jabbed with her pipe.`
`It transformed into a beautifully intricate golden longsword.`
`"Very well, that's just what I'd hoped for.`
` Let's settle this."`
`Erika threw her scythe up into the air.`
`When it returned to her hand, it had become a sword similar to Beato's.`
`The nearby goats crowded around Erika, trying to support her.`
`"You stay out of this.`
` All of you need to start lifting the anchors!`
` Tear up the Golden Land by its roots!!"`
`Aye aye, sir!`
` The goats bowed and rushed to their posts.`
`Several dozen ships had lowered their anchors, digging into the base of the Golden Land.`
`Soon, they were going to try and pull them up, ...tearing the Golden Land to pieces.`
`"Come, Erikaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!`
` I'll give you the honor of my final duel!!"`
`Beato raised her sword, bowed in the ancient fashion, and waited for her opponent.`
`Erika kicked off her shoes violently and slowly walked up to the tip of the boat barefoot.`
`Then, in accordance with Beato's rules, she bowed back.`
`It was a duel on the prow of a ship that pierced the sky.`
`Below, the crowd of goats was being blasted away by the indiscriminate cannonballs, burned up and crushed in the panorama of this world's end.`
`By now, it would be stupid to wonder whether anyone from the Ushiromiya family was still all right.`
`Yes, it truly was the end of this world.`
` The end of the Golden Land.`
`Ground to dust, filled with flames.`
`The golden rose garden was burning spectacularly, with bits of fire and golden splashes flying about.`
`The ground creaked as fissures ran through it.`
` ...Through to the base of the Golden Land.`
`All of the ships started pulling up their anchors at once.`
` Crowds of mighty goats used all of their monstrous strength to lift them.`
`The anchors that dug into the Golden Land's base...spread cracks throughout the entire Golden Land.`
`Not just the ground, but the air itself was filled with cracks, and shards of gold fell down everywhere.`
`The Golden Land's end was adorned with the flames of hell and streaking gold fragments, with fiery red and ephemeral gold.`
`Atop the boat's prow, Beato and Erika looked down on this, their swords crossed and sparks flying between them.`
`"Now there's one hell of a sight to see!!`
` Don't you think it's fitting?!`
` The perfect final chapter for your tale...!!"`
`"The Golden Land may meet its end.`
` I may perish as well.`
` However, no one can erase the fact that we were here!!`
` Ange reached the answer!`
` The Witch of the Future has a mission and hope...and will soon set off on a new journey!!`
` We have already succeeded...!!`
` Too bad for you, Furudo Erikaaaa!!`
` This battle ends with our victory!!!"`
`This was a duel between the master of the illusion called the Golden Land and the witch who controlled truth.`
`The earth split behind them.`
` The Golden Land was torn up.`
`The cat box known as the Golden Land was ripped apart, and the nothingness below peeked out through the cracks.`
`The scrambling crowd of goats fell through the gaps and were swallowed by the sea of nothingness.`
`...Beato's friends were among them.`
`They helped each other, lent a hand to each other, unwilling to sacrifice anyone until the final moment.`
`Still, ...what a romantic and fragile illusion is the end of the world.`
`The ground shattered and sank.`
` It fell apart into the ocean of nothingness.`
`None could survive.`
` None could be saved.`
`This was...destruction.`
`As the comrades-in-arms fell into the sea of nothingness, they looked up one last time...and prayed.`
`They prayed that the master of the Golden Land would leave proof that the Golden Land had indeed existed.`
`However, Beato didn't look down at them.`
` They wouldn't have wanted her to.`
`"This is our Golden Land!!`
` I am the Endless and Golden Witch Beatrice, and I am here!!`
` We may fall, but we will not be defeated!!`
` You shall become living proof!`
` I'll carve the proof of our existence into your chest!!"`
`"So long, Beatrice!!`
` This marks the end of that stupid endless game!!`
` Fall into hell, you illusion!!!!"`
`Lambdadelta and Bernkastel's fight to the death had passed through its phase as a dynamic clash of fireworks...and was now a clash that was quiet and motionless.`
`...These two witches, who possessed power on an entirely different level, may have been truly equal in strength.`
`The battle could only be resolved by mutual consent, if one of them lost interest or found some reason for wanting to lose.`
`Since both were putting their all into the fight without yielding a bit, they were absolutely and completely equal...`
`"...Lambdadelta...`
` ...I'm glad...to have you as a friend..."`
`"Dammit, just a bit longer...!`
` Just fall apart already, stupid magic circle...!"`
`Battler got irritated and punched the magic circle, but there was nothing he could do except continue to watch over it.`
`After all, the only way to dissolve it was by waiting.`
`However, the pair of them still felt relief, if only a little.`
`Lambdadelta really was strong.`
`Even in a battle this spectacular, she fought on an even footing.`
`No, ...if you considered how confident each side looked, she seemed to have a slight advantage in Battler's eyes.`
`She would probably manage to buy them enough time.`
`Ange would take the key and return to the Golden Land.`
`They just had to endure a bit longer...`
`......However, they had no way of knowing what Lambdadelta's fate would be after this.`
`She had disobeyed the Senate, the highest-level witches in existence.`
` ...Something brutal probably awaited her.`
`However, even knowing this, Ange had to step forward into the future, without looking back.`
`...That was the single duty given to her, the Witch of the Future.`
`"......Onii-chan, ...what's that...?`
` Something's coming towards us from a long way away."`
`"...?!`
` Crap, ...are they enemy reinforcements...?!"`
`Lambdadelta and Bernkastel were glaring at each other, so they didn't notice.`
`Heading towards them from the distance...were several emerald green glints.`
`That light proved that they were enemies.`
`"But there's only a few of them.`
` ...They won't be a match for Lambdadelta."`
`"............"`
`All of the cats so far seemed like fish in a school,`
` giving the impression that they'd be terrifying as a group, but not much of a problem by themselves.`
`However, there was something different about the lights approaching them now.`
`......They were approaching in a beautiful, ordered formation, like a constellation.`
`Battler quickly realized that this was something new...`
`"...My miko,`
` isn't it about time to prepare the key...?"`
`Just by her tone, Battler was able to tell how great a witch this was.`
`The black cats that surrounded her in a graceful and systematic constellation...`
`were all wearing large capes with elegant designs.`
`...It looked as though great overlords from many worlds had been transformed into cats, leaving only their capes untouched.`
`What Battler imagined was quite true.`
` That was exactly what had happened.`
`These were the overlords from many worlds that formed Featherine's personal guard.`
`Their bodies took the form of cats merely as a sign of respect to their master, who took the form of a human.`
`These were entirely different from the pack of wild cats that served Bernkastel.`
`"...Auaurora...`
` ...Oh, is it that time already...?"`
`"When holding a party, it's important to keep your guests waiting for a fitting amount of time.`
` ...It is, however, not something I am particularly fond of."`
`As she said this, her eyes flicked to Lambdadelta.`
`The latter bowed hurriedly.`
`Though Lambdadelta grinned, she was also sweating, her brow furrowed with tension.`
`"......How long it has been, Lady Lambdadelta?"`
`"It's a pleasure to see you,`
` Great Lady Aurora..."`
`"...This is no place to entertain one of your position.`
` ...Did you get lost on the way to the party...?`
` If so, allow me to guide you there myself."`
`"...Th-That would be an honor, Great Lady Aurora..."`
`Featherine Augustus Aurora.`
` ...The legendary Great Witch.`
`It is said that she surpassed the level of witches, becoming a Creator,`
` ...and that, upon reaching this forbidden plane, she was cursed with a deadly ailment.`
`However, in life, she once turned her pet cat into a witch.`
`They say that this second witch wanders the sea of Fragments endlessly, `
`searching for any Fragment that can revive her master from the pits of death called boredom, if only for a moment.`
`...And so, the cat revived her master.`
`Revived the sacred witch who had reached heights none should reach...`
`Just as witches look down at and mock Humans from a higher world, calling them pieces on a game board...`
`So she looks down at and mocks the realm of witches from an even higher world, calling them pieces on a game board.`
`...If a witch's strength is measured by the height of the world they are capable of reaching...`
`Then she was like a witch come back from the realm of the gods, one who had touched the highest, forbidden heights and survived.`
`Was there any chance of winning against her?`
`No.`
`Lambdadelta was unable to choose either victory or defeat by her own will.`
`"My miko,`
` would you mind playing with your friend some other time...and getting back to work now?`
` ...Prepare the key."`
`"......Okay..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` The simple, naive way cats forget their errand partway is their true charm.`
` ...Don't you think so, Lady Lambdadelta...?"`
`Lambdadelta didn't say anything, but hung her head low.`
`...From this position, it seemed that the key's seal would dissolve at any second.`
`However, Bernkastel would probably find Battler and Ange before that.`
`Once they got their hands on the key, they could leave this place immediately.`
` ...Of course, this was assuming that they did so before Bernkastel and Featherine found them.`
`......Bernkastel...mustn't be allowed to move from this spot.`
`"...Looks like game over, Lambda."`
`"........."`
`"I am the miko of the Great Witch Aurora...`
` You haven't forgotten that the Witch of Theatergoing bestows her protection upon her Reader mikos, have you...?"`
`Lambdadelta still stood slumped over, without answering.`
`The Witch of Theatergoing gave protection to her Reader mikos.`
`If Lambdadelta attacked Bernkastel, who was Aurora's miko,`
` ......then the Great Witch Aurora would follow her contract, prevent what she considered an attack against herself, and 'respond accordingly'.`
`"...Let's make a deal."`
`"...What kind of deal...?"`
`"Where is Battler hiding?`
` If you come clean, we'll let all of this slide."`
`"Is the Witch of Miracles afraid of a tiny, little piece like Battler?"`
`"...It's because I'm the Witch of Miracles.`
` ...I'll never forget that even a little pebble like him is capable of creating a miracle."`
`"After all, there's a little pebble who got super-promoted into a Witch of Miracles."`
`"I'll ask one more time. Where is Battler?"`
`"........."`
`"...Too bad, Lambda.`
` It looks like that's your answer."`
`Bernkastel turned her back on Lambdadelta.`
`Then, she told her master that she was leaving to prepare the key, ...and she started swimming towards the key room.`
`......If I let her go...any further, ......she'll find Battler and Ange...`
`Battler readied himself.`
` This time, it was his turn to become a sacrifice......`
`Even though he was nothing more than a single pebble, ...he could still put out an eye.`
`A candy firework exploded right in front of Bernkastel.`
`"......Lambda,`
` ...you really are a moron."`
`"...L-Lambdadelta......"`
`"......Now I've done it...`
` ...Battler, Ange,`
` ...the rest is up to you...!"`
`The cat overlords changed their formation, becoming a ferocious constellation that surrounded Featherine.`
`Then, each drew the most terrifying of magic circles from their respective worlds...and began to chant.`
`".........`
`...I am slightly confused.`
` ...Both by you, my miko, and Lady Lambdadelta.`
` ...What sort of sideshow is this...?"`
`"......It looks like Lambda wants to stop me from going to get the key."`
`"Hoh.`
` ...And what would the point of that be, I wonder?"`
`"If you still don't get the point,`
` ...then you must be getting a bit tipsy, Featherine.`
` Looks like you need a pick-me-up."`
`Lambdadelta bluffed as well as she could.`
` Her fingertips were shaking slightly.`
`"......An attack against a miko is considered to be an attack against her master.`
` ...You should know this as well as anyone, correct...?"`
`"I know it.`
` ...Going by that rule, it looks like the two of us are gonna have to fight."`
`"Hoh.`
` ......Have I or my miko caused insult in any way?`
` If so, then please accept my apologies."`
`"But could you tell me one thing?`
` I didn't think you had a miko at the moment.`
` ...How long have you had one?"`
`"As for that,`
` ...I've got a ton of them already...!!`
` 30 or 40, I think.`
` Maybe even more!"`
`"I, Lambdadelta, will handle any fight picked against one of my mikos, no matter who the opponent is...!!`
` All of them are certain that a happy ending will come!!`
` As the Witch of Certainty, I can't abandon people who work hard and believe with certainty like that!!!"`
`"......I can't say I dislike this tale of yours.`
` It would be worthy of my viewing.`
` ...However, I am not a spectator at the moment, but a performer.`
` ...I know that you are my miko's close friend, so I will give you one warning.`
` ......Remove yourself from this stage.`
` I will prepare a special seat for you in my audience seating."`
`"......I've been thinking about which is more interesting: ...your tale, or the one I've been watching."`
`"......And your conclusion?"`
`"Battler's tale is a hundred times better...!!`
` Sorry, but I'll be getting Best Supporting Actress this year!!`
` ...Hey, you guys!`
` You'd better vote for me in the last character popularity contest, okay?!`
` At least get me in the top 5! Got it?!"`
`"......Who are you talking to?"`
`As Lambdadelta pretended to joke around, ...she calmly focused on the one weak point she could see.`
`If she had a chance for a single attack, ...then a one-in-a-billion shot at victory existed.`
`It was that horseshoe-shaped memory device floating around Featherine's head.`
`Without that, she couldn't preserve her own existence.`
`Destroying it was impossible,`
` ...but if Lambdadelta could just jar it enough, ...she might be able to make it bug out.`
`At least once in the past, Featherine's memory device had been damaged, and her personality and appearance had changed.`
`...However, she was aware of that herself...and probably wouldn't let that happen again no matter what.`
`"...Very well, Lady Lambdadelta.`
` When you've finished your script, feel free to send it in whenever you wish."`
`"The script is simple.`
` ...Just one line.`
` 'The fantastic, cute Lambdadelta-sama...`
`took out the evil mastermind Auaurora in a single shot!'"`
`"Foolish Lambda.`
` ...I never realized how stupid you were."`
`"...The cats need not interfere.`
` ...I will personally reward Lady Lambdadelta for the courageous tale she has submitted.`
` ...You will be granted a fitting tale and a fitting ending for your bravery."`
`"Featherine Augustus...Auauroraaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`Lambdadelta summoned magical power from her whole body and raised it in a mass above her head.`
`"Forgive me, but..."`
`Then, the world's time stopped.`
`"Your script will not be used.`
` ...After all..."`
`Rather than time stopping, ...it was more like the flipping pages of a book had stopped.`
`In this motionless world, ...closely packed letters appeared.`
`"The one writing the rest of the script...is me."`
`It was a tale...that had been written up to this very moment.`
`'"Featherine Augustus...Auauroraaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"'`
`'Lambdadelta summoned magical power from her whole body and raised it in a mass above her head.'`
`That was where the paragraph ended.`
`In this frozen world, Featherine sat with her arms crossed.`
`"...How troublesome.`
` ...It's been so long since I've written a fight scene.`
` ...How annoying to have to suddenly write up a development like this out of the blue..."`
`When I get stuck writing, I try to write in reverse.`
`In other words, instead of starting at the beginning, I start at the end and go backwards from there.`
`That way, it's easier to set up foreshadowing, and I can write the story with my vision for the end in mind.`
`...The only downside is that I have to suddenly start at the climax without setting up the story first.`
`"......In the meantime,`
` I'll start at the end of the fight and go back from there.`
` ...Lady Lambdadelta,`
` this is where you lose to me and die."`
`As Featherine said this, words were added to the massive group of letters that filled the frozen world.`
`However, she was starting from the end, so there was a large gap between the new words and the old ones.`
`"...So, how will you lose to me?`
` ...You should probably have a heroic end to suit your bravery.`
` ...How about this?`
` Lambdadelta gets blasted away by something, slammed against the bookshelf, `
`and her limbs are snapped off as she dies and disappears into the darkness below.`
` ...Yes.`
` Quite a flashy way to go.`
` ......Good. For now, that's how your final moments will be."`
`The blanks in the outline Featherine spoke of were being filled up.`
`At the same time, Lambdadelta's figure was wiped out.`
`After crossing her arms and thinking again, Featherine pointed in a random direction.`
`Lambdadelta appeared, blasted away by 'something' and slammed spreadeagled against the bookshelf Featherine had pointed at.`
`"......Well now, I must write up the fierce battle that leads to this end,`
` ...but as you can probably tell, I'm a little tipsy at the moment.`
` ...I'll fill that part in later, when I have some time to go over it nice and slowly."`
`"...For now, let me off with this.`
` I promise to add in a heroic fight to your liking later on..."`
`Featherine snapped her fingers.`
`...Lambdadelta...had no idea what was going on.`
`Before she could even blink, ...she was suddenly here, being slammed against a bookshelf.`
`"...W...h...a...t......i...s......t...h...i...s..."`
`She couldn't comprehend the 'something' that Featherine had killed her with.`
`However, that was only natural.`
`After all, Featherine herself hadn't decided what the 'something' was.`
`However, Lambdadelta did understand one thing.`
`She was already dead.`
`Streams of blood dripped from the corners of her mouth.`
`Then, lines of blood appeared on her wrists and ankles, her elbows and knees.`
`She looked like a marionette doll of herself.`
`"......W...h...a...t......k...i...l...l...e...d......m...e..."`
`"Precisely, Lady Lambdadelta.`
` Let me know if you have any good ideas."`
`"...Y...o...u......m...o...n...s...t...e...r......"`
`Still pinned against the bookshelf, ...Lambdadelta let her head slump.`
`Her wrists, ankles, legs, arms, and neck...`
`each split into a separate part, ...and the marionette shaped like her lost its strings, falling in pieces into the depths below.`
`Nothing remained.`
`It was all swallowed up by the darkness beneath them...`
`"A monster, she says.`
` ...Quite a compliment, for one such as I.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle* Ahhahahahahahahahahaha."`
`"...L-Lambdadelta..."`
`"Ange, ...don't look. You can't look...!!"`
`Shedding frustrated tears, Ange closed her eyes tight.`
`She must not look.`
`The Witch of the Future...must not accept Lambdadelta's defeat...`
`"She hasn't kicked it yet!`
` She was brave, and that's all we need to know...!!"`
`"I know...!!`
` I know Lambdadelta...would never lose...!!"`
`*pop*`
`At that moment, there was a slight sound, ...and the golden key that hung in the air...shook.`
`...The seal had finally broken.`
`Battler grabbed at it immediately.`
`However, at exactly the same moment, a magical tremor spread throughout the vast key room.`
`"Wh-What?!"`
`That tremor...seemed to have shaken something inside my pocket.`
`I stuck my hand in...and found that the Fragment Lambdadelta had given us to return to the Golden Land...had shattered.`
`"...D-Dammit, ...Lambda's Fragment is...!"`
`"...You were so close too.`
` Now, there's nowhere to run."`
`"Bernkastel..."`
`"If Lambda had been a little cleverer, she probably could've bought you five more seconds.`
` ...Then, you would've taken that key and escaped to the Golden Land.`
` ...Looks like the miko suffers too when their master's a fool.`
` Ahhahahahahaha."`
`"......Hoh."`
`Featherine quietly showed her surprise.`
`...To truly surprise her was no easy task.`
`The Witch of Miracles, who boasted that no one could even step on her shadow unless she wished it, ...fell.`
`After taking Battler's right fist to her face, she fell.`
`Bernkastel's body immediately split into dust and reconstructed itself in front of Battler.`
` As though nothing had happened.`
`However, she was holding her cheek.`
`She couldn't undo the fact that she had been hit.`
`For the first time in a hundred years, she had let someone tread on her shadow without her consent.`
`Her face was gradually filled with shock.`
`And Battler's?`
`...It couldn't be seen.`
`His outstretched right arm was blocking it, so his expression couldn't be seen...`
`"............"`
`"............Wh-What?"`
`"......Take it back."`
`"......T-Take what back......?"`
`She didn't let the next strike hit her.`
`Bernkastel vanished like mist, then reappeared a short distance away.`
`However, Battler only missed by a hair's breadth.`
`Not because she had intentionally made that happen, ...but for real.`
`"......It hurts......it hurts, it hurts......"`
`Finally, she truly began to feel the pain of being punched in the face.`
`For too many years, she had forgotten the very concept of pain.`
`Very slowly, ...it was coming back to her.`
`"It hurts! ...It hurts, it hurts, it hurts...aaaaghghhh!!"`
`Bernkastel writhed in anguish, holding her cheek.`
`That feeling, forgotten for centuries, seemed to be hitting home hard.`
`Battler looked at her.`
` Their eyes met.`
` ...Once again, Bernkastel remembered the emotion she had forgotten for hundreds of years.`
`"......Does it hurt?"`
`".........!!!"`
`"The pain you caused by ridiculing my friend......is greater than that."`
`And then, she shuddered.`
`What Battler saw before his eyes...was Bernkastel shuddering for the first time in centuries.`
`To Bernkastel's eyes, it hadn't even looked like Battler rushing at her and punching.`
`It was as though...she had been sucked towards where he stood with his furious fist raised.`
`When her eyes had opened wide in terror, ...Battler's massive fist had been all that she could see.`
`Of course, he wasn't capable of hitting her.`
` Bernkastel was just like a shadow.`
`She dodged by moving instantly and leaving an afterimage, but mere teleportation wasn't enough to escape from Battler's furious pursuit.`
`True, trying to hit Bern was like enviously trying to hit the reflection of the moon on water with a stone.`
`No matter how often you hit it, you can never smash the moon's reflection.`
`However, Battler hit it. And again.`
` Over and over.`
` To prevent the moon from showing on the water's surface again.`
`A fiercely thrown pebble sent ripples across the water's surface.`
` It broke through the moon's reflection, broke through the water's surface itself, ...leaving even the bottom of the pond bare, ...breaking through everything.`
`His certain willpower...broke through to a miracle.`
`A backwards kick that Battler shot out without even looking behind him...split through empty space.`
`In that space, ...Bernkastel reappeared with a foot in her gut.`
`"Geh......agh......"`
`"...Take back your insults against our brave friend."`
`"Uuh, ......ghh... ...ggggghh......"`
`The Witch of Miracles fell.`
` For the second time, she fell.`
`Once, it would have been a miracle.`
`Things that happen more than once aren't miracles anymore.`
`Bernkastel understood.`
`Battler...was capable of hitting her...`
`Then, she fell, ...was slammed against the floor, ...got up on her hands and knees, and vomited.`
`She threw up violently over and over.`
`Her face was covered with pain and vomit and tears and snot.`
`Then, she looked up at Battler with a furious expression...and howled.`
` And she wasn't howling at Battler.`
`"A-Auaurora...!!`
` Y-Your miko is getting beaten up!`
` What are you standing around watching for?! Take him out!!!"`
`"Forgive me, but I am busy writing Lady Lambdadelta's final moments right now.`
` ...I cannot come to your aid.`
` ......Why don't you all give her a hand?"`
`Featherine's guard, the cat overlords, now formed a different constellation.`
`Then, each drew a magic circle and began chanting.`
`"Aha, ahhahahahahahahahaha!!`
` You know what?! Each one of these cats is the final form of a main character, each from a game like yours!!`
` Every one acted the main part in their heroic tale, and the story of their bravery was given honor, allowing them to become Aurora's guards!!`
` Each one fought for the very existence of their country, their planet, their universe!!"`
`"What about you?!`
` Ahhahaha, at best, you've just been playing around with your little sister and some imaginary witch!!`
` These main characters are on a totally different level from you!!`
` Eat this and die, take it to the gut, scum!!!"`
`"...O-Onii-chan......!!!"`
`Their many spectacular magical spells depicted the beginning of a universe, the creation of planets, their destruction and the universe's end, all in an instant.`
`After that, not a speck of dust should have remained...`
`However,`
` when the smoke cleared, there was a person standing there.`
`It stood there......with its hands in its pockets...and its head hanging quietly.`
`Its face was in shadows and couldn't be seen.`
`"...Onii-chan......"`
`"What...the hell...?"`
`Battler...seemed to be completely uninjured.`
`Not only were his clothes not burnt, but his hair hadn't even been disturbed.`
`"...Wh-What the hell?!?!`
` Stupid cats, that didn't work at all!!"`
`The cat overlords silently shook their heads, sending a short report to their master.`
`"Endless Nine."`
`"What...did you say......?"`
`"It seems that no one can interfere with their tale.`
` Forgive me, my miko.`
` It would appear that the cats have reached their limit."`
`"...A-And you call yourselves overlords of many worlds?!!`
` Weren't you all once main characters on different game boards?!`
` And this is the best you can do?!`
` You're pathetic!!"`
`The cats knew.`
`From the very beginning...`
`They had known that they wouldn't be able to do anything with him as the main character of this game board.`
`"...My miko,`
` creating a tale on the game board is a privilege granted only to the Game Master.`
` That has already been established, so I must respect that rule, being the mere writer that I am.`
` I shall return to my position as a spectator."`
`"Y-You useless master...!!!"`
`"......Battler,`
` I apologize for the insults your friend suffered at the hands of my miko.`
` And I see that the right to weave your game belongs to you, the Game Master.`
` You shall weave your own game.`
` That is as it should be."`
`"........."`
`"However, my miko is now a Game Master in your game.`
` ...It seems the two of you opened the game board at the same time.`
` It is rare to have two Masters for a single game, but this miracle pleases me.`
` ...After all, I can rest assured that this will make for a proper final game for you both."`
`"......Stand up,`
` Bernkastel."`
`"......I see...`
` ...So, you're saying that if two Game Masters are going to fight, ...they have to do it by the rules of the game...`
` ......*giggle*, ...*giggle*giggle*`
` ...Why didn't you just say that in the first place...?"`
`Bernkastel slowly got to her feet and made her body melt away like mist.`
`Then, she appeared in the air once again, facing Battler.`
`"Very well.`
` ...I'll fight by the rules of your game board.`
` However, I'm not as easygoing as you all are, so I'll start with a short-tempered, overwhelming puzzle and end this in an instant.`
` Who will be my opponent?`
` I don't mind if you both take me on at once."`
`"Onii-chan, I'll fight too."`
`"......Stay back."`
`"Why...?!"`
`"Watch from there.`
` And this time, ...understand what I wanted to teach you."`
`"......Onii-chan..."`
`"Are you happy with this, Aurora?!"`
`"...I shall be your witness.`
` If you defeat my miko, I promise to return you all to the Golden Land."`
`"*giggle*giggle*`
` Assuming the Golden Land still exists, that is."`
`"I...believe in them."`
`"That's right...`
` Beato...and all the others...won't lose...!"`
`"*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*...!!!`
` In that case, we'd better start with the bad news.`
` ...Erika, you can make your report now.`
` Come!"`
`When Bernkastel snapped her fingers, Erika appeared with a bow.`
`"Pardon me for the interruption, my master."`
`"...Sorry, Erika.`
` How inconsiderate of me, to keep you waiting when you came bearing good news."`
`"No problem!`
` Rejoice, my master.`
` I have come to inform you of the complete destruction of the Golden Land!"`
`"...Liar!!"`
`"The Golden Land has been totally destroyed.`
` I'm here to report that it's collapsed and fallen into the sea of nothingness.`
` Not just the Humans, but the Illusions as well have been completely annihilated."`
`"Liar!!`
` I won't believe it!"`
`"...Then allow me to make you believe it.`
` Take this, my master."`
`Erika humbly presented an object wrapped in cloth.`
`It shone with a golden light.`
`"...What's this?`
` A golden apple?"`
`"This is the heart of Beatrice, master of the Golden Land...!"`
`"...B-Beato......!!"`
`"........."`
`Bernkastel pinched it between two fingers, held it aloft, and gazed at it.`
`"...Even like this, it's still beating.`
` ...You're so cute, Beatrice.`
` ...The game board that you are might be opened again by someone.`
` ...You still believe that, don't you...?"`
`"I-It's okay, Onii-chan...`
` We didn't see Beato get defeated...!`
` This is some sort of trick they're using on us.`
` A trick to make us lose our morale...!`
` Or maybe it's a trick of Beato's!`
` She changed herself to pretend that she's been defeated.`
` There's no way that Beatrice...that everyone...that the Golden Land could be destroyed...!!"`
`"*giggle*`
` ......*giggle*giggle*giggle* Ahhahahahahahhhahahahaha!!`
` That's true. If the Witch of the Future believes that, you might be able to make it so...`
` ...So, let me show you.`
` Look closely, Witch of the Future from 1998."`
`Bernkastel...threw the golden heart into the air like an apple.`
`Then, with the blood-red blade of the scythe that appeared in her hand, ...she split it...`
`"`
`#ff0000Beatrice died in October of 1986.`
` Therefore, the Golden Land she created was completely destroyed.`
` Your family that was kept alive in the Golden Land was destroyed along with it.`
` Your father, mother, and of course Battler...will never return to you again...and will never speak your name again.#ffffff"`
`".........Ah..."`
`"The Witch of the Future has the power to interpret things how she pleases and overwrite what happened.`
` ...However, there is just one fact that she can't overwrite, no matter how much she struggles."`
`"...And that is...death.`
` You cannot overcome any concept of death, be it physical or mental.`
` ...It is the single blade of truth with which witches of the past can strike down witches of the future..."`
`"......Ah, ......ah......ah......"`
`"Hang in there, Ange."`
`"......But, ......but......"`
`"You decided to accept it, didn't you?`
` ...You decided to live on, even if no one came back alive, ...didn't you...?"`
`"...I know... ...I know, but... ...But...!!!"`
`Even so, ...a tiny sliver of hope...had remained inside Ange's heart.`
`Despite everything,`
` ...if she was favored by some miracle,`
` ...maybe someone would come home after all.`
`It doesn't matter when.`
` It could be ten years later or fifty years later.`
`It doesn't even matter if they've forgotten my face...`
`I believed that someone might come back someday...`
` ...And I decided to live with that tiny hope in my heart.`
`...Even though I accepted everyone's death, ...even though I saw it in the Book of the Single Truth,`
` I still thought......that it wouldn't be so bad...to believe in a miracle, ...just a little......`
`A miracle you believe in, even though you know it won't happen, ......is hope.`
`So, the witch who knew that miracles don't occur......had ruthlessly torn that hope away.`
`"Don't cry."`
`"I know...!!`
` But, ...but!!"`
`"Even the big brother you're crying to right now...is already dead."`
`"Onii-chan isn't dead, he's here!!`
` Right here!!!"`
`"Don't cry, Ange."`
`"But, ...but!!!"`
`"Don't cry!!!"`
`At Battler's shout, Ange bit back her tears.`
`"Why...does it matter?`
` ......What do we of the past mean to you, living in the future?`
` ......Ange,`
` what sort of witch were you?"`
`"......Huh?"`
`"Whether we're alive or dead means nothing to you."`
`"Th-That's not true...`
` I want you to live...!"`
`"That's not it!!`
` You can go beyond life and death, right?!!"`
`Ange didn't understand what he was telling her.`
`So, stunned into silence, she frantically considered what her brother might be trying to say.`
`Battler slowly lifted his face...and stared at Bernkastel.`
`"......And...you aren't a witch.`
` ......You're a reaper."`
`"That's right.`
` I have the sickle that reaps all hope and miracles.`
` So I must be what you say."`
`"...You're a reaper, who stole away the hope that kept Ange alive...`
`...and lured her towards death."`
`You're the one who threw about truths of the past, stealing the future from Ange's eyes and forcing her to look only at the past.`
` And, you're the one who thrust the hope-crushing Single Truth in front of her, `
`gently pushing her from behind as she, of her own accord, took that step from the skyscraper's roof off into the world of nothingness.`
`"But now, I'll free Ange from the spell that you represent!!`
` Ange won't be trapped by the curse of the past anymore!!`
` She'll step forward into the future!!`
` But not into the emptiness of the abyss that you're trying to lure her into.`
` ...Ange will live strong...in the future starting in 1998!!"`
`"Humans are wretched creatures, who walk into the future while staring back into the past!!`
` That's why they easily plummet into pitfalls and flip over like comical fools!!"`
`"Come, Bernkastel!!!`
` A witch of the past like you can't block the radiance of the future!!"`
`"Aha, ahhahahahahahahahaha!!!`
` Yes, let's go, let's follow the rules of your game!!`
` I'll give you some closed room riddles.`
` But, since I'm short-tempered, heavy-handed, and easily bored, I'll give you all of them at once!!!"`
`Bernkastel spread her hands, and it seemed as though a halo or angel wings were spreading out behind her.`
`Each of the countless rays that spread out from her...were the blue streaks of closed room mystery blades.`
`Bernkastel, who had traveled the sea of Fragments for many, many years, had gathered these countless closed room mysteries as souvenirs from all over the place.`
`All of those rays twisted at once...and aimed towards Battler.`
`It was as though infinite giant snakes had turned their heads to stare at him.`
`"......If you fail to shoot down even a single puzzle, `
`then this is goodbye.`
` I'm not as forgiving as Beato, who gave you until October 5 at midnight to give your answer.`
` If you don't answer immediately, you'll die."`
`In other words, this was no 'mystery'.`
`This wasn't an intellectual game, but a merciless assault.`
`"Die."`
`"......!!!"`
`All at once, hundreds of guided lasers known as mysteries shot at Battler.`
`The complex geometric figure drawn by those blue lasers was nothing but divinely beautiful.`
`Each one was a mystery.`
` Trying to solve each one in this oppressive hailstorm would be like threading a storm of approaching needles.`
`Battler flew freely through this vast space, dodging the beautiful blue streaks of mystery as he shot them down one after another.`
`The entirety of the mystery knowledge he had built up before this day told him the answer to each puzzle.`
`Each time his eyes glowed with the answer, one of the mysteries shattered.`
`However, each mystery was only one out of hundreds.`
` This hardly rose to the level of 'opposition' or 'resistance'.`
`"......Onii-chan, it's impossible...!!`
` Run!!"`
`"There is no unsolvable mystery, ...just like there is no inescapable fate."`
`"Onii-chan...!!"`
`"Watch, Ange.`
` Don't miss what I'm trying to show you..."`
`By now, the bundle of mysteries looked like one giant snake with blue streaming behind it.`
`Battler skillfully dodged it, precisely splitting its many fangs off one by one.`
`...Even though he knew his resistance was useless, like trying to pick up all the grains of sand on a beach one by one.`
`"Not bad.`
` ......Classic mysteries were your specialty, right?`
` Then what about twists on the genre?`
` Let's see if you can handle more and more mysteries from all times and places."`
`Even though Battler was still fighting the giant snake, wings appeared behind Bern once more.`
`And......they gave birth to seven more huge snakes.`
`It now looked like a great dragon with seven heads.`
`"Ushiromiya Battler,`
` it's true that you're a very avid reader and an expert on the mystery genre.`
` But you're still young.`
` ...There's a limit to how many books and mysteries you could've read.`
` ...Learn that this world is filled with countless riddles and tricks that you've never heard of."`
`"...Onii-chan!!`
` You can't do this anymore!!!`
` Please, just run away!!`
` You can't beat Bernkastel!!"`
`Battler's expression remained calm.`
`However, his whole body was covered with sweat, and he was breathing hard.`
`It was clear that he couldn't overcome this onslaught, though Battler himself refused to admit it.`
`Battler wiped away his sweat...and fixed his gaze on the eight snake heads that surrounded him in three dimensions...`
`"...Ange,`
` ......you believed that someone from your family would come back some day,`
` lived that way for 12 years, ...and then lost your spirit.`
` For a time, you surrendered to the miracle that refused to happen."`
`"......That's..."`
`"In that case,`
` ...if I want to see you off as you try and step forward into the future, `
`...I mustn't surrender to a miracle myself."`
`"That's right.`
` But I'll still harvest your miracles and hopes.`
` All of them, without mercy."`
`What was now an eight-headed dragon...opened its eight jaws.`
`It looked for weak points from all angles, hoping to swallow Battler in a single gulp.`
`He wouldn't be able to dodge any longer.`
`"Ange-san,`
` ...if you're expecting a miracle, then I have some bad news for you."`
`"......?!"`
`"Beato has now been completely destroyed, and it's even been announced in red.`
` Do you know what that means?"`
`"........."`
`"Since Beato has been destroyed, the Golden Land has been destroyed as well.`
` ...That means that everyone has vanished.`
` In other words, you no longer have any friends who can conveniently show up and save you from this pinch."`
`Beato has been destroyed, and that's been confirmed in red.`
` ...Therefore, no one else could come to rescue them.`
`...Even EVA was a resident of the Golden Land.`
`After bravely breaking the key's seal earlier on, she had probably hidden away somewhere.`
`However, now that Beato had been destroyed, ...all of the residents of the Golden Land had met the same fate as ice under the sun...`
`Any faint hopes Ange might have had that EVA was hiding in the shadows, ready to save them from this final pinch,`
` ...had been completely crushed from the moment Bernkastel smashed that golden heart...`
`There was no one left to save them from this crisis.`
`She couldn't hope for the appearance of any new factor that might save her brother.`
`And what about Ange herself?`
`She could only watch from where she stood.`
`If I help, will I be able to bring about some kind of miracle...?`
`But I don't know that much about the mystery genre.`
`I've only watched Beato's game Fragments, gathering some basic training on how to fight.`
`At best, I can avoid slowing him down, ...but I can't protect my brother.`
`But...I can't just watch...`
`"O-Onii-chan...!!`
` Let me fight too...!!"`
`"Stay back!`
` ...Just...keep watching.`
` ...And think."`
`"Think about what...?!!"`
`"Go back to how you felt at the very beginning, ......back when you were six years old, ...when it all started."`
`"...How I felt...when I was six..."`
`"You've lived for 12 years looking for the truth.`
` ...But that's not your real, greatest wish."`
`"...My...greatest wish......"`
`"We prepared this final game...to protect that wish and that hope.`
` Unfortunately, you've wasted that chance.`
` ...So, you'll have to abandon that hope as you step forward into the future.`
` ......But even so,`
` even so, ...if there's strength in your heart, ...you can still have it."`
`"...Have what......?"`
`"Remember...`
`your very first wish.`
` ...Even after learning the Single Truth, remember."`
`The Single Truth.`
`Even after learning the heartless truth...that everyone is dead and no one will come home, ...remember.`
`Remember your very first wish.`
`"Onii-chan!!!"`
`There was a cataclysmic flash, as brilliant as the birth of a sun.`
`All of the palely glowing snakes...ran through Battler.`
`He was stained red, surrounded with a cloud of blood.`
`Then, he stumbled, ...and in the end, he looked at Ange.`
`Ange...couldn't say anything in response.`
`The light in Battler's eyes faded, ......and, slowly, ...his body began to fall...`
`It reached the ground...and gently landed like something settling on the ocean floor.`
`Ange rushed toward him...and saw the last expression that would ever cross her dead brother's face.`
`His eyes were opened wide, ...filled with an unwavering determination until the very last second...`
`"......Was Ange-san ever that good at mysteries?"`
`"She's nothing compared to Battler."`
`The waving snakes raised their heads...and surrounded Ange.`
`Ange...had no blades to fight with.`
`She could only cling to her brother's dead face, saying his name over and over.`
`"This is a surprisingly boring ending.`
` ......I guess that's checkmate."`
`"............"`
`The eight snake heads......all attacked at once.`
`Ange held her brother's dead face, ...thinking about his final words...`
`My very first wish... It could only be one thing...`
`That everyone......would come home...`
`That fueled my life for 12 years, until I finally wore out and abandoned my own hope.`
`In exchange for the hope I'd abandoned, I began searching for the truth.`
`Then, at the end of the truth, ...I was forced to see a brutal ruthlessness that I didn't need to know about,`
` ...and as a result, I was faced with the true despair of knowing that no one would come home.`
`That final hope, ...which I still felt attached to even after abandoning it, was crushed.`
`The Single Truth.`
`If only I didn't know that, ...I might still be able to hold onto that faint hope.`
`But, ......now......`
`You can still have it.`
`If there's strength in your heart,`
` you can still have it.`
`Remember...your very first wish.`
`".........Gahah, ...ggghh!"`
`Battler was coughing.`
`Impossible.`
`His whole body had been pierced, and he had been completely dead.`
`For him to cough would be too much of a miracle to be possible.`
`"What?!!`
` Why?!`
` Battler died!!`
` So why...why was he revived?!"`
`Battler rose to his feet slowly.`
`Though blood still dribbled from his mouth, his expression was fearless.`
`However, Ange didn't stand up.`
`She kept sitting, her head lowered.`
`"......Well, that was a nice warm-up.`
` ...Shall we get started, Bernkastel?!`
` Time for Round 2...!!"`
`"Wh-What in the...why, my master?!`
` The dead can't revive!!"`
`"Impossible!!`
` ...#ff0000`
`Battler died!!!#ffffff`
` How can he revive?!"`
`"......Onii-chan......is alive......"`
`"#ff0000I've used the red truth!!`
` I've announced that Battler died#ffffff, right?!`
` So why, how did he come back to life?!?!"`
`"Even if the whole world says he died,`
` ......I'll be the one person in the world who believes...`
` ...Onii-chan is alive.`
` And, someday, ...he'll come back to me."`
`"That's right.`
` ...As long as you hold onto that hope, ...none of your miracles will ever be destroyed!"`
`"...H-How dare you stand before the Witch of Miracles...and claim to understand theeeeeeeeem?!!`
` Uuuuurrrrrgggggggghghh, swallow them, grind them up, `
`erase both siblings noooooooooooooooww!!!"`
`You can't erase us.`
`""Even if the whole world refuses to accept it, miracles will happen if we continue to believe!!""`
`The eight wriggling snake heads transformed into a massive whale jaw...and swallowed everything.`
`"There will be no miracle!!`
` #ff0000You can't open your heart to anyone who exists!!#ffffff`
` So diiiiiiiiiiiie!!!"`
`"You're wrong.`
` ...Everyone...will protect me."`
`The cruel whale of mystery that tried to swallow everything...was gouged deeply by a massive wedge.`
`This deeply pounded wedge could only be used by those who had talent and a deep love for mysteries.`
`"That trick's such a clicheeeeeeeee...!!`
` I read and got bored of that one ages ago!"`
`The woman who stood back to back with Battler, launching stakes, ...was very, very clearly...`
`"Beato?!?!`
` How?!`
` #ff0000I announced your death with the red truth!!#ffffff"`
`"......And what is this red truth of yours...?"`
`"#ff0000The red truth is absolute!!`
` A perfect truth, which no one can overturn no matter how hard they try!!#ffffff"`
`"Even if the whole world gets together...`
`...and denies the truth about my family,`
` ...even if that's forced in front of my eyes as the Single Truth,`
` ...I won't acknowledge it.`
` After all..."`
`Ange slowly rose to her feet.`
`Around her, ...the shapes of people slowly appeared, and they also rose to their feet.`
`One after another, a whole crowd of them.`
`They were...Ange's family, her relatives.`
` Everyone from Rokkenjima.`
`That wasn't all.`
` Everyone from the Golden Land and all of the Illusions appeared and, following Ange's lead, they rose to their feet.`
`Then, all of them glared at Bernkastel.`
`"Even if the whole world denies my hope, I won't abandon it.`
` I won't abandon my certain hope that everyone's alive.`
` ...And, I've found something.`
` ......I've found...how I'll live as a witch."`
`"......Y-You... ...Weren't you just a Witch of the Future...?`
` Just a powerless witch who could only shed tears of regret for the past...?!"`
`"I'm the Golden Witch, ANGE Beatrice.`
` ...I am the Golden, the Endless,`
` ......`
`and the Witch of Resurrection."`
`"......You've found it, haven't you, Ange?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Thanks, Onee-chan.`
` ...After all those long years, I've finally found it."`
`"I always knew you'd be able to find it."`
`"Thanks, Onii-chan.`
` ...I've understood...`
`what your last game was trying to show me."`
`"Disappear, stupid delusions!!!`
` I can't...`
`I can't accept something like thiiiiiiiiiiis!!!"`
`"Everyone will be with me for eternity.`
` No matter how many times people try to kill them with the red truth,`
` ...I'll reject it.`
` Everyone will be revived for me no matter how many times it takes.`
` ......I am ANGE, Witch of Resurrection!!`
` Your red truth can't lay a finger on my world!!!"`
`"Uuurrrggggaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggghhh!!!"`
`Ange--or rather, Ange and her family and her friends--all fired off golden streaks at once.`
`They were the same as the marks left by Bernkastel's great snakes.`
`However, the glow inside these...was gold.`
`Then, they wriggled, combined into one single mass, and transformed into an eagle that now had two wings.`
`It wasn't one-winged anymore.`
`Thanks to Ange's absolute willpower, the golden eagle had gained the wing it needed to fly into the future.`
`Those spread wings......made Bernkastel and the whale shrink back.`
`"The Ushiromiya eagle never looks back."`
`"And it never gives up...!!"`
`The golden eagle easily swallowed the blue whale with its wings, grinding it to bits.`
`And it didn't let the whale's master escape either.`
`It was now Bernkastel's turn to run.`
`Bernkastel didn't fight the golden eagle.`
` She couldn't.`
`In this world of Ange's, where even the red truth couldn't hurt anyone, what sort of attack could affect her?`
`She frantically ran this way and that, throwing one wedge of red truth after another at the Ushiromiya family.`
`Ushiromiya Kinzo is dead.`
`Ushiromiya Krauss is dead.`
`Ushiromiya Natsuhi is dead.`
`She repeated this over and over again, ...but no one fell down.`
`Ange wouldn't accept it, so they couldn't pierce anyone.`
`"...Th-This is...`
` Is this sort of Endless Nine even possible...?!`
` E-Even the red truth...doesn't work?!!`
` Just what is this gold truth?!!`
` What kind of gold truth could defeat red truth...?!!!"`
`"A believing heart.`
` ...This is 'our' consensus.`
` ...Your red truth can't pierce any part of the truth that we all acknowledge and share."`
`"......So long, Bernkastel!`
` ...This time, it's really checkmate."`
`"I-I......won't accept something like this, `
`I woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooon't!!!"`
`The massive golden eagle...finally swallowed Bernkastel whole.`
`It then slammed into the vast ceiling, ...and there was an incredible explosion accompanied by an earthquake.`
`From the cracked ceiling, along with many falling chips, ...a single black cat plummeted...and slammed against the floor.`
`Erika ran up to it, repeatedly calling out to her master, hugging it.`
`Then, she realized that it was still breathing, and simultaneous expressions of relief and shock rose to her face.`
`"...Don't worry.`
` I won't let you lay a finger on my truth, but in the same way, I won't lay a finger on your truth."`
`"...She looks like a wet mop."`
`"Call it a good scolding, free of charge."`
`"Beato,`
` don't act too cozy with my big brother.`
` I still haven't accepted your relationship, got it?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` It was quite bold of you to revive me, fool!`
` But it's too late. My charming subordinates and I shall torment you until the day you die!!`
` And I'll make you watch Battler flirt with me every day!!`
` Wah?!"`
`"Oh, that's pretty convenient.`
` Looks like this resurrection magic has an off switch."`
`"Wha......wai......An......!!"`
`Beato kept appearing and disappearing like a lightbulb turning on and off.`
` Ange seemed to be enjoying herself.`
`"Waaaaaaah, Battleeeeeeeer, Ange's being mean!"`
`"Go easy on her, Ange."`
`"Sure.`
` If you say so, Onii-chan."`
`"Ange, you're incredible!! Uryu-!!"`
`"Ange-sama!!`
` Congratulations on becoming a Witch of Resurrection!!`
` This way, we'll all...be with you forever!"`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` We're all here.`
` ...The anti-magic toxin doesn't matter one bit.`
` You'll be with me for all eternity."`
`"Nice, Ange.`
` Well said!!"`
`Everyone surged forward, squishing Ange.`
`They tried tossing her into the air, but dropped her onto her butt, and everyone laughed.`
`Ange looked a bit resentful, but when her brother lent her a hand, she got up and joined the circle of smiles...`
`A quiet applause greeted them.`
`Featherine, their witness, had acknowledged their victory and was clapping for them.`
`"...Splendidly done,`
` Lady ANGE Beatrice.`
` ...In celebration of this miracle, I bestow upon you the title of Lady.`
` The tale you weaved was quite entertaining."`
`"............"`
`"There is no need to be so hostile.`
` I am congratulating you."`
`Featherine smiled serenely.`
`Then, the cat overlords broke their positions in their constellation and lined up behind her.`
`It was clear that this was not only a peaceful action, but part of a solemn ceremony.`
`"You have defeated my miko.`
` And I thank you for sparing her life.`
` ......As you can see, she was my cute pet cat, who never ceased to save me from boredom.`
` If she died, boredom would overcome me as well."`
`The true strength of this being, who referred to Bernkastel as a pet cat, had already been made clear during her fight with Lambdadelta.`
`Even so, Ange spoke.`
`"...I...won't forgive you for killing Lambdadelta."`
`"My, that doesn't sound like the words of a Witch of Resurrection.`
` Can you not revive her whenever you wish?"`
`"Huh?`
` I can revive her...?!"`
`"It's okay!`
` I'm sure that Lady Lambdadelta has been revived somewhere, thanks to your power. There's no need to worry."`
`"Indeed.`
` She has already been moved to the audience seating I prepared for her.`
` Do not fear.`
` I shall take good care of her."`
`"Really?!`
` That's...wonderful..."`
`Ange finally relaxed and let the tension leave her whole body.`
`"Well now.`
` ...Battler,`
` you are now the sole Game Master of your final game."`
`"......True.`
` That cat of yours looks like she's out of the running."`
`"Perhaps you should carry on with the final ceremony of your game...`
` ...My miko is as forgetful as a cat, but she can sometimes be as persistent as one.`
` I suggest getting it over with quickly."`
`"......Yeah.`
` ...Okay, I'll follow your advice there."`
`"I shall be your witness and record a detailed account of it all."`
`"The final...ceremony...`
` ...So, even this game...is about to end."`
`Battler nodded silently.`
`Then, he stepped out from the crowd and motioned for Ange to follow him.`
`As Ange passed by each member of the Ushiromiya family, they cheered her on, giving her words of encouragement.`
`Battler took out the golden key and handed it to Ange.`
`It now had the same glint it had possessed when he had first given it to her.`
`Then, two doors appeared out of thin air on either side of them.`
`They had a stately design, ...making the importance of this choice clear.`
`"...Am I supposed to pick one without any hints?"`
`"Of course not.`
` I'll give you a hint.`
` By now, it should be an easy puzzle.`
` A simple puzzle with two answers.`
` And you'll choose your answer by opening one of the doors."`
`"I see...`
` Okay.`
` So, this is a continuation of that Halloween party.`
` I fell asleep during that party, didn't I?`
` I'm glad to finally wrap that up properly."`
`"Beato,`
` come forward."`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` After all, you fell asleep before you got to my puzzle.`
` I'm glad I now have a chance to tell it."`
`"Sorry about that.`
` It sounds like it'll be pretty tough."`
`"Uryu-!`
` You'll be fine, Ange!"`
`"Kihihihihihi, I wonder about that."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Prepare yourself. It's a tough one!"`
`"...Calm down, Ange.`
` It's an easy puzzle.`
` ......Don't you remember the first thing your brother told you, ...about how to choose the best possible option...?"`
`"........."`
`"Battler, you're giving too many hints.`
` This is the triumphant return of Lady ANGE, Witch of the Future.`
` All you have to do is watch over her."`
`"...True.`
` Then I'll hand it over to Beato.`
` ...I'm counting on you."`
`"Indeed.`
` ......Then let us begin."`
`"...O-Okay."`
`Ange gulped, then stared up at the witch's face.`
`The witch held out her #cc99ffleft hand#ffffff, bringing it close to Ange's face.`
`Then, she slowly spread her fingers.`
`"Look carefully at my palm.`
` I'm not hiding anything, correct?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` There's nothing there."`
`"Watch closely.`
` I'll make a fist,`
` ...and then stretch out my index finger."`
`She stretched out her index finger and held it right in front of Ange's eyes.`
`"Watch the tip of my finger closely.`
` Ready? It'll be fast."`
`The witch rapidly lifted her index finger high into the air, pointing at the heavens.`
`Just as Ange looked up to see the finger raised high, it swung down as though trying to dodge her gaze.`
`In that manner, `
`...up, down, left, right, then left again.`
`Ange, feeling as though she'd lose if she couldn't keep up with the fingertip, swung her face this way and that, looking serious.`
`The witch's hand moved faster and faster.`
` Ange didn't lose track of it.`
`Then, after the high pointing finger was swung down all of a sudden,`
` ...the index finger curled up again, and the hand was held in a simple fist.`
`"............"`
`"Ready? `
`I'm going to open my hand..."`
`The witch slowly opened her #cc99ffright fist#ffffff...`
`And there......was a cutely wrapped candy.`
`"Got it?"`
`"Yeah."`
`"Was this a trick or magic?`
` That is my puzzle for you."`
`"Go ahead, Ange.`
` ...Give your answer.`
` Is this a trick or magic...?"`
`I...know.`
`I know what the answer is.`
`"If your answer is 'magic', open this door.`
` If it's 'a trick', then open that door."`
`I had already decided upon my answer.`
`"This is my answer."`
`I walked over to the door that represented the answer I had chosen.`
`Then, I put the golden key into the keyhole...and turned to face everyone.`
`"The Ushiromiya eagle never looks back."`
`"...That's right.`
` Sorry."`
`I gripped the key tightly and twisted.`
`Then, the key and the door flashed brilliantly...and slowly faded away.`
`Beyond the door...was a strangely-colored space.`
`If I step into this, ...I'll reach the future I chose.`
`Before taking that single step, ...I spoke without turning back.`
`"The Ushiromiya eagle never turns back.`
` ...So I won't turn around, but I'll say this!`
` Thank you, everyone.`
` But this isn't goodbye!`
` I'll always be with you all!!"`
`"Yeah.`
` You won't turn back.`
` But we'll always be standing behind you."`
`"...That's not what I mean!!`
` Despite it all, I still believe.`
` I'm positive...that everyone will come back!!"`
`"......Ange..."`
`"That is good.`
` ...Ange,`
` I look forward to the day when we all meet again."`
`"Ange, my adorable granddaughter.`
` We may be away for some time.`
` ...Here, don't forget this.`
` It's your prize from that quiz party."`
`A gold butterfly flew over my shoulder, landed on my palm, and turned into `
`.`
`"...This was lying next to me when I woke up on the sofa, wasn't it?`
` ...This was...my prize."`
`"Take it back to the future with you, and treasure it."`
`"Thanks, ...everyone."`
`"......Maybe I should've taken this a bit more seriously."`
`I...took a step forward.`
`Forward...into the future.`
`I won't say goodbye.`
`So, see you later.`
`We'll always be together.`
`The wind brushed against my cheek.`
`I slowly opened my shut eyes.`
`...I must have had my eyes closed for a very long time.`
`Even the sparkles below me...seemed blindingly bright.`
`...It was a strange world, with a sea of stars beneath me.`
`The wind was cold.`
` ...However, it told me that I had returned to reality.`
`I was standing with one foot outstretched......over that starry sea.`
`How long have I been here?`
`...Time has probably been stopped for me ever since Bern lured me forward, ...when I was about to take that step off the edge.`
`"........."`
`I slowly......pulled my foot back in.`
`Then, I leaned against the fence and sat down.`
`The sky...was far away.`
`But so was the ground.`
`This whole time, I've been in this sad place, so far from both of those worlds.`
`I can't...go to the sky.`
`In that case, I have to return to my world.`
`"And the elevator is probably the way to go.`
` ...I've done enough skydiving.`
` ...Yeah, there really is no chance.`
` No chance of me jumping down from here and surviving by some miracle."`
`Some Witch of Miracles has already guaranteed with certainty that such a miracle won't occur, after all.`
`Then, I finally noticed them.`
`It was the guards President Okonogi had assigned to me.`
`They were approaching the fence with forced smiles and sweat dripping down their faces, trying not to startle me.`
`That's right.`
` I gave these guys the slip before jumping off, didn't I?`
`"......Did you think I was going to jump?"`
`"W-Well, that's...umm......"`
`"...Sorry.`
` If I jumped, I guess you'd really catch it from Okonogi-san."`
`"Ange-san, ...it's dangerous there.`
` For now, please come back to this side..."`
`"Let me stay here a bit longer.`
` ......It's okay.`
` I won't get any sudden ideas.`
` Do any of you have a cell phone?"`
`"Y-Yes..."`
`"I want to talk to Okonogi-san about something.`
` Would you mind calling him?"`
`The guards looked at each other, then rushed to take out their cell phones.`
`They were worried that I might get annoyed and jump off, leaving them to take the blame.`
`"...Th-The president has picked up...`
` ......Here..."`
`"Thanks.`
` ...Hello, Okonogi-san?`
` ......Yeah.`
` Sorry for calling all of a sudden.`
` No, it's excellent news.`
` A bit of an early Christmas present.`
` ...I'm giving all of the Ushiromiya group to you.`
` ......That's right.`
` In exchange, I have a few things I want."`
`As she gazed down at the sea of stars spread out on the ground below her, Ange spoke.`
`She spoke of how she would live from now on.`
`......Ushiromiya Ange's strange and mysterious adventure...ends here.`
`But my life will continue.`
`After all, there's already something for me to do.`
`I am ANGE Beatrice, witch of Mariage Sorcière.`
`"Ushiromiya Ange just fell from here and died.`
` ...I am the witch, ANGE.`
` ...I'll live.`
` As a witch."`
`"And so, your game ends."`
`As Ange opened the door and vanished from sight, ...the residents of the Golden Land disappeared as well.`
`Afterwards, only Battler could still be seen.`
`He had now done everything he could for Ange...`
`"...Close the door.`
` ...Wasn't there some rule to be followed when closing this door?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ...The rule said that you needed two people to close it."`
`"Hey, Aunt Eva."`
`"I told you to stop talking to me like I'm an old lady!"`
`The two of them stood to the left and right of the door that Ange had vanished through.`
`"Ange,`
` ...find happiness in your future."`
`"After all, we'll always be with you."`
`Then, the two of them held their hands out in front of them.`
`As they did, a door popped into existence and closed.`
`Then, the door itself faded away...`
`"...And now, we have completed our role."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...This marks the end of the pieces' purpose."`
`"You have worked hard, both of you.`
` ...And with this, I shall clean up your game board and put it away."`
`Slowly, ...the world melted.`
`At a glance, it looked as though the City of Books was starting to fall apart.`
`But that wasn't it.`
`Battler and EVA's world...was being cut off from the City of Books.`
`The world broke apart bit by bit, and the ceiling would probably fall in soon.`
`"This is goodbye,`
` Battler-kun."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...See you later. And, someday,`
` I'll leave Ange in your hands, Aunt Eva."`
`"At least at the end, try calling me EVA onee-san, would you?"`
`"............"`
`"See you later, Erika.`
` Somewhere, someday."`
`"......Both Ange and I were Witches of Truth.`
` ...So...just what was the difference between us?"`
`"......Yeah, what could it be?"`
`"I...was a witch who endured and withstood the truth,`
` ...but I turned my back on that truth.`
` ...However, even after she learned the truth, she continued to believe in her own truth.`
` ......If she was a true Witch of Truth,`
` ...then what kind of witch was I?"`
`"That's right.`
` ......You...aren't a witch."`
`"............"`
`"After all, you're the detective."`
`".........`
`......<Good>.`
` ...I'd forgotten."`
`"We'll meet again, someday.`
` ...Wherever there's a crime, the detective's sure to be there, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` When another crime occurs in the Ushiromiya family, `
`I promise to appear."`
`"So long, great detective."`
`"So long, my rival.`
` I look forward to the day when the two of us can cross blades again."`
`Those...were the final words the two ever spoke to each other.`
`A terrible roar and a cloud of dust blew by, covering everything.`
`...And then, everything vanished.`
`Nothing remained.`
`Battler and EVA were both gone.`
`The City of Books was wrapped in silence.`
`"......It's all...over."`
`"Yes,`
` Great Lady Aurora."`
`"...Take care of my pet cat.`
` ...Now, I shall go too.`
` There are some things that must be cleaned up in this world as well."`
`When Hachijo made her announcement, `
`everyone fell silent, thinking they had misheard her.`
`Before too long though, the crowd exploded with a shower of questions about what she meant by this.`
`"Th-That's...too cruel...!!"`
`"You can't do that after dragging us along this far!!"`
`"Madam Hachijo, we have come from far and wide to see it, yes?!`
` How can you...do this now?!!"`
`"......I will say it again.`
` I've changed my mind.`
` Ushiromiya Eva's diary will not be made public."`
`"A-A fraud, this is all a fraud...!!"`
`"Was it really Ushiromiya Eva's diary?`
` Are you sure it wasn't a fabrication you created?!"`
`"You think you can get away with something like this?!!`
` Show us the book!!!"`
`"Children of men can be so hideous.`
` ...Neither you nor I have the right to read what lies in there.`
` ...However, now that I think of it, this has been quite an entertaining show.`
` Children of men who disturb the sleep of the dead and spread rumors for their own entertainment can be quite amusing, at times like this.`
` ......Let us go, Bern.`
` I have had my share of entertainment for the night..."`
`A black cat jumped onto Hachijo's shoulder,`
` and she disappeared off to the side of the stage, the Book of the Single Truth in her arms.`
`Only the angry yells of the massive crowd remained...`
`And so, ...the people began to lose interest in Ushiromiya Eva's diary,`
` ...doubting whether it had even truly existed.`
`Though the weekly magazines were in an uproar over the scam Hachijo Tohya had pulled,`
` some began to openly wonder if the Rokkenjima mystery itself was an indiscreet desecration of the dead.`
`I don't think a little thing like this will allow Rokkenjima to rest in peace.`
`However, it did create an atmosphere where people were slightly more hesitant to openly show interest in the Rokkenjima mystery.`
`An unopened cat box is eternal.`
`Rokkenjima will probably never find peace.`
`However, ......even so, compared to how it was before, ...life will surely be easier.`
`......Because, as the years pass, ...the dust will slowly pile up on it where it lies in the depths of oblivion.`
`At the bottom of the deep sea known as the depths of oblivion, ...the cat box of the witches will probably get slowly buried as the years pass.`
`Featherine...threw a single golden rose into that sea.`
`An offering to let the cat box rest in peace.`
`With the tale of that golden rose, ...let us mark the end of this long story.`
`In the darkness, there was a massive roar and an earthquake.`
`When it passed, ...dawn began to rise over the endless night...`
`"Where am I......?"`
`"We're in the wreckage of an old submarine base.`
` Don't you remember...?"`
`"It's where it all started."`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` The place where we first met, two generations ago."`
`"Hahaha.`
` Sounds pretty romantic if you put it that way."`
`Battler and Beato...could be seen in the ruins of Rokkenjima's underground submarine base.`
`The cave's mouth opened to the sea, and the gentle sound of the waves drifted in along with the cries of the seagulls.`
`It seemed that the typhoon, which had closed off the island for two days, ...had finally gotten bored and gone away.`
`Beato went down to the shore and lifted up a large sheet.`
`Beneath it...was a motorboat.`
`Of course, it wasn't from the time of the war.`
` It was modern.`
`"Pile this up on the boat.`
` Careful, it's heavy."`
`"Whoa.`
` This is a gold ingot.`
` I thought they all got buried."`
`"I thought something like this might happen, `
`so I snuck this one out beforehand."`
`The single heavy gold ingot was dropped into the boat.`
`I'm not sure how much this is worth by itself, but it must be quite a lot.`
`"Have you ever driven a motorboat before?"`
`"You're joking, right?"`
`"It's easy.`
` I'll teach you."`
`She wasn't used to this, but after several mistakes, Beato finally got the engine started.`
`"If you go out that way and hop from island to island, you'll see Niijima before too long.`
` Then, you can just land on a sandy beach."`
`"...Aren't you coming?"`
`"I cannot.`
` ...I am the master of the Golden Land.`
` I cannot leave this place."`
`"What's to be gained from staying?"`
`"What's to be gained from going?"`
`"Let's live."`
`"......I cannot.`
` I have already committed countless sins in countless worlds.`
` The number of lives I have taken, the number of sins I have committed...is far too great."`
`"But you haven't committed any sins in our world."`
`"No, ......that is not true."`
`"............"`
`"Go.`
` Go while I'm still in a good mood.`
` Otherwise, I may seal the island in a storm again."`
`Battler suddenly spun around.`
`When Beato turned around to see what was going on, her body was suddenly lifted into the air.`
`"Then `
`I'll take you back as a souvenir from the Golden Land."`
`"L-Let go...!`
` Th-This isn't safe...!!"`
`"C'mon, don't freak out.`
` Listen carefully, Beatrice."`
`"Wh-What...?"`
`"I'm going to kidnap you."`
`".........Ba..."`
`As Battler quietly gazed at her with serious eyes, Beato was lost for words.`
`"If you've sinned,`
` then I've sinned as well for making you do it.`
` ...So, let's carry your cross together."`
`"...Battler......"`
`"As long as I live,`
` ...I'll carry your cross.`
` ...Let's leave the Golden Land.`
` You and me, together."`
`Beato was now too shocked to say anything at all.`
`Then, tears poured from her eyes, and she covered her face.`
`Battler gently set her down on the boat.`
`He undid the mooring ropes.`
`...Now, there was no longer anything tying this boat to the island.`
`"Let's go."`
`Controlling the boat as Beato had taught him, Battler slowly guided it out...`
`When they passed out of the dimly lit cavern, they were immediately struck by the bright rays of the sun and surrounded by a crowd of white seagulls.`
`As the seagulls flew this way and that, ...the feathers they dropped in the water seemed to celebrate the boat's departure.`
`The brilliant sunlight told them that they were now free of the island's curse.`
`...The sky, now freed from the seal of the typhoon, seemed too bright to be real.`
`Feeling hot, Battler took off his jacket.`
` ...It was swept away by the wind and danced through the sky.`
`However, instead of panicking, Battler just smiled as he watched it go.`
`Beato also watched it go.`
`...No, she watched the island go.`
`Rokkenjima...and the Golden Land she had spent a thousand years in.`
`"Will I......be able to live...?"`
`"You will.`
` ...You won't have a magical butler, but there's all sorts of useful stuff out there.`
` ...There's no end to the things you couldn't find on Rokkenjima.`
` I'll...show you what the world's like."`
`"......Will I...be able to live...?"`
`Beato repeated the same words again.`
`Battler knew what she meant.`
`However, no matter what answer he gave, he wouldn't be able to resolve her problem now.`
`...However, there was a way to resolve it.`
`Time...and the heart.`
`Little by little, bit by bit.`
`Like a chain being cut by falling drops of water, ...he would have to sever the curse of the island gradually, ...over a long period of time.`
`It might take a long, long time.`
`However, someday, ...she will be free.`
`That's what I believe.`
`"I am a sinful witch, who toyed with hundreds of deaths on that island.`
` ...Your world...is too brilliant for me."`
`"No, you will live."`
`I answered immediately and forcefully.`
`"If you think you need to atone for hundreds of sins, then keep on living and living.`
` Live as hard as you can, ...with everything you've got.`
` That's the only way you can atone."`
`"......Is that...truly the only way to atone for my sins?"`
`"That's right.`
` And you'll definitely be able to do it someday.`
` Trust me."`
`".........Battler......"`
`"Come on, don't look at me with those teary eyes.`
` It's embarrassing..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...`
` Forgive me.`
` Then, at the very least,`
` ...would you close your eyes?"`
`"...Wh-Why should I...? Hey, your face is pretty close..."`
`"Foolish man...`
` You ought to be cursed for taking the witch away from the Golden Land.`
` ......That's why you must close your eyes.`
` ...I-It's...embarrassing for me too."`
`As soon as Battler shut his eyes...`
`Soft lips...covered his.`
`Then, they slowly drew back.`
`He tried to open his eyes, but just got slapped.`
`"Don't look, I told you not to look at my face!!"`
`"C-Come on, what's there to lose...?!"`
`"You have no delicacy!`
` Don't open them, not yet!!`
` Why?`
` B-Because I want to kiss you again...!!"`
`The next kiss...was on his earlobe.`
`"H-Hey, quit it...!`
` Now this is getting really embarrassing...!"`
`He knew he'd get hit again if he opened his eyes, so he resisted with his eyes still shut.`
`Then, after sighing and tickling his ear,`
` Beato spoke in her usual cheerful, bullying voice.`
`"Sorry, Battler.`
` I'm a terrible, atrocious witch."`
`"Yeah, I know.`
` You're an evil, cruel witch."`
`"And so, I cannot atone for my sins.`
` After all, I'm the sort of witch who can cackle over hundreds of deaths...!"`
`"Y-You're really something, you know that...?`
` But you wouldn't be you otherwise."`
`He accidentally opened his eyes.`
`...And when he did, ...the witch was nowhere to be seen.`
`The Golden Witch had vanished...like a dream or an illusion.`
`...And...so had the single ingot they had carried with them.`
`A black luxury car was parked at the rear entrance of the skyscraper.`
`Men wearing suits were packing a heavy-looking attache case into its trunk.`
`"Let me handle all the rest.`
` We'll take care of all the complicated details."`
`"I'm counting on you.`
` Aunt Eva trusted you more than anyone, `
`so I'm sure she's glad this is all in your hands now."`
`Out of the building...came Ange and President Okonogi.`
`Ange's expression...was peaceful.`
`It was hard to imagine that this was the same person who had always looked so dark in Okonogi's eyes.`
`"...In her later years, the company president was very ill.`
` I imagine that she said some fairly harsh things to you,`
` ...but I don't believe she truly meant them."`
`"I know.`
` Even I said things I shouldn't have on my bad days."`
`".........You've changed."`
`"You think so?"`
`"...I thought you'd never forgive the president as long as you lived."`
`"You're the one who taught me, Okonogi-san."`
`"I did?`
` Did I say something?"`
`"Without love, the truth cannot be seen."`
`"Did I really say something that pretentious?`
` Hehhahahahahahahaha."`
`"It's been a long journey.`
` ...It really has been a long journey, all just to understand what you told me that day."`
`Of course, Okonogi understood.`
`He understood that, in her heart, this had been a long and profound journey.`
`"Contact me when you decide on a new home and account.`
` I won't let you want for anything."`
`"Any problems with the Sumadera family?"`
`"Leave that to me.`
` We have your power of attorney as our rallying point.`
` Thanks to that, the Ushiromiya group is a united front.`
` ...Because of what you did, Ange-chan, the business built by the former president has been protected.`
` I truly believe she'd be joyful at your decision."`
`"I'm just pushing all the hard stuff on you."`
`When the great President Ushiromiya Eva passed away, the Ushiromiya group was shaken.`
`There was no clear successor, so the group had been in danger of splitting.`
`After that, everyone had been waiting to hear what Ange would say, since she had inherited a large portion of the group's stock.`
`...However, Ange had shown no interest in any of this...`
`and had gone around talking about things like selling all their assets and donating everything to some charity,`
` which had shaken the group even further.`
`There had even been a chance that an outsider, such as the Sumadera family, would interfere and destroy the Ushiromiya group.`
`As disturbing as it may seem, `
`some had wished for the source of all this trouble, Ange, to disappear...`
`...However, Ange had undergone a change of heart, deciding to do what was best for the Ushiromiya group that Eva had built up,`
` and the worst-case scenario had been avoided.`
`Okonogi had been named as Ange's legal guardian.`
`By simply giving him her trust, Ange now had in him the most reliable ally possible.`
`Okonogi himself had certain plans he could carry out based on the knowledge that Ange trusted him.`
`Okonogi, who had carried great responsibility in the Ushiromiya group thanks to his position as Eva's closest confidant, was the most natural choice to be Eva's successor for the top spot,`
` and thanks in part to his ability, everything had now been wrapped up smoothly.`
`This way, the Ushiromiya group was secure.`
`The Ushiromiya group had been the only thing still tied to the Ushiromiya name other than Ange herself,`
` so she might have thought of it as her final link to her family.`
`"You know, you're free to come back any time you want.`
` We have a chair set aside just for you."`
`"Thanks.`
` Just knowing I have a place to go back to...means I can set off on my journey in peace."`
`"What are you going to do from now on?"`
`"I'm going to become an author."`
`"An author?`
` To write novels?"`
`"It doesn't matter what.`
` It could be novels or picture books.`
` If I have any skill at drawing, maybe I'll do a manga.`
` ...What I do doesn't matter.`
` As long as I can share my heart with someone."`
`"...Sounds like you've set a noble task for yourself.`
` I'll be praying for your success."`
`"Thanks.`
` If I manage to publish a book, I'll send you a copy."`
`"I look forward to it."`
`The car's trunk was closed with a clunk.`
`Apparently, all of her luggage had been loaded.`
`"Ah, yes, allow me to introduce you to the driver.`
` He's a protege of mine.`
` He's trustworthy, and you can rely on him for anything.`
` Oh, and he worked as a guard for the old president for many years, so you might recognize him."`
`"...As long as it isn't Amakusa."`
`Achoo!`
` The man walking out of the driver's seat sneezed.`
`"Now that hurts, Lady."`
`"Amakusa, what the hell have you done to her?"`
`"...Well, he was always the most flippant of Aunt Eva's guards.`
` I was hoping for pretty much anyone else."`
`"But he was also the one closest to you, wasn't he?"`
`"...Well, at least listening to him talk can be pretty entertaining."`
`"The boss assigned me to be his contact with you.`
` If you ever get into any sort of trouble, just let me know."`
`"And what if I ask you to go buy me toilet paper?"`
`"Then I'll pick up some tampons too while I'm out."`
`"...See?`
` The guy's a creep."`
`Okonogi guffawed.`
`I got into the back seat.`
`"Stay well,`
` Ange-chan."`
`"I guess this is the last time anyone will call me by that name."`
`"Let me know when you've decided on a new one."`
`Okonogi patted the roof of the car.`
`At that signal, Amakusa honked the horn and removed the hand brake...`
`"So, until you've decided on a new name, I guess I'll be calling you Lady."`
`"That's fine for now."`
`"...Okay.`
` Where are we going?`
` North? South?"`
`"......Any recommendations?"`
`"Why don't we try leaving the main island?`
` I'd suggest Hokkaido.`
` ...Huge meadows, giant clouds!`
` A novelist writing stories in a log cabin... Sounds awesome."`
`"Great, let's head south.`
` ...I was planning to do the opposite of whatever you said anyway."`
`"Heheh, that's pretty harsh."`
`"I'd like to go someplace hot.`
` A town with a view of the sea."`
`Ange closed her eyes.`
`Things had been pretty crazy lately, and she was tired...`
`"Understood.`
` By the time you open your eyes, we'll be in an unfamiliar land.`
` ...But it'll be a warm town with a view of the sea."`
`"Can't wait to see...`
`what you choose."`
`The car got onto the freeway.`
`It was surrounded by the great river of cars heading east and west.`
`By now, no one could tell which of those points was the car she rode in.`
`Starting today, Ushiromiya Ange would change her name and live in a new climate.`
`Changing her name didn't mean that she had given up on being Ange.`
`This was Ange's...`
`No, ANGE Beatrice's mission.`
`I am ANGE Beatrice.`
`The Golden and Endless Witch of Resurrection.`
`A witch of Mariage Sorcière.`
`The final witch, who is still alive in the future called 1998......`
`A strong wind blew through my hair.`
`My nose was filled with the smell of the sea.`
`...I must have been standing still for a very long time.`
`This is...a point cutting through the sea.`
`I was standing on the bow of a boat.`
`I was still holding that thing.`
`"...Lady,`
` if you stand around there too long, you'll freeze."`
`"Amakusa......`
` ...So, this is..."`
`Captain Kawabata's face peered out at her.`
`"You can see it now.`
` That's the old Ushiromiya family dock."`
`"Whoo.`
` Not even a trace of it left."`
`"...I see.`
` ...So, I've come back here.`
` It's been a really long daydream......no, a long and windy side trip."`
`No matter what sort of tales are woven or written about the past,`
` ...they have nothing to do with my tale of the future.`
`I swore to live life looking only at the future, without turning back.`
`If swearing that has a purpose, then this hasn't all been just a daydream.`
`And besides, I've brought many things back with me from that long side trip.`
`Some of those are even immediately useful.`
`"......`
`...But yeah, this isn't going to do me much good."`
`I threw `
` into the ocean.`
`"...!"`
`"...What was that?"`
`"My regrets.`
` ...I've shed my old shell."`
`"So, with old Rokkenjima right in front of you, you're having a change of heart?"`
`"...That's not what I meant.`
` I mean I've had enough of being Human."`
`"?"`
`I won't waste that long journey.`
`I now have a new way to live.`
`And that isn't as the Human called Ushiromiya Ange.`
`I am...reborn.`
`"Captain,`
` sorry, but would you mind leaving for a second?"`
`"Hmm?`
` Sure, whatever you say."`
`Captain Kawabata went down into the driver's area.`
`"...What is it, Lady?`
` Why the troubled face?"`
`"I feel like taking a step into a new life."`
`"You already have."`
`"True.`
` ...If I could sell off all the Ushiromiya family wealth that's burdening me, maybe donating it to some charity, that would be a huge relief.`
` Then, I'd finally be able to escape from the shell called Ushiromiya Ange."`
`"......`
`...It seems a waste of all that money.`
` You could do anything you wanted with it."`
`"Who cares?`
` My point is that I don't need it."`
`"......That may be true.`
` ...Then again, not everything that you'd be selling off belongs to you exclusively.`
` ...For example..."`
`"Are you talking about the Ushiromiya group's stock?"`
`"...That's right.`
` They may be little more than scraps of paper to you,`
` but doing something like that could shatter the whole company...`
` I don't think my boss could bear to have that happen."`
`"Yeah, I know.`
` It's like that for the Sumaderas and President Okonogi alike.`
` There are plenty of people who're in a tough spot because I can do as I please."`
`"......There's no doubt that you're a VIP, Ange-san.`
` Wouldn't it be better to chill out and hide away for now, and just hold off on doing anything flashy...?"`
`"What would be the fastest and most convenient way to prevent this VIP from doing as she pleases, I wonder?"`
`"...Hey, that's a good question...!`
` Well, we could break out the drinks, tell each other our deepest secrets, and..."`
`"Anyone could guess that the final destination of my journey is Rokkenjima.`
` And, right now, Rokkenjima is completely uninhabited.`
` ...There's no one there.`
` No one to see or to hear.`
` This is the perfect day for a closed room."`
`"......Well, yeah, that may be true."`
`"The Sumadera family is chasing me.`
` They even managed to barge into President Okonogi's building with perfect timing.`
` ...Someone leaked the fact that I was there."`
`"Are you saying my boss sold you out?`
` ...Then why would he give you a bodyguard?"`
`"Since he doesn't know what sort of whims I'm going to act on,`
` President Okonogi wants to have both the Sumadera family and me indebted to him.`
` That way, he can sell information about me, let me slip away by a hair, and keep track of my whereabouts, putting both me and the Sumadera family in his debt while keeping a trump card in his hand."`
`"You're definitely overthinking things there..."`
`Amakusa wore a forced smile, trying to smooth things over.`
`"We can be sure that the Sumadera family is chasing me.`
` My actions are being intentionally leaked to them."`
`"Then, we'll bump into each other on Rokkenjima.`
` I will be killed by them.`
` After that, you will kill the Sumadera hit men, `
`and President Okonogi will have a trump card to use in negotiations with the Sumaderas.`
` ...If I die, the Ushiromiya group will be stable for the time being.`
` Plus, they'll be able to draw the line with the Sumadera family.`
` On the other side, the Sumadera family itself will be able to neatly do away with Aunt Kasumi, the leader of their overenthusiastic radical faction.`
` ...Both sides will finish their bargaining with a draw, and everyone'll be happy."`
`"............Whew.`
` ...That's a pretty interesting story you've thought up there."`
`"That golf bag you brought with you...`
` I've had a look at what's inside.`
` Are you planning to start a war or something with all those guns?`
` ...But it had a sniper rifle in it.`
` Would a bodyguard who's always by my side really need something like that?"`
`"Well, you never know what might happen..."`
`"Why would a bodyguard, who works best when traveling light,`
` choose to abandon his position for a whole day to get a gun like that, and right before we leave for Rokkenjima?"`
`"......Lady,`
` ...you're over-thinking this, okay...?"`
`"When I reach Rokkenjima,`
` ...you'll suggest that I go visit the place they died or something, getting me on my own.`
` That's the bait.`
` The bait to lure in Sumadera Kasumi and the others waiting for me on Rokkenjima.`
` After that, you'll use that ridiculously huge gun to round them up. The end."`
`"...Well, what's wrong with rounding them up?`
` Isn't that what a guard's supposed to do?"`
`"In addition to a cutting-edge sniper rifle, you also had a modern German submachine gun."`
`"Those are really handy.`
` No matter how many people the Sumaderas have, I could clean them all up, no trouble..."`
`"There was one more.`
` A handgun.`
` ...Even though the sniper rifle and the submachine gun were the best and the newest models, the handgun alone was beat up and old-fashioned.`
` See?"`
`Ange...pulled the handgun out and pointed it at Amakusa.`
`"...C-Cut it out.`
` This isn't funny..."`
`"A handgun is something you're always supposed to have on your person, right?`
` So, why would you go get a second handgun...and such an unusually old one?`
` One theory can explain this.`
` ...What if...it's the same kind of gun Sumadera Kasumi and the others are using?"`
`"This is a Tokarev.`
` A gun once used by the Soviet military and which has gotten pretty popular in the Japanese underground.`
` It's exactly the sort of weapon the Sumaderas might be using.`
` ...Also, having Sumadera Kasumi die would be convenient for the Sumadera family as well.`
` They could have leaked...no, exchanged information on their end as well.`
` Therefore, it's possible that you knew beforehand that the Sumadera hit men would be using Tokarevs."`
`Amakusa was speechless.`
`Was he speechless because this was all true, or because he was stunned by the determination with which Ange pointed that gun at him?`
`"The plan that you...`
`...no, the plan that all of you made together...`
` It was to use me as bait to lure Sumadera Kasumi to an uninhabited island, setting it up so that both sides appear to finish each other off...`
`"............"`
`A single line of cold sweat dripped down Amakusa's forehead...`
`With the wind whipping through her hair, Ange spoke coldly.`
`"...Just by the presence of this handgun,`
` see how far Ushiromiya Ange's reasoning has taken her.`
` What do you think, everyone...?"`
`"......You haven't taken the safety off."`
`"I know.`
` ...Tokarevs don't have a safety."`
`Amakusa tried to dive behind cover, but he couldn't outrun a bullet.`
`It shot into his gut, making him double over in pain.`
`Ange, who knew that he had a gun hidden in his pocket, then eliminated his chances of a counterattack.`
`Blood spurted from Amakusa's forehead, and he did not close his eyes again.`
`"......There's a perfect, certain way to confirm someone's death without a doctor, and it's the easiest one in the world."`
`"...Y-You......!"`
`Kawabata stuck his head out, and his face went pale when he saw the gruesome scene on the deck.`
`This time, Ange pointed the barrel of the gun at his forehead.`
`"Before we left, you said you needed a bit more time to get the boat ready.`
` However, if you've been bought, `
`then we can say for sure that you were buying time so that Sumadera Kasumi could set up her ambush on Rokkenjima."`
`"......I-I have no idea what you're talking about...!!"`
`"You're a cat box, inside of which is a Kawabata who was bought and betrayed me...and a Kawabata who hasn't betrayed me.`
` ...Now then, how can I kill the one who betrayed me?"`
`"S-Stop...!!`
` Don't shoot...!!"`
`"I just have to shoot the whole cat box to death."`
`The boat's owner slumped over backwards...and fell.`
`Then, with a second bullet, she performed a perfect examination of his corpse.`
`She had...survived.`
`Surely, ...she had survived the web-like conspiracy that had been wrapped around her so cleverly.`
`...Ange returned to the bow of the boat, faced the strong winds head on, and peered into the future in front of her.`
`The boat whose owner was gone...headed towards the endless horizon, on and on in a straight line.`
`She prayed that the truth she truly desired to reach lay before her.`
`Then, ...she heard the sound of clapping.`
`The sound of clapping, on a boat where Amakusa and the captain were no more.`
`However, Ange didn't look surprised.`
`She calmly and slowly turned around.`
`"Splendid reasoning, comrade Ange.`
` My fellow Witch of Truth, ANGE Beatrice."`
`"...Oh, you're here, Erika."`
`"Anytime someone wants to expose the truth, you'll find me there.`
` *giggle*giggle*."`
`"Hey, Erika."`
`"What...?"`
`The boat had already passed by Rokkenjima.`
`The island's silhouette was now off in the distance.`
`The boat headed towards the endless horizon, ...continuing on its endless journey.`
`The new Witch of Truth announced the beginning of this endless journey to her fellow witch.`
`"......I'll carve out my future in my own way."`
`"Sounds splendid."`
`"At the end, ...will there be a truth for me to find?"`
`"Just what sort of truth could you be looking for, after all this?"`
`"............"`
`"............"`
`"......Hmph.`
` ...You're right.`
` I know that the truth isn't worth anything.`
` And there's one more thing I've figured out."`
`"What's that?"`
`"That bewildered look on Amakusa's face when his scheme was exposed.`
` That was pretty good."`
`"*giggle*!"`
`""<Good>!""`
`"...Erika, Dlanor."`
`"Yes, my master."`
`"You CALLED?"`
`"...I want you two to stay in this Fragment `
`and explain everything in the remaining 1st through 4th games.`
` That pitiful transient witch who supports the Illusion of the Witch no longer exists herself.`
` Expose the naked truth thoroughly."`
`"*giggle*! Leave it to me, my master.`
` There is no riddle that I, Furudo Erika, cannot solve."`
`"...Of course.`
` That's why you're my piece, my double.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`Bernkastel wore a massive...and horrible smile, which Erika shared.`
`...Beatrice's Illusion of the Witch would disappear,`
` and the results in all of the previous games would be painted over.`
`It had been crushed in every way possible, ...and only the naked truth remained.`
`Such a weak truth was no better than fish on the chopping board for Erika...`
`"It is possible to explain all of the past four games with Natsuhi as the criminal,`
` or with certain irregularities based off that theme.`
` I won't let anyone say it's the crime of the witch Beatrice again.`
` I'll start compiling it together at once, and then present a first-rate tale to you."`
`"*giggle*...`
` You mustn't leave even a single Fragment of Beato's Legend of the Witch behind.`
` The rumors among the servants, the way people talked about unexplained events as though that legend was the cause,`
` the Illusion of the Witch that worked alongside the illusion of Kinzo...`
` ...Deal with all of them completely."`
`"Of course.`
` I'll get to it right away.`
` ...We now have the furniture in custody.`
` We're hurrying to identify their vessels."`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory had already been taken into custody.`
`Those noisy sisters who had served Beato now faced nothing but denial.`
`What sort of illusion were they based upon that allowed them to 'manifest'?`
`...Everything would be exposed...`
`and denied.`
`"Eiserne Jungfrau has already begun its INVESTIGATION.`
` According to the most recent results, there is a high probability that they were constructed during the 1960's in the vicinity of New York.`
` An aide has already been sent to the LOCATION."`
`"The 1960's? The Seven Sisters of Purgatory are <Made in USA>?`
` Pfft, *giggle*giggle*giggle*...`
` Even though they bragged about being furniture connected with King Solomon and serving a thousand-year-old witch, they're a total sham.`
` Who was it...?"`
`"According to the report, ...`
`there's this group of big-time swindlers who make money by selling fakes to rich fans of the occult."`
`"Because the deceived millionaires try to resell the fakes as though they were real,`
` there's a chance that they've been falsely deified by enthusiasts in the FIELD.`
` We are rushing to find confirmation and further DETAILS."`
`"So Ushiromiya Kinzo was a sucker who'd pay big bucks for any fake occult object."`
`"...*giggle*giggle*, ...ahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` And that's what the Seven Sisters of Purgatory really are...?`
` That's hilarious,`
` ahahahahahhhahahahahhahahahha!!`
` A total sham, just like Beato's Illusion of the Witch."`
`"Though they call themselves the seven deadly sins, they're actually cheap, fake souvenirs.`
` ...Well, from the very beginning,`
` I figured they were nothing more than paperweights sold at some shady souvenir shop."`
`"*giggle*giggle*!! Paperweights...!`
` Ahhahhahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Have you confronted the Seven Sisters with that truth yet?"`
`"No, not YET."`
`"They still seriously believe they were created`
` by a great sorcerer over a thousand years ago.`
`...I'd like to confront them with perfect evidence and the truth right away...`
`and let them know that they're mere paperweights worth less than 30 US dollars."`
`"When you do, I wonder what their faces will look like...as they lose all hope.`
` ...*giggle* I can't wait.`
` Call for me when that happens.`
` I'll come to watch, with some of the best black tea and dried plums."`
`Beato's Illusion of the Witch had already been penetrated,`
` and it's been proven that everything was simply the result of Human delusions.`
`What kind of delusions created them, and what caused these in the first place?`
`When the answers were proven perfectly and shoved in the faces of those concerned...`
`...The illusion would vanish and be completely annihilated.`
`This is what they meant...by 'execution'.`
`"...An execution is not a SHOW.`
` As a general rule, it is not made PUBLIC."`
`"This is an inspection by the Great Lady Bernkastel, member of the senate,`
` so she can observe that the Great Court is performing its duties satisfactorily.`
` Do you, as a mere Inquisitor of Heresy, wish to deny her this right...?"`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` I'm just observing as a representative of the senate to make sure you follow the proper procedures when you carry out your work.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"We are currently preparing to take Virgilia, Ronove, and Gaap into custody as well.`
` The Chiester Sisters Imperial Guards are conducting that investigation."`
`"...Of course, we will then detain and execute those three connected to Beatrice."`
`"Dlanor, what is the true nature of the Chiester Sisters?"`
`"...We believe there is a high likelihood that their vessels are weapons used in the CRIMES.`
` For this purpose, Senior Aide Gertrude has formed a special TEAM.`
` We are currently investigating all CASES."`
`"I'm looking forward to the Chiester Sisters' execution too...!`
` One at a time?`
` Or all of them at once?"`
`"No one's stupid enough to put an entire can of tea leaves in a pot at once.`
` You've got to enjoy it slowly, one spoonful at a time."`
`"*giggle*giggle*! Exactly.`
` Let's have their executions on consecutive days.`
` For the furniture and the witches, one by one.`
` I'll send you an execution show every day."`
`"Wonderful.`
` ...After all, there really are a lot of them.`
` Looks like we'll be able to enjoy ourselves for a full two weeks.`
` ...Maybe we can let them decide which ones to execute first.`
` Heheheheheheheheh!`
` Make sure you think up something great for the execution concept.`
` ...I'd like to enjoy executions both old and new, from east and west every day."`
`"...The rules state that the method of execution is to follow Great Court REGULATIONS."`
`"Leave it to me, my master.`
` I will most certainly prepare you a fascinating execution show!"`
`"Oh, and you'd better quarter at least one of them."`
`"Of course.`
` I shall make a list of the best forms of execution from all countries, from Europe to Asia,`
` which were used by kingdoms east and west for crimes no less than treason against the king!"`
`"...I'd like to think up some execution methods myself.`
` ...Pondering that will be the perfect way to relax on those sleepless nights.`
` ...*giggle* I'll iron out my ideas and send you a letter soon."`
`"Certainly, my master.`
` Then, we'll have the Bernkastel-style one as the grand finale.`
` ...At the very, very end, when all the illusions are broken and Beato's magical compendium has been completely crushed,`
` ...I shall present my master with that finest of executions that she desires, ...the execution of Beatrice...!"`
`"Thank you, Erika.`
` ...Thanks to you, it seems I'll be able to forget the pain of my illness for a little while...`
` *giggle*giggle*, hehehehehehhahahahahahahahahaha!`
` You're just perfect.`
` My piece, my double,`
` ...and my adorable daughter."`
`"...Y-Your words are too good for me...! My master...!!"`
`"Erika, I'll give you honor and a reward.`
` ...And that reward is...the greatest symbol of Beatrice, the portrait from the reception hall.`
` Take that off, smash it to make firewood, bake a cake with that and eat it.`
` Then, I'll allow you to put your portrait up in the remaining frame."`
`"...Th-Thank you very much...!`
` It is a great honor...!"`
`"...You will eradicate and erase Beatrice's name and all traces of her.`
` Until that is all finished, I will order that you be made the master of this sealed-off Rokkenjima."`
`"...By the name of the Witch of Miracles, Bernkastel,`
` I proclaim that you will be given the rank of witch until that day.`
` ...From now on, you will call yourself Erika, the Witch of Truth."`
`"...Th-`
`The Witch...of Truth...!`
` ...Th-`
`Thank you very much, my master...!!`
` I vow to work even harder so that this honor will not be wasted...!"`
`Even though she was nothing more than a piece,`
` ...she was being granted the honor of calling herself a witch like her master, if only for a brief stretch of time...`
`Erika was so moved that her actions had been acknowledged in this greatest form that she trembled...`
`"Dlanor, continue to aid Erika `
`and report on her progress to me."`
`"...As you WISH."`
`"......By the way, where's Lambda?"`
`"She is over THERE."`
`From the guest seating on the second floor, she pointed downwards.`
`Lambdadelta...could be seen beneath Battler, who hung there, dead and pierced by the red longsword.`
`"...Ushiromiya Battler...`
` You were an interesting guy.`
` ...And you might've become even more interesting, ...but too bad."`
`"What a wonderful way to die.`
` ...Erika!`
` You can hang Battler's corpse in the mansion's reception hall.`
` ...The next time I come to visit this Fragment, welcome me in front of it."`
`"Certainly, my master.`
` I'll make that foolish man an eternal monument to my master's victory!"`
`"*giggle* That sounds wonderful. Really tasteful.`
` Maybe you can coat him with plaster and make a beautiful white statue.`
` ...And it'd be wonderful if you decorated him all cute!"`
`"Yes, Lady Lambdadelta.`
` I will strive to answer to your expectations...!"`
`"Congratulations on becoming a witch.`
` Though it'll just be for a while, I'll welcome you as a friend."`
`Erika was so overcome with emotion that tears came to her eyes.`
`...Because for a piece, no greater pleasure exists than having your work acknowledged by your master.`
`"In the end, I'd like to have Beato stuffed too.`
` Then I'll decorate the reception hall with her."`
`"Galaxy Express?"`
`"The one that isn't 'Night on the-'."`
`"...You know,`
` I read that back when I wasn't a witch.`
` ...I always thought it strange`
` that humans who obtained eternal life would become so cruel.`
` ...At the time, I honestly couldn't relate."`
`"...After becoming a witch and living a thousand years, I fully understand it.`
` ...That writer could understand our cruelty really well, in the truest sense.`
` *giggle*giggle*!"`
`"...Where'll you go next?`
` I'll bet we say farewell with our backs turned, right?"`
`"That's because I don't want to let you get bored."`
`"Thanks, Bern.`
` But you can be sure I'll count to a hundred and then start searching for you again."`
`"You really don't let a person get bored.`
` That's why I like you, love you.`
` ...Let's meet again somewhere.`
` However, we may not be reunited for another hundred or thousand years...if ever."`
`"That's okay.`
` The sea of Fragments is tiny to a pair who love each other."`
`"The Third Man?"`
`"No, Children of Paradise of course."`
`"...If you could escape the poison of just a single evening's worth of boredom...`
`each time you smashed one of those countless Fragments that glitter like a starry night,`
` even you would want to count the stars in the sky."`
`"Ooh, not bad...pfft, *giggle*giggle*...!"`
`The Voyager witches travel across the countless glittering futures of possibility...`
`...and gobble them up, trying to escape their illness called boredom for as long as they can.`
`The tiny, tiny Fragment created by the Human known as Beatrice...`
`...had now been gobbled up by the two witches...`
`...and had lost its glitter.`
`The two who had earlier called themselves rivals in front of Beato...`
`now stopped that charade and laughed together playfully.`
`"Erika,`
` new ruler of this Fragment,`
` ...weave the truth, ...and create the tale that leads up to this world's demise.`
` ...Umm, the next was the 6th game, right?"`
`"Yes, it's the 6th game."`
`"Decide the title for Episode 6 yourself.`
` After all, you're already the spinner of this tale, as well as the Master."`
`"Thank you very much.`
` ...Actually, I've already decided on one."`
`"...Oh, already?`
` ...Then let me hear it.`
` What kind of title is it?"`
`"Yes.`
` Episode 6, ...`
`Heheheheh, I'd really like to leave you hanging for a bit, but I'll tell you."`
`"*giggle*!`
` Come on, stop being a smartass and tell us.`
` A newbie witch like you shouldn't be teasing your seniors!"`
`"Episode 6,`
` Checkmate of the`
`   Golden Witch!"`
`In the cathedral devoid of people,`
` ...a figure could be seen still staring up at the heavens,`
` its chest pierced with a long red sword that pinned it in place to the ground.`
` That figure was...Battler.`
`...Ironically, it looked just like what he'd done to Beato with blue wedges in the 4th game...`
`Battler had died quite some time ago.`
`No, ...in this place, the concept of death means nothing except that one has stopped thinking.`
`Therefore, in a sense, Battler was not dead.`
`...After being defeated in a fight over the truth and surrendering, he no longer had the strength to think of a way to resist.`
`That's...what made him dead.`
`Dlanor's massive longsword, which had been left in place of a tombstone,`
` ...fastened Battler to the spot even after his death...`
`This was all being lit by a faint light seeping out of an incredibly high skylight.`
`Quiet footsteps rang out across this still cathedral...`
`From the darkness behind a pillar, ...a woman slowly stepped forward.`
`...It was Beatrice.`
`Just like they'd been the whole time in the Golden Land, ...her eyes had no light in them...`
`and were still muddied over with gray.`
`This person was once unable to even drink black tea to her satisfaction by her own will,`
` ...but though it was slow...and though there was no life in her eyes,`
` ...she was, surprisingly, walking.`
`Then, with slow, deliberate steps,`
` she reached Battler, who was still dead, pierced through...`
`Then,`
` ...she slowly...`
`...touched Battler.`
`...She tugged...`
`on his sleeve.`
`However, Battler showed no reaction...`
`...When she realized that it wasn't sleep,`
` ...but death...`
`...The witch with the hopeless gaze...`
`...let her head hang even lower...`
`Then,`
` ...she quietly...`
`...whispered...`
`"......`
`......You...`
`liar..."`
`Beato...`
`...softly touched Battler...`
`Then,`
` ...she pressed her forehead against Battler's chest.`
`There was no longer...`
`...any heartbeat.`
`It wasn't just because he had surrendered.`
`It was because the witches had chased him from the game board.`
`...So from now on,`
` ...Battler would never...return...`
`So from now on,`
` ...the Golden Witch Beatrice...`
`...Would have no reason...`
`...to exist......`
`...Thank you...`
`...Liar...`
`...Goodbye...`
`And...`
`...Sorry.`
`Then,`
` ...the Golden Witch...`
`completed...`
`...her task...`
`and scattered...`
`as a spray of gold.`
`In the Golden Land,`
` ...the gray rain...`
`gently continued to fall.`
`...There was a faint aroma of good black tea.`
`Beato stared blankly at its surface.`
`There was Virgilia, continuing her knitting,`
` ...along with me and...Dlanor, talking to each other.`
`...This is...`
`...a recollection...`
`A recollection from Battler's memory, which Dlanor's sword must have given him as it pierced him...`
`A recollection of that time Dlanor had come to visit the tea party in the Golden Land...`
`"It's the same with ME.`
` The next time we cross swords, I won't hold BACK."`
`"Bring it on. `
`I'll be your opponent.`
` Come at me with all you've got."`
`"I PROMISE.`
` With everything I've GOT."`
`...Dlanor, huh?`
`I'd thought she was an emotionless killer doll without a heart,`
` ...but maybe she actually is pretty approachable.`
`...Though of course, neither of us will show any mercy when fighting over the game board.`
`For a while, we gazed at the rain-drenched rose garden as we quietly enjoyed our tea.`
`"...Still, it really is terrifying.`
` The way you fight.`
` ...Knox's Ten Commandments, or the Decalogue, wasn't it?`
` Those classic rules of the mystery genre, right?"`
`"YES.`
` ...They are commandments conceived by my FATHER."`
`"Hidden doors must not exist.`
` That's Knox's 3rd, right?`
` That means there's no need for detectives to even look for hidden doors.`
` ...Sounds pretty ridiculous."`
`Bernkastel said it herself.`
`She said that, because they were forbidden by Knox's 3rd, even searching for hidden doors was a waste of time.`
`I'd like to counter that by saying it probably isn't so uncommon for a rich family's mansion to have a hidden door or two built into it.`
`...But apparently, that sort of rule works perfectly well in the mystery genre.`
`By the way, there exist many wonderful mysteries in which hidden doors appear...`
`and where hidden doors are the theme.`
`...Of course, this is limited to novels which have the 'premise' that hidden doors exist.`
`If that 'premise' doesn't exist, hidden doors must not exist.`
`So because that 'premise' doesn't exist, there is no need to search for hidden doors.`
`...I think that's probably the essence of her ridiculous argument.`
`It's like the detective trying to expose the truth...and the illusion trying to confuse it with a mixture of truth and lies...`
`are getting blended together, leading to a bizarre form of argument similar to a Devil's Proof.`
`Making a closed room murder seem to be accomplished by a witch with magic is fantasy.`
`Exposing that it was a Human's crime done with tricks is anti-fantasy.`
`Examining all possibilities to expose the nature of those tricks is mystery.`
`But is it also mystery...to claim that possibilities with no hints supporting them are unworthy of investigation?`
`Let's say a hidden door is hidden in a way that there would be no clues.`
`Would claiming that a hidden door therefore exists, even though a detective couldn't find it,`
` ...be anti-mystery?`
`...That's enough of that.`
`This argument is too far of a digression from the riddles I'm actually supposed to be solving.`
`My fight is very simple.`
`I'm only fighting to explain how it was possible for a Human to carry out these crimes that were supposedly carried out by a witch.`
`This whole discussion about 'mystery' and 'anti' doesn't serve any purpose.`
`That's why I didn't have any particular interest regarding these rules known as the Knox Decalogue...`
`"......Do you dislike Knox?"`
`"It doesn't work for me.`
` ...There's something strange about making it possible to deny the existence of all hidden doors without investigating.`
` ...It's about as dubious as a Devil's Proof.`
` ...Even though it's supposed to be the exact opposite of fantasy, it somehow feels like it's the same kind of argument."`
`"............"`
`"...Ah, I shouldn't have said that.`
` Your dad was the one who made them, after all."`
`"Do not WORRY.`
` ...After all, there are some who say it is nothing more than a silly GAME."`
`"The Decalogue feels like something very arrogant to you, right, Battler-kun...?"`
`"...To be honest, yeah.`
` ...If an actual detective said he didn't need to look for hidden doors because they must not exist,`
` everyone would start looking around on the floor to see if some of his screws had come loose..."`
`"In that case, Battler,`
` ...let us say that the 3rd Commandment didn't exist.`
` In that case, what would happen to closed room mysteries...?"`
`...What if Knox's 3rd, 'hidden doors are forbidden', didn't exist...?`
`"...In other words, hidden doors would always work just fine as the standard trick for closed rooms."`
`"This does not refer to hidden doors with hints or FORESHADOWING.`
` ...It refers only to doors that even the detective cannot find because, of course, they are HIDDEN."`
`"Battler-kun, you often fight by using a Devil's Proof, assuming the existence of an undiscoverable element X.`
` ...That's what this is about."`
`"That'd be horrible.`
` The closed room mystery genre wouldn't be worth reading at all."`
`And if it were no longer worth anyone's time, ...it would cease to exist.`
`No one would want to try solving the riddle from the beginning, not if they knew the answer might just be an unforeseeable hidden door.`
`"...Unless you have some guarantee that no hidden doors exist,`
` you don't really feel like trying to reason it out.`
` ......I see.`
` So Knox's 3rd is necessary.`
` ...Without that, it wouldn't be worth reading closed room mysteries."`
`"And if you didn't feel like trying to reason it out, ...what would that lead to...?"`
`"It means you wouldn't even want to read it."`
`"That's IT.`
` ...Humans are weak creatures, who can't even think unless they have proof that reasoning is POSSIBLE."`
`"...That reasoning is possible.`
` ...In other words, they need encouragement, to let them know they can solve it if they work hard enough."`
`That...might be true.`
`...It's the same with exercising.`
`If you're told to run around the campus ten times, you can tough it out.`
`However, if you don't know how many times you're supposed to run around it,`
` you'd probably get tired out before you made it around three times.`
`The same thing goes for thinking and reasoning.`
`Humans view a problem differently depending on whether or not it's guaranteed to be solvable...`
`"In detective novels, there's always a scene where the detective announces that he's discovered who the culprit is.`
` ...That's a sign saying 'The hints have all been given in the previous parts of the story,`
` so dear readers, please try to reason it out'."`
`"...Ah.`
` I always thought it was just a classic line, but I guess it does also have that effect."`
`"To put it harshly,`
` until the detective says that,`
` ...readers won't feel like trying to solve it no matter how much they love solving mysteries."`
`"...Weren't you like that yourself in the previous GAMES...?"`
`"............"`
`Now that I hear it,`
` ...maybe that really was the case.`
`Maybe my fight against Beato really began in the 2nd game.`
`At first, I didn't seriously try to tackle the closed room riddles Beato threw at me.`
`After all, I knew nothing except that people had died in a closed room, and the windows and doors were all locked from the inside.`
`...I mean, seriously, talk about having no hints to go on.`
`So, I refused to argue on the grounds that I couldn't fight...`
`because the lack of clues made reasoning impossible.`
`...After that, didn't Beato sneer at me,`
` asking whether I'd repeat that over and over forever in an endless repetition of moves...`
`At that time, Beato said this:`
`"Of course not. I'll give you the thing people like you always demand.`
` The reason you always stop thinking and then moan about it is 'lack of information'! If you are then given information, you start doubting whether the information is true or not by 'denying the basis'!"`
`Isn't that convenient?`
` What clever little words to hide your own incompetence.'`
`Then, she said she'd give me certain information that couldn't be denied,`
` and created the rule called the red truth.`
`Once we reached that point, the curtain finally rose on my battle with Beato...`
`"...So, ...that's when I finally had a guarantee that I could solve this tale if I tried,`
` ...and I stepped up to the stage with her for the first time...?"`
`"Beatrice.`
` ...She's a strange PERSON.`
` Though riddles are the only holes witches can live within, she began to give you the red truth, a method by which those riddles could be SOLVED."`
`You could say the red truth is a hint Beato gives me, so that I can compete in this war of reasoning.`
`...Like candy.`
`Because I've been given hints,`
` it's like she's saying...`
`try and solve it,`
` ...for it can be solved.`
`...A enigma that's guaranteed to be solvable...`
`...can't be called a true 'enigma'.`
`"Isn't this almost as though...`
`...Beato herself `
`is admitting...`
`...that she isn't really a witch...?"`
`"My, my.`
` That does seem logical.`
` ...She truly is a strange child."`
`"............"`
`Beato gave no answer.`
`With gray eyes, ...she did nothing but blankly gaze at the steam rising from her black tea...`
`"My father created the Decalogue to act as a crutch for the power of THINKING.`
` ...It most certainly wasn't made as a way to arrogantly decide THINGS."`
`"...A crutch...for the power of thinking..."`
`"That's RIGHT.`
` By Knox's 8th, it is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not PRESENTED.`
` ...This does not only mean that one is forced to avoid making theories that are not supported by CLUES."`
`"If you turn it around,`
` ...it means that the one proposing the riddles is forced to display clues that lead to the solution."`
`"...So, in other words,`
` ...if you follow the Decalogue,`
` ...all riddles must have hints,`
` ...and therefore, it's guaranteed that finding the solution is possible."`
`I see, ...so this is what they mean by a crutch for the power of thinking.`
`If you can believe that it's solvable, you start wanting to have a go at those riddles.`
`If you're capable of believing that hints do exist, you get fired up about rereading the story to search for them...`
`"I'll admit...that it might have the power to give courage to those trying to solve it."`
`"You seem to think the Knox Decalogue is a series of restrictions imposed by the one who made the MYSTERY,`
` but it is also vital for the READERS.`
` ...By using the Decalogue as a crutch,`
` we are given the courage needed to use reasoning,`
` as well as the willpower to reread the tale several times in search of the clues we know must be hidden THERE."`
`"...It's like the lid of a jar of jam that's too tight and won't open.`
` ...Like Mom always used to say,`
` ...if you think you can't open it, then it really won't open no matter how hard you try.`
` ...The same thing happens in sports.`
` They say whether or not you have a strong image of yourself and believe you can win no matter what...`
`has a large impact on the records."`
`In that case...`
`...The Knox Decalogue isn't really a set of arrogant and strict restrictions.`
`...You can also see it as a way to encourage readers, who are trying to solve the mystery,`
` by telling them to give it their all, since it's definitely solvable...`
`"...That's an interesting way to interpret it.`
` ...Still, I've heard that not all detective novels around the world follow the Decalogue all the time, right?`
` ...When you bump into one of those, won't you feel tricked...?"`
`"Even the Decalogue is nothing more than a single INTERPRETATION, and it cannot be applied to all mystery STORIES.`
` ...Though among fundamentalists of my father's work,`
` it seems there are those who harshly criticize works that violate the Decalogue and call them HERESY..."`
`There's no end of arguments like this in the mystery world.`
`Was this or that famous detective novel really a fair mystery--in other words, one that followed Knox's Decalogue?`
`That sort of argument is already an eternal theme of the mystery world.`
`In fact, in mystery discussions,`
` arguments like these sometimes become even more heated than discussion of the actual tricks...`
`"I can understand why they'd want to criticize it.`
` ...They try to solve it, believe it's solvable and follow the Decalogue, but it's actually not made to be solvable like that at all.`
` I can understand how that'd get pretty annoying."`
`That's right.`
`When fighting with the Decalogue, ...there's just one thing you want guaranteed from the beginning.`
`In other words, ...you want a guarantee that this detective novel will adhere to the Decalogue.`
`If a work labels itself as an orthodox mystery, then you have nothing to worry about.`
`However, the mystery genre contains many unorthodox sub-genres within it.`
`...Does that mean trying to use reasoning in an unorthodox detective novel is a complete waste of time...?`
`"...Looking at it that way,`
` ...it really does feel arrogant."`
`"YES.`
` I also find it extremely sad that my father's Decalogue has been used as such an arrogant WEAPON."`
`"...Then again, you just fought against Beato using the Decalogue as a weapon.`
` ...Can I take that as proof that this game world of Beato's follows the Knox Decalogue...?"`
`"........."`
`When I asked that, ...there was a strange silence.`
`Virgilia, Dlanor,`
` ...and of course, Beato...`
`...all remained silent for a while...`
`Almost as though my question had touched at the core of something...`
`"That...is something I cannot answer myself."`
`"Why...?"`
`"This is a game that this child made.`
` ...A game to decide which of the two of you will win.`
` ...This child has called it a confrontation between mystery and fantasy."`
`"But unfortunately, she never said it was an orthodox mystery.`
` That means you have no guarantee that it follows the Decalogue."`
`"...But at the same time, <Miss> Beatrice has said that this game is a contest between you and HER.`
` ...In other words, there is a chance that you could win."`
`"In other words,`
` ......you're trying to say that reasoning is possible?"`
`"........."`
`"...If you asked this child, she would probably say that reasoning is possible.`
` ...However, just as she is the challenger and you are the challenged, the two of you are different creatures.`
` ...Something Beato might have proposed, thinking it is solvable,`
` may or may not be solvable for you as well."`
`For example, let's say we propose a simple riddle that any Japanese person would know.`
`...However, if the person we're telling this riddle to is a foreigner with a Japanese-English dictionary in their hand,`
` it might be almost impossible to solve.`
`...In other words, it's possible to have a one-sided 'solvable problem',`
` which might be easy for the questioner but extremely difficult for the person trying to solve it...`
`By the way, do you know of the foreign riddle:`
` 'Why do dragons sleep all day?'`
`The answer is `
`'To battle the knight'.`
`It's a riddle from the English realm, so it might be a little tough for a Japanese person.`
`"For that reason,`
` ...I cannot say for certain that this tale is something you will be able to solve.`
` ...However, I can promise you one thing.`
` ...I will guarantee it with the red truth."`
`"...What?"`
`"#ff0000Beato wanted you to solve it,`
` so she made this game,`
` ...the riddles of this tale, ...solvable.#ffffff`
` That alone, I will guarantee with the red truth."`
`It was...`
`...the one guarantee...`
`...that all those who try to use reasoning desire.`
`"I don't know if my father's Decalogue will apply to that answer or lead you to IT.`
` ...However, when you run into a tight spot and want a compass for your reasoning, `
`please try using my Decalogue if you REMEMBER.`
` ...It might give you renewed courage...and might possibly even lead to some new DISCOVERY..."`
`"Thank you.`
` If I'm truly stuck, I'll think about your fighting style.`
` ...Are you sure it's okay to help out an enemy like this?"`
`"Pay that no MIND.`
` I came to this tea party without a GIFT.`
` I hope you enjoy this in place of a SNACK.`
` ...And...if you come face to face with me AGAIN,`
` there probably won't be time to speak of such things so CASUALLY."`
`...Knox's Decalogue...`
`...and Virgilia's red truth.`
`'#ff0000Beato wanted me to solve it,`
` so she made the riddles of this game solvable#ffffff'.`
`In other words, ...Beato wants me to be capable of solving it.`
`Isn't that...proof that reasoning is possible...?`
`...Of course, that's from Beato's point of view,`
` ...and it doesn't necessarily mean that reasoning is possible for me...`
`Compared to before now, when I didn't even know whether reasoning was possible or not,`
` ...that one line might give me a great deal of courage...`
`At least it has the power to silence any negative thoughts...about this all being useless...`
`"...Unless the other party assures you that reasoning is possible, you won't do it.`
` ...It's almost like love between shy, young people."`
`"Love?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...Unless you have proof that the other person loves you first, you don't want to love them back.`
` ...Right?"`
`Both boys and girls...want to hear someone else say they love them first.`
`That's their dream.`
`...If they're in love, they don't want to love the other person until they're sure this person loves them back.`
`After all, there's nothing as painful as a one-sided love,`
` ...and the scars of the heart left behind last a long time.`
`Because they are afraid of that pain,`
` ...they want proof that the other person loves them first more than anything else...`
`"I SEE,`
` that's an interesting way to explain the relationship between writer and reader in a detective NOVEL."`
`Yeah,`
` ...maybe you could liken detective novels to that.`
`Both the writer and the reader...`
`...first want the other party to say they'll solve it (or that it can be solved).`
`Until the writer is assured that the reader will certainly have a go at the riddle if they propose it,`
` they don't want to write their story.`
`The same goes for the readers.`
`Until they are assured that they will certainly be able to solve the riddle if they try, they don't want to read the story.`
`Because they don't want to write what they consider a masterpiece and be hurt when no one reads it.`
`Because they don't want to reason about what they consider a masterpiece and be hurt when they realize it was all useless.`
`"By that argument,`
` ...it really isn't a stretch to say it's like love between shy elementary or middle school-aged kids.`
` ...Even though they really do want it, they don't have the courage to reveal their feelings,`
` so they wait uncomfortably for the other person to confess, ...and by the time summer ends, nothing's happened."`
`"Heh, more than that, sometimes the girl even ends up going out with an entirely different guy.`
` That's what my first love was like, ihihi."`
`Along with these one-sided feelings they can't express, they lament the passage of a summer that will never come again, and the days of their youth end.`
`The writer who wouldn't write until he gained the support of readers...`
`goes for all eternity without releasing his maiden work.`
`The reader who waited for the writer's rise to fame...`
`goes their whole life without knowing the joy of the mystery genre.`
`"...Battler-kun,`
` when does this 'the chicken or the egg' type of shy love `
`reach the level where can it progress into mutual love...?"`
`"Well, ...that's probably when things start to pile up.`
` ...It starts as a relationship between friends, they communicate with each other more and more,`
` ...and when the two both reach the level where they're sure...`
`that 'I like this person and they surely like me',`
` ...well, then they probably just naturally become a pair of lovers."`
`"My impression up until now was that relationships starting with a sudden confession of love tend to break up more often,`
` whereas pairs who never actually confess to each other but realize that they've always been together...usually stay together for a surprisingly long time."`
`"In other words,`
` this happens once the two of them believe in each other and a relationship of trust is BORN,`
` ...is what you're SAYING?"`
`"...Maybe.`
` ...It's a bit odd.`
` ...I've always thought the mystery genre was a battle between the writer and the reader, ...but maybe that's not quite right."`
`"Yes.`
` It's something that cannot go on without a relation built on mutual trust,`
` ...a relationship with love."`
`"........."`
`"........."`
`"...So, you're saying our relationship...`
`...isn't one of killing each other, but one with love?"`
`"...*giggle*`
` Though it doesn't look like anything more than a pair of elementary schoolers bullying each other to me...`
` Heheheheh."`
`Virgilia joked at us in a middle-aged woman sort of way.`
`Still, ...though I'm not expecting friendship or a trusting relationship,`
` ...I can accept her as a rival.`
`Beato is fighting at full force, trying to make me acknowledge that she's a witch.`
`So I'll respond to that and go all out, trying to deny that witches exist.`
`"How can you be sure that `
`<Miss> Beato is fighting at full FORCE?"`
`"Can't you tell that by looking?"`
`"It isn't as though she has proclaimed in red that she's fighting you at full FORCE.`
` ...And yet, you still have no DOUBTS?`
` You are the one who said you wouldn't believe anything except the red TRUTH."`
`"...Nng, ......"`
`"*giggle*`
` ...Surely this is that stage Battler-kun mentioned earlier,`
` where communication increases and you learn not to doubt your relationship."`
`Virgilia and Dlanor giggled together.`
`...One guy, multiple women.`
`And the topic is love.`
`...Wait a sec, isn't this the worst possible formation for getting made fun of?`
`When I tried to bring back a proper mood for a tea party in the rainy Golden Land by clumsily searching for a more noble subject,`
` Virgilia saw right through me and laughed...`
`.........`
`Even amidst this, Beato kept looking downwards with those gray eyes,`
` staring into her black tea...`
`......`
`...Yeah, that's right...`
`Virgilia and Dlanor...have given me so many hints...`
`And yet, I barely thought about it at all...`
`By now, it's all too late...`
`...'Let me think'.`
`Now that everything is too late already and I've got an endless amount of time on my hands, ...let me think.`
`...One more time, let me think about the red truth Virgilia gave me...`
`and the crutch of the Decalogue that Dlanor lent me...`
`With the red truth,`
` ...Virgilia guaranteed that at the very least, Beato left enough room in this tale for me to achieve victory.`
`...That red truth guarantee will once again...`
`...give me the power to start my heart beating...`
`And...there's the crutch of the Decalogue, which Dlanor lent me.`
`Dlanor herself warned me in the beginning that the Decalogue isn't so almighty that it can solve all riddles.`
`However, she said something about how it could be used as a method to solve...`
`...no, to take on riddles.`
`...Let me try it.`
`Though there's no guarantee that this tale is mystery or fantasy,`
` ...let me believe that I'll definitely be able to solve it,`
` ...that it is a solvable tale, a mystery...`
`and let me take it on one last time...`
`When I came to,`
` ...I was suddenly in...`
`...that strange tea room where I'd often argued furiously with Beato from across that table.`
`...Of course, Beato was nowhere to be found.`
`It was just me, ...isolated and alone.`
`That's okay.`
`Even so, ...I won't stop thinking.`
`Okay then.`
`...What were Knox's Commandments again...?`
`I'm sure Dlanor explained most of them when slamming me with them.`
`Of course, even I recall them vaguely.`
`What was...the first one, again...?`
`"...Allow me to speak.`
` Knox's 1st.`
` It is forbidden for the culprit to be anyone not mentioned in the early part of the story."`
`When I muttered about what the first one was...`
`...As if answering my question,`
` ...Dlanor's subordinate appeared.`
`Without bothering with an unnecessary 'hello', she told me nothing more or less than what I wanted to know.`
`"...Yeah, that's it.`
` The 1st.`
` ...The culprit has to be one of the people mentioned in the early part of the story."`
`In other words, ...the culprit must have already appeared...`
`as early as the first game...?`
`True, that's the most basic of basics in the mystery genre.`
`A classic assumption.`
`...A classic assumption...?`
`...been keeping to that assumption...?`
`With each new game, the number of people in this tale keeps increasing.`
`That violates the closed circle rule.`
`By that point, everything gets screwed up.`
`Did I give up on the inside,`
` ...thinking that the true culprit or mastermind must not have shown up yet, and that reasoning was therefore useless...?`
`If I read this tale as a fantasy, ...new characters keep showing up,`
` to the point where even having demon kings or gods or creators appear wouldn't be strange at all.`
`Even if the true mastermind first appears in one of the last Episodes, I'd have to accept it.`
`However, ...if I read it as a mystery and stick with that conviction...`
`Then there's no need to worry at all about anyone who shows up later.`
`Because Knox's 1st clearly states that it's impossible for the culprit to be anyone who appears later on in the story.`
`...Of course, there's also what both Dlanor and Virgilia said.`
`There's no guarantee that this tale follows the rules of the Decalogue,`
` so of course, I can't deny the possibility that the culprit first appeared in the 2nd game or later.`
`However, ...this is one way of thinking.`
`This time...`
`I'll forget about the Devil's Proof completely...and try to borrow the power of the Decalogue in my thinking.`
`After all, I've already said myself that I won't be able to reach the truth without a multi-angled outlook.`
`"In that case, ...that means the culprit in all of these repeating games...`
`is one of the 18.`
` From the very beginning, ...there was no need for an illusion of a 19th person."`
`...Even the first of Knox's commandments...`
`...denies the existence of an unknown person known as the witch from the very start.`
`If I had followed that in the truest sense,`
` ...I might not have suffered so miserably in the 2nd game.`
`"...And Knox's 2nd?"`
`"Allow me to speak.`
` Knox's 2nd.`
` It is forbidden for supernatural agencies to be employed as a detective technique."`
`Dlanor's other subordinate appeared without a sound...`
`and gave me an answer to my question.`
`...That's right.`
`A detective can't go around using magic.`
`"So, ......`
`...if this is a fair battle, `
`...does that mean that, like the detective, `
`...the culprit also isn't allowed to use magic...?"`
`"Allow me to speak.`
` ...Know that you are free to interpret it as you please."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` ...Sure.`
` I'll interpret it my way."`
`If this game is a battle between me and Beato...`
`...Then because this tale is solvable,`
` no elements will appear that make it impossible to solve.`
`In other words, things like magic mustn't appear.`
`When they do appear, I shouldn't suspect that the mystery element is breaking down,`
` ...but I should instead question why it was shown...and suspect the witnesses and observers.`
`That's right, `
`...that was...`
`Beato's greatest weapon in the 2nd game.`
`Depictions of magic, which couldn't exist in a mystery.`
`By showing me that, she forced me to think that this tale wasn't a mystery,`
` and therefore, that reasoning was impossible...`
` So I surrendered...`
`However, if I had believed unshakably that it was a mystery...`
`...It would've been completely obvious to doubt the witnesses who claimed to have seen magic.`
`Also, at the end of the 1st game,`
` it was revealed that this tale was passed on to people in the future by that message bottle.`
`...Someone had written about this crime, ...this tale.`
`In other words, this entire tale is a world that includes the personal opinions of an observer, `
`...namely, the person who wrote that message in a bottle.`
`In other words, the observer isn't God.`
`It's a Human.`
`Therefore, there's no guarantee that this description is truly impartial.`
`By the end of the 1st game, it was already clear that we've broken the constant premise of the mystery genre:`
` that the story itself must be seen through the eyes of God.`
`For that reason, it's possible to doubt even the observer, as well as the witnesses.`
`If I could've doubted this much,`
` ...then no matter how many seemingly unsolvable displays of magic appeared, `
`I wouldn't have had to blindly accept them and give up...`
`However, that begs the question:`
` ...is it even possible to solve a tale written by an observer who isn't impartial?`
`...If I get obsessed with this, all my reasoning will end here.`
`However, ...I had to believe.`
`I had to believe...`
`...that Beato was trying to fight me through this tale.`
`Because it's a fight, `
`...that means I've been given a chance of winning.`
`By giving me that, `
`...doesn't that mean...`
`...that reasoning is possible?`
`...This part...is tough.`
`Unless I believe that the cruel witch took on the risk of losing to try and have a fair fight with me, ...I can't get past this part.`
`...Just like Virgilia said, ...it's just like love.`
`If I can't believe that Beato is fighting me head on with everything she's got,`
` ...I won't be able to reason any further than this.`
`...Sure, ...I'll acknowledge it.`
`Unless we acknowledge that we 'love each other', `
`...we won't be able to get any further.`
`When Virgilia ran out of patience with the two of us, shy and incapable as we were of acknowledging that out loud,`
` she gave me that red truth instead.`
`That was the red truth saying `
`'#ff0000Beato wanted me to solve it, so she made the riddles of this game solvable#ffffff.'`
`...What the hell.`
`It's like 'Satou-san in class A says he likes you'.`
`Like hearing a love confession via a friend...`
`...I really am...`
`...pitiful.`
`Reasoning...is love.`
`If we don't love each other, `
`...the reasoning won't start.`
`In that case, how can we say that we love each other?`
`'If you think you can solve it, just you try.' 'You're incompetent, like hell you can solve it.'`
`...Yeah, according to George-aniki, people like that are called 'tsundora'.`
`Heheh, that brutal witch is finally starting to look a bit cute.`
`...If I meet her again, I wanna try saying 'You're such a tsundora'.`
`If I meet her again, ...somewhere...`
`.........`
`"...Tell me the other parts of the Decalogue.`
` I don't care about the order.`
` ...Give me something that seems useful."`
`"Allow me to speak.`
` Knox's 8th.`
` It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not presented."`
`"Allow me to speak.`
` Knox's 6th.`
` It is forbidden for accident or intuition to be employed as a detective technique."`
`It must not be solved with clues that aren't presented.`
`And, it must not be solved by relying on accident or coincidence.`
`If this tale is made to be solvable...`
`We can read this the opposite way.`
`In other words,`
` ...clues must be prepared so that the case can be solved.`
`And, it has to be made in a way that it can be solved without relying on coincidence.`
`If I can believe that Beato is challenging me to a fair game where reasoning is possible...`
`...Then I can be sure of that.`
`In other words, ...Beato has already left me clues, hints, and messages in this tale.`
`...It isn't from the Decalogue, but Erika or someone said this:`
`There are three riddles to be exposed in a mystery.`
`One is the 'who dunnit'.`
` Who is the culprit?`
`One is the 'how dunnit'.`
` How did they commit the crime?`
`One is the 'why dunnit'.`
` Why did they commit the crime?`
`All of this means...that clues related to these three riddles are already present inside this tale.`
`...No, strictly speaking, it's like this:`
`Because she wanted me to solve these three riddles, ...Beato scattered hints about.`
`Though whether I'm capable of catching those or not is another matter...`
`Even if you think a riddle you propose is easy, ...it might be difficult for the person trying to solve it.`
`In that case, it's only natural that there'll be a difference in how difficult each person finds it.`
`...Therefore.`
`As Beato goes through each successive game, she watches me closely...`
`and tweaks the game as needed to get a good arrangement.`
`When Beato realized that I'd completely surrendered in the 2nd game because it was too hard,`
` she secretly worried.`
`If I surrendered and lost the will to fight, ...the game would no longer remain on an even footing.`
`Therefore, in order to make me regain my will to fight,`
` ...from the 3rd game onwards, she set things up in a way that made it easier for me,`
` giving me tips on how to fight and a few hints.`
`Virgilia and Ronove obviously appeared so that they could help me.`
`Also, though we still had the usual crazy magic shows,`
` she gave me the metaphor of the Braun tube trial, as well as tips on how to fight back.`
`I finally understood how to fight, `
`...and most likely, at the end of the 4th game...`
`...Beato managed to have the all-out showdown with me that she had probably wanted.`
`...Then, Beato acknowledged that my abilities had become full-fledged,`
` ...and entrusted me with her heart...`
`...entrusted me with explaining this tale, didn't she...`
`In that case, ...it was really dumb of me to boycott most of the 5th game...`
`just because I was so disgusted with those two witches...`
`It doesn't matter who the Game Master is.`
`All I need is to search for the truth in Beato's game.`
`...On the contrary, I should probably...`
`thank those two witches just a little for continuing the game in Beato's place, now that she's gone and left everything to me.`
`Of course, I doubt those evil witches were trying to do anything of the sort...`
`Culprit.`
` Crime.`
` Motive.`
`The answers to those three ultimate riddles...the hints...must be scattered throughout the previously shown tales.`
`It's probably a very faint light, ...like trying to find beads that have fallen onto a sandy beach.`
`They're definitely there.`
`...However, they're so faint that unless I believe strongly, there's no way I'll be able to find them.`
`"Please.`
` Allow me to speak."`
`"...What is it...?"`
`"Go back...through the tale.`
` ...Know that you will be given them as long as you don't lose sight of the truth's faint light."`
`"...Right now, `
`......through this tale..."`
`"Know that for reasoning to be possible, a trusting relationship is required."`
`"...Yeah, `
`...I know.`
` ...In fact,`
` ...maybe I finally noticed just now."`
`It's something that's been repeated over and over again throughout the tale, `
`...persistently so.`
`"...Without love, `
`...the truth...cannot be 'seen'..."`
`Slowly, the tea room dissolved into darkness...`
`Then, as though I was slowly sinking into a pitch-black sea,`
` ...I passed through the crevice of the long journey I'd taken with Beato...`
`...and kept on falling and falling...`
`It was a bizarre experience, `
`...like crossing over the boundary of sleep while still conscious.`
`The several tales before became faint bubbles...no, were they small shining Fragments?`
` ...And were scattered like stars amidst a pitch-black sky.`
`I kept sinking on and on...`
`...into that sea...`
`The tales up until now...`
`...one after another...`
`...after another...`
`Vergilius guided Dante to Mount Purgatory,`
` ...and brought him to the feet of the eternal lady who waited at the top, Beatrice.`
`Therefore, `
`...the innermost depths lay not at the bottom,`
` ...but at the peak of Mount Purgatory.`
`The eternal lady......`
`had been waiting there for Dante......`
`the whole time......`
`An`
`d `

`en`

`I.`
`.`
`.`
`k`
`n`
`e`

`.`
`...I've finally...reached the truth...`
`...To the depths...no,`
` ...to the peak...of Mount Purgatory......`
`......Idiot......`
`...You...`
`...really are...`
`...an idiot...`
`"...Ah, `
`...gwah...`
`...that hurts..."`
`He woke from the sleep of death,`
` ...and bit by bit...his sense of pain came back to him...`
`On Battler's face, which still looked up at the heavens as he hung there pierced by the longsword,`
` ...a suffering and alive expression gradually returned...`
`"You...`
`...really are...`
`...an idiot...`
` ...A huge idiot..."`
`Battler...noticed.`
`...This whole time, `
`...Beato had been snuggling up against him, ...sleeping.`
`And when he held her, `
`...he knew...`
`...that it was not Beato, `
`...but her crumbling...`
`remains.`
`So, when Battler just tried to hold that form as fragile as ash, `
`......then, just like a sand castle made on a beach...washed away by a small wave, `
`...it fell apart and lost its form...`
`At Battler's feet...lay nothing but the ragged remnants of Beato's dress...and a pile of ash.`
`No, ...on top of that pile of ash, ...he could see something sparkling gold.`
`...It was...`
`...the husk...`
`of a single gold butterfly...`
`which had been torn to bits...`
`And so, ...Battler...`
`knew...`
`I've...definitely reached the truth...`
`...However, ...I wasn't able to do it...`
`...while Beato still remained in this world......`
`"...Beato, ...`
`...you...`
`...really are...`
`...an idiot..."`
`I've finally...`
`...reached the truth `
`of this crazy riddle you've created...`
`...Just...`
`like you wanted...!`
`I didn't lose heart, `
`...and I finally...`
`...made it there in the end...`
`So why...`
`...did you lose heart...`
`...without waiting for me...?`
`...You believed so strongly, didn't you...?`
` That I'd...definitely reach the truth...`
`So, ...why...?`
`Why...`
`...couldn't you believe with me...`
`...and wait...?`
`You aren't the one who's been forcing endless torture on someone else.`
`It's me...!`
`I've been the one putting you through such cruel torture...!`
`You resisted until the very end and kept on protesting to me...`
`...And even though...`
`...I've now finally...`
`...reached that truth...`
`To think that you...`
`...couldn't wait any longer...`
`...and that it's all too late...`
`"Y...`
`...You idiooooot...`
`...Why...did you lose heart...`
`...before me? Dammiiiiiiiit..."`
`It's my...fault...`
`I forced her to endure this torture.`
`In fact, she's been doing a wonderful job sticking through it for so long...`
`Over and over and over again, you kept on protesting to me,`
` ...and because I was so incompetent, ...it was as though I couldn't understand the truth.`
`"Idiot...`
`...idiot...`
` ...Your riddles...`
`...are too twisted...!!`
` ...Why couldn't...`
`...you say it...`
`...more simply...?`
`...Idiooooooooooooot!!`
` Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaggghhhhh!!"`
`His scream of pain...`
`...filled the sad cathedral...`
`The sad witch who wasn't able to communicate the truth to Battler.`
`The sad man who wasn't able to understand the witch's truth.`
`Battler's howl of anger and sadness rang out for that pair...`
`The clock hung in the cathedral showed that it was 24:00 on October 5th, 1986.`
`Time was up...`
`...for everything...`
`You're kidding me...`
` ...Don't set something like a time limit on this difficult riddle you're so proud of...`
`"...No, `
`...I understand...`
` Even though there was such a faint chance of that miracle happening, `
`...you prayed for it to happen...`
` ...You're...`
`...just like Grandfather."`
`You prayed for and bet on the power of a miracle, `
`...one so unlikely that it was totally impossible, less likely than finding a bead you've dropped on a sandy beach...`
`And that means I've now truly arrived at that miracle.`
`However, ...your time...`
`...didn't last long enough......`
`If I had reached this point even a little sooner...`
`If I could have 'seen' the truth...!!`
`Even if it had been right before time was up, `
`...I might...`
`...have been able to save you...!!`
`But right now, ...I've been run through pathetically.`
`...I can't...even hold what remains of you...!`
`...As I attempted to pull the longsword out,`
` ...I tried stretching out my arms and kicking my feet, struggling to at least touch her remains, ...but nothing worked.`
`"...Shiiiiiit...`
`dammiiiiiiiiiittt...!!!"`
`...At that time, I noticed a golden glint on the palm of my hand.`
`It was......a single wing from a gold butterfly.`
`That small Fragment of gold...`
`...was the only piece of Beato...`
`...that I was permitted to touch...`
`I cried with all my strength, ...gripped that Fragment, ...and pressed it against my head, apologizing.`
`...Why couldn't I reach the truth earlier...?`
`Then I pressed it to my chest,`
` ...promising that even now, `
`...I would never again lose...`
`...the truth...`
`When I pressed my hand against my chest, ...the sword piercing my chest cut my wrist, and blood dribbled out.`
`That blood spread throughout my fist...`
`...and it must have...`
`...soaked that gold Fragment with my red blood.`
`It must have been...the only way of telling her...`
`that I'd found the truth she'd wanted me to know about...`
`I clutched the wing of the gold butterfly...`
`...with my freshly bleeding hand...`
`...and pressed it against the red sword that pierced me...`
`At this point,`
` ...Ushiromiya Battler...knows.`
`And he understands.`
`...He's found...`
`...this tale's...`
`...everything...`
`At that time, ...it seemed as though...`
`...a faint golden light leaked out of the gaps in his clenched fist.`
`The two witches had their backs turned,`
` and Erika was laughing at Battler's corpse.`
`"...That really is pathetic, Battler-san.`
` I'll make your foolishness into a statue, and for all eternity...`
` ......Huh...?"`
`At that time, Battler's chest...`
`...no, `
`...the red longsword that pierced Battler...`
`...began to sparkle gold from deep within his chest...`
`That bright golden light...began to change the red sword's color, `
`...turning it gold...`
`"...What's going on...?"`
`"...B-Battler is...`
` ...What...`
`...is this...?!"`
`"......!"`
`"Gwah...!!"`
`Battler coughed up blood and groaned.`
`His consciousness...came back.`
`His will to live, his will to fight...came back...`
`The red longsword that pierced Battler...could no longer be described as such.`
`...By now, it had become a golden longsword.`
`Then, `
`...slowly, `
`...gradually, `
`...it pulled itself out of Battler's chest...`
`It finally pulled itself free and started dancing through the air, `
`...then stood up in front of Battler's eyes as though it knew who its master was.`
`Battler, crawling on the floor and moaning, grabbed the golden longsword, `
`...and though it looked painful, `
`...he slowly...`
`...rose to his feet once again.`
`"...This sure is an elaborate act.`
` ...Is this one of your tricks, Lambda?"`
`"Th...`
`...That glow...`
`...i-it couldn't be..."`
`Lambda stared wide-eyed at that bright golden glow in awe...`
`When she noticed that Battler's resurrection wasn't part of a script Lambda had thought up,`
` Bern also frowned slightly...`
`"...Sorry. Retrials will not be permitted.`
` Chiester Sisters, eliminate this resurrection illusion..."`
`"Understood.`
` 45, 410, firing permission granted."`
`"...I-It's...unable to target!!`
` IFF error, code 999...!"`
`"...Eeek."`
`"...999, you say... Impossible...!"`
`The Chiester Sisters hesitated, unable to carry out Bernkastel's orders...`
`"Lambda, what kind of farce is this?`
` ...The Illusion of the Witch has been completely destroyed, and the trial ended with our victory."`
`"...Sorry, Bern.`
` ...You'll have to stick around a bit longer.`
` ...Isn't that right, Ushiromiya Battler...?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` ...Sorry to keep you waiting, Erika,`
` ...Bernkastel,`
` ...now it's time for my truth..."`
`"Request for a retrial accepted.`
` ...The assembly of witches retracts the adjournment of the Court of Illusions!!"`
`"O-Objection.`
` The trial has already been concluded, and the results have even been announced...!"`
`"Objection overruled...!!`
` All verdicts are overshadowed by new truths!!"`
`"Objection!!`
` Not only has Battler been banished as a player, he also doesn't hold the rank of witch...!`
` He isn't qualified to call for an appeal...!"`
`"Objection overruled!!`
` He already does have that.`
` ...By the name of Lambdadelta, Witch of Certainty, I acknowledge it...`
`...Ushiromiya Battler...!`
` I acknowledge you as the new Golden Witch...`
`...no, ...as the new Endless Sorcerer, Ushiromiya Battler...!!!"`
`"...Wh-`
`What did you say...?`
` ...B-`
`Battler got...`
`...the rank of a witch...?!"`
`The rank of a witch, which she had desired for so long, had been granted to Battler so quickly.`
`And on top of that, this wasn't anything temporary.`
`...This was an official, proper authorization by Lambdadelta.`
`Erika couldn't accept it, and her face turned bright red...`
`"...Hmph, ...hehehehehhahaahahahahahahaaah!!`
` Looks like that kid's game really will keep us entertained until the very end...!`
` Sure, I'll play along...!"`
`"Erika, you handle this...!`
` The red truth you've created with me is perfect...!`
` The construction of truth that makes Natsuhi the culprit is perfect...!`
` Battler certainly won't be able to break it!"`
`"O-Of course, my master...!!`
` There's no need to worry at all!`
` Anyway, Chiester Sisters, my master ordered you to fire, right?!`
` How long is it gonna take you to carry that order out?!"`
`"E-Error code 999!`
` A-An access code is required to target the territory lord...!"`
`"...Nyeh.`
` I told you he'd do it nyeh."`
`"Territory lord...?! Who is?!`
` Who controls this Fragment?!`
` I do...!!"`
`"...Territory lord...`
` ...You don't mean, `
`...Battler is...?"`
`"Yes.`
` Ushiromiya Battler has been authorized as the official territory lord of this Fragment...!"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ...So, you still don't understand?`
` You don't know what that gold sparkle signifies?`
` ...He's reached it, ...Battler has.`
` ...He's made his way to the innermost depths of all truths!!"`
`"........."`
`"That means Battler's understood everything about this world, this tale, this game.`
` ...In other words, he's reached the position of the game's master.`
` ...*giggle* I'll bet you don't want to believe it, right, Bern?!"`
`"...Heh, ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` Yeah, I don't want to believe it...!!`
` Okay, I'll test Battler to see whether he really understands everything...!!`
` Erika!"`
`"Too bad, Erika.`
` ...Just when you were finally appointed as the territory lord of this Fragment, you've been deprived of that title."`
`"The new territory lord of this Fragment is Ushiromiya Battler.`
` ...*giggle* Is it awful? Hey, hey, don't you feel just awful?!`
` How's it feel to be deprived of that title just when you'd finally gotten it?! How's it feel?!"`
`"Ahh,`
` ...waaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhggh!!`
` Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!!`
` If you think you can disprove my theory, just try iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!`
` It's impossible,`
` i`
`m`
`p`
`o`
`s`
`s`
`i`

`e`
`!!`
` The theory I've created has no holes!!`
` It's impossible to deny that Natsuhi is the culprit!!"`
`"...`
`#ff0000I can construct a theory with someone other than Aunt Natsuhi as the culprit.`
`#ffffff ...It may be that your truth is impossible to disprove.`
` ...If so, that means your truth won't be able to deny my new truth either...!"`
`Battler spoke with the red truth allowed him by his status as a sorcerer.`
`"...A-A culprit other than Natsuhi...?!`
` ...H-Hah!! How's that?!!`
` Dlanor!!`
` Let's see where this delusion of Battler-san's takes us...!!"`
`...Slowly, ...Dlanor stepped forwards.`
`In her hand...was the red longsword of the Decalogue.`
`She also had a blue short sword.`
`In Battler's hand...was a golden longsword.`
`...The two rivals once again...`
` ...No, for the first time...`
`...they truly confronted each other.`
`"...Battler, I've been WAITING."`
`"Sorry to keep you."`
`"You did NOT.`
` Your return was sooner than I ANTICIPATED."`
`"Kill him, `
`Dlanor A. Knoooooooooooxxxx!!!"`
`Dlanor's form disappeared in an instant.`
`As though her slow, dignified movements from before were only a lie...!`
`...The curve drawn by the longsword of red truth burned itself into the retinas of those who saw it.`
`Before anyone had enough time to follow that curve, ...it was already approaching Battler's chest...!`
`"#5DECFFLady Erika's reasoning has solved the 5th GAME.`
` No new facts exist that overturn the truth created by this reasoning...!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000It's possible to show a different truth by using a different interpretation!!`
` #ffffffWhen multiple truths exist in parallel, the authenticity of both is questioned!!"`
`In this closed-off world, it's possible for differing truths to exist at the same time.`
`Furthermore, as long as multiple truths exist, it's impossible to claim that any of the truths are the single truth.`
`In other words, even if I can't overturn Erika's reasoning, by questioning its credibility...`
`...and conquering it, I can defeat it...!`
`"Bern's reasoning is perfect. You won't be able to overturn it easily.`
` ...But still, `
`if you can present a theory on par with Bern's, the fight'll come down to a verdict.`
` That means either one of the truths might be defeated and denied!"`
`"...What a laughable script...!!`
` I'd expect nothing less from a demon's script!!"`
`"Then let me ASK!!`
` What is this theory with someone other than Natsuhi as the CULPRIT?!!"`
`Battler's golden longsword drew both red and blue curves at will.`
`"#5decffIt's possible to construct it using the revenge of the baby from 19 years ago, the one from Aunt Natsuhi's confession.#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000Knox's 1st.`
` It is forbidden for the culprit to be anyone not mentioned in the early part of the story!`
` A person first introduced in the 5th game cannot be named as the CULPRIT...!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffWhat if the baby from 19 years ago was among us since the very beginning?`
` For example, ...what if it was me?!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000Knox's 8th.`
` It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not presented!`
` #ffffffWas there ever any foreshadowing showing that you might be the baby from 19 years ago?!!"`
`"#ff0000The red truth from the 4th game that I'm not the son of my mother Asumu.`
` The feeling that Dad was hiding something in both the first game and this game.`
` In particular, in this game, it was made clear that there were some special circumstances having to do with my birth.#ffffff"`
`Battler proposed that he might be the baby from 19 years ago...`
`...and announced that he'd reconstruct the crime with himself as the culprit.`
`As Dlanor cautiously held her sword at the ready, she gauged the distance between them...`
`Now that Battler had inherited the position of this world's territory lord and attained the rank of Endless Sorceror,`
` his movements surpassed Human understanding.`
`By now, the physical distance between them probably counted for nothing.`
`After all, their extremely agile battle was surpassing the point where the concept of distance made any difference.`
`"...A good START.`
` Let us hear...your theory with Battler as the CULPRIT...!"`
`"Yeah, I'll let you hear it.`
` I'll prove that this explanation also works...`
` ...and that you can't be certain Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit...!"`
`"<Good>!!`
` If you're supposed to be the culprit, that creates several contradictions!`
` I'll use those contradictions to reap your feeble truth!`
` I, Furudo Erika, the detective and the Witch of Truth will...!!"`
`This time, Erika stepped forward.`
`...In her hand, there appeared a scythe like one a grim reaper might hold.`
`A ruthless scythe for reaping everything that threatened her theory...!`
`"#5DECFFIt's only possible for the crime to have taken place between 24:00 and 1:00!!`
`#ffffff`
` #ff0000During that one hour, you were in the dining hall of the mansion!!#ffffff`
` #5decffTherefore, it was impossible for you to commit the crime!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000It has not been specified that the time of death was between 24:00 and 1:00.#ffffff`
` #5decffTherefore, it's possible that the crime didn't occur between 24:00 and 1:00...!#ffffff"`
`"There's a restriction on any murders in the cousin room!`
` #ff0000From 1:00 AM until the discovery of the crime, it was impossible for any criminal action to occur in the cousin room!!`
` Dlanor, now!!!"`
`"#ff0000Knox's 8th.`
` It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not PRESENTED.`
` If the crime actually was carried out in the cousin room, clues must have been SHOWN.`
` Because clues were not given to the detective, Lady Erika, who was on the watch for any abnormalities inside that room until morning, such a crime is IMPOSSIBLE...!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffBy the time of the crime's discovery, you mean the point at which I let out a scream and everyone gathered there.`
` Even if it was impossible to kill them before that point, it was possible to kill them afterwards...!!#ffffff"`
`Battler used a blue flash to deflect both of the red truths that Erika and Dlanor had flung at him...!`
`Erika's eyes went wide.`
`After all, what he had said was completely absurd.`
`...At that time, `
`...they still hadn't been killed...?!`
`Even though corpses with their necks sliced open were laying right there?!`
`"#ff0000The death of the four in the cousin room has been proclaimed with the red text!!#ffffff`
` Are you trying to use the Illusion of the Witch?!`
` Are you trying to resurrect George and the others using the concept of magic, even though they were dead at the time?!"`
`"I see, since you believe they were dead by that point,`
` it probably looks as though the dead have been brought back to life to you...!`
` So this might look like magic in your eyes.`
` ...In that case, I won't be the one to take the next shot at you!"`
`"Fool!!`
` How often do I have to say it?!!`
`#ff0000 The deaths of the four people in the cousin room have been proclaimed with the red truth!!`
` Furthermore, those corpses were witnessed by a large number of people!!`
` Furthermore, it's already been proclaimed in red that no examination of any corpses would lead to a mistaken result...!!`
` Take that, dead people!!!"`
`"#5decff...When was that red truth made?`
` Have you forgotten, Miss?#ffffff"`
`The fierce shower of red was blocked by a magical barrier set up by Ronove, who suddenly appeared right in front of Battler.`
`Now that Beato was gone, the demons shouldn't have been able to manifest themselves in the real world...`
`However, ...he 'existed' here...`
`...and calmly dealt with Erika's attack.`
`"Y-You, ...Ronove!!`
` H-How did you get here...?!`
` Well, who cares, this all works out nicely. Now there's no need to go looking for you.`
` I'll capture you here and deny your existence too!!"`
`"...I'll leave it to you.`
` Teach her that you can't control everything with a single, arrogant truth."`
`"<Yes, your majesty>.`
` ...Well then, ...allow me to be your opponent for a bit.`
` What do you say, Miss?"`
`"#5decffIn that case, when do you claim the red truth death proclamation happened?!`
` Are you saying you can pinpoint that?!`
` You can't pinpoint it, so you can't deny that the death proclamation was made at the time of the crime's discovery!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000When this court was opened, Lady Lambdadelta made a proclamation.`
` She said this was a 24:00 answer session!`
`#ffffff`
` ...The death proclamation was made at 24:00 on the second day...in other words, at the end of the game.`
` That does not deny the possibility that the murder occurred after the morning of the second day, after the so-called 'discovery of the crime'...!#ffffff"`
`"Then, you're saying...that the victims were alive at that time?!`
` Even though their necks were sliced open?!"`
`"#5decffDid you see that yourself, Miss Detective...?`
` True, our current understanding is that no corpse will lead to a mistaken examination, no matter who performs it, `
`...but no rule named so far has prevented something other than a corpse from being called a corpse.#ffffff"`
`Erika swung her scythe recklessly, `
`but Ronove blocked everything with elegant gestures made with the shield on one of his hands.`
`"...S-So, at that point in time, no one was dead?!`
` There weren't even wounds on their necks?!`
` In that case, ...why did Battler scream?!"`
`"Better watch your feet, little girl.`
` #ff0000...Ushiromiya Kinzo is already dead at the starting time for all games!#ffffff"`
`"Huh?! Ah-"`
`A pitch-black hole opened beneath Erika's feet and swallowed her up.`
`She could probably see through to the other side of the hole.`
`...It was the same thing you'd see if you looked down out of the skylight on the ceiling of this cathedral.`
`"Lia!!"`
`"Yes."`
`Virgilia could already be seen in midair inside the cathedral.`
`As Erika fell from the heavens, Virgilia was right below her and caught her on the end of a divine spear that sparkled blue!`
`"#5decff...Shouldn't you rethink your reasoning?`
` Kinzo doesn't exist.`
` Therefore, the way for the bodies to disappear in your theory is a failure.#ffffff"`
`"CORRECT.`
` ...Unless someone other than Kinzo makes the corpses disappear, your theory FAILS."`
`"Geh, `
`...gah, `
`...gammiiiiiiit, this is nothing...`
`...graggh, ...gggh...!!"`
`Virgilia's blue divine spear skewered and pinned Erika in midair.`
`Erika struggled, filled with hatred, but she couldn't get it out easily.`
`Then, all around her,`
` ...several small, fast things clanged off the walls and enveloped her.`
`Then seven people manifested themselves at once.`
`"We are the Seven Sisters of Purgatory...!!`
` Know this, foe of our master!!"`
`"...You...lowly paperweights...!!"`
`"#ff0000After George's death, his corpse was never moved!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000After Jessica's death, her corpse was never moved!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000After Maria's death, her corpse was never moved!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000After Rosa's death, her corpse was never moved!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000After Genji's death, his corpse was never moved!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000After Krauss's death, his corpse was never moved!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000Therefore, the corpses couldn't have vanished after being discovered!!`
` Your theory about Kinzo carrying the corpses away fails!#ffffff"`
`"AAAaaaaaaarrggghhhhhhhghhh...!!!`
` But so what?`
` Even without Kinzo, I can explain how...the corpses disa-...`
`...nnngg, ...gaaaaaaaaaggghhh!!`
` I, ...Furudo Erika, have to revise my theory...?!`
` Nnnnnngggaaaaaaaaaarrrrggghh!!`
` I do?! ...The detective does?!!`
` Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrggghhhhh!!"`
`...Erika was probably capable of escaping this even with Kinzo's existence denied...`
`by making only a small revision to her theory.`
`However, `
`...to her, having to revise a theory she had already created...`
`...was extremely...humiliating!`
`"Looks like you toyed around with your plan too much in order to corner Natsuhi like that."`
`"You played around too much with your reasoning.`
` ...At this point, your master isn't the only one who can speak of Kinzo's death with the red truth."`
`"This is what you get for playing around in the witches' darkness.`
` ...Know that, Furudo Erika...!"`
`"Nngh, ...gggh, ggh...!!"`
`Of course, even Erika had doubted Kinzo's existence from the beginning.`
`However, it had previously been impossible for anyone to deny his existence in that trial,`
` except for Bernkastel and Lambdadelta, who had sided with each other.`
`And because of the willful silence of those two, the truth about Kinzo had truly been unfixed.`
`And yet, to think that Battler...had become a witch...a sorcerer...`
`and capable of using red without proof!!`
`However, she had her own Inquisitor of Heresy, who could also use red without proof to counter!!`
`"D-Dlanoooooooooooorrrr!!!!"`
`"#ff0000Knox's 2nd!!`
` It is forbidden for supernatural agencies to be employed as a detective technique!`
` If you would show that Kinzo has died with the red truth, then I demand that you display proof of a Human's truth that could be used to make that point...!#ffffff"`
`"...Forgive me, damn geezer."`
`"Overcome it, Battler.`
` Don't let my corpse stop you...!!"`
`"#ff0000Presentation of evidence.`
` I'll present a corpse that could possibly be identified as Ushiromiya Kinzo's...!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffCan you prove that this corpse is Ushiromiya Kinzo's?!`
` No matter how much it resembles him, unless you can prove that it is him,`
` it is possible to claim that it was a substitute corpse from someone ELSE!!`
` Can you show that it was Kinzo's corpse with the truth of HUMANS?!`
` In this case alone, and with the red truth specifically, no counterargument will be valid...!!#ffffff"`
`"...Ooh.`
` Any counter with the red truth will be invalid?`
` I guess that works."`
`"It may be true that the existence of third-party corpses has already been denied with the red.`
` However, if saying that with the red is forbidden...`
` *giggle* Battler has nowhere to run to.`
` Heheheheheheheheheh!"`
`"That's right...`
` #ff0000In this closed-off Rokkenjima, there is no objective way to show that this corpse is Grandfather's.#ffffff"`
`"#5decffAnd that itself suggests the possibility that this corpse is a body double!`
` This unidentifiable corpse cannot serve as proof of Kinzo's death...!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decff...Checkmate...!!`
` My theory does not waver!!#ffffff"`
`Dlanor had sealed off the red truth as a means of proving that Kinzo's corpse had been shown.`
`...Even with the power of witches, Battler couldn't argue back...!`
`"...How are you gonna prove that the corpse was Kinzo's if the red truth is sealed?`
` It's impossible.`
` ...It can't be done...!"`
`"...With red or blue, ...right...?"`
`"#ffcc00I guarantee that this corpse is Ushiromiya Kinzo's corpse...!!#ffffff"`
`Then, `
`...when Dlanor...`
`...met with Battler's golden flash, `
`...she was unable to fully block it with either her red longsword or her blue short sword, `
`...and she was blown backwards into empty space...!`
`It was a direct hit, ...without any miscalculation.`
`Though she had always seemed as firm as a small giant before now,`
` she was finally blasted away and slammed against the wall as though she was the slender girl she appeared to be...!`
`"...D-Dlanor?! Wh-What are you..."`
`"...A splendid gold TRUTH.`
` ...It is VALID."`
`"...G-Gold truth...?!"`
`The golden longsword, which had been drawing red and blue trails before now,`
` finally drew a curve that retained its divine golden color.`
`The truth it showed...was neither red nor blue.`
`...It was gold...truth...!!!`
`"Wh-What is that...?`
` Lambda, does this follow the rules?!"`
`"......`
`...Yes.`
` ...Gold truth, valid.`
` The gold truth...`
`...can only be used by the territory lord of this world...`
`...no, ...only by the Game Master himself!!"`
`"...Wh-What did you say......?"`
`"...Gold TRUTH.`
` A divine truth woven in a different fashion than the red TRUTH.`
` ...Its strength is on par with the red TRUTH.`
` ...It may sometimes be INFERIOR.`
` But it is sometimes SUPERIOR!!"`
`"That glitter...is proof that Battler-kun truly understands Beato."`
`"...I've shown it.`
` Shown that the corpse is Grandfather's."`
`"YES.`
` Gold truth, ...ACCEPTED.`
` Unless Lady Erika's theory undergoes some revision, it will be DESTROYED...!"`
`"...Wh-What the...`
`ah, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrgghhh!!!"`
`Erika cried out in pain.`
`...It wasn't the pain of her body being pierced.`
`It was the pain of her own theory being defiled...!`
`"...I see.`
` ...It's like 'And then there were no Ackroyds'.`
` ...Just when did this, ......`
`...*giggle*giggle*, `
`ahhahahahaahahahahhaahahahahhahah!!`
` What a crazy mashup of great works!!"`
`"Battler, it would be excessively unrefined to say any more.`
` Even without saying another word, `
`you've fully made your truth about the corpses' disappearance 'understood'!`
` I see, 'that thing' you're thinking of doesn't conflict with any of the red in this trial so far!`
` Your truth based around the revenge of the man from 19 years ago had been completely understood and processed!!`
` I proclaim that your truth has now been established!!"`
`"Wha.`
` What the...?!`
` Why is that, Great Lady Lambdadelta?!!`
` He still hasn't explained everything...!!`
` I still have many ways to argue back, ...like Hideyoshi's closed room, the seal on Natsuhi's personal room, and the button in the closet!"`
`"...Do you...`
`really still think you're capable of defeating Battler's argument...?"`
`"Ggah, ...gwwaagghgghggghhh...!!!!"`
`Only Erika, the one who was supposedly so intelligent, couldn't understand.`
`...She couldn't understand that Battler had already reached the real truth.`
`"#ff0000Because of this, Grandfather's absence has been verified, `
`and the dishonorable relationship between Aunt Natsuhi and Grandfather has been removed from consideration!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000Aunt Natsuhi is pure and faithful!`
` I won't permit this vulgar tale you're all so fond of!!#ffffff"`
`"...B-Battler-kun...!!"`
`"#ff0000Furthermore, `
`because we've raised doubts about the time of death for all who have died so far, the alibis for everyone besides Aunt Natsuhi go back to square one...!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000If you try to argue that the crime was impossible for everyone except Aunt Natsuhi, it won't work!!#ffffff"`
`Dlanor, who must have risen to her knees at some point, `
`slowly stood up...`
`The flash from the golden longsword was still buried deep into her chest.`
`Though pain didn't show in her expression, `
`her awkward movements clearly showed how serious the damage she had taken was.`
`Even though she herself knew that the match was long over by now...`
`...Dlanor didn't abandon her duty...!`
`"#ff0000However, in the cousin room, you witnessed corpses that were impossible to MISIDENTIFY...!`
` Are you trying to say that was a LIE?!`
` ...Knox's 7th, it is forbidden for the detective to be the CULPRIT!!`
`#ffffff The detective is obligated to keep to an objective point of VIEW.`
` Your theory would mean you violated this OBLIGATION!!"`
`"#ff0000Furudo Erika is the detective, and the 'me' in this game isn't one!!`
` And by Knox's 9th, it is permitted for observers to let their own conclusions and explanations be heard...!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000Knox's 8th, it is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not PRESENTED!`
` Until now, you have been the DETECTIVE!`
` Was it ever shown that you were not the detective this time, and that you were an observer capable of inserting his own personal IDEAS?!!`
` Unless it was, you do not have the right to falsify your point of VIEW!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000In this game!`
` When I figured out the device connected to the epitaph's riddle, I witnessed Grandfather.`
` ...As has already been shown in red, Grandfather doesn't exist.`
` It was impossible for me to witness him!`
` Therefore, it has already been shown that my viewpoint wasn't objective!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffIt is possible that it was just a sheet or something fluttering in the wind and rain, which you mistook for Kinzo.`
` It cannot be used as foreshadowing to form a basis for Knox's 9th...!!`
` Mistaking one thing for another is a right permitted to all observers!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000There's the red truth that Beato showed during the 4th game!!`
` No person would mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight!#ffffff"`
`It's the red truth Beato used to counter my blue truth claim that 'someone disguised themselves as Kinzo'`
` to make it seem as though Grandfather had appeared.`
`#ff0000In other words, on this island, all illusions that might lead someone to mistake something for Grandfather, including someone else pretending to be Grandfather, 'most certainly cannot work'.`
`All of Aunt Natsuhi's schemes to make it seem Grandfather existed were hidden in the relatives' blind spots,`
` all of them clever tricks like 'he was here just a second ago' or 'he's in his study alone now'.`
`They never tried to make anyone mistake something they saw for Grandfather himself,`
` so there are no contradictions.`
`If they had tried to dress one of the servants in Grandfather's robe, `
`...it probably would've been seen through in an instant...`
`It has been guaranteed that none of the characters in this tale would 'mistake something for Grandfather by sight'...!`
`If someone claims to have seen Grandfather despite that, it becomes a 'lie'.`
`Allowing lies to be contained within their observations is a right granted to everyone, `
`...except for just one person.`
`And that person is...`
`'the detective'...!!`
`"#ff0000Because of the right granted by Knox's 9th, anyone is allowed to mistake a sheet in the wind for something else and tell about it.`
` ...However!`
` Mistaking it for Grandfather in particular is not permitted in this game due to the red truth!!#ffffff"`
`"...So, once you claimed to have seen Kinzo,`
` it was no longer misrecognition,`
` but INTENTIONAL.`
` ...In other words, this proves that the observer was not OBJECTIVE...`
` Is what you are SAYING...?"`
`In this case, unintentional 'misrecognition' is not permitted by the rules of this game.`
`However, it is possible to intentionally 'lie about seeing' something you never saw...!!`
`And that is an action not permitted to a 'detective', who is obligated to maintain an impartial perspective...`
`"Forgive my crazy argument...`
` It's all finished now."`
`"No, it's OKAY."`
`......Because men like you exist in this WORLD...`
`...You will surely protect the fragile truth from any kind of PRIDE.`
`You will surely protect the real truth...from the tyranny of any plausible truth...`
`that might claim to exist as the sole truth and try to exterminate all fragile TRUTHS...!!`
`Battler's golden longsword...drew a massive blue arc as though splitting the heavens.`
`"I'm glad I could fight with YOU...!!"`
`"#5decffTherefore, `
`my perspective in this game is based upon the 9th, not the 7th...!!`
` The fact that I claimed to have seen Grandfather is proooooooooooofff!!!#ffffff"`
`...The noise that rang out across the cathedral...`
`...was the sound of Dlanor's longsword clattering to the floor.`
`Simply letting go of that was the same as resigning to the proud Dlanor.`
`Though the blue trail Battler had drawn was aiming right for the top of Dlanor's head, ...it stopped a hair's breadth away...`
`If it hadn't, Dlanor would probably have been annihilated, without leaving a single scrap of flesh behind.`
`"...I RESIGN.`
` ...I give up on denying your TRUTH..."`
`"I've paid my debt.`
` ...Let honor be to your father.`
` ...The Decalogue was neither arrogant nor judgmental...!"`
`"...H-Honor to...my FATHER..."`
`Dlanor...sat down on the floor...`
`and completely abandoned her will to fight.`
`"...Wh-What are you doing, Dlanor?!!`
` Lame, pathetic!!`
` You stupid half-wit murder doll!!`
` You've tainted the honor of your own father, shame on you!!`
` You still call yourself mystery's wedges?!`
` Will you surrender to magic?!`
` The history of the mystery genre won't allow that!!"`
`"...You're the one...`
`...that doesn't understand what mystery is all about.`
` ...If you see mystery as nothing more than a weapon with which to sneer at your opponent intellectually,`
` ...I won't let you ever say so again!!"`
`"...B-Battleeeeeeeeee...eeer...!!!"`
`"#5decffI'll present a truth that conflicts with yours!!`
` Aunt Natsuhi was threatened by a phone call over the internal line, sent by the man from 19 years ago, me!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffHis goal was to make Aunt Natsuhi look like a murderer...!!`
` From the beginning, this has all been a drama of revenge intent on framing Aunt Natsuhi...!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffTh-That's wrong, it's a drama of revenge against the Ushiromiya family that Natsuhi thought up!!`
` Your theory outright opposes mine!!#ffffff"`
`"...You still can't pull out the blue spear that's sticking through you, right?"`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` From Erika, I haven't heard of a single way for the corpses to disappear that doesn't involve Kinzo.`
` Looks like your theory's about to be denied, doesn't it?!"`
`"Th-This spear is just...`
`...ugh, ...gaaaaahh...!!`
` You paperweights, `
`...get out of my way...!"`
`...The deeply piercing blue spear and the seven red stakes tormented her theory.`
`They won't come out...`
` They won't come out...!!`
`"......I acknowledge the mistake in Erika's reasoning and the need for revision."`
`"Wh-What the...my master?!?!"`
`Watching Erika's face contort with pain as she struggled to escape from the spear,`
` Bernkastel spoke this with a disgusted expression.`
`Faced with the facts, ...Bernkastel had acknowledged Erika's loss herself.`
`Erika gazed at her master, who was no longer confident in Erika's own victory, `
`with a mixture of shock and despair...`
`"...I don't give a damn about your pride.`
` How long do you intend to shame yourself like that?`
` ...You, my double who's been granted the same blue hair as me, ...how long do you intend to hang there pierced through like that...?`
` I guess I'll just have to descend myself..."`
`"...Looks like I didn't need a piece after all.`
` Aah, what a pain, what a pain, what a total pain...`
` I don't need a piece, I'll just throw it away, yeah, that disappointing, regretful, discouraging, hopeless let-down of a misfire...!!`
` ...Do it quickly, filth!!`
` Didn't I tell you to revise that pathetic theory of yours?!?!"`
`"Ooh, ...agh...hh...y-yes, my master...!!`
` I'll revise it, ...I'll revise my theory...!!`
` Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggghhhh...!!"`
`As Erika's face twisted in humiliation and tears streamed from her eyes,`
` she withdrew and revised her own theory in accordance with her master's order...`
`Mumbling quietly, she made various revisions with the blue truth,`
` had them acknowledged by Lambdadelta, and finally had the blue spear smashed and was freed...`
`Though that blue truth did indeed explain how the corpses had disappeared,`
` ...it couldn't conceal its desperation and was a bit of truly shabby reasoning.`
`"...My master, `
`...I-I've taken it out...`
` ...My theory...`
`...is perfect..."`
`"Are you kidding me?`
` It's horribly pathetic.`
` ...But I'll forgive you.`
` Because your face and your theory are so lame it's funny!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!!"`
`Erika was taunted by her master, who wore an ugly expression.`
`She thrashed about on the floor, crying bitter tears.`
`The wounded Dlanor stepped out before her, as though shielding her, and she spoke to Bernkastel, as well as Battler.`
`"...Regardless of how pathetic it might BE,`
` ...Lady Erika's revised truth is VALID."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` Regardless of my truth, yours can exist at the same time.`
` ...That's what this world is like.`
` No one can disprove them, so even if there are various truths and even if they contradict each other wildly, they can exist at the same time.`
` Here, as many truths exist as you can imagine.`
` No one can just deny that all on their own...!"`
`"YES, that is TRUE.`
` ...I won't let anyone deny Lady Erika's TRUTH."`
`"...D-Dlanor..."`
`"As long as I'm here,`
` I will protect that TRUTH.`
` ...No matter how pathetic it is, I will not laugh at that TRUTH."`
`"Aah, ...waaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!"`
`...The words of Dlanor, whom Erika had previously looked down upon, led Erika to once again thrash about on the floor, sobbing.`
`"And,`
` because no unique truth exists, everything is covered in darkness.`
` ...Therefore,`
` while both my theory and Erika's theory are impossible to deny, neither is a unique truth.`
` They are vague, and while neither can be denied, neither is certain...!!"`
`"Because there has been no decision, the Illusion of the Witch still exists.`
` ...The only one who will be permitted to expose it...is neither Erika nor the rest of you.`
` ...It's me alone!`
` I won't let anyone expose Beatrice's illusion except me!!!"`
`"The verdict is revised...!!`
` Because of the truth presented by Ushiromiya Battler, Erika's truth is no longer unique!`
` However, Erika's truth is impossible to disprove!`
` Therefore, both of their truths exist together!`
` The conclusion of the 5th game is rescinded!"`
`"The game goes back to being even!!`
` And I transfer the position of Game Master from myself to the Golden Sorcerer, Ushiromiya Battler!!"`
`"Ushiromiya Battler, step forward!!`
` I appoint you as the new Game Master!!`
` Will you accept?`
` You will, right?!`
` Do it, you new Endless Witch!!!"`
`"Yeah!!`
` I'm the new Game Master!!`
` I'll weave the 6th game...!!"`
`"Erika, let's settle things for good this time!!`
` Stand up!!"`
`"...Y-Yes, `
`...I will stand...`
` ...I'll make you regret...`
`...giving me a chance to clear away this shame...!!!`
` My master, please give me an opportunity to fight with Battler again in the 6th game!!"`
`"...Sure.`
` Of course I'll give you a chance."`
`"Wow, incredible.`
` She said 'I'll give you a chance'.`
` Isn't this a miracle? From the Witch of Miracles, Bernkastel."`
`"...Erika,`
` you've miraculously managed to escape with your life.`
` ...In the 6th game, ...Battler's game,`
` ...expose the truth no matter what...`
` Unless you want to be tossed aside into the darkness of oblivion!!"`
`"Y-Yes, my master...!!!`
` ...Dl-Dlanor..."`
`"Of COURSE.`
` I will give it my all in the next game as WELL."`
`"Heh, ...heheheheheheh!!`
` I won't pretend to be a guest any longer.`
` ...Together with Dlanor, I'll tear your game to bits!!"`
`"Sure.`
` I'll invite you to my 6th game...!!`
` Sorry, but that title of yours...<Checkmate of the>...isn't cutting it."`
`"It's your game. You can decide the name yourself!`
` Just bring it on...!!`
` I, Furudo Erika, ...am a detective before I am a witch!!`
` I acknowledge you as the new master of this game, ...and I issue a proclamation of war!!`
` I'll definitely...definitely expose it all!! I'll kill you!!`
` Golden Sorcerer, Ushiromiya Battler!!!"`
`"Yeah, come at me with all you've got!!`
` Furudo Erikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`Just watch, Beato.`
` ...I'll take charge of your game!!`
`And in this next game, I'll prove that I completely understand all of your riddles...!!`
`""Then let the pair exchange their rings!!""`
`...Beato took Battler's hand...and put a ring with the seal of the One-Winged Eagle on his finger.`
`"......Are you sure...?"`
`"You already are the territory lord.`
` ...So, this ring belongs to you, Battler-san."`
`"...You're really sure?`
` ...At this rate, the world you created, ...and the tale..."`
`"Yes.`
` ......I created this tale because I wished to be with you.`
` ...That means the purpose of this world has been fulfilled.`
` ...So, from now on, ...I want you to write it.`
` ...The continuing tale...of you and me."`
`"............"`
`"...Or is doing it like that too awkward for yooou?`
` *cackle*cackle* I'm just pushing the tiresome task of territory lord onto you anyway.`
` It's much easier being the wife, where you only have to brag...!"`
`"I just need to play around and wait for you to write a new tale.`
` And, for each new tale you write, I'll play any part you need.`
` ......Be it an evil witch, or a rival.`
` ...A lover, ...or a wife."`
`"My tales are pretty intense.`
` You'll be busy from dawn until dusk."`
`"Indeed...... Bring it on..."`
`Beato's hand relinquished the ring of the territory lord...`
`From Battler, she received a silver ring with a crest that could only be worn by the wife of the territory lord.`
`They exchanged their rings, ...and their wedding was complete.`
`Then, the pair turned around, ...faced the packed crowd of guests, and raised their rings high.`
`A thunderous applause rang out for them...`
`"As a memorial to this night's events, the great territory lord will now recognize the accomplishments of certain people."`
`"Let those called come forward."`
`At Battler's nod, Beato read the name of the first guest to be recognized.`
`"...Kanon,`
` come forward."`
`"K-Kanon-kun...?!"`
`A girl goat pushed her way through the crowd, took off her mask, and yelled.`
`A cloud of gold butterflies gathered before Battler and Beato...`
`...and took the form of Kanon, kneeling in front of these two nobles.`
`Kanon had already died and vanished.`
`...However, all of the dead revive in the Golden Land.`
`"Kanon, right here..."`
`"When my husband was locked up and in danger,`
` you rescued him and displayed your capability for self-sacrifice by choosing to remain in that eternal prison in his place.`
` Such devotion is deserving of an award.`
` Therefore, we will allow for your resurrection, as well as your continued service."`
`"...Yes ma'am!`
` I am honored...and delighted!"`
`"Kanon-kun, ...Y-Yoshiya-kun!!`
` Yoshiya-kunnnn!! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!"`
`Jessica raced forward and landed sobbing in Kanon's chest.`
`Kanon patted her head gently and held her...`
`"You won't be serving as furniture.`
` You'll be serving as a human.`
` ...Do you understand what that means?"`
`"......Yes."`
`After glancing at Jessica sobbing, ...he looked at Battler again and nodded forcefully.`
`"Now for the next pair.`
` Ushiromiya George and Shannon!`
` Come forward!!"`
`""Yes.""`
`George and Shannon were the next to be called.`
`Perhaps they had already readied themselves.`
` They walked forward boldly and kneeled.`
`"Ushiromiya George, right here."`
`"Shannon, right here..."`
`"You two withstood Zepar and Furfur's trials until the very end.`
` Your great achievements and affection, determination and nobility were exemplary and deserving of an award.`
` Therefore, your marriage certificate has been issued with the territory lord's signature!"`
`""We are honored and delighted!""`
`"No one will be allowed to object to this certificate!`
` Let the families of those recognized bless their union with all their hearts!!"`
`"And so,`
` now that there's nothing stopping these two, let's all throw rice at them and celebrate.`
` Hey, congrats, you two!"`
`When the territory lord clapped his hands in celebration, it spread throughout the entire cathedral.`
`Then, a group of goats in the front line of the crowd took their masks off one by one...`
`"...L-Listen up, okay?!`
` I'll never forgive you if you make too much salty miso soup!`
` And George is getting a little overweight, so go easy on the sugar-"`
`"George! When a man gets married, `
`he's got to treasure his wife even more than his parents!`
` No matter what your mother says, you make sure you protect Shannon-chan!"`
`"Yes, of course!!"`
`"George-san...!!"`
`"A-Anyway, George needs to be asleep by 7:00!`
` I'll never forgive you if you let him stay up late!!`
` And don't forget that washing his back and cleaning his ears are also a wife's responsibilities!!"`
`"I-Is that true...? Wh-What have I done..."`
`"...A-A wife's job can vary, depending on the family..."`
`"Rudolf-san, have you been treasuring your wife?"`
`"O-Of course...`
` Why would you doubt that...?!"`
`"Find happiness, you two.`
` Marriage isn't a goal.`
` It's just the starting line, okay?"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!`
` Congratulations, congratulations!!"`
`"Uryu-!! Congratulaaaaaaatioons!!!"`
`"We mustn't lose either."`
`"Heh, heheheheheheh...!!`
` Y-Yeah, no way we're losing, dammiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`All of the Ushiromiya family, all of the servants, and all of the spirits and demons in attendance...`
`celebrated the honorees with an even greater applause...`
`And so, ......the curtain closes on the tale woven by the Golden Witch.`
`Perhaps we should finish this tale with the epitaph.`
`The following is the passage of the Golden Land, from the epitaph of the Golden Witch.`
`The witch shall praise the wise and bestow four treasures.`
`One shall be all the gold from the Golden Land.`
`One shall be the resurrection of all the dead souls.`
`One shall be the resurrection of the love that was lost.`
`One shall be to put the witch to sleep for all time.`
`Sleep peacefully, my beloved witch, Beatrice...`
`"......`
`...So, this means Beato was satisfied and put to sleep...?"`
`"That interpretation is probably appropriate..."`
`"And?`
` Now that the game's over, Onii-chan will be released, right?`
` ...What will he do next?"`
`"...Who knows?`
` ......The book of this Fragment tells no more of the story."`
`"......So, in the end, we don't even get to see what comes next for him.`
` ........."`
`...Nothing comes next for him.`
`In the end, Onii-chan and the others never came back.`
`They reached the Golden Land and had a great time together there.`
`...Even if the tale tells us that, ...the truth is...`
`that everyone died in that huge accident...`
`"Still, ...we've learned a lot of very interesting things.`
` ...It seems that island...really was a crazy island of illusions."`
`"Indeed.`
` ...And your reading was truly wonderful..."`
`"...I feel worn out, like watching a six-hour movie all at once.`
` ...I'm tired."`
`"Ushiromiya Ange,`
` you truly have worked hard.`
` ......Your reading has soothed my boredom.`
` I, Featherine, am more grateful to you than I have been for so many years that I cannot remember..."`
`"If you're grateful, why can't I have some kind of award too?"`
`"Hmm, what would be good...`
` Give me some time.`
` I will think."`
`Featherine sat down in her rocking chair and rocked it, apparently trying to think of something...`
`"...Ushiromiya Ange,`
` you really have worked hard.`
` ...You have done well to keep reading for me until the end.`
` ...With this, your responsibilities as my miko are lifted.`
` You may return to your original world and be reunited with the fate you have been given."`
`"Sheesh.`
` ...Feels like this was one hell of a side-trip."`
`"Do not pout.`
` I am thinking of a reward now...`
` ...Yes, that's something I haven't done much...`
`or rather, at all, ...for quite some time.`
` ...I imagine the ink from the bottle has dried up by now..."`
`Even after the tale ended, Ange and Hachijo's debate over it continued for quite some time.`
`It had been very serious...and fiery.`
`Ange had acknowledged that this tale was no crazy literary work,`
` ...but a new message bottle, which had drifted here once more from the Rokkenjima of 12 years previous...`
`to tell her of one truth...`
`And, ......it seemed as though she had found her own interpretation of the truth she thought the tale was trying to tell.`
`...Of course, that was only one truth,`
` and it did not mean an end to her journey.`
`However, ...maybe it can be viewed this way.`
`It wasn't sufficient to fill the 12-year gap in her heart.`
`...However, at that moment, ...just enjoying the feeling along with the bitter coffee Hachijo had made...was enough.`
`"...Thank you for reading until the end.`
` ...And thank you for your thoughts and opinions.`
` ...I'm sure the very first Endless Witch is happy..."`
`"......Wow, so you can bring yourself to say stuff like that.`
` ...If you'd just talk like that from the beginning, you'd have tons more fans."`
`"...I am merely praising the wonderful reader that you most certainly are.`
` ...I just wanted to say that spending the time I have left in my life writing for you alone...`
`was much more productive than writing for those pigs who do not talk and cannot think would have been...`
` *giggle*."`
`"That's just the kind of thing you'd be better off not saying.`
` ...Well, I'll take it as a compliment.`
` ...Okay."`
`I get the feeling...that I've spent a really, really long time here.`
`It feels...as though I've spent a major fraction of my life here.`
`...Though it should feel uncomfortable, sitting here on a sofa in someone else's house,`
` ...for some strange reason, it feels as familiar as my own home.`
`However, the clock says it's only been about two or three hours since I met her.`
` ...My sense of time feels very strange...`
`"...Your friend seems to be taking his time..."`
`"It must be a long phone call.`
` It's creepy for a guy to talk that long on the phone."`
`He said he was going to make a scheduled report to Okonogi-san, didn't he?`
`Even though he was told that he could use the phone here, he declined and went to look for a public phone somewhere.`
`...Something about how he didn't want to risk being bugged.`
` He's a moron, so I'll let him do what he wants.`
`"Is the nearest public phone far?"`
`"If you go out onto the street, there's a store on the corner a short ways down."`
`"Then I'll be on my way.`
` ...You can use this to pay for food or whatever."`
`"...If I let you keep that money,`
` will you come again, read my next manuscript, and tell me your opinions...?"`
`"...You're willing to pay rolls of money to get an un-cute girl like me to read your manuscript?"`
`"No.`
` You really were a good, clear-thinking reader.`
` ...We create these tales and throw them out into the world in search of people like you."`
`"...You praise me too much.`
` I just take books a little too seriously."`
`"As thanks for the considerable time you have given to me,`
` ......I will someday write your tale."`
`"Am I going to appear in one of your Forgeries again?`
` ...I hope you kill me in a slightly better way this time."`
`"...Do you...like miracles?"`
`"You mean like a deus ex machina plot development?`
` ...I used to hate them, but recently I've become a big fan.`
` Still, I've become a bit of a picky eater, and simply falling from a skyscraper and ending up unharmed doesn't quite qualify as a miracle to me anymore."`
`"......Then perhaps one day, I will write a tale that you will consider a miracle..."`
`"I'm...really sorry for barging in all of a sudden and saying all kinds of mean things."`
`"...No, it was a worthwhile conversation.`
` ...I wonder if my head editor will set up another meeting between the two of us..."`
`"Sure, if there's another chance for one.`
` <See you again, have a nice day>."`
`"Yes, it may happen again sometime.`
` ...I pray that you find your truth."`
`"Thank you."`
`"If you ever do reach a truth of your own,`
` ...please try making that a tale as well someday..."`
`"......You want me to become one of you witches?`
` I wonder.`
` I'm bad at writing.`
` A good reader isn't necessarily a good writer, you know?"`
`"Ah, quite true.`
` I myself can never read anything written by anyone else."`
`"...Sheesh.`
` Then, I'm off."`
`"After this, I will probably never see you again,`
` ...but I pray I will be fortunate enough to meet another you someday, ...somewhere."`
`"......`
`Can I ask one last question?"`
`"Go ahead..."`
`"......That Featherine witch, who appeared within the tale.`
` ...That's...you, right?"`
`"It may be presumptuous to say it, but that was my intention."`
`".........`
`...This might be a strange question, but...umm...`
` ......Are you Featherine?`
` Or is Featherine you?"`
`"...Well now.`
` ...What might you be talking about...?"`
`That mysterious woman was mysterious to the last.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`......And so, the day of which I had no ~ib~memories~ib~ ended, and on the following day, I would take a boat to Niijima.`
`I'll probably never meet her again.`
`However, that just means that 'I' won't meet her, ...so some other 'me' might meet her somewhere down the road.`
`...Just as 'I' have reached several truths, they must also...want to reach the truth.`
`So long, Featherine.`
`...If you ever write a decent story, please call me again.`
` If I'm free, I might drop by...`
`"No problem.`
` It's the most luxurious escort job I've had yet.`
` ...I'd almost like to invite you along, sir."`
`"...I'll take a pass on that.`
` You know how old I am.`
` I'm done running around all over the place..."`
`The person on the other end of the line...was Okonogi.`
`...Okonogi was also a man who tended to move from place to place, so it hadn't been easy to catch him even on the phone.`
`"Our trip's been pretty <cool>, and right now, there's no need to run around."`
`"Sumadera Kasumi is searching for you like mad.`
` ...According to our informants, she's already gotten a ride to Rokkenjima.`
` You'll bump into her there."`
`"So, just as planned."`
`"...It'll likely be just five or six people at most.`
` And they'll probably be armed with nothing more than handguns.`
` They're no match for you.`
` Feel free to run wild.`
` But make sure you kill them.`
` ...Were you able to aquire one of your favorite toys?"`
`"Of course.`
` I'm surprised you managed to arrange for it in this country."`
`Behind Amakusa was the rental car that they'd borrowed under a false name,`
` ...inside of which was now a black golf bag.`
`"The Sumadera Head Family has already given the okay, but make sure you get out of Japan as soon as you're done.`
` Don't forget to buy your cup ramen by the box in Narita before your flight out."`
`"Heheheh, I'll take care this time.`
` ...It's an easy job."`
`"Also, ......you do understand about 'that', right?"`
`"That...?`
` ...Well, I'm not sure what you mean."`
`"...Playing dumb, are we?`
` ...Well, that's okay.`
` Despite how you talk, you've never betrayed my expectations in the past.`
` ...If you're clever about it, you won't even have to get your hands dirty.`
` ...There should be plenty of ways to handle it."`
`"......`
`...Heheh, I'm not sure what you're talking about."`
`"...I realize that Ange-chan is a child to be pitied.`
` ...If only she could've stayed true to that and acted the part of a secluded young lady.`
` ...When we decided to join forces after Eva-san's death, we reached an agreement.`
` ...This little portable shrine of ours is important, ...but she's also a liability.`
` This is for the sake of world peace as well, okay?"`
`"......So, watch and see how it goes.`
` I hope those Sumadera black-suits know how to shoot a gun right."`
`"............"`
`"Hmm?`
` What is it, sir?"`
`"...Don't tell me that, after a few days on the run,`
` you and Ange-chan have already hooked up...?"`
`"Hah.`
` ...Me and that bratty little girl? ...Please."`
`"Well, it's not like I care...`
` It just means you've finally managed to break free enough that you can take passes at girls, right?`
` ...Half of the world is made up of women.`
` You'll never last if just one or two of them make you freeze up."`
`".........`
`...Oh, speak of the devil.`
` She's here.`
` ......Guess that's all for today.`
` I'll contact you after I reach our lodgings on Niijima.`
` Later."`
`Ange was walking down the street.`
`Why'd she have to do that, when I told her to wait for me to come back?`
`...If only she wasn't like this, she might've lived a long life.`
`"...That was a pretty long call.`
` I was so tired of waiting that I left."`
`"Heheh. Sorry about that.`
` ...How was it for you, Lady?`
` Did you learn anything interesting...?"`
`"It was interesting.`
` ......I've harvested all I need."`
`"Hyahha...!`
` Sounds <cool>."`
`After Amakusa opened the passenger's side door, Ange got in the car.`
`Amakusa quickly went around to the driver's seat.`
`"......Then let's head to the harbor.`
` According to the old man, the Sumadera family has set up a net."`
`"......If we do get caught, then that's the measure of my luck.`
` ...If we don't, ...then Rokkenjima is waiting for me.`
` ...Let's leave it all to luck."`
`"...Luck, is it?"`
`"When you can't decide what to do,`
` or when it doesn't matter either way,`
` ...it's not so bad to entrust your fate to a coin toss."`
`"Heheh.`
` Then I guess I'll try leaving it to luck too.`
` ......I've gotta admit, I'm a fan of that kind of thing."`
`"...Great, my bodyguard just said he's gonna leave everything to luck.`
` Wonderful."`
`"I had to leave for that phone call, so I totally missed the clincher.`
` What happened after I left? Let's hear it."`
`"No. I'm not telling."`
`"That's a shame."`
`The car dashed through the hilly town...`
`That car wouldn't return to Hachijo's house for all eternity.`
`However, Ange didn't get sentimental about it.`
`For now, ...she just wanted to silently consider the new message bottle that the current Endless Witch, Hachijo Tohya,`
` had given her...`
`In the rear-view mirror, the town where a witch lived faded off into the distance.`
`However, that scene wasn't reflected in Ange's eyes...`
`"......Lambda, ...where are you...?"`
`Just having to say that felt like admitting defeat, ...and I didn't like it.`
`Why is it that she's always so obnoxious and clingy when I don't need her,`
` ...and then won't answer when I call her name?`
`Where...am I...?`
`Annoyed by the completely predictable ending, I'd left the cathedral.`
`...I'd planned on finding some terrace with a cool night's breeze to kill time on until the end of that farcical reception.`
`"...It's true that I tried to find somewhere desolate so that I wouldn't have to look at people,`
` ...but this is a bit ridiculous."`
`I, the great Bernkastel, ...am lost?`
`A miracle like that certainly wouldn't happen.`
`Yes, ...miracles don't exist in this world.`
`To create a miracle, you need 'an amount of time that can never be reached', a period that's no different from infinity.`
`So, when something that appears to be a miracle happens in a shorter span of time than that,`
` ...it is not a miracle,`
` but the product of someone's...design.`
`"In other words, ...the reason I'm walking down this corridor...`
`is because someone's design has forced me here...`
`"...Who?`
` Who would have pulled such a complicated prank on me?`
` ......It looks like you're quite the shy one,`
` ...calling me out to a desolate place like this."`
`...Then, ...from the other end of the dark corridor, ...I heard a sound.`
`*patter*, *patter*patter*patter*...`
`It sounded as though some small animal, like a dog or a cat, was walking at a quick pace.`
`No miracle could cause a dog or cat to be in a place like this.`
`Such a miracle would not be 'allowed'.`
`Since it isn't a miracle,`
` that means I'm being guided in that direction.`
`...Very well.`
` This might be some new theme to keep me entertained.`
`If this is some new joke of Lambda's, I'll cover her whole body with honey using my tongue as a reward.`
`...And then, I'll stick parasol chocolates into her eyes and tell her to never do it again.`
`In the direction the noise had come from, ...it was not only dim, but shrouded in complete darkness.`
`However, ...I could sense something in that darkness.`
`...There were two emerald green glints, ...probably cat eyes.`
` The eyes of a black cat that peered through the darkness.`
`"Are you the one who called me here...?`
` ......Or...are you just the messenger...? ........."`
`When I looked at my feet, ...I saw red cat footprints leading towards those cat eyes.`
`...The marks were unsettling, ...as though the cat had run through a pool of blood.`
`When my eyes adjusted to the darkness, ......then even with the lack of light, I was vaguely able to make out these red footprints.`
`...They weren't actually glowing or anything,`
` ...but they served perfectly well as a signpost leading me onwards.`
`*patter*patter*patter*patter*...`
`As though it was telling me to follow,`
` ...the cat turned around and dashed off into the darkness.`
`......What is it?`
`...Something feels...very strange.`
`It's a feeling I haven't felt since I began calling myself the cruelest witch in the world.`
`...I can't quite remember what this feeling is.`
`Still, ...for one as tired of boredom as me, it's surely more fun this way.`
`I followed the bloody footprints of the cat, which would sometimes stop and look back at me,`
` ...and walked on and on through the dark corridor...`
`Forward, ......turn,`
` ...head down what appeared to be stairs from time to time.`
`And then, ...though I couldn't really tell because of the darkness, ...it went in through the crack of a door.`
`"......Here...?"`
`I pushed the door open slowly, ...but it was dark on the inside, just like the corridor.`
`However, the air and the slight change in the echos made by the footsteps...`
`told me that this was a room, not a corridor.`
`The sounds of the cat's footsteps were gone.`
`...However, the bloody footprints remained.`
`On the other side of some sort of wooden screen, ...under what looked like a small spotlight...`
`...There was that same black cat gobbling down some bloodstained pet food.`
`...I see.`
` So, this is its reward for bringing me here...`
`"Cat...`
` Sorry to bother you during your meal, `
`...but I'd like you to summon your master.`
` ......That is, unless you're actually the one who summoned me...?"`
`Talking to it didn't cause it to turn around.`
`...Well, I guess it is an animal eating its food.`
` ...If I kick it away, it'll probably run off to its owner.`
`"......Hmph."`
`When I did kick the cat,`
` ...it sailed away like a stuffed animal,`
` hit the wall, and fell to the ground.`
`Then, it vanished, melting into the darkness...`
`...What's with this cat?`
` ...Is it just an illusion...?`
`".........!"`
`When I looked at its food plate, ...it was piled up with what appeared to be blood-drenched raw meat.`
`...It was as though someone had torn apart living flesh on the spot and piled it up on there.`
`"...Come on, what's with the creepy reception?"`
`——That was a mean thing to do, kicking it.`
`The instant I heard that voice, the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end.`
`Then, ...the surrounding area finally brightened...`
`However, Bernkastel had already guessed where this was before it grew bright...`
`"......That was you, was it not?`
` ...That cat."`
`"............"`
`"...A cat who has learned how to eat meat...and that it can sometimes choose its own path.`
` ...It has been a long time..."`
`"It's a path I might never have had to know about if you hadn't told me.`
` ...You're the monster who taught me the taste of flesh.`
` ...So, you've come back to life,`
` ......Featherine Auaurora..."`
`"...Augustus Aurora...`
` You never learn, no matter how often I tell you that...`
` ...Very well.`
` Even that brings back fond memories...`
` I have heard the rumors...`
` ......It seems you have taken the name Bernkastel, Witch of Miracles, ...and have been playing a far from praiseworthy Fragment game..."`
`"I'm just imitating you.`
` Though I could hardly match up to your level.`
` ...If the rumors you've heard about me are bad, that applies a hundredfold to you."`
`Bernkastel sat unreservedly in an antique chair,`
` ...as though she was already familiar with the place.`
`"......What are you afraid of?`
` I am merely celebrating my reunion with my longest-serving miko so far...`
` Did you really find my messenger cat so displeasing?"`
`Bernkastel's manner seemed completely relaxed...`
`However, Featherine admonished her, telling her not to be afraid.`
`...And, judging by the expression that had risen to Bern's face,`
` ...Featherine had been right on the mark...`
`"Did you really have to make such blunt insinuations against me?`
` ...A cat leaving behind bloody footprints and stuffing its face with bloodstained meat..."`
`"............`
`...Have no fear.`
` ...Look closely.`
` ...Do you see any cat stuffing its face with meat...?`
` I just gave it a plate of biscuits as a reward for going to get you..."`
`"............"`
`......It was as though soot covering the plate at her feet was blown away, even though there was no wind.`
`...There lay an adorable...and perfectly normal...cat dish,`
` ...with a pile of small biscuits on top of it...`
`"......Tch..."`
`Bernkastel didn't even hide her displeased grimace.`
`Featherine shrugged and muttered 'you haven't changed, child of man' as she rocked her rocking chair.`
`"......I see you're as unpleasant as ever.`
` ...But I'm happy now.`
` Imitating you really has been far from boring."`
`"...Scold me as you please.`
` It is the parting gift I gave you when we last met."`
`"You liked rude mikos because they kept you entertained, right...?`
` Tch, ridiculous.`
` ...If talking will only please you, I'll shut up.`
` ...So, ...what do you want with me...?"`
`"It seems Beatrice's game has ended with Battler's victory.`
` ...I observed it.`
` It was quite entertaining."`
`"...I'm sure you liked seeing me fail miserably."`
`"Nonsense, it was a splendid performance...`
` ...I'm sure Beato is very grateful to you."`
`"......Hmph.`
` ...And?`
` If you want me to read the Fragments of Beato's game aloud for you, I refuse.`
` I'm not your miko anymore."`
`"I have observed all of Beato's games.`
` ...I also watched Lambdadelta's game and Battler's game with great interest.`
` ...I believe I have formed an answer for all the riddles in my own way.`
` ......The culprit.`
` The motive.`
` The individual tricks.`
` ...I'm not yet clear about the very last part of the epitaph's riddle,`
` but I have enough of a theory that if I actually went to Rokkenjima and investigated, I should be able to resolve that part as well."`
`"......And...?"`
`"Of course, since there is no single truth, my theory is probably only one of many possibilities.`
` ...However, that is only a question of possibilities, a trivial problem."`
`"...What are you up to?`
` ......Do you want to debate Beato's game with me?"`
`"Wrong.`
` ......What I want is to look at the answers, child of man."`
`Those words of Featherine's made Bernkastel straighten up.`
`...Her old master did not fail to notice that small reaction.`
`"So far, you have spiced up this tale as an actor.`
` In doing that, you have probably come to know many truths.`
` ...However, even you are unaware of the truth behind several riddles that Beato has cleverly kept hidden, correct...?"`
`"......`
`......I see...`
` ...You want to use me to chew apart and string out the guts of something again."`
`"After watching a play, reading the pamphlet and learning what goes on behind the scenes is similar to, as you would say it,`
` enjoying some black tea after a meal.`
` ...That enjoyment cannot be left undone."`
`"You like to play with them and love them while they're alive, then eat their flesh when they die.`
` ...So, cats are doubly useful to you.`
` ......Just die, monster."`
`"I want...to look at the answers.`
` ......I'm sure you want to know them."`
`"............"`
`"Think of it as a burial for Beato's corpse, where you are in charge of the service.`
` ...What do you say to that, child of man?"`
`"...Now, you're starting to speak my language."`
`When Featherine snapped her fingers,`
` a thin spotlight appeared on the table, which was covered with cluttered books.`
`There...lay a folded version of the game board for Beato's game.`
`The Witch of Theatergoing spun her finger in a circle, and the game board opened up by itself,`
` showing the black and white pieces lined up inside it.`
`"......The game board and all the pieces are gathered here.`
` ...The records for the previous games are all present as well.`
`With a rustling sound, the book flipped through all its pages of its own accord, front to back, `
`shut itself, and flew to the side of the game board, where it waited.`
` Inside it, all of the movements of the pieces during previous games were recorded...`
`"......I see.`
` So you were short a player and a commentator..."`
`"We're also short on black tea.`
` ...Similarly with dried plums.`
` Of course, I will find some."`
`"......`
`...Okay.`
` If you add on some mustard rice cakes, then we have a deal."`
`"The negotiations are concluded."`
`"I have one condition."`
`"Oh, and what is that?"`
`"I'm going to be the Reader, okay...?`
` ......I have no love, so a few things might be interpreted in an odd way.`
` ...However, the Reader is free to read things in a manner and with an intonation of her choosing."`
`"I only want to check the answers.`
` ...I don't particularly care about the tale itself.`
` ...I'm not deeply interested in what sort of tale you'll create.`
` ......Ah, yes.`
` Now I see what you're after."`
`"......Will you accept that condition?"`
`"Very well...`
` I want to know the answer. You have your grudge to worry about.`
` The negotiations are concluded."`
`When Featherine snapped her fingers once more,`
` ...a large chair appeared, as though beckoning Bernkastel to sit there.`
`It was...a throne, horribly mismatched with the furnishings of this room.`
`Wait, I've seen this before.`
` ......This is-`
`"I acknowledge it. You may sit.`
` You are the Game Master."`
`"......Are you sure?`
` ...Are you really...sure...?"`
`"You can create whatever sort of tale you like to satisfy your grudge.`
` I am not interested.`
` However, I have one condition as well.`
` ...Answer all of the questions I ask.`
` Absolutely no keeping secrets, hiding or dodging the issues."`
`"Heh, ...heheheheheheheheheh...!`
` Leave it to me.`
` Tearing up guts and dragging them out is my specialty.`
` ...After all, you trained me."`
`"Let us make some black tea.`
` ...We'll use our own hands, not magic.`
` ...Let the master treat her miko to some tea..."`
`"The old Beato told me that witches are the best ones to have black tea with."`
`"It seems that rule doesn't apply to us...`
` ...Heh, ...heheheheheheheheheheheheheheheh."`
`...At some point, ...that dish piled with biscuits...`
`had once again been covered with a mountain of torn-apart meat and a splatter of red.`
` No, not just meat, ...even the bowels...`
`"...Black tea is best enjoyed-"`
`""With your fellow monsters.""`
`"......In that case, let's get the pieces ready.`
` If we keep up the count, this'll be game 7, right?"`
`"Indeed.`
` A fortuitous number."`
`"But not for Beato, right?"`
`Bernkastel...slowly picked up a black piece.`
`It was...the piece that represented Beatrice.`
`It was sometimes a king, sometimes a queen, and could become a knight.`
`...However, that was only if it got promoted.`
`Until then, it was only a trash piece, like a pawn.`
`First comes the placing of the pieces.`
`By this point, the witch's game has already begun.`
`Bernkastel took Beato's piece...`
`and raised it high.`
`"First move, placement.`
` Beatrice on d8."`
`......When I came to, all was silent.`
`The room was dimly lit.`
` And yet...it was massive.`
`...Where on earth...is this...?`
`I was sitting in what seemed to be a very short sofa.`
`It was very constricting, and looked like there were several more of them off to each side of me...`
`Once I noticed that, I realized that I was in a theater.`
`"...Where on earth...am I...?"`
`I don't know how long I've been here.`
`And, more importantly, I don't know where this is.`
`...Beatrice's funeral ended, `
`everyone went back to the mansion, and...`
`...And after that, my memory gets fuzzy, and I can't recall anything else.`
`Then, I was surprised to notice the presence of another person.`
`Apparently, I wasn't the only one sitting in the audience seating of this vast theater.`
`...The sound had come from a seat to the side of mine.`
`When I looked, I saw a girl sitting several seats off to my left.`
`It was a face I had never seen before.`
` ...Who is she?`
`She looked like a high-schooler or a college student, about the same age as I was.`
`"......Nnn..."`
`She groaned.`
`Apparently, she had just woken up...`
`I didn't want to scare her, so I decided to introduce myself first...`
`"...Hello."`
`".........!!"`
`Apparently, she was equally surprised to find someone other than herself here.`
`She jumped when she heard my greeting.`
`"...Who the hell are you?"`
`"I feel the same way.`
` ...It seems that neither of us is here of our own accord."`
`"......Is that...the One-Winged Crest...?"`
`"Huh?`
` ...Do you recognize this crest?"`
`She looked suspiciously at the One-Winged Crest emblazoned on my collar.`
`Her stare, which was unmoving but not openly hostile, wasn't exactly pleasant for me.`
`"Allow me to introduce myself first.`
` ...I am Ushiromiya Lion."`
`"Ushiromiya, ...huh?`
` What?"`
`"Lion.`
` Written as '睆御', but pronounced 'Lee-on'.`
` ...Pretty strange name, don't you think?"`
`"...No stranger than mine.`
` But I'll have to apologize.`
` I don't know who you are."`
`"That's hardly surprising, `
`since I don't know you either."`
`"That's not what I meant.`
` Who are you?`
` There's no one like you in the Ushiromiya family."`
`"And why are you so sure?`
` Do you have something to do with my family?"`
`"I'm a member of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"...But that's..."`
`She showed me her left sleeve...and the crest of the One-Winged Eagle emblazoned upon it.`
`"...I regret having to ask the same question, but who are you?`
` I've never seen you in the Ushiromiya family."`
`"......`
`...First they tear me into little bits, then they make me read...`
` ...What's next?`
` Which witch am I supposed to be entertaining this time?"`
`She spat out those words and seemed to be complaining about something.`
`"Ange.`
` ...I'm Ushiromiya Ange.`
` Rudolf and Kyrie's daughter."`
`"What?!`
` ...A-Ange-chan...?!`
` But you're supposed to be six years old..."`
`"......I was six during the year of the final family conference on Rokkenjima.`
` ...Now I get it.`
` So, you're a person from the year 1986.`
` I'm 18 years old.`
` And I'm from the year 1998."`
`"I-In other words, ...you're the Ange-chan...of 12 years in the future...?"`
`"I'm glad you believe it.`
` But, unfortunately, I don't have a clue who you are.`
` ...Who are you?`
` Who are your parents?"`
`"My father is Krauss.`
` Natsuhi is my mother."`
`"That would make you Jessica onee-chan."`
`"Jessica is my little sister."`
`"......`
`...What's going on?`
` Wasn't Jessica onee-chan an only child...?"`
`By this point, I was starting to figure out the situation this Ange had come from.`
`...She's probably from the world where I awakened as a witch, ...the world where Lion doesn't exist.`
`"It will be a bit difficult to explain, ...but think of it this way.`
` In a world slightly different from the one you know, I am also a member of the Ushiromiya family.`
` In your world, a different fate leads me to walk a different path through life, so that I do not live as an Ushiromiya family member."`
`"......Are you...a witch...?"`
`"Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm just an ordinary human.`
` ...What I just told you is something I heard from the witch called Bernkastel-san."`
`"......Bernkastel?`
` That one with the long, blue hair and the gloomy face...?"`
`"...Y-Yes.`
` That probably fits her, I think..."`
`"......In other words,`
` I've been forced to play along with another witch's farce.`
` ...Just where is this place?"`
`"I only woke up a second ago myself.`
` ...I'm wondering the same thing."`
`"It looks like a theater.`
` ...Are we supposed to watch a play or something?"`
`"...I'm really not in the mood now.`
` Let's look for an exit."`
`"......You haven't noticed yet?`
` Look."`
`"Huh?`
` ......Ah, these are..."`
`*clank*.`
`I finally noticed.`
` Both of my wrists and ankles had chains attached to them.`
`As long as I sat here, I had enough slack that I could move about a little, but it looked like there wouldn't be nearly enough for me to get out of this place.`
`"...When did...?`
` ...Who would do something like this...?"`
`"......Once a witch has made you her piece,`
` you'll be their plaything forever.`
` ...There's no way to escape."`
`Ange crossed her legs, making the chains clank together.`
`She realized that no amount of struggling could have broken those chains.`
` ...Getting panicky wouldn't accomplish anything.`
` She must've had nerves of steel.`
`"What do you mean, a witch's piece?"`
`"...It's like being their slave.`
` ...I made a deal, once.`
` ...I said I wanted to see my family, to bring them back from that day.`
` In exchange for making that a possibility, that witch turned me into a witch's piece.`
` ......At least the witch kept her promise.`
` I was able to see Onii-chan again."`
`"...You mean Battler-kun...?"`
`"Well, I wasn't even able to tell him who I was.`
` ...And, in exchange for that short bit of time, I'm now trapped inside the witches' toy box for all eternity.`
` ...Looks like you are too.`
` ...Did you make some sort of contract?"`
`"N-Nothing of the sort..."`
`"Did you ever ask a witch to grant a wish for you?"`
`"Never.`
` ......She taught me what a miracle my existence is.`
` That's all."`
`"...Either way, neither of us is getting out of here.`
` ...Okay, witches!`
` What kind of show do you have for us this time?!`
` Have we moved from reading aloud to theatergoing?`
` Am I supposed to watch someone else read aloud this time, or what?!`
` If that's it, then start it up already.`
` I'm bored enough as it is!"`
`Ange yelled this to the pitch-black stage.`
`Her voice reverberated throughout the theater, but no one gave an answer...`
`...No, someone did.`
` And that was also in a voice that rang out across the theater.`
`However, that voice sounded theatrical, as though someone was announcing the start of a play.`
`"What happened on that day, you ask?`
` I'm not telling.`
` If only you'd just give up and die!"`
`"...Whose voice was that...?"`
`"That old hag.`
` It was Aunt Eva's voice."`
`"What does she mean by 'what happened on that day'?"`
`"...She's talking about the 4th and 5th of October in the year 1986.`
` ...The day of the final family conference on Rokkenjima."`
`"In other words, ...today."`
`Today is October 4th, 1986.`
`As a prelude to the family conference, Beatrice's funeral was held...`
`"That's a surprise.`
` So, you've come here from October 4th, 1986?`
` Tell me.`
` What happened during those two days...?!"`
`The answer she seeks is inside the cat box.`
`All I can tell her about is my close call with a sad life.`
`However, I doubt that explanation will satisfy her.`
`Then, ...a pillar of bright light pierced the stage.`
`There stood a white shadow.`
`...That white dress was obviously Clair's.`
`Of course, Ange didn't recognize her.`
` She looked suspicious, apparently wondering who in the world this was.`
`However, even I felt as though something was wrong.`
`...Didn't she settle all of her regrets in that funeral a short while ago, before being sent off into the next world...?`
`She stood all alone in the narrow beam of light in the center of the stage, and the expression on her face was lifeless.`
`The light began to grow brighter and brighter.`
`It shone more and more fiercely on her, until it became blinding just to look at her.`
`The world was enveloped by a light so bright that we couldn't open our eyes,`
` surrounded by a sound like wind or television static, `
`...and our minds began to go blank...`
`"Whoo...!`
` They're bloomin' wonderfully again this year!"`
`"It must be a pain to take care of all these.`
` Pretty easy for us though, just looking at 'em."`
`"*giggle* I agree.`
` We've got to thank the people who take care of them for us."`
`"But it is a bit lacking in grace.`
` I prefer the way it used to be, before Nii-san decided to pile so much on."`
`"The old look did have its own charm, didn't it?"`
`"Uu-!`
` I love roses!`
` I'd like them even more if they didn't have thorns!`
` Uu-!"`
`"Whoa!`
` This rose garden really takes me back!`
` I'd totally forgotten about it these past six years...!"`
`"I guess it really has been that long.`
` Both you and this garden have changed so much."`
`"Ah, let me introduce you!`
` This is Kanon-kun, one of our servants!`
` This is the first time you've met Battler, right?"`
`"...Pleased to meet you."`
`"You can just call me Battler!`
` Nice to meet you!"`
`"Shannon's here too, today.`
` Remember when we used to play together?"`
`"Ah, ...Shannon-chan!`
` I'd totally forgotten... That really takes me back!`
` How's she been doing?!"`
`"She's grown more and more beautiful these past six years.`
` You should say hi to her later on."`
`"Shannon and George onii-chan are reeeally good friends! Uu-!"`
`"Maria, shhh!`
` That's a secret!"`
`"If you would, everyone, allow me to guide you to the guesthouse."`
`After enjoying the lovely welcome provided by the roses, the relatives followed Gohda in the direction of the guesthouse...`
`October 4th, 1986.`
`Rokkenjima.`
` In a world without Lion.`
`...On the day of the Ushiromiya family conference.`
`Maria read a mysterious letter aloud after dinner, just as she had been told to.`
`The writer of the letter claimed to be the Golden Witch Beatrice and challenged the family.`
`Try and solve the riddle of the epitaph.`
` Otherwise, I will take everything.`
`It was Beatrice's announcement of the game's start, the same as the usual games.`
`Had an unknown person appeared, related to the problem of the inheritance's distribution?`
`Where was the 20 billion yen worth of gold hidden?`
`What was the purpose of this letter? For what goal had it been written?`
`Who on earth is this Beatrice?`
`It was the usual dinner on October 4th, ...where several bits of suspicion and paranoia intertwined.`
`"George-kun,`
` I'm sorry, but could you go to the guesthouse with the others?`
` My apologies."`
`"...Shannon,`
` take the children to the guesthouse.`
` We will move straight on to the family conference."`
`"Y-Yes.`
` As you wish..."`
`"Beatrice, the Golden Witch...`
` What a fascinating letter you've sent us..."`
`"She's telling us to solve the epitaph...?`
` Ridiculous.`
` That gold belongs to us.`
` Why would we ever give it up to some outsider...?!"`
`"...If we could just find that gold, we'd all be happy.`
` No one would have to lose anything."`
`"Let's go, everyone.`
` They'll be having an adult conversation from here on out..."`
`"...Sheesh.`
` Sounds like it's gonna get complicated."`
`"Come on, Maria...`
` Let's go..."`
`"Beato's ceremony has begun...`
` Kihihihihihihi..."`
`"Okay, everyone, ...I shall guide you to the guesthouse..."`
`"...What's...all this about...?"`
`"Probably a replay of one of the old games, ...or else an entirely new game.`
` In all the games, October 4th happens in pretty much the same way."`
`"...A new game?`
` You mean, a tale that hasn't appeared in any of the Fragments so far?"`
`"There's no way they'd go to the trouble of chaining us down if they just wanted to show us a game we already know.`
` ...It's probably a new game.`
` That means there should be a Game Master.`
` ...Who is it?`
` ...That witch?`
` Bernkastel...?"`
`"I...can't imagine so.`
` ...Clair should have vanished already.`
` There should be no need to spin up a new tale..."`
`"Beato's game board was hijacked by those evil witches long ago.`
` Even Beato is nothing more than a piece in their games."`
`"...Just who is behind this, ...and what are they after?`
` What do they want to show us...?"`
`Before this tale began,`
` Clair definitely appeared on the stage.`
`She is the teller of the tale of Beatrice's game.`
` Beatrice, the 'me' from a world of a different fate.`
`However, didn't she entrust everything to Will, who solved all of the riddles?`
`There should be no need for her to make new riddles...`
`...In that case, is Bernkastel using this tale to test me...?`
`Along with Will, I have at least touched the deepest depths of this tale...and understood the culprit's heart.`
`So, even if an entirely new tale presents itself, I should be able to see through the riddles.`
`...Is that...what my role is...?`
`Is my role to teach Ange about the truth of this tale...?`
`"...Do you know?`
` ...Do you know the truth of this tale?"`
`"I have several theories.`
` Still, none of those can give a conclusive answer.`
` The truth is always inside the cat box.`
` I can't say anything for sure."`
`In this world, Ange is absent on this day.`
`So, it's only natural that she doesn't know what happened.`
`However, at the very least, I do know who the culprit is...and what they were trying to do on this day...`
`"...I think...`
`I've finally understood my role in this."`
`"What do you mean?"`
`"Apparently, you're here as a theatergoer, and I'm here as a commentator."`
`"Then as a commentator, what exactly is it you're going to explain for me?"`
`"After all, ......I know who's behind the crime that's about to occur."`
`"What did you say...?"`
`"Thinking about it straightforwardly,`
` ...the only explanation I see is that someone's trying to make us solve the epitaph, hoping to then snatch the gold for themselves."`
`"I agree.`
` If they'd already solved it, they could just take it.`
` There'd be no need to challenge us to solve the riddle."`
`"It's a prank by one of the servants.`
` They must be hoping to pick up the scraps from the celebration if the gold is found."`
`"I cannot imagine that any of our servants would do such a thing..."`
`"...Or, maybe one of us sent the letter, pretending to be a servant."`
`"If that's it, you're the most suspicious one.`
` You schooled Maria-chan on her part and made her read the letter, didn't you?"`
`"I-I wouldn't do that...!"`
`"Give that a rest, Eva.`
` We can't jump to conclusions.`
` Isn't this the time for us all to stick together?"`
`"That's right.`
` The aim of this strange letter is probably to disrupt our unity.`
` The more we let it affect us, the more things will go the way of this 'Beatrice' who sent it."`
`"Kyrie-san's right.`
` Wouldn't it be best to simply ignore a letter like that from the start?"`
`"That is what I have been saying this whole time.`
` This sort of prank is not worth considering!"`
`"Yes, that's it exactly.`
` If a couple improbable claims for damages get ya flustered, you'll never be able to sell anythin'!"`
`"My husband's right.`
` This is a child's prank, and taking it seriously is just a waste of time.`
` If someone really wanted to shake up the inheritance issue, they'd come forward boldly instead of using something this roundabout."`
`"You've got it right there.`
` Someone probably wants to make us think there's another person trying to make demands about the inheritance, when their real goal is just to pick up the scraps."`
`"...I wonder if they'll ask for some hush money in exchange for staying out of the inheritance issue."`
`"If that were the case, they should have written it into the letter."`
`"And the letter is just a challenge, telling us to try solving the epitaph or else hand over everything."`
`"The culprit is tryin' to make us solve the epitaph's riddle!`
` Nothin' more, nothin' less."`
`"So, it's simple.`
` If we worry about this letter, we lose."`
`"Indeed, I agree.`
` ...After that big mysterious show, like something out of a mystery novel, we've all gotten a bit too wrapped up in this.`
` ...Hahahaha.`
` It seems we're all taking this too seriously."`
`"But who did it?`
` ...Such an aggravating thing to do."`
`"If it wasn't a servant, then one of us must have written it.`
` I'm not naming names, of course."`
`"St-Stop it.`
` I really know nothing about this...!"`
`"Settle down.`
` Anyway, what this letter says does make a bit of sense.`
` ...All of us need money.`
` And, if possible, we need it right away.`
` No one here has any objections to that, right...?"`
`"...Of course not.`
` Whether it's money or love, you can never have too much."`
`"We don't know when Father's inheritance will come to us.`
` ...However, the gold of the epitaph is different.`
` If we find it, we could just split it then and there."`
`"In a sense,`
` it's even closer to us now than the inheritance is."`
`"Assuming we can solve the epitaph..."`
`"...Everyone here has tried solving it on their own, yes?"`
`Kyrie asked the room at large, and everyone wordlessly nodded back.`
`"Here, we have four people who have inherited the blood of the one who made that riddle, ...and each has tried solving it on their own.`
` That doesn't sound very efficient, does it?"`
`"...True.`
` We've all been greedy and tried to go it alone.`
` ...However,`
` we've already reached a decision about how we'll split the gold up if it's found.`
` And about acknowledging Aniki as the Successor."`
`"Though you demanded quite a lot in exchange."`
`"...I wonder if we can solve that epitaph...if we pool our efforts and work together..."`
`"Two heads are better than one.`
` And here, we have seven."`
`"Today, we reached a general agreement about the inheritance problem.`
` ...Why not take a shot at the epitaph for a bit of fun on the side?"`
`"Nice idea.`
` Let's give it a try and call it a break."`
`"...Ridiculous.`
` Of course there's no hidden gold..."`
`"Take it easy.`
` Just think of it as a game.`
` Let's have Gohda-san bring us something cool to drink.`
` We can take a break and all play with riddles as a big, happy bunch of siblings for once."`
`"Hmmm.`
` Well, the night is long.`
` It would at least be more productive than pointless inquiries into Father's health."`
`"I'll ring up Gohda-san.`
` He can bring us something."`
`"Let's have tea and sweets.`
` ...Oh, and a map of Taiwan."`
`Two shadows could be seen in the rose garden arbor.`
`...It was George and Shannon's secret meeting.`
`"I want you to take this ring."`
`"...G-George-sama..."`
`"I swear to love you all my life.`
` ...Not just now, while we're young.`
` I swear to love you and keep you happy until we get old and go to our graves."`
`"...And are there any lies or exaggerations in your words?"`
`"No, not one.`
` I'm confident in my resolve to love you and build a happy household together with you."`
`"And what would this happy household be like?"`
`"Well,`
` it will be full of happiness.`
` We'll have a house, with a car and a yard.`
` And one dog.`
` The yard will have a vegetable garden.`
` The kids will run around, and we'll smile down on them from the balcony.`
` That's what our typical future Sunday will look like."`
`"That...would be wonderful..."`
`"Whaaaat?!!`
` Those two're going out?!"`
`"Shhh!`
` Why are you so damn loud?!`
` Maria'll wake up...!"`
`"I-I see.`
` So that's how it is...`
` Now that you mention it, they seemed to have a pretty good mood going on there.`
` ...That's right, we're about the age where you fall in love."`
`"We've changed a lot in the last six years.`
` George nii-san used to be a bit unreliable, but he isn't anymore."`
`"That's what I thought.`
` George-aniki's got that 'air of dignity' thing going."`
`...But still, Shannon-chan and George-aniki.`
` That's a bit unexpected.`
`They played together often enough six years ago, but I didn't think they were that close.`
`"...Well, six years is a long time."`
`"These six years have been huge for all of us."`
`"Yep.`
` ...A lot's happened to me these six years, and to be honest, I've forgotten almost everything about Rokkenjima."`
`"And I'd forgotten almost everything about you too."`
`"Now that really hurts, ihihi!"`
`Talking together like this, it felt as though we'd been teleported six years into the past.`
`Six long years, so long that I forgot almost everything.`
`And yet, it's coming back to me, bit by bit.`
`......Shannon-chan.`
`Six years ago, you were part of our group, and we played together a lot, didn't we...`
`Back then, I think I might've...liked Shannon-chan.`
`That was the age when we were all overly self-conscious, in love with love.`
`Bittersweet memories of jokes involving melodramatic, flippant words.`
`"...That takes me back.`
` I think I remember saying all kinds of stuff that I'd be way too embarrassed to say now.`
` Gyaaah, just remembering it is making my face go red!"`
`"Hihihi.`
` Shannon might be a scatterbrain, but her memory's incredible.`
` Guess I'll just have to ask her all about your dark, embarrassing history."`
`"Qu-Quit it.`
` That was six years ago, the statute of limitations has gotta be up...!"`
`...I see.`
` So, Shannon-chan is going out with George-aniki.`
`.........`
`What am I thinking?`
` Could this be...jealousy?`
`I didn't really think about it until now, ...but that thing Shannon-chan and I had back then...was probably my first love.`
`Well, it's not like I have any right to be jealous, after forgetting the whole thing until we met again.`
`"Everyone knows that Dad's hometown was Taishou in Taiwan."`
`"He still chews areca nuts from time to time in memory of that place.`
` Apparently, he got hooked on that instead of smoking when he was young."`
`"...But there must be several rivers there with sweetfish swimming in them."`
`"It has several mountain streams that are famous sweetfish fishing spots.`
` ...Anyway, you could probably find sweetfish living anywhere the water was clean.`
` We're completely stuck."`
`"Maybe it was just some nearby creek Father played in as a kid.`
` He said sweetfish, but maybe we're lookin' for somethin' more like carp."`
`"...Or, it could be some sort of metaphor.`
` The river isn't necessarily a river with water flowing through it."`
`"What do you mean by that...?"`
`"Well now...`
` ...Who knows?"`
`"Kyrie has a point there.`
` Isn't it a bit too early to be sure that Taiwan is this homeland, or that this sweetfish river is a river with water flowing down it?"`
`"If we look at it that way, we're just stuck again.`
` The more you think about this riddle, the harder it gets."`
`"...That's it.`
` This is just a riddle.`
` ...Kyrie-san is right.`
` We need to be flexible in our thinking..."`
`"If we're looking for a river near Taishou, ...that would have to be Danshui River..."`
`"Are you even listening?!`
` We just said that it might not be the kind of river with water flowing down it!`
` Is there any proof that this river is a sweetfish river?!"`
`"Y-You're right... I-I'm sorry..."`
`"...Well, it probably did have sweetfish in it.`
` After all, 'danshui' does mean freshwater.`
` Makes sense that a freshwater fish like sweetfish would be swimming in it."`
`"Sweetfish are freshwater fish.`
` So, a sweetfish river would be a freshwater river.`
` ...Is that how we get Danshui River?`
` Hahahaha, quite the word game."`
`"Now that's an interesting theory.`
` ...Let's advance our reasoning a bit further.`
` As you travel down the river, you will see a village.`
` ...What's the name of the town at the mouth of Danshui River?"`
`"......It says 'Danshui' here."`
`"I went sightseeing in Danshui.`
` It was a calm and gentle harbor town.`
` Beautiful sunsets."`
`"Did you find 'the shore the two will tell you of'?"`
`"...Not really.`
` It doesn't ring any bells."`
`"I guess the beloved hometown wasn't in Taiwan.`
` It might have been Odawara after all."`
`"If we can't discount any possibilities, ...then we won't get anywhere.`
` We can't even get past the first line of the epitaph."`
`"Quiet, you're distracting me!`
` ...It has to be Taiwan.`
` Father wouldn't describe any other place as 'beloved'!"`
`"...That is one thing we can agree upon.`
` To this very day, Taiwan is the homeland of Father's heart."`
`"It's probably best if we don't spend too much time on the first line.`
` I'm going to take a look at the others.`
` ...Just a quick peek, starting at the first twilight."`
`"...Me too.`
` I'll leave the sweetfish river to you, Aneki, and have a go at the second half."`
`"On the first twilight, offer the six chosen by the key as sacrifices...`
` How mysterious."`
`"...I-I've got it."`
`Eva suddenly muttered.`
`All of the others spun around to look at her.`
`Eva was flipping through the pages about Taiwan with incredible force,`
` then found the page she was looking for and slammed the book open so hard that it almost tore.`
`This whole time, the book had been opened to the page with place names.`
`As far as the overall mass of information went, this seemed the most useful page to start from.`
`However, the page Eva opened to was very limited in the scope of its information.`
`It was...a map of railway lines.`
`"...As you travel down the river, ...there's a village, ...a village.`
` ......!!`
` There it is, the village!"`
`"...Wh-What are you talking about, Eva?`
` Explain yourself."`
`"Quiet!!`
` There's a shore too, and a mouth...!`
` I'm not sure what it means by 'the two', ...but there definitely is a village and a shore and a mouth...!!`
` This has to be it... This is definitely the village where the key to the gold sleeps...!!"`
`"C-Calm down...!`
` Explain it so we can understand too!"`
`"...The Danshui Line?`
` ...I see.`
` So, the sweetfish river was actually a railroad called the Danshui Line?"`
`"Well, I doubt there are any sweetfish swimming there..."`
`"Look!!`
` If we follow the Danshui Line down, there's a station that used to be known as Kirigan!`
` Look at the characters it's written in!!`
` There's a village (里), a mouth (坣), and a shore (岸)!!"`
`"Sh-She's right...!`
` There's a village, mouth, and shore...!!"`
`"......As you travel down the river, you will see a village.`
` ...True, that's the only station on the Danshui Line that has the character for village in its name."`
`"I see, it's like a code pointing towards this station's name..."`
`"This has to be it! There's no doubt...!!`
` We just need to look a bit further, and we'll definitely find out what 'the two who speak' means...!!`
` ...L-Look!!`
` This is it! This is it!"`
`"The region around the station has the same name, except with a mouth in the second character.`
` ...That makes a total of two mouths in Kirigan.`
` Are those 'the two who speak'?"`
`"...I-Incredible, Nee-san.`
` This has to be it..."`
`"Does this mean that the key is hidden somewhere in this town of Kirigan...?"`
`"I wonder.`
` ...The whole riddle so far has been a word game.`
` If so, isn't it likely that the sleeping key is also a word game?"`
`"I agree.`
` On the first twilight, the key selects six sacrifices, right?`
` So, it's hard to imagine that it's actually something key-shaped...!"`
`"...Whoo.`
` ...This is getting...damn interesting..."`
`"Offer up the six chosen by the key.`
` ...Let's think of a key that's somehow related to this!`
` And let's break down this name, 'Kirigan'!`
` I'm absolutely sure that this is a word game!`
` It has to be...!!`
` Think, everyone!!"`
`"That's interesting.`
` ...Though this rain would get me down if I were alone, it feels nice and cool when you're by my side."`
`"...It's about time for us to head back.`
` I'm keeping Kanon-kun waiting."`
`"You're right.`
` And I've probably kept Jessica-chan and Battler-kun waiting."`
`"It brings back good memories.`
` Remember when the four of us used to play together?`
` ...It was a lot of fun back then too."`
`"To me, it's a lot more fun now.`
` Because I get you all to myself."`
`"*giggle*`
` ...Oh, George-sama."`
`They laughed at George's melodramatic line.`
`However, George's laugh seemed just slightly forced.`
`"...George-sama?"`
`"Hmm?`
` ...Oh, I'm sorry.`
` ......Well,`
` I guess I still have a bit of an inferiority complex when it comes to Battler-kun."`
`"An...inferiority complex?"`
`"Like Uncle Rudolf, he's lively, interesting, and just full of energy.`
` He's much more attractive than I am.`
` ...I can tell how much he outshines me when we're together."`
`"That's not true.`
` You're very accomplished and attractive.`
` You aren't worse than Battler-sama in any way."`
`"...Really?"`
`"Yes.`
` Really."`
`"The truth is...`
` ...When I first heard that Battler-kun would be coming back this year, ...I wasn't happy about it."`
`"Why not...?"`
`"...Six years ago,`
` ...Battler-kun was the one who was really close to you.`
` I wanted to get closer to you, but I just couldn't manage to get between the two of you.`
` ...You two just looked so good together that I could do nothing but watch on longingly."`
`"Is that how it was...?`
` Wasn't it just Battler-sama making fun of me one-sidedly..."`
`"...Of course you looked incredibly good together.`
` There's no doubt about that.`
` ...I was sure that you two were going out."`
`"That never happened.`
` You're overthinking it..."`
`"......I really am pathetic.`
` I was afraid that when I handed you this ring today, you'd refuse."`
`"Why is that?`
` ...Why should I refuse your ring, George-san?"`
`"Because...Battler-kun came back.`
` I was afraid that you might like Battler-kun even now...`
`...and that, now that he's here, you wouldn't have any use for me."`
`"......George-san?`
` Please, look at this.`
` You see this silver glint on my ring finger?`
` What do you think that is?"`
`"...You're right.`
` Sorry.`
` What's got me so shaken, I wonder.`
` ...I'm probably still jealous of him, now that he's gotten even cooler these past six years.`
` ...How pathetic."`
`"No, it's okay.`
` Those feelings are a sign that your love for me is so strong, you don't want to give me up to anyone.`
` ...If you're worried about my feelings switching to Battler-sama,`
` just love me all the stronger so that such a thing would be unthinkable.`
` ...Love me so much that I don't have time to think about other men."`
`"I'm scared too.`
` I'm sure you'll meet many women in the future who are much more attractive than me.`
` Or, you might tire of me when I don't match up to your expectations.`
` It scares me to think that I might not be able to grasp hold of your feelings for the rest of my life."`
`"There's no need for you to be scared of that.`
` I swear to love you all my life."`
`"But even though I swore the same thing, you're having trouble believing it just because Battler-sama came back."`
`As Shannon giggled, `
`George finally realized that his own lack of confidence had hurt her...`
`"...I've fallen for a wonderful man named Ushiromiya George-san.`
` And this is a man who has sworn to love me all his life, and who has given me a ring as a sign of this oath.`
` With this ring here on my ring finger, I can give an honest confession."`
`"Sure."`
`"Yes, as you said,`
` ...I did like Battler-sama six years ago.`
` I think I probably liked him more than you."`
`"However, `
`that was six years ago.`
` Now, things are different.`
` In these six years, I've sorted out my feelings for Battler-sama, and cut myself off from them along with the memories of the past.`
` Now, I exist only to love you."`
`Shannon spoke clearly and strongly...`
`George gave a single, uncertain laugh.`
` It was probably the same sort of laugh the George of six years ago had made.`
`Then, he stretched resolutely and hugged Shannon without saying a word.`
` In that moment, he said goodbye to the person he had been six years ago...`
`"I've got the ladder...!`
` Here we go!"`
`"<Quadrillion>.`
` ...This is the only place you'll find that number written on this island."`
`"One tenth of ten quadrillion...`
` How suspicious."`
`"If our idea is right, there should be some sort of device embedded in that relief."`
`"We just need to check.`
` Who's going up?"`
`"I'll go.`
` Hold that ladder down, okay?"`
`"Be careful.`
` It is fairly high up..."`
`Rudolf climbed up the propped-up ladder.`
` Step by step, as the rain poured down on him...`
`"Look at the 'q'.`
` See anything?`
` Some sort of device?"`
`"Nnn...`
` Ladder's a bit shaky.`
` ...Hmm?`
` Oh boy..."`
`"What is it?!`
` Did something happen?!"`
`"...Heheh...`
` Bingo.`
` Take a look at this."`
`Rudolf tossed the 'q' down.`
`It hit Krauss on the shoulder and landed in a puddle.`
`"This is...the key!"`
`"What does it mean?!`
` Rudolf-kun,`
` don't tell me you can take out the other letters too?!"`
`"...Yeah, looks like it.`
` Guess our crazy theories weren't far off after all!`
` What's the next letter to take out?!"`
`"U-Ummm, 'i'!`
` And then 'l'!"`
`Following her instructions, Rudolf removed the six letters of the first twilight...`
`Now that they'd gotten this far, ...nothing stood in the way of them solving the riddle.`
`By trial and error, ...they finally reached the final stage.`
`"It says to gouge starting from the head, which must mean going from left to right."`
`"Rudolf-san!`
` Starting from the left, turn the keys before taking them out!"`
`"Got it...!`
` Now, we've massacred all of the letters.`
` We reached the ninth twilight, and none are left alive."`
`"So?!`
` Did something happen?"`
`"It felt like something clicked, but nothing changed.`
` Did a hidden door open up somewhere?"`
`"H-Hey!`
` Look at that!`
` It moved, I'm sure it did!!"`
`"......?!`
` Everyone, look!`
` The lion statue's facing the other way...!"`
`"Wh-What is going on?`
` Is there some secret inside the lion statue...?!"`
`"...That's not it.`
` It's probably telling us to look where the lion's pointing.`
` See?`
` Look that way."`
`"That lion's facing a different way too...!`
` What does it mean?!"`
`"It's guiding us, stupid!`
` We have to go in the direction the lions face...!"`
`Eva dashed forward.`
`The others all chased after her.`
`...The gold was right in front of them.`
`"...Now this is a surprise.`
` Who would have thought that a hidden stairway like this existed?"`
`"It makes sense now.`
` Father didn't like people going near the chapel..."`
`"...I wonder how long that device has been there.`
` Judging by the feel of this underground passage, probably for quite a long time..."`
`"I imagine it was built at nearly the same time as the mansion itself.`
` ...The riddle of the epitaph was probably also planned many decades ago."`
`"Well, this is Dad we're talking about.`
` ...I try not to let the things he does surprise me, but this..."`
`"Just how far does this stairway go...?"`
`"Hey, maybe that old rumor was true.`
` ...You know, the story about him having a mistress in a hidden mansion somewhere in the forest."`
`"I see.`
` It's likely that this underground passage goes all the way there."`
`"...I wonder if it connects to the mansion from that day..."`
`"I think we've found the goal.`
` ...Look at that filthy door.`
` Something's written on it."`
`"...Whew.`
` Bingo."`
`Something was written on the door in red paint.`
`On the tenth twilight, at journey's end, you shall attain to the power of the Golden Land's treasures, once and for the last time...`
`"Does it open...?"`
`"It does.`
` ...Ready?`
` I'm going to open it."`
`"So, we've finally reached the gold..."`
`"We can only hope...that such a sweet deal's really true."`
`"Let's open it, Nee-san."`
`"Right.`
` I'm opening it."`
`The heavy door...opened slowly...`
`Then, the gold-filled underground VIP room showed itself...`
`They only had an instant to admire its splendid furnishings.`
`As soon as the mountain of gold next to the canopy bed came into sight, they all froze, stunned.`
`After a second, the stunned silence faded and was replaced by cries of astonishment and wild joy...`
`"......Incredible!!`
` Haha, hahhahahahahahaha!!"`
`"I-I can't believe it... It's 20 billion yen in gold...!!`
` It really...does exist!!"`
`"What a shining mountain.`
` It almost blinds the eyes..."`
`"Uhhahahahahahahaha!!`
` We did it! We did it!!`
` We win this game!!"`
`"......Y-You mustn't touch it without permission!`
` This is Father's gold!!"`
`"Oh, really?!`
` Then why don't you call Father down here now!`
` Right away!!`
` The time for your farce is over and done with!!"`
`"Natsuhi nee-san,`
` let's put an end to the obvious lies, shall we?`
` We have a real mountain of gold right here!`
` Shouldn't we all be honest with each other?"`
`"Fortunately, we're all in a good mood and feeling very gracious now.`
` Just give it up already!"`
`"Nng...!"`
`A pile of gold this massive carries magical power within it.`
`That power draws out the most honest feelings within people.`
`The light from the chandelier glinted off the golden mountain, lighting them up with its golden sparkle.`
`It was as though the sparkle controlled everyone present.`
`For some time, they forgot their age...`
`and howled and laughed, running about and rolling around like a bunch of excited kindergartners at a park...`
`"...What is all this?`
` What's it supposed to mean?"`
`"Before the crimes, ...the epitaph has been solved, ...and by all of the siblings together..."`
`"That hasn't happened in any of the games before now."`
`"...Supposedly, Beatrice decided not to commit the crime if the epitaph was solved..."`
`"Yeah, supposedly.`
` ...Hmph.`
` We'll see about that."`
`Ange snorted, ...but I believed.`
`...This is what Clair decided.`
`Because she entrusted everything to the roulette of fate, she'll obey the result.`
`She let the roulette decide her own fate specifically because 'they' couldn't decide on their own.`
`So, she'll do what it says.`
` She'll follow her own rule.`
`She'll definitely keep her promise.`
`"I don't think `
`the crime will occur."`
`"...Are you sure about that?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...Her roulette has already made its decision.`
` This is the end of her game."`
`"If it's the end, what happens next?`
` Do they all become happy rich people and leave the family conference unharmed?`
` Does my family get an ingot that isn't chocolate as a parting gift before coming back to me?`
` Will it be a happy end for everyone?`
` You think those witches would chain us to chairs to show us a naive dream like that?!"`
`"......Nnn..."`
`When she showed off the chain on her wrist with a clank, I was unable to counter her with confidence.`
`But I want to believe.`
`Though this might be the least exciting ending, Clair's game has now reached an end.`
`...Perhaps, just once at the end, she wanted to show us a world where no crime occurs.`
`Now that she has disappeared with no regrets,`
` is she leaving us a parting gift in the form of a game where no crime takes place,`
` in a sense, the most peaceful sort of game?`
`I want to believe.`
`...If only these heavy, cold chains weren't holding us in place in this theater.`
`"I-Is someone there?!?!"`
`Rosa's shrill cry brought the celebrating to an immediate stop.`
`Rosa knew she'd seen it.`
`The curtain against the wall had fluttered, and a shadow had been there behind it.`
`"...C'mon, don't do that.`
` You're just imagining things..."`
`"Is someone there?!`
` If you are, come out...!"`
`When Eva yelled,`
` ...the curtain shook.`
`And then, ...a witch wearing a black dress appeared from the other side...`
`In an instant, everyone realized that the dress was the same as the one worn by the witch of the portrait,`
` ...and they realized one more thing.`
`This person...was the owner of this room.`
`"...Welcome to the room of the gold."`
`Her face and her voice were expressionless, blank.`
`The others all looked at each other, wondering who should respond.`
` Rudolf was the first to speak.`
`"...So, you are Beatrice."`
`"Indeed."`
`"A-And you're the one who gave Maria that letter...?!"`
`"Indeed."`
`"...Is Father behind this?"`
`"No.`
` This is my...game."`
`"If that's so, then we've won.`
` We've solved the epitaph's riddle and found the gold...!"`
`"We've accepted your challenge and won...!`
` That means this gold belongs to us, right?!"`
`"Indeed, it is as you say.`
` ...You have solved the epitaph splendidly and discovered the hidden gold.`
` This game ends in your victory.`
` ...This gold no longer belongs to me, but to all of you..."`
`"...It seems you're a graceful loser."`
`"Hey, you.`
` ...If we hadn't solved the epitaph's riddle, what were you planning to do?"`
`"The letter said that you'd take 'everything of the Ushiromiya family'."`
`"Yes.`
` I planned to take all of your wealth...and all of your lives.`
` ...I planned to do as I pleased with everything that exists on this island."`
`...The witch walked towards the table next to the bed.`
`Then, for the first time, the others realized what sat on that table.`
`They were...four rifles.`
` There was also a case filled with bullets...`
`The witch picked up one of the lead bullets lying on the table and played with it, her face still expressionless, as she spoke.`
`"If `
`this night ended before you managed to solve the epitaph's riddle, `
`...I planned to follow the epitaph and commit 13 murders."`
`"...Wh-What did you say...?"`
`"...That's what I thought when I first saw that epitaph.`
` ...It almost looks like something you'd find in a serial murder mystery novel.`
` ...That's right.`
` If you had killed 13 people to match the epitaph, ...that would've made for quite a mysterious crime..."`
`"Th-There's no way you could do that all by yourself...!`
` No matter how many guns you had, killing 13 people...that would just be...!!"`
`"...I formed my plan with great care and constructed several alternatives.`
` I envisioned all of the actions you might take from tonight and through tomorrow... and prepared a mystery to deal with each of those.`
` ......I'm afraid I cannot reveal those at this point, but it really was a tightly-knit set of pleasant closed room murders."`
`"If there were just a few of us, you probably could've gunned us down in our sleep.`
` But there's no way you could've killed 13 of us...!`
` We aren't that stupid."`
`"......It would seem so.`
` At any rate, I predicted that the epitaph being solved before the first twilight was the most unlikely result."`
`"It would seem that us reaching this place was a miscalculation on your part."`
`"No.`
` ...Even this was one of the results of the roulette I wished to create.`
` This is probably the best outcome for all of you.`
` No one will die, and you can leave this island with the gold.`
` ...Congratulations.`
` This game ends with a perfect victory for you all."`
`If no one could solve the riddle, she planned to take a gun and commit a serial murder.`
` Everyone gulped as they watched the witch emotionlessly make her confession...`
`"...If this confession of yours is the truth,`
` that means you were trying to kill us."`
`"Yes.`
` That is true."`
`"The hell...`
` How can you just say it like that?"`
`"You couldn't possibly expect us to treat you favorably after revealing that much to us, right...?"`
`"I am prepared.`
` ......You may do as you will with me.`
` ...If you hadn't solved the epitaph, I would have done the same to you, so it is only fair."`
`"...This girl's got guts."`
`"I planned this game because I was prepared to bet my life.`
` I am satisfied with the result.`
` ...If you wish to kill me now, I am prepared."`
`By now, she didn't even treasure her life.`
`As the witch spoke and walked near the others, they automatically stepped back...`
`"The gold belongs to all of you.`
` I planned to give everything to the one who discovered it first, but I didn't expect there to be seven of you.`
` ...I leave the decision of how to split the gold to you.`
` I will not involve myself.`
` ...And..."`
`The witch walked even closer.`
`The group parted, and she walked up to the antique clock behind them.`
`The clock was large and had a dignified feel to it.`
` The witch patted it and spoke.`
`"...Allow me to explain the device within this clock.`
` ...For you have gained not just the gold, `
`but the entirety of this island."`
`"What...do you mean by that?"`
`"......`
`If you read it like a murder case up until the eighth twilight, then only 13 people are killed.`
` But by the ninth twilight,`
` ...it clearly says that none are to be left alive."`
`"What does that mean?`
` That she...was planning to massacre all of us?"`
`"...Don't tell me, that clock..."`
`"As you have guessed,`
` ...it is linked to a set of explosives."`
`"Are you the one who set that up?`
` ...Or was that Ushiromiya Kinzo?"`
`"Kinzo is the one who set up the device.`
` It's the source of his mad magical power..."`
`"...I-I don't have a clue what you're talkin' about."`
`"In other words, `
`...Dad set up this bomb,`
`"On this island, Ushiromiya Kinzo made a contract with the Golden Witch and obtained the gold.`
` However, that was not all he gained."`
`"...Wh-What are you talking about...?"`
`"Wait, ...don't tell me...`
`........."`
`"There is that rumor about the remains of an old Japanese military base existing on Rokkenjima...`
` Could it be..."`
`"Your guess is correct.`
` ...Beneath this island sleep the remains of an underground Japanese military base from the time of the war.`
` Along with 900 tons of explosives."`
`"...N-Nine hundred tons?!`
` Th-That's unbelievable!`
` If that exploded, the result would be unimaginable!`
` Forget just the mansion blowin' up, ...it'd leave a massive crater!!"`
`"I believe an expert's estimate put it at a hole several dozen meters deep and a kilometer across."`
`"...There wouldn't be...even a trace left..."`
`"Those explosives can be ignited by a special device.`
` ...One connected to the activation switch I just flipped."`
`The witch toyed with a switch on the top part of the antique clock.`
`"...If 24:00 arrives when the switch is in this position, the bombs will explode."`
`"U-Umm, it's almost 24:00 now..."`
`"In other words, it won't explode X hours after you flip it.`
` ...It's a time limit bomb that only explodes at midnight.`
`"Indeed.`
` ...It is almost 24:00 now.`
` If such an explosion is what you desire, you need only leave it like this."`
`"Who would want that...?!!`
` Turn it off!"`
`By this time, Kinzo was probably the only one who knew.`
`The secret base on Rokkenjima had started out as a submarine base.`
`However, when that plan reached a standstill, it was redefined as a top secret base for homeland defense.`
`A huge plan had been drawn up to have the army and navy perform a pincer attack on American forces if the latter decided to land on Kujuukuri Beach and press towards Tokyo.`
`As a trump card for this massive defensive maneuver, the navy started stockpiling large quantities of explosives and fuel in absolute secrecy.`
`And the Rokkenjima base was the location of that top-secret stockpile.`
`The buried explosives weighed 900 tons in total.`
`Also, fearing that the Americans might find out the island's secrets and seize the explosives,`
` they set up a system for the self-destruction of the entire island...`
`Kinzo, who knew all of this, decided not to remove this device, but to tie it in with this strange clock that could trigger such an explosion any night at midnight.`
`...Kinzo was famous for building up his funds using a vast store of gold,`
` then using those funds in several sink-or-swim gambles, one after another.`
`Just what did his stockpile of gold...and the 900 tons of sleeping explosives mean to him?`
`At this point, we can only guess.`
`Perhaps the true source of Kinzo's mad power...wasn't the gold after all.`
`If he lost a big gamble and all that he owned, he could erase this entire island from existence with this device.`
`For the rest of his life, he must have put the gold and everything else he had on the line...`
`Kinzo probably stared at this clock at times, ...sometimes flipping the activation switch and letting it tick down.`
`Maybe, whenever he came up against a troubling problem, he would hide in here...and flip the switch...`
`...With the intention of blowing everything away if he didn't think of a brilliant plan before 24:00 came.`
`He could gaze at this mountain of gold, listening to the clock tick towards his death as he searched for an idea...`
`Perhaps Ushiromiya Kinzo's real study wasn't the one in the mansion,`
` but this place instead...`
`"...That sort of switch sounds just like Dad.`
` ...So, maybe each time Dad worried about something, all of us kids were put on the line as well..."`
`"This is Father, ...so it wouldn't be unthinkable..."`
`"This device now belongs to all of you.`
` ...If you desire a massive explosion, use it whenever you please."`
`"A-Are you crazy...?!`
` Who'd want a big explosion...?!!"`
`"...These explosives are half a century old, right?`
` Would they really go off?"`
`"Yes, of course.`
` The explosives and the fuses are still working.`
` ...I tested them myself."`
`"You tested them...?"`
`"...You mean...that?"`
`"I see... Now I finally understand.`
` So, that's why the shrine disappeared without a trace..."`
`That summer, the shrine had disappeared completely, along with the reef under it.`
`Though people found it odd that the waves could have wiped it out so completely, no one paid it much mind.`
`And now, this piece fits perfectly into the hole that caused that strange feeling...`
`"Indeed.`
` ......I used that shrine to test whether the explosives were still working after half a century.`
` I believe you are all aware of the result."`
`"............"`
`"The little bit I used was enough to make that entire reef vanish.`
` It's easy to see how 900 tons of that would cause an explosion large enough to rewrite the map..."`
`"...If an explosion like that were to occur, it would certainly kill all of us.`
` But what about you?`
` I doubt you were planning to commit a group suicide with us..."`
`"This underground VIP room is connected by a subterranean passage to the remnants of the military base.`
` If you go straight along that, you'll come out at the hidden mansion on the opposite side of the island, Kuwadorian.`
` It's about two kilometers away.`
` If you make it all the way there, you should be able to escape the blast."`
`"...I see.`
` So, you planned to escape to there just before the blast."`
`"I have only said that such a thing is possible.`
` ...You may not believe this, but if the ninth twilight ended before any of you could solve the riddle,`
` ...I planned to die along with everything else."`
`"...There's something seriously wrong with this girl..."`
`"She's insane...`
` There's no point overthinking it!`
` If we hadn't solved the epitaph, she would've used those guns,`
` or else that switch,`
` to massacre all of us, right?!`
` There's no doubting that now!!"`
`"You are correct.`
` ...You have ended this game in the best possible way, without there being even a single victim.`
` ...I wish to convey my respect and admiration.`
` There may have been seven of you, but you did solve that riddle, which took me so long to solve, in a single night.`
` ...That is worthy of praise."`
`"And I admire you for your graciousness and honesty in defeat.`
` ......We'll decide how to deal with you in the future, but I intend to do all I can to reach a gentlemanly agreement."`
`"...Pay me no mind any longer.`
` I am already one of the dead, who was already prepared to kill everyone and die myself."`
`The Golden Witch Beatrice solved the epitaph, reached this room, and revived.`
`And now,`
` ...new people had solved the riddle and reached this room, ...so her role was finished.`
`When the epitaph's riddle was solved, ...Beatrice's illusion of the witch ended.`
`Most likely, no one in this room was capable of understanding her grim determination.`
`...She herself was probably the only one who understood.`
`As long as the many selves inside of her understood, that was enough.`
`......I am one yet many.`
`I abandoned myself to the magical roulette of endless possibilities.`
`The result...the answer...is this.`
`This is what the tarot cards known as the epitaph ceremony have shown me.`
`...Beatrice is already dead.`
`They did not kill her.`
`I killed her myself, ...in accordance with fate's command.`
`They will never understand, ...for all eternity.`
`............`
`The witch stared up at the ceiling without speaking for a while, then looked as though she'd suddenly remembered something.`
`She grabbed at the sleeves of her dress and took out some sort of card.`
`"Oh, yes.`
` I forgot.`
` ...I have no need for money after death.`
` I will give this to all of you as well."`
`"...A cash card?"`
`"I have converted a portion of the gold to cash.`
` This is for the account that the money is in."`
`"I see.`
` So this is source of the Golden Witch's magical energy."`
`"How much?"`
`"I've forgotten the details.`
` However, there is more than a billion yen."`
`"A billion...!`
` Now that really would be magic!"`
`"True.`
` There's nothing you couldn't do with that much money."`
`"Very true.`
` The strongest magic to counter the Humans' anti-magic toxin is this magic of gold.`
` ...It may be that this card holds greater power than the ingots."`
`"Certainly.`
` Cash would be much more agreeable than ingots."`
`"Here you go.`
` ......I have no need of this anymore."`
`The card she held out...was not taken by any of them.`
`Who would ever just hand over a card with a billion yen in it?`
`The mountain of gold, the device for blowing up the island, the card with a billion yen...`
` ...All of these surpassed their understanding.`
`So, ...no one could bring themselves to take it.`
`"...I don't like it."`
`"...What don't you like?"`
`"Here you go, here's a mountain of gold.`
` And I'll turn off the explosives and give you a card worth a billion yen while we're at it.`
` ...It sounds far too good to be true.`
` ...You're trying to trick us somehow, aren't you?"`
`"I have no desire to trick you, but I won't try and force you to believe.`
` ...I have offered you everything, revealed everything.`
` What you believe and what you do is now for you, the new masters of the gold, to decide.`
` You are even free to disbelieve all I say and leave this place."`
`"Eva,`
` I can't imagine that she's lying."`
`"And how could you know that?!`
` I don't like how relaxed she's acting!`
` It's as though she thinks she's already won!`
` ...I just had an idea, a second ago!!`
` What if she's lying about which is the 'off' side of the switch?!"`
`"Wh-What do you mean, Nee-san...?"`
`"Just a second ago, this woman flipped the switch to the side she said would turn off the bomb!`
` But what if that actually armed the bomb?!`
` We solved the riddle, so you turned the bomb's switch to 'on', trying to blow us and everything else up, right?!"`
`"......`
`...If that is what you think, then feel free to flip the switch on this clock.`
` It will be 24:00 in one minute.`
` ...The clock will show you the truth."`
`"...Wh-What did you say...?"`
`"H-Hey, what're we supposed to do...?`
` Is the bomb set to 'on' now?`
` Or 'off'?!"`
`"I can't imagine that she's lying...!`
` It's inactive now.`
` We shouldn't flip it...!"`
`"But I don't like it!!`
` Why is she so resigned to her fate?!`
` Why's she offering us things one after another?!`
` She's tricking us to buy time!!`
` She wants to buy time until 24:00 so that she can go down in flames along with us!!"`
`"............"`
`"Wh-What about the switch itself?`
` Is there some way to tell if it's on or off...?"`
`On the upper part of the antique clock was a metal switch that could slide right or left.`
`Right now, it was set to the left.`
`However, there were no marks in particular on either side to tell one which was 'off' and which was 'on'.`
`"Hey, tell us the truth!!`
` Which way is off?!"`
`"...Left.`
` It's off now."`
`"You idiot!`
` You really expect an honest answer from her?!`
` It's the opposite... It has to be!!`
` The right side must be 'off'!!"`
`"W-We don't have any more time, Nee-san...!!"`
`"Quit it, Eva!!`
` Don't touch the switch!`
` It's set to 'off' now!!"`
`"Eva-san, take your hand off it!!"`
`"I agree.`
` It's 'off' now.`
` If she wanted to kill us with a bomb, she wouldn't have told us about it."`
`".........!!!`
` ...B-Beatriiiiiiiice...!!`
` Don't think you can trick me...!!!"`
`"......`
`...5.`
` ...4...3."`
`"Nng, aah...aaaaaaaaaarrrrgggghh!!!"`
`The second hand of the clock...ticked past 24:00.`
`October 4th ended...and the curtain rose on October 5th, 1986...`
`The switch was still pointing to the left.`
`...The witch's words had been proven correct.`
`"...Have I gained your trust now...?"`
`"......Y-You bitch!"`
`With a hideous, sweat-covered expression, Eva snatched the cash card away from the witch's hand.`
`"...How about a bankbook and seal?`
` We can't withdraw anything with just a card!"`
`"All you need is the PIN.`
` It's eight digits long."`
`"W-Wait a second!!`
` I'm writing it down...!!"`
`Eva and Kyrie both took out a pen and notepad and began writing the eight digit number the witch told them.`
`"......That is everything I have to tell you and to give you.`
` ...I will say nothing more.`
` All of my tasks have been completed."`
`After saying this, the witch spun around...and sat down on the bed.`
`She wasn't even looking at the others anymore.`
`She sat there like an empty husk which had, just as she had said, finished everything it existed to do...`
`For a while, everyone watched the witch to see if she would remember something else and start talking.`
`However, she said nothing else.`
`The witch who had called herself one of the dead was now little more than a large French doll wearing a black dress...`
`Gold is the only physical embodiment of magic that can exist in the human world.`
`Since ancient times, even a small bit of it could control men with its magic.`
`In that case, how much magic power would dwell in it...`
`if it was piled up in a mountain so high you'd have to look up to see the top?`
`"Don't be stupid, we'll split it evenly!`
` Isn't that the obvious solution?!"`
`"Didn't we say that half of this pile would belong to me, and the other half would be split between the four of us?!"`
`The yells of the humans dancing around the gold reverberated throughout the underground room...`
`In front of the pile of gold, they were arguing about how it should be split.`
`"Did you solve the riddle all by yourself, Nii-san?`
` You didn't, right?!`
` The four of us siblings solved it together!`
` Of course we'll split it in four equal parts!!"`
`"Coward!`
` Weren't you the ones who first made that proposal about the gold's distribution?!!`
` How can you disregard that so easily...?!!"`
`"You really think you're in a position to bargain?`
` When you're the ones hiding Dad's death...?!!"`
`"Y-Yeah, yeah...!!`
` You've been swindling us this whole time, treating Father's wealth as if it were your own...!"`
`"All you need to do is split the gold evenly, and we'll drop all the rest, including that particular issue.`
` It sounds very fair to me."`
`"Well, if you insist, go ahead and try splitting it four ways.`
` Let's divide this pile up right now, and you can all take your own shares home.`
` I hope you have pockets that can hold 2.5 tons of ingots...!`
` It seems you've all been driven mad by the gold and lost all ability to make rational judgements."`
`"What do you mean by that, Krauss nii-san?"`
`"Look at this ingot.`
` As you can see, there are no official markings, just Father's crest.`
` ...How do you intend to turn unmarked gold like this into cash?"`
`"Nnng, ...well..."`
`"Have you finally figured it out?`
` This pile of gold may be worth 20 billion yen.`
` However, that's only if you can trade it for cash.`
` Are any of you capable of exchanging this many unmarked, unidentified ingots for cash at the proper rates?!"`
`If it was a necklace or a ring, exchanging it for cash would have been a manageable problem.`
`However, doing that for several tons of unmarked gold that couldn't be made public...would be impossible for any normal person.`
`...However, Krauss could do it.`
`Among the several business friends that remained from Kinzo's generation, there were some who had black market ties and a lot of financial power.`
`The billion yen tied to the cash card that the Golden Witch had held out a second ago...`
`had already been turned to cash thanks to one of Kinzo's connections...`
`However, none of the other siblings had any connections like that.`
`They would have to rely on Krauss to get cash for the gold.`
`"Now you're finally seeing it.`
` I apologize for hiding all of those things about Father.`
` However, you're in no position to take advantage of that weakness."`
`"...Y-You really think you have such an advantage just because of something like that?!?!"`
`"What do you intend to do with that gun?`
` Please, you're scaring us."`
`Eva was gripping the gun so hard it looked like it might snap.`
`...The four guns that the witch had placed in this room were now in the hands of the relatives.`
`Just as the gold had led their hearts astray,`
` it seemed these guns had the magical power to turn their hearts to violence...`
`Finally, a scuffle arose between Eva and Krauss.`
`Off to the side, Natsuhi started arguing with Rudolf and his wife, and the grand underground VIP room was filled with thundering jeers...`
`"............"`
`After being forced to watch this scene for so long, Ange's face was starting to contort with pain.`
`It was only natural, after being shown this abusive argument between her parents and her other relatives.`
`"...What on earth......?"`
`It was painful for Lion too.`
`Lion would have tried to intervene and calm them, if that had been possible.`
`The gold isn't going anywhere, right?`
` If you just slow down and think, you'll be able to resolve this.`
`Going by what Eva and the others said, it's clear that'll they need a lot of money before the end of the year.`
`However, the billion yen cash card should be more than enough to pay for that.`
`That would handle their emergency expenses, so they could then convert the gold to cash at their leisure...and just split it amongst themselves.`
`Sure, maybe Krauss was the only one capable of converting the gold.`
` That might give him an advantage over the other siblings.`
`However, this gold couldn't be dealt with by open means.`
`In addition to attracting public attention, it would also lead to various legal problems.`
`It was better for this secret money to remain secret.`
`If they wanted to get the largest portions possible, then they should all agree not to tell anyone about this gold.`
`In other words, to maximize their profits, they would all need to make a gentleman's agreement...to keep this secret.`
`Krauss did have a slight advantage.`
`However, it was possible for the other relatives to refuse to cooperate and tell the world about the gold.`
`And then, ...there was also the concealment of Kinzo's death to consider.`
`Krauss was an investor.`
` He needed not only financial clout, but also a certain degree of public confidence in him.`
`His advantage isn't big enough for him to act so overbearing.`
`"...The mountain of gold...has made everyone lose their ability to think rationally.`
` ...This isn't an argument between adults.`
` ...It's just a fight between kids."`
`"What's so fun about showing us this...?`
` Or is this the game of some new witch...?`
` Are they watching us suffer from somewhere and laughing?!"`
`"............"`
`By now, ...even I didn't have a clue who was showing this to us, or for what reason.`
`At the very least, this new tale didn't seem to be overflowing with affection.`
`...At first, I thought it was a tale of a beautiful world, where no crime occurred and Clair's regrets had vanished.`
`But something's different.`
`This tale is clearly filled with ill will towards us.`
`I'm sure of that much now, ...but I don't have a clue who would want to show us this.`
`Suddenly, an explosion rang out.`
`...I didn't think it was the sound of gunfire.`
`After all, ...people living a normal life never hear that kind of sound.`
`*drip*, *drip*drip*drip*.`
`It was the sound of thick raindrops hitting the floor.`
`...There was no rain in this underground room.`
`...It was blood dripping down...from Natsuhi's right eye.`
`The bullet had gone in through her right eye...towards the back of her head...`
`"...N-Natsuhi...?"`
`"...I-It's your fault...for jumping at me..."`
`The gun, ...which fell from Eva's grasp, ...landed on the floor with a hard metallic clang.`
`As though in response to that sound, Natsuhi's head slowly turned to face the ceiling...`
`"...N-Natsuhi...`
` ...Natsuhiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!"`
`Natsuhi flopped backwards.`
`When the back of her head hit the floor, a red splash spread out beneath it, ...forming a single flower to adorn her dead face...`
`"Natsuhi...nee-san..."`
`"Wh-Why did you shoot her?!`
` Why? Eva?! Evaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!?!"`
`Krauss howled, raised his gun, and ran at Eva.`
`At the same time, Hideyoshi leapt between them.`
` A scuffle broke out between the two men.`
`"How could you?! Natsuhiiiiiiiiiiiii, nngaaaaaahhhhh!!"`
`"K-Krauss nii-san, you've got it wrong... You've got it all wrong...`
` It was...just an accident...!!"`
`"Evaaaaaaaaaa, how could you?!!`
` I'll kill you! I'll kill yooooooouuu!!"`
`"I......I didn't shoot... I didn't...`
` Even though I told her to stop, she just jumped at me...!!"`
`Krauss, who had just seen his wife killed before his eyes, had lost all traces of rationality in his expression.`
`He was so furious that, if he had knocked Hideyoshi aside and jumped at Eva, he might have torn her throat out.`
`"Why did you kill her?! Why?!`
` Evaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"It was an accident, ...an accident...!!`
` Calm down, Krauss nii-san...!!`
` ...Owowowow......nngggggghhhh..."`
`Another explosion rang out.`
`Hideyoshi's face was covered with blood.`
`The two of them had been fighting over the gun Krauss held, trying to push it away from themselves.`
`When the barrel had turned to point at Krauss's chin, ...the sneering, formless reaper, master of the room of gold, had swung its scythe once more.`
`A line of blood...trickled from Krauss's mouth.`
`"U...Uwaaaaahhhh, ...hyaaaaaaaaahhhhh...!!"`
`The two fell down, with Krauss's body on top of Hideyoshi.`
`Letting out a cowardly cry, Hideyoshi backed away before Krauss's body could cover him...`
`"...D-Dear...!!"`
`"I didn't do anything!!`
` Krauss nii-san's finger just got caught on the trigger...!`
` It's an accident, ...an accident I tell you...!!"`
`"Th-That's right, an accident... This was all an accident...!!"`
`As the pair of them broke down sobbing and repeatedly claiming that it was all an accident, Rosa and the others were unable to say a thing...`
`The witch also watched this scene, but said nothing, and appeared to be completely disinterested.`
`"...I-It wasn't our fault...!`
` It was just an accident...!`
` You saw, right?! Right? Right?!"`
`"You saw that, didn't you, Rosa?!`
` Krauss nii-san and Natsuhi nee-san both let their emotions get ahold of them and charged at us...!"`
`"...Who knows?`
` I couldn't say either way."`
`"Stupid Rosa!!`
` You saw, didn't you?!`
` You saw it from right there, so you must know!!"`
`"I'm sorry.`
` I can't tell if it happened by accident...or if you killed them and tried to make it look like an accident."`
`"R-Rosa, you...!!!"`
`"Rudolf-kun...!`
` You saw!`
` You know what happened, right?!`
` Right?!"`
`"......`
`...Sorry, but I agree with Rosa.`
` We can't tell if it was an accident or intentional."`
`Rosa's and Rudolf's gazes looked very cold and indifferent to Eva and her husband.`
`"What are we going to do? They were shot to death...!`
` Saying it was a simple accident won't convince anyone...!!"`
`"Th-The forest!`
` We'll say they went to the forest and went missing! That will buy us some time...!"`
`"That won't get us off the hook, right?!`
` The police will just search the whole forest!!`
` And anyway, why would those two go off into an uncultivated forest like that?!`
` It'll look suspicious from the start!`
` There's no way we'll get away with it!!"`
`"It'll be okay...!`
` If we hide the corpses here, no one will be able to find them!`
` If we all play dumb, it'll work!"`
`"It won't...`
` There's no way you can fool the police.`
` If the two of them disappear during a family conference where we were arguing over the inheritance problem,`
` ...the police won't just put it down as a case of missing persons."`
`"......`
`...I-I just had an idea..."`
`Though Eva had been scratching at her head, overcome with emotion,`
` ...her arms suddenly fell as though their strings had been cut.`
`"...Wh-What did you think of?"`
`"...An accident.`
` ...We just need to make it look like an accident."`
`"Idiot...!`
` What kind of accident...?!`
` There are clear gunshot wounds on both corpses, right?!`
` Even if we burn them to make it look like they were caught in a fire, it'll still be obvious that they were killed by guns!!"`
`"...A fire?`
` That's not good enough.`
` ...We need more.`
` A much more massive accident."`
`"...A-A massive accident...?"`
`Eva slowly walked forward, ...tapped it, and spoke.`
`"An explosion accident.`
` ...We just need the sort of accident that will leave no traces of their corpses."`
`As she played with the switch that would cause an automatic explosion at 24:00,`
` ...Eva spun around to look at them, a crazed expression on her face...`
`It was truly...a mad flash of inspiration.`
`If they flipped the switch to the right and waited for 24:00, the 900 tons of explosives would wipe out the mansion without a trace.`
`There wouldn't even be anything left of the corpses.`
` There certainly wouldn't be any way to tell that they had died by gunshot wounds before the explosion.`
`"It's an unshakable fact that this island is still filled with explosives from the war!`
` Then, by coincidence, tomorrow night...`
`something will set it off by chance and the whole thing will explode!!`
` Yes, it'll be an accident!`
` An explosion accident!!`
` What do you say?!!`
` There's no way the police will find out the truth!!`
` This way, we can pull it off!!`
` We can hide the manner of their deaths!!"`
`"Ha...hahaha... That's...crazy..."`
`Shaking, Hideyoshi frantically searched for a counterargument, hoping to shut down Eva's mad idea.`
`......But he couldn't find one.`
`If they blew everything up, the facts would all be muddled...`
`They could make it look as though Krauss and Natsuhi had died in an explosion accident...!`
`"It's perfect, just perfect...!!!`
` After all, it was an accident that they died anyway!`
` We're just changing the type of accident!!`
` Isn't that right?`
` We can think up any story we want!!`
` By chance, the rest of us will happen to be in the hidden mansion tomorrow night!`
` Then, when the explosion accident occurs, we'll be lucky enough to survive!!`
` That story should work!!"`
`"...J-Just what sort of story are you planning on?`
` ...What kind of story could explain how the two of them alone remained here `
`while the rest of us conveniently went to the hidden mansion and managed to escape...?!"`
`"That's what we've got to think up now, stupid Rosa!!!`
` It doesn't matter what it is, as long as we all agree to it!!`
` I'll think of something... I ~ib~am~ib~ thinking... You all think too!!`
` Someone think of somethiiiiiiiiiiiing!!!"`
`"C-Calm down, Eva...`
` I'll think about it, and so will everyone else!`
` We'll definitely think of something, and it'll all work out!`
` We'll share the burden. You won't have to carry it all yourself...!!`
` It'll all be okay... It will!!`
` I know we'll think of a good excuse!"`
`"...What kind of excuse?`
` We took the kids and all the servants to go exploring an underground passageway, leaving just the two of them behind,`
` and the rest of us all decided to spend the night in the hidden mansion?`
` How could any excuse work?`
` ...It's insane!"`
`"And thinking up that insane thing is our job!!`
` Why are you acting like this has nothing to do with you?!`
` You think of something too!!!"`
`"......Nee-san,`
` let me ask you a question.`
` ...If you blow up the island, what will happen to this gold?"`
`"Nnng, ...w-well......"`
`"We've finally gotten our hands on 20 billion yen of gold.`
` And you want to blow it all away...?"`
`"We can just carry it away...yeah, that's right!!`
` The explosion will happen tomorrow at midnight!`
` We have a full day!!`
` If we all carry it together, we might-"`
`"You realize there's 10 tons of it, right?`
` ...Just how much do you think our small group can carry `
`back and forth across this long, underground passage that goes all the way across the island?`
` You're being absurd."`
`"H-Here!!`
` We have this card, right?!`
` The card worth a billion yen, the one that woman gave us!!`
` We'll just carry as much gold as we can!`
` We have the card with a billion yen on top of that!`
` If we split that three ways, we'll have more than 300 million each!`
` That should be enough for all of our purposes!!"`
`"I don't like it."`
`"...Y-You don't like what...?"`
`"We have a mountain worth 20 billion yen right here.`
` Why should we be satisfied with just 300 million each?"`
`"...R-Rosaaaaa..."`
`Eva's face twisted in anguish...and was met by Rosa's look of cold unconcern.`
`"...If we gave Krauss nii-san his share,`
` we'd each have a share of 5 billion.`
` Subtract the 300 million from the card, and the rest of my share is 4.7 billion.`
` ...If you agree to pay that much to me, then you can do whatever you want with this mountain of gold."`
`"What do you think you're saying?!`
` So, you don't intend to cooperate?!"`
`"Nee-san,`
` please calm down and listen.`
` This plan will let both of us leave with the maximum amount of money."`
`"Wh-What...?!?!"`
`"I want you to go to the police and turn yourself in, admitting that you got into a scuffle and the gun went off."`
`"A-Are you crazy?! I don't want to go to the police!!!"`
`"Of course, we don't want to say that the crime happened here.`
` The police would find the gold.`
` ...Yes, how about the rose garden?`
` It's pouring rain now, so the police probably won't find any contradictions at the crime scene."`
`"I'll let you think of an excuse for why you and Nii-san started fighting while you were holding guns in the rainy rose garden.`
` ...Please, don't try to get us and our shares involved just because you want to hide your own crime."`
`"R-Rosaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`"It's not so bad, right?`
` After all, it's not like they'll keep you in jail for several decades.`
` It was an accident, right? You'll be able to get out after just a few years.`
` ...When you've paid for your sins and come back, then you can do whatever you want with your 5 billion."`
`"No, I'd never do that!!`
` What would happen if we were arrested?!`
` What would happen to my husband's company?!"`
`"Who cares about the company?`
` With 5 billion yen, working any longer would just be a waste of time, right?"`
`Rosa had never intended to go along with Eva's proposal.`
`If it was a question of maximizing each person's portion, no one had anything to gain from an explosion accident.`
`An explosion would conceal Krauss and Natsuhi's deaths.`
` ...And it would serve no further purpose.`
`From Rosa's perspective, the ideal outcome would be for them to confess to their crimes, without any unnecessary tricks.`
`All she wanted was to change the crime scene from here to a different place.`
`However, Eva didn't want to be arrested.`
`She didn't like having her share shrink from 5 billion to 300 million,`
` but even that was more than enough to cover the amount she had been trying to wring out of Krauss in the first place.`
`She wanted to hide what had happened here, even if it meant blowing away 4.7 billion yen.`
`What would happen if they were arrested?`
`The life, the company and the trust that Eva had worked so long to build...`
`were things that couldn't be bought back with money.`
`So, she wanted to hide Krauss and Natsuhi's deaths, even if it meant blowing up all 4.7 billion yen worth of her gold...!`
`But from Rosa's perspective, that was just irrational nonsense.`
`"R-Rosaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"What do you think you're doing with that gun, Nee-san?`
` ...Are you going to have me die in the explosion too?`
` That'll make finding an excuse even harder.`
` In fact, it'll make it harder to explain away the other two deaths as accidents too..."`
`"Three whole deaths means it'll be quite a large-scale crime.`
` ...It would probably get you the death penalty.`
` Or life in prison, if you're lucky.`
` Even in the best case, you'll probably be put away for more than a decade, right?"`
`"Turn yourself in.`
` If you do, this will be no more than a pair of unfortunate accidents.`
` Of course, your jail term won't be too terrible either.`
` ...Don't worry about George-kun.`
` We'll take good care of him.`
` And we'll make sure that your entire share of 5 billion yen is waiting for you when you get back."`
`Eva ground her teeth and glared.`
`The Rosa she knew should've been shaking and obeying her commands.`
` And yet, ...Rosa wasn't scared.`
`Her blank expression...`
`no, that faint smile...was one that Eva had never seen before.`
`"Put the gun down, Nee-san.`
` Once you calm down, you'll see that my plan is the best one.`
` ...Jail isn't so bad, right?`
` Think of it as a financial strategy."`
`"Even if they put you in for ten years, there will be 5 billion waiting for you when you get out.`
` That's like working for a 500 million yen salary, right?`
` If you think of it that way, won't you enjoy your job more?"`
`"Liar!!!`
` You just want to steal my share away while I'm in there!!`
` Like your man did to you!!!"`
`"H-He has nothing to do with this, okay?!?!`
` I won't run away... I'd never run away with someone's money...`
` ...Ooohhh, ...I'll never do iiiiiiiiiiiit!!!"`
`Rosa's once-frigid face was filled with rage.`
`The two howling people pointed their guns at each other, shouting insults...`
`You could smell the gold room's reaper slinking closer.`
`The smell of gunpowder, the explosive smell of death, ...filled the room...`
`*drip*.`
`A bubble of blood dripped from Rosa's mouth.`
`Then, ...she fell over lifelessly, like a mannequin someone had pushed over.`
`"...E-Eva...?!"`
`"...I-It wasn't me!`
` I swear I didn't even pull the trigger!"`
`"......The round in the chamber of your gun was spent when you fired at Natsuhi-san, right...?`
` You never reloaded, so even if you pull the trigger, that gun won't kill anyone.`
` Have no fear."`
`As Kyrie said this, she maneuvered the lever action with a practiced hand, and a smoke-smelling shell casing was ejected...`
`It hit the floor with a small, metallic sound.`
` That tiny sound had a disturbing ring to it...`
`"Rosa-san's analysis was a little naive.`
` ...She has no idea how difficult it would be `
`to exchange this many unmarked gold ingots for money."`
`"...Back in Dad's day, even just showing this gold to get funding was enough to create the massive rumor called the Ushiromiya Legend of the Gold.`
` ...Exchanging this for cash is impossible.`
` A pile of gold you can't use is no better than a pile of crap."`
`"'10 tons of gold were exchanged for cash on the black market, and the Successor and his wife died mysterious deaths.'`
` Expecting that to go unnoticed is what's really unbelievable.`
` ...We don't want to get the police involved.`
` We'll blow up this island and destroy all the evidence.`
` If it's tough parting with the gold, feel free to grab as much as you can hold.`
` The billion yen on the cash card is more than enough.`
` ...In other words, Eva nee-san was right."`
`"I......I'm glad...`
` ...It looks like we're on the same page...`
` ...I-If the police get involved, who knows what might happen?`
` It's the same with cashing in the gold.`
` I'm sure that would have tripped us up somewhere, so we had no choice...!!"`
`"The 1 billion that woman over there exchanged for cash is the only money we'll be able to get our hands on!`
` And even splitting that billion, it'll be more than enough for what we need...!`
` On top of that, now that Rosa is dead, our shares have increased even more...!`
` We can each leave this island with 500 million...!"`
`"Exactly.`
` As long as we don't let our greedy desire to cash in the gold control us,`
` ...we can pretend that everything that occurred on this island never happened.`
` We have a way to do that right here."`
`By this point, neither deaths from accidental discharges nor shooting murders meant anything on this island.`
`Everything would be erased equally by the explosion accident.`
`No matter what happened between now and midnight the next day, everything would be rewritten.`
`"...And you told me...to turn myself in?! Stupid Rosa...!`
` You weren't satisfied with just 300 million?`
` This is what you get for being too greedy...`
` ...Y-You brought this upon yourself..."`
`"But Kyrie-san, ...there was no need to shoot her, right...?`
` Even Rosa-san would've figured it out if you'd just told her..."`
`"I did need to shoot her.`
` After all, Rosa-san's the only one who didn't fire her gun."`
`"...What does that matter...?"`
`"The guns lying at your feet are Krauss nii-san's and Eva nee-san's.`
` Both of those have been fired.`
` However, Rosa-san's gun can shoot if you just pull the trigger.`
` It's hard to reload one of these if you aren't used to a lever action.`
` An amateur would have some trouble pulling it off."`
`"Kyrie-san, what are you talking about...?"`
`"Y-You...!!"`
`They finally realized what Kyrie meant.`
`'Rosa had the only gun that could still fire, so I shot her first.'`
`Oh, how foolish we were... Why didn't we realize sooner?`
`Even though we knew there's a mechanism for erasing everything that happens on this island...`
`Eva and Hideyoshi hurried to pick up the guns that lay at their feet.`
`At the same time, fire spat from Kyrie's gun once more.`
`Hideyoshi let out a short scream, clutched at his chest, and fell over face-down.`
`"Dear?!`
` Dear...!!`
` ...Wah, ...why is this-"`
`Eva fiddled with the lever action, trying to imitate something she vaguely remembered from a western movie,`
` but something seemed to be caught, and the still-open lever didn't budge.`
`"See?`
` It's pretty hard."`
`"...Y-You...!!!"`
`Kyrie finished reloading with a fluid motion.`
`The way she held it was as innocent and sure as a kid playing with a squirt gun.`
`With another heartless cry of gunfire, the puppet called Eva slumped down to the floor as though its strings had been cut...`
`"...Rudolf-san,`
` the billion yen card."`
`"Sure..."`
`The cash card with a billion yen, which Eva had just grabbed from the witch...`
`That alone was worth more than enough.`
`The 20 billion yen pile of gold had skewed everyone's sense of value.`
`Just a few million yen is enough for people to kill over.`
` And this was a billion yen.`
`"Rosa-san,`
` those were some famous last words there.`
` 'Just 300 million?'`
` ...You were too greedy."`
`"Heheh...`
` No kidding.`
` ...Ah, lucky me.`
` I don't have to fish through her corpse."`
`As Rudolf walked up to Eva's body, he found the card lying beside it...and picked it up.`
`"So, this flimsy little card is worth a billion yen...`
` ...Sticking with the company would be a waste of time.`
` So, do we close up shop and spend the rest of our lives in some southern country?"`
`"I'm sure you'd get bored right away.`
` Besides, I like seeing you get all worried about some problem, then leap around like a little kid when you finally overcome it."`
`"Heheheh...!`
` Sure you do..."`
`"Thank you, Ms. Golden Witch.`
` ...Rudolf-san and I will make good use of this billion."`
`"............"`
`"Krauss nii-san promised to treat you in a gentlemanly fashion.`
` But I haven't made any such promise."`
`...She pulled the trigger without a trace of mercy.`
`When the ringing of the gunfire died down, ...blood trickled from the witch's mouth, and she fell over onto the bed.`
`Once again, Kyrie ejected the used shell casing.`
`The four metal sounds of used shells hitting the floor seemed to symbolize the fact that Rudolf and his wife now possessed all shares of the gold...`
`"...All of them were really slow-witted...`
` ...From the moment they heard about the bomb, they should've known that they wouldn't be leaving this island as a big, happy family."`
`"Sorry 'bout this, Aniki, Aneki, Rosa.`
` ...Well, that's life for you.`
` Give me a break, okay?`
` Aniki and Aneki get into a fight, Rosa gets dragged in,`
` and I'm the one who picks up the pieces.`
` ...Just like it's always been, right?"`
`It wasn't as though Rudolf and Kyrie had planned to kill everyone and take everything for themselves from the start.`
`Kyrie had quickly realized, by the length of the barrel of the gun in her hands, that it would probably hold five rounds at a time.`
`......Yes.`
` Kyrie and Rudolf were both very familiar with this gun.`
`Rudolf, whose interest in guns from old westerns came from his Father, owned a shotgun of the same model.`
`Even Kyrie had earned the qualifications to use that gun,`
` becoming familiar enough with it that they could go shooting together for fun...`
`Including the witch, there had been eight people there.`
` Six people besides the two of them.`
`Each gun held five rounds.`
` ...That was one short.`
` They didn't have enough to kill everyone.`
`"...To be honest, it really surprised me when they got into a fight and one of the guns went off."`
`That coincidental accident...had provided the missing bullet.`
`It wasn't the second shot.`
` The very first shot, which had accidentally killed Natsuhi, had guaranteed that this massacre would happen...`
`In this smoke and corpse-filled room of gold, the two of them wore easygoing smiles, hardly any different from those they usually wore...`
`"...What `
`do we do now?"`
`Rudolf picked up Rosa's gun.`
` Then, he fired a test shot at the wall and ejected the old shell with a smooth motion like Kyrie's.`
`Kyrie went to the box of bullets on the table, casually picked up a few, and loaded them one after another into her gun.`
`"Set the bomb switch to 'on'.`
` Then, we just need to wait 24 hours."`
`"Everyone's gonna run wild when morning comes and they can't find us."`
`"Then we just need to make sure they don't."`
`"Guess so.`
` ...What about Battler?"`
`"He's your son.`
` Not mine."`
`"Don't say that.`
` Look how attached he is to you.`
` He really respects you."`
`"Then think of a clever way to trick him.`
` I'll worry about Ange.`
` You worry about Battler-kun.`
` Fair enough?"`
`"Nng, ...sure."`
`"I'm kind to my own children,`
` ...but it's a real pain to be nice to Asumu-san's kid.`
` You understand, I hope?"`
`"............"`
`Kyrie's voice had grown cold.`
`She had acted warmly towards Battler because that had been the adult thing to do.`
`He was Rudolf's son, so she tried to avoid being hostile, nothing more.`
`But underneath, he was the son of Asumu, a woman Kyrie still hated even though she was dead.`
`Now that she had given birth to Ange and finally built up a new family,`
` ......was Battler's return really such a happy thing for her...?`
`"Get yourself ready.`
` Now that we've come this far,`
` ...we can only go for the billion yen or die trying.`
` If you can't convince Battler-kun, I'm sorry, but I won't be taking any chances."`
`"...No need to threaten me.`
` I'll take care of it.`
` I'll find a good story to tell him."`
`"Make sure you do.`
` ...I know Ange will be very sad if she's forced to hear about Battler-kun dying in an accident."`
`"Sure...`
`.........`
` ...How do we start?"`
`"We have nothing to gain by waiting for morning.`
` Now is the best time."`
`"...Oh, wonderful.`
` Not even time for a break."`
`"...A test?`
` What's this supposed to be?`
` At this time of night?`
` Starting now?"`
`Battler yelled wildly into the receiver.`
`When he said 'at this time of night', George and Jessica turned to look.`
`According to the clock, it was past midnight.`
`It might be a normal time to be told to brush their teeth and go to bed, but he couldn't understand what this test thing was all about.`
`"Okay, I'll hand it over.`
` ...Here, George-aniki.`
` It's my dad."`
`"...Hello, `
`this is George speaking."`
`"Ah, hey, George-kun.`
` Sorry to call so late.`
` You weren't sleeping already, were you?`
` You're all still up chatting away?"`
`"Pretty much.`
` Maria-chan is sleeping...oh, wait, it looks like she just woke up.`
` So, what did you want to talk about?`
` Battler-kun said something about a test..."`
`"Ah, yeah.`
` Dad can be such a pain sometimes.`
` He suddenly came down from his room.`
` A bunch of stuff happened, and by the end, he was talking about which grandchild would make the best Successor."`
`"...But isn't Uncle Krauss the Successor?"`
`"He says the four of us aren't up to the job,`
` ...so he's gonna skip us adults and choose one of you grandkids instead.`
` It's all so sudden, we're really freaking out here.`
` Aniki and the others are all arguing about it across the room.`
` I'll bet you can hear Aneki shrieking in the background, huh?"`
`"...I-Is that so?`
` If that's what Grandfather says, then there's no way around it, I guess...`
` In that case, what should we do?"`
`"He says he wants to call you out one by one, starting with Jessica-chan.`
` ...Oh, wait a sec.`
` ...............`
`...Okay, you still there?`
` It looks like you and Jessica-chan will be the first up to bat.`
` He wants Jessica-chan to go to the parlor in the mansion.`
` You're supposed to go out in front of the chapel."`
`"It's so sudden, I hardly feel ready...`
` What sort of test is it?"`
`"It looks like Dad made some kind of crazy quiz.`
` ...Some weird questions about what it means to be the Head."`
`Of course, a few things about this seemed off to George.`
`However, Kinzo was famous for doing radical things on a whim.`
` ...Even this strange test seemed plausible once he heard that it was a sudden idea of Kinzo's.`
`...But even so, if he wanted to test them one by one, why wouldn't he call them out one by one?`
`They could have just had everyone wait in some reception room to be called in one at a time.`
`Why would two people be called to different places at the same time?`
` The plan didn't seem to make sense, and George felt he was missing something.`
`"Still, I wonder why he wanted to meet you in front of the chapel, of all places.`
` ...He expects a lot from you.`
` I think he wants to talk to you alone, not sure what about."`
`"...Grandfather...wants to talk to me?"`
`"I wonder what he's got to say.`
` I mean, you're the most talented of all his grandkids.`
` He's probably got something to tell you in particular, right?`
` ...Anyway, that's what he says.`
` Get over there right away.`
` I'm supposed to go to the chapel too, `
`so let's get this over with, `
`or we're both gonna catch colds."`
`"......I see.`
` Okay.`
` Then I'll head towards the front of the chapel,`
` and Jessica-chan will go to the parlor.`
` ...Sure.`
` I'll see you in a bit, then."`
`What sort of test or private conversation...could Kinzo possibly want to have at this time of night?`
`Then again, it's a well-known fact that Kinzo doesn't have long to live.`
`It wouldn't be so strange if he wanted to give some sort of will to each of his descendants individually...`
`Inside George's mind, the faint feeling that something was wrong...was replaced by a desire to meet Kinzo directly and hear about this in more detail.`
`George set down the receiver and quickly explained to the others.`
`"It's as you heard.`
` ......Grandfather says he wants to give us all some kind of test."`
`"Uu-?`
` A test...?"`
`"After hiding in his study all these years, he suddenly decides to give us a test this late at night?`
` ...Damn that old geezer.`
` What's he thinking?"`
`"It seems our parents feel the same way.`
` It sounds as though they're very worked up about it."`
`"Well, I doubt getting worked up about it will change Grandfather's mind."`
`"Exactly.`
` ...We might as well accept it.`
` It's Grandfather's order, after all.`
` Let's obey it.`
` ...To start, Jessica-chan and I are being called out.`
` I'm going to the chapel.`
` Jessica-chan is supposed to go to the parlor in the mansion."`
`"What about Maria and me?"`
`"I think they'll contact you later.`
` Wait here."`
`"Uu-!`
` A midnight test!`
` What could it be?!`
` What kind of test is it?!`
` A quiz?`
` A puzzle?`
` I'm really good at wolves and sheep puzzles!`
` Uu-!"`
`Maria, who was now fully awake, seemed to be very excited about this unexpected midnight test.`
`"Then we'll just hang out here."`
`"Yes.`
` Okay, I'm going.`
` It sounds like they're already waiting for us."`
`"...So, he's making one of his grandkids the Successor.`
` Sounds great to me.`
` Now I can let one of you guys deal with it!"`
`"I'm gonna become the Successor!`
` I wanna do it!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!"`
`"Ahaha.`
` Having Maria as the Successor wouldn't be so bad."`
`"Bye.`
` See you later."`
`Rudolf put down the receiver and stood up.`
`"Okay.`
` ...Guess I'm going to the spot in front of the chapel.`
` It's damn cold out there.`
` ...Gohda-san,`
` have some coffee waiting for me when I get back, will you?"`
`Next to Rudolf, ...Gohda was lying face-up.`
`His face was covered by a crossword puzzle book.`
`However, its pages were stained with blood, and you didn't need to move the book to imagine how he had met his pitiful end...`
`"How was it?`
` A nice script, don't you think?"`
`"Yep.`
` We should be thanking Dad.`
` If we just say it was him being fickle, no one's gonna doubt us."`
`"*giggle*`
` Then let's split up.`
` ...I'll take care of Jessica-chan.`
` You take care of George-kun."`
`"You got it.`
` ...Let's get this over with quickly, so we can relax and have some coffee."`
`"There won't be any problems, yes?`
` ...No sudden pangs of conscience?"`
`Kyrie smiled coldly...`
`It probably would have been safer to call them out one by one and finish them off together.`
`...However, Kyrie had chosen to have her husband work separately.`
`She wanted to measure Rudolf's resolve.`
`If she was the only one who got her hands dirty, and Rudolf just watched,`
` his heart wouldn't be as dedicated to this venture.`
`By having him dirty his own hands, she could make him truly determined to see this thing through.`
`...Kyrie understood this sort of mind game better than anyone else.`
`Rudolf reflexively averted his gaze from the cold glint in her eyes, but then he just shrugged and answered her question.`
`"Of course.`
` ......We have a billion yen riding on this.`
` And I'm a man.`
` I'm not gonna miss a chance that'll never come again in my lifetime."`
`"...I expected no less of you, Rudolf-san.`
` ...I love people who seize chances when they come.`
` That's why I fell in love with you."`
`"Th-Thanks...`
` I'm glad."`
`"Rudolf-san."`
`"What...?"`
`"Stay like that...always, okay?"`
`"Huh?`
` What did you say?"`
`"Always remain the same Rudolf-san I love, `
`...okay?"`
`"...Of course.`
` When have I ever let you down?`
` ...You should be worrying more about what kind of champagne we'll use to toast our victory."`
`"I'll do that.`
` ......Take care, now.`
` If you really treasure Battler-kun, don't kill George-kun in front of the chapel, okay?`
` It'll be a pain if he finds the body."`
`"...Yeah, I know.`
` ...I'll lure him away somehow.`
` We'll be outside, and it's raining.`
` Should be some way to do it."`
`"And you aren't a villain in some old western, got it?`
` Don't grant any last requests or take down any final messages, okay?"`
`Kyrie lifted up her gun again and ran the lever...`
`...To eject the casing from the round she had killed Gohda with.`
`"......Dear...`
` ...Deeeeeeeeear...`
` Waaaaaaahhhhh..."`
`Eva was holding Hideyoshi's body and crying.`
`She hadn't been shot at all.`
` The bullet had grazed her head...and missed.`
`She hadn't been playing dead.`
` She really thought that she'd been shot.`
`When Kyrie's gun spat fire, Eva felt something fierce skim past her head...`
`before feeling light-headed and fainting.`
`Then, she had awoken in the now silent room of the gold.`
`The remains of her beloved husband lay beside her.`
` As well as Krauss, Natsuhi, and Rosa's corpses.`
`It was a room of death and piled up bodies...`
`When she had cried all she could over Hideyoshi's body,`
` ...she realized that she still had something she needed to do.`
`"...George is in danger...`
` ...George, ...George...!"`
`They're trying to use the bomb to blow up everything, to bury this whole island with an 'explosion accident'.`
`...Of course.`
`As Eva had expected, the switch on the clock was set to the right, which meant that it was active.`
`Eva moved to flip it to the left...and stopped.`
`That's right.`
` As long as this switch points to the right, ...everything that happens will disappear in this night of illusions.`
`Yes, this is an illusion.`
`No matter what happens tonight, everything will become muddled and hidden away.`
`"They're probably going to kill everyone else.`
` That has to be it... I'm sure of it...!"`
`When she looked at the table with the box of bullets,`
` she saw signs that they had roughly grabbed a bunch of bullets before leaving.`
`It clearly showed...that they planned to use that many bullets.`
`...I have to fight.`
`...If only to protect just the life of my precious son...`
`The gun that I dropped when I was shot is stuck with the lever open.`
`No matter how hard I pull, it won't open any further, and it won't close again.`
`...Apparently, a bullet has gotten jammed, breaking it.`
`...It's just as Kyrie said.`
` Loading a bullet is tough if you aren't used to it.`
`"Please, `
`dear...`
` Lend me your strength...`
` ...Lend me your strength,`
` so that I can protect George..."`
`In Hideyoshi's hand was Krauss's gun, which he had been trying to pick up.`
`Eva took it, ...prayed to her husband one more time, and tugged on the lever handle.`
`...With a light metallic sound, `
`...the golden casing spun through the air...`
`and bounced off the ground.`
`When she timidly tried to push the lever back, `
`...this time it returned to its original place without any resistance.`
`...There was another metallic clang.`
`It was the sound of a new bullet being loaded...`
`"...Hmph.`
` I figured it'd be something like this.`
` ...Someone's scheming to show me the game that'd disgust me most, just to mock me..."`
`In the games so far, various people have been suspected of being the culprit or an accomplice.`
`The only difference now was that Rudolf and Kyrie were those suspects...`
`However, to Ange, that was the most infuriating plot twist possible.`
`"............"`
`Even Lion was full of painful thoughts.`
`Solving the epitaph was supposed to be the only miracle that could lead to a game without a single victim,`
` ...but ironically, the tragedy hadn't been averted even so.`
`Does this mean we aren't allowed to have a future where we all happily return from this island alive,`
` ...even if the epitaph is miraculously solved before the crime occurs...?`
`A miracle certainly will not occur.`
`...Those words, which I had heard in one of the Fragments Bernkastel had shown me, raced through my mind...`
`"Bernkastel-san...`
` You showed me how wonderful my world was...`
` ...I don't want to believe that you created this tale just to hurt Ange..."`
`"...By now, even I realize that you're the Game Master here.`
` ...Please, tell me.`
` ...Why are you showing us this game...?"`
`Of course, no one answered Lion's muttered question.`
`The game created to mock Ange continued emotionlessly,`
` ...with more terrible twists that didn't betray anyone's expectations anymore...`
`"Ha!`
` Show whatever terrible game you like!`
` You're trying to say that this is one of the endless possibilities inside the cat box, right?!`
` Just do whatever you want...!`
` I won't let something like this get to me!!`
` Someday, I'll find out the truth of what happened on October 5th, 1986!!"`
`After meeting Kyrie in the parlor, Jessica was told that the test would be held in the dining hall, and she followed Kyrie there...`
`"......Aunt Kyrie, there's no one here."`
`"He'll be here soon.`
` Sit over there."`
`"............"`
`Jessica sat in the chair she had been offered, looking nervous and agitated.`
`Kyrie was by far the calmer of the two.`
`Kyrie closed the door behind her, revealing the gun that rested behind it.`
` Jessica was facing the other way, so she saw nothing...`
`"...Did you hear anything about this, Aunt Kyrie?`
` Like what kind of test this is?"`
`"Yes.`
` It'll be over soon."`
`"I sure hope so."`
`As she complained, Jessica turned her head around, and the tip of her nose bumped into cold metal.`
`"......Huh-"`
`"U-Uncle Rudolf...?!`
` What...are you doing...?"`
`"Heheh.`
` I guess shooting people in the back just isn't for me after all."`
`"...H-Hey, ...that was dangerous.`
` What on earth are you doing...?!"`
`"Come on, why else would someone point a gun and pull the trigger?"`
`Rudolf reloaded rapidly and pulled the trigger again without any sign of hesitation.`
`As the sound of gunfire thundered through the rain, George grabbed at his side and fell to his knees...`
`"Unnggg...ggnhh...!!"`
`"That's weird.`
` I guess it really does shoot low.`
` ...This gun's really got it bad."`
`"S-Somebody...!!`
` Help me, ...Uncle Rudolf is...!!"`
`George started stumbling away, still clutching at his side.`
`His voice as he called for help was weak and thin.`
`In comparison, Rudolf, who stood behind him, looked perfectly calm as he fiddled with his gun and checked his sights.`
`"...It hurts... ...It hurts...`
` ...Gah, ...nngg...!"`
`It felt to George as though something had been gouged into his side.`
` It was so painful that he could barely stand and walk...`
`He leaned against the trunk of a tree.`
`After he crouched down, trying to cover his wound, ...he was no longer able to stand back up.`
`George didn't have a clue what was going on.`
` However, he had felt as though something was wrong this whole time.`
`Of course it was strange that he'd be called out alone to a place like this, at a time like this.`
`...And yet, `
`...how could he have known that something was wrong...?`
`After all,`
` ...his own uncle...`
`had told him that his grandfather was asking him to join the family conference.`
` ...How could he have suspected...?`
`"...Sorry 'bout this, George-kun.`
` It hurts, doesn't it?`
` If I knew it'd come to this, it would've been kinder to blow out your brains from behind.`
` I thought it'd be too cruel to finish you off before you knew what hit you, but it looks like I got it backwards."`
`"......Wh-`
`Why, `
`Uncle Rudolf...?`
` Why would...`
`do...`
`this......?"`
`"Forget about this.`
` By tomorrow night, all of it won't have happened."`
`With a quick use of the lever handle, he loaded another bullet.`
`The casing of the bullet that had pierced George's side fell heartlessly in front of him...`
`"Everyone's gonna die in a sudden, unfortunate accident.`
` Until that moment, we'll all be a big, happy family.`
` ...That's how it's gonna be.`
` So don't worry about this.`
` Forget it all."`
`Of course, George didn't have a clue what Rudolf was talking about.`
`All he knew was that Rudolf wanted to kill him, and that he showed no trace of hesitation...`
`...His image of Rudolf as the ideal cool, joke-loving adult...`
`didn't match up with the man standing in front of him, holding a gun.`
`No, maybe this feels wrong because it fits him too well.`
`He has that same smile, as though he's about to tell some hilarious joke,`
` ...but he's pointing a gun at me.`
`...Why would that kind, `
`...funny Uncle Rudolf...`
`...do this...?`
`It made him feel unimaginably sad, ...and tears flowed from his eyes.`
`"Uu, ...uuuuuu...Uncle Rudolf...`
`"Haven't I always told you, George-kun?`
` ...Make sure you don't end up as an adult like me.`
` Now you see why.`
` In the next world, make learning how to spot villains your first priority.`
` ...I know you can do it.`
` After all, it's just another kind of studying."`
`"Uu...*hic*...gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!"`
`He bit down the pain in his side.`
` ...With the last of his strength, George threw his whole body into a roundhouse kick.`
`At the same time, fire spat from Rudolf's gun.`
`...The bullet pierced George's chest.`
`George spun around as he fell amidst an outpouring of blood.`
`He moaned wordlessly, clenching bloodstained teeth.`
`A frigid gun was pressed harshly against his temple.`
`"So long.`
` ...Go become a great man in the next world.`
` Don't get blinded by money like me."`
`"...I can't believe...`
`...that my uncle...`
`...would kill for money...`
` Aaaaaaaahhhhh......"`
`"You're so innocent.`
` ...People can kill...`
`over money."`
`The ruthless trigger forestalled any further questions.`
`George's hands, which had been covering his wound, dropped lifelessly...`
`When Rudolf saw the last glimmer of life leave him, he sighed deeply and looked tired.`
`"Heh, ...hahahahahahahahahaha.`
` ......That was easier than I'd thought."`
`Rudolf looked up into the dark, rainy sky, the rain drops hitting him full in the face,`
` ...and laughed with an indescribable expression, his tongue hanging out.`
`"I thought my conscience would bug me more.`
` ...Now that it's over, it was pretty easy."`
`*giggle*giggle*, `
`gahahahahahaha.`
` Rudolf laughed.`
`This was probably just the thing Kyrie had hoped for.`
`It had taken considerable effort to kill George.`
`...He may have been merciless, but the last traces of a conscience in Rudolf's heart had probably slowed him down.`
`However, now that he had killed someone with his own hands, a turning point that few people ever reach,`
` ...Rudolf had finally awakened.`
`...No, he finally understood.`
`"...It's just like squeezing dough out of a bunch of morons.`
` ...The same old game of musical chairs.`
` If there's a pile of money in front of you, the first one to reach it wins.`
` The slow ones just get kicked down to hell."`
`Haven't I driven dozens of poor fools into debt with my earlier swindles?`
`Several of those probably ended up bankrupt, and some of those might've hanged themselves.`
` And I always laughed like it was none of my business.`
`And that's all there is to it.`
`The only difference now is that, for the first time,`
` ...I've dealt the final blow with my own hands.`
`"...Thanks, Kyrie.`
` ...You're always the best at cutting away my naivety.`
` ...Heheheh, ...hehhahahahahahah!`
` Hyahhhahahahahahahahahaahahahaha!!!"`
`Rudolf's evil laugh rang out.`
`The laugh was so purely evil, it was almost soothing.`
`Hypocritical evil that still contains some pangs of conscience is far more repulsive to behold.`
`If a man's committed to doing great evil anyway, how much more pleasant and gallant it is when he's wholly devoted to his goal.`
`In that sense, Rudolf's evil smile and laugh...`
`were pleasant and gallant indeed...`
`Which means...`
`The brutal, bloody stage of the dining hall...must have been soothing as well.`
`A clang.`
` A thud.`
` A crack, a squish.`
` ...A strange mixture of these sounds kept repeating over and over at the same tempo.`
`...Each time, a red splash landed on the tablecloth dangling nearby.`
`"Jessica-chan, ......can you hear me...?"`
`Kyrie asked this with the sort of smile any aunt might make to her niece.`
`However, Jessica didn't answer.`
`There was nothing particularly surprising about this.`
`...After all, by now, `
`...her nose had been broken, `
`her eyes had been smashed, `
`...her teeth had been knocked out, `
`and not only her nose, but her entire face was now hardly recognizable as a face, `
`...just a lump of bloody flesh...`
`Kyrie finally stopped her task of repeatedly smashing Jessica's face with the stock of her gun.`
`Still sitting on top of Jessica, she tossed her gun to the side, ...pulled a compact out of her pocket, and looked at her own face in the mirror.`
`Then, finally, ...she realized that her face was covered by speckles of fresh blood.`
`"How terrible.`
` These clothes will have to go too.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`With a muffled laugh, Kyrie shakily rose to her feet.`
`Jessica wasn't moving anymore.`
` ...She had been convulsing a bit until a second ago, but now, she was as still as stone.`
`"...Smashing a woman's face `
`is nothing new to your aunt, okay?`
` Sorry about that.`
` ...If you hadn't resisted, I could've given you a much cleaner death."`
`Kyrie pulled the tablecloth off and used it like a towel to wipe the blood from all over her body.`
`However, instead of taking the blood off, it just smeared it around...`
`and did nothing to remove the stench of blood and death that covered her.`
`When she got tired of rubbing the tablecloth against the blood, Kyrie walked over to the extension line telephone in the corner of the room.`
`Then, she dialed the number for the cousin room in the guesthouse...`
`"......Hello.`
` It's me.`
` ...It's your turn now, Battler-kun.`
` Go to the spot in front of the chapel, please.`
` ......Yes, that's right.`
` I haven't been given any instructions for Maria-chan.`
` Have her wait there.`
` ......*giggle*`
` Yes, keep your wits about you.`
` ...I'm rooting for you to be chosen as the Successor, Battler-kun."`
`With the same smile as usual and the partly-wiped splashes of blood still covering her face, ...Kyrie finished her call to Battler.`
`When she set down the receiver, there was a small knock, and Rudolf came back into the room.`
`"...Hey, you look like shit."`
`"Jessica-chan has better reflexes than I gave her credit for.`
` I didn't think she'd be able to fight back from a situation like that."`
`"It's a bit of a shame she had to end up looking like this.`
` ...What a waste of a good, Natsuhi-esque woman."`
`"And how about your end?`
` Did he give you much trouble?"`
`"No problems there.`
` Plain and simple."`
`When Kyrie heard Rudolf's instant response, she favored him with an evil smile.`
`Yes, the man she loved was the sort who could do it if he tried, without letting cheap emotions get in the way...`
`"I love you, Rudolf-san.`
` I wouldn't have it any other way."`
`"It's hard to imagine an easier job to net you a billion yen.`
` ...It's like Dad always said.`
` In the life of every man, there comes one day when he has to be willing to kill."`
`"In other words, always be determined to survive, even if you have to kill to do it.`
` ...That's my favorite line of his."`
`"What's next?`
` My rifle is hungry for blood."`
`"You've got a big job coming up.`
` Convincing Battler-kun."`
`"Ah, that's right.`
` That'll be a pain.`
` Hope I don't have to end it by pulling the trigger."`
`"I've really enjoyed `
`life as a three-person family with Ange.`
` ...But, if you really want Battler-kun to join in on that, ...give it your best."`
`"Sure.`
` ...I'll make sure we don't have any complaints from him.`
` Don't worry, I've worked out a scenario to trick him good."`
`"Good luck.`
` Even I hope that Ange's beloved big brother doesn't get caught up in the explosion accident."`
`"I know.`
` Then, I'll head back to the chapel."`
`"Rudolf-san."`
`"What...?"`
`"......If you can't convince Battler-kun..."`
`"......`
`...I know, I know.`
` If that happens, bang."`
`"Battler-kun is independent enough that he left the family out of protest when I married you, remember?`
` ...If you can only convince him halfway, and if things get nasty later on,`
` ...he'll prove fatal to us."`
`"I know.`
` Believe in me."`
`"...And if...`
` If I decide that Battler-kun is growing suspicious, `
`...I'll kill him myself.`
` He's not my kid, after all."`
`"...Yeah,`
` I know.`
` ...So, `
`promise me one thing, Kyrie."`
`"What's that...?"`
`"If...I can trick Battler, and the three of us make it off this island..."`
`"...If that happens, what?"`
`"......`
`...Never say that Battler isn't your kid again.`
` ...After all, ...you're his mother.`
` ...Please."`
`"......`
`...Sure, I promise."`
`Kyrie shrugged and answered as she loaded bullets.`
`"You go to the chapel.`
` I'll wait until Battler-kun has left, and then clean up everything inside the guesthouse."`
`"Are you sure you'll be okay doing that alone?"`
`"That's my line."`
`Battler left the guesthouse under an umbrella.`
`He had been called to the area in front of the chapel, just like George had been.`
`Not even 30 minutes had passed since the time George and Jessica had been called out.`
`...Apparently, this test didn't last too long.`
`"...Damn geezer.`
` First you never come out, not even for lunch, and then you show up in the middle of the night with a test.`
` ...I'll bet living as a shut-in's got his sense of day and night all backwards."`
`Complaining all the way, Battler strolled off into the rain.`
`Almost immediately, he was swallowed up by the darkness of the rose garden and passed out of sight...`
`......And then...`
`Kyrie could be seen coming out from the darkness of the rose garden.`
`Her right hand held a gun.`
` Her left an umbrella.`
`Her inner pocket contained the master key ring she had stolen from Gohda.`
`Her right pocket had a handful of bullets.`
` Her left held a knife she had taken from the kitchen.`
`She was a carefully and perfectly outfitted murderer.`
`Another bolt of lightning struck down from the swirling skies.`
` It lit up only half of Kyrie's face.`
`Her cheek...was still covered with Jessica's blood...`
`Under the eaves, Kyrie folded up her umbrella, smiled, and spoke to no one.`
`"Hey everyone, I'm home."`
`Rudolf could be seen under the eaves of the chapel.`
`He had hidden his gun in the nearby shadows and was now smoking a cigarette...`
`"...Should be easy to trick that dimwit.`
` ...And if it doesn't work, that's just too bad."`
`He glanced over at the place he had stowed his gun.`
`The cigarette smoke began to pleasantly cloud his mind.`
`...Battler isn't a kid anymore.`
` He's an adult, who can choose his path through life as he pleases.`
`When animals grow up, it's normal for them to form a group and go on a journey.`
`Humans are the only ones that keep treating their young like kids even after they get big...`
`"...If I'd known it'd come to this,`
` I never would've begged for you to come back.`
` ...I regret...dragging you back into the family..."`
`He puffed out those words...`
`...along with the smoke.`
`When Battler came, he didn't intend to voice those regrets of his.`
`Rudolf was already determined to play the part of the evil murderer who kills for money...`
`"...He's still not here.`
` ...What's taking him so long?"`
`At that moment, he heard the sound of someone stepping on gravel.`
`He looked up, thinking that Battler had finally arrived, ...but the sound had come from the direction opposite of the mansion.`
`"............!"`
`"...Rudolf...`
` ...How could you...`
`do that...to my husband...?!!"`
`"Aneki... So, you're alive..."`
`"Sorry that I'm alive!`
` Too bad!`
` But my husband wasn't so lucky...`
` How could you...`
`With a face obscured by anger and tears, Eva slowly walked closer, her gun raised.`
`Her husband had been killed right in front of her.`
` She probably wouldn't even hesitate.`
`Realizing that a gun, quivering with anger, was pointed right at his chest, Rudolf backed away.`
`As he pretended to retreat, ...he approached the gun he had hidden in the shadows.`
`"C-Calm down, Aneki...`
` Put the gun down...`
` ...I never wanted that to happen.`
` Everything happened so fast. There was nothing I could do...!"`
`"How can you tell such half-baked lies?!!"`
`As Eva had said, it really had been a half-baked, pointless thing to say.`
`Rudolf would have said anything if he thought it would calm Eva's emotions before she pulled the trigger, which she looked capable of doing at any moment now...`
`...Then, Rudolf's foot came in contact with his gun.`
`"L-Let's just talk this over.`
` ...George-kun should be here soon.`
` ...Oh.`
` ...Hey, George-kun, we're over here."`
`Rudolf waved, as though George was coming from behind Eva.`
`Let Eva's attention turn in that direction...`
`...That idiot.`
` My simple, big sister has always been a sucker.`
`Die!!!`
`Gunfire.`
` ...Then, a bit later, the sound of something heavier than rain drip-dropping onto the cobblestone.`
`"......Agh, `
`......nggg..."`
`"...Rudolf...`
` I've always been able to see through your tricks...!!"`
`The bullet Eva fired went straight into Rudolf's chest.`
`The bullet Rudolf fired at Eva missed, landing near her feet.`
`"Guess I was...`
`right...`
` This gun...`
`does shoot low..."`
`He dropped the gun into a puddle with a splash, staggered backwards, and leaned against the wall of the chapel.`
`"Nah, that's not it...`
` ...All good westerns end...with the bad guy's bullet missing..."`
`Eva dashed up to him, kicked away the gun that had fallen into a puddle, and grabbed Rudolf by the collar.`
`"What about George?!`
` Where is he?!`
` I won't let you kill him...!!"`
`"......Sorry, Aneki.`
` ...Already...got him."`
`"Liar!!"`
`"...Did it in the bushes over there.`
` ...Go take a look.`
` You'll see soon..."`
`"......R-`
`Rudolf, `
`...you......"`
`Eva, who claimed to know all of her little brother's tricks,`
` ...also knew that Rudolf's final words, as his consciousness began to fade thanks to the bullet wound, were not a lie.`
`"How could you... George, ...Geoooooooooooooooooorrge!!!"`
`An empty shell casing bounced off the cobblestone.`
` The furious gun barrel was pressed against Rudolf's forehead.`
`"...Go ahead and shoot.`
` ...I doubt that'll bring you much peace though."`
`A bolt of lightning turned everything white.`
`However, the wall of the chapel was stained blood red.`
`A red splash, like a crushed tomato, came out from the back of Rudolf's head and covered the wall...`
`Then, leaving a red trail behind him, `
`...Rudolf sagged downwards, `
`sat on the ground, and fell over.`
`"George, Geooooooooorge!!`
` Geooooooooorge, uwaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!"`
`Eva dashed off towards the bushes.`
` ...She found George's corpse almost immediately, screamed, and broke down sobbing.`
`...Rudolf's bloody corpse was exposed to the rain that ran down off the eaves.`
`His eyes were still wide open.`
` A fist-sized, flesh-covered hole was open in the back of his head, ...and his insides were exposed to the open air.`
`Inside was a mixed jelly of flesh, brains, and spinal fluid.`
`That goop, which looked like someone had mixed it up with a spoon, dripped from his eyes, nose, ears, mouth, and the hole in his head...`
`"...Dad, ...Dad...`
` ...Aaaaaaaaahhh...!!!"`
`Ange clutched at her head, sobbing and moaning.`
`Her father had dirtied his hands with murder over money, and on top of that, he had faced such a cruel end, and Ange had been forced to see his corpse.`
` It was hard to imagine a more painful experience for a daughter to go through.`
`...I'm totally fed up with this. It's completely meaningless.`
`"Bernkastel-san...!`
` I know you're here somewhere!`
` Please, make this game stop...!!`
` There's no point to it!"`
`As if in answer to that yell, ...a black shadow appeared a few seats in front of them.`
`Or perhaps she was sitting there the whole time.`
`Maybe we just couldn't see her until we were aware of her.`
`It was, without a doubt, the back of Bernkastel's head.`
`"Bernkastel-san...!!"`
`"...Pipe down back there.`
` Can't you watch the show quietly?"`
`The witch turned around with bored eyes.`
` ...As though the two people yelling were the strange ones.`
`"Please stop this...!`
` We realize that this is the sealed cat box world of October 4th and 5th...!"`
`The games are like messages.`
`Or maybe more like a roundabout love letter.`
`A single message can be conveyed over several games.`
`But now, we understand.`
`We know that endless tales can seep out of the sealed, two-day cat box.`
`And beyond that, I even know the culprit and the motive.`
` That has already been revealed, and it doesn't even have anything to do with this game.`
`"We both know the answer, that this is a cat box tale...!`
` So, there shouldn't be any need for any further games...!!`
` If this is supposed to be a game between you and us, then we already know the answer...!!`
` The game should be over!!"`
`"Just shut up already.`
` Didn't you hear Bern tell you to be quiet?"`
`Another shadow appeared in the next seat over, turned around, and scolded the pair.`
`"......There is a point.`
` If you just watch, you'll see it.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Are you the Game Master...?!"`
`"...Not at all."`
`"Then who is it?!`
` Could it be...Clair...?"`
`"If you watch, you'll see.`
` Not much longer now.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*."`
`"The tragedy has already reached its climax.`
` Who'll survive, I wonder?`
` Heheheheheheheheh..."`
`Bernkastel isn't the Game Master...?`
`Then who is?`
`Could Clair have created this cruel tale...?`
`Or are there even more witches playing around with this cat box...?`
`The guesthouse...was wrapped in silence.`
`There were no sounds.`
`No trace of anyone's presence.`
`No breathing from anyone alive.`
`There wasn't anything to be heard anymore...`
`If anything could be heard...`
`...It was the sound of the murderer's feet stepping across the floor...`
`Kyrie slowly passed through the lounge.`
`In her right hand...was a gun.`
`In her left hand...was a knife.`
`The knife was stained with blood, and some was still dripping from the tip,`
` ...leaving behind red tracks like a demon's footprints...`
`Her hands were filled with tools of murder.`
`So, she wasn't capable of doing anything but murder.`
`In that sense, at that moment, she was clearly and purely a murderer.`
`...The murderer went to the entrance hall,`
` and then, only after reaching the front door, looked down to see the two bloodstained hands of a killer.`
`Those hands gripped the tools of death that had performed a cruel massacre.`
`Then, at last, the murderer realized that it wouldn't even be possible to open the door like this...`
`and tossed aside the knife...`
`Then, the murderer reached out to the door, turned around calmly, ...and spoke.`
`"Sorry, everyone.`
` ...But don't worry.`
` A few days later, the newspapers will be talking about an unfortunate accident.`
` ...And I'm sure the news shows, the papers, and rumormongers everywhere will be sure that you spent your time in happy ignorance until the instant of the accident.`
` ...In other words, you'll all have had a good time until midnight on October 5th."`
`So said the one who had stained that bloody guesthouse red.`
`"At this hour, the cousins are all staying up late and playing around.`
` ...And the servants who have to get up early are all snoring.`
` The ones on the late shift are probably filling in the log or taking a break about now."`
`"...That's how it is.`
` From where I am now, I can hear laughter coming from the cousin room.`
` ......*giggle*."`
`Humans outside the cat box would probably never understand what Kyrie was saying.`
`Only she, shut inside the cat box of the explosion accident, could know what it really meant...`
`Outside, the rain poured down heavily.`
`Kyrie almost picked up an umbrella, but then stopped suddenly, as if she'd just thought of something.`
`Then, she started walking out into the rain, not caring at all whether she got wet or not...`
`Did the murderer not want an umbrella to get in the way of her gun?`
` ...Or was she hoping that the rain could act as a shower to get the blood off her?`
`"............"`
`Kyrie stopped walking.`
` As though something unexpected had caught her attention.`
`However, this time, it was no whim of hers...`
`"......How could you...`
`...kill my husband...?!!!"`
`"Oh,`
` ...Eva nee-san.`
` ...That's surprising.`
` How could I have missed you from that distance?"`
`"I'm just as surprised.`
` I didn't think I'd survive."`
`"...You came here from the underground stairway behind the chapel, right?`
` ...In that case-"`
`"That's right.`
` I bumped into Rudolf in front of the chapel!"`
`"And how was he doing?"`
`"Oh, just wonderful.`
` We managed to have a friendly sibling chat for the first time in a while."`
`"......`
`...I see.`
` ...He's such a show-off, but so unreliable in a tight spot.`
` ...Looks like he can't do anything without me after all."`
`After that short exchange of words, Kyrie already knew that Rudolf had been killed.`
`However, no trace of urgency or panic rose to her face.`
`She just closed her eyes with her usual unconcerned expression,`
` ...and when she opened them again, she had regained her composed smile.`
`"...Thank you.`
` I'm grateful.`
` This way, I really can have everything to myself."`
`"What's that blood on your clothes...?`
` You just came out of the guesthouse, didn't you...?`
` ...Don't tell me..."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ...I'm right in the middle of a murder case at the moment."`
`"You killed them?!`
` All of them?!!`
` Even Maria-chan...?!"`
`"There was no need to let them live until morning.`
` When morning came, there would be an uproar, and that could be a pain.`
` They might've used a radio to contact someone off the island and gotten help.`
` ...So, this was clearly the optimal move to take.`
` If you spin the chessboard around and look at it that way, right...?"`
`"Monster!!`
` I can't believe you could be so blinded by greed that you'd commit murder...!!"`
`"You weren't doing so bad yourself."`
`"That was an accident!!`
` I didn't mean to kill them!`
` Unlike you!!"`
`"No, just like me.`
` ...If that gun hadn't gone off, you would've kept on arguing and jumping at each other.`
` Then, the rest of you would've eventually reached the same answer as me, just a few steps slower."`
`"I'm not a murderer!!"`
`"Not true.`
` You're just a murderer who didn't get a chance.`
` You've just been saved by that accidental discharge.`
` ......If it weren't for that bit of good luck, and if I hadn't moved before you did, `
`...then you would've played the same role I'm playing now.`
` That fact won't go away, no matter how much you try to deny it. It's the truth of a different future."`
`"D-Don't try and confuse me!"`
`However, ...on the inside, Eva understood.`
`Back then, she had probably been saved by that accidental discharge, by a coincidence.`
`If the argument had continued much longer, she would surely have grown a desire to kill Krauss and the others, and might even have carried it out.`
`...She simply could not deny the existence of that demon deep within her heart.`
`Only the theatergoers knew.`
`They knew that she could become a killer in another world.`
`Kyrie, who didn't have the theatergoing ability, knew this fact as well.`
` ...Maybe there really was something extraordinary about her after all.`
`So, for some time, Eva could only grind her teeth in silence, still pointing her gun...`
`"...I don't understand.`
` You're also a mother. You've felt the pain of giving birth to your own child.`
` How can you not know how precious a life is...?!`
` How are you capable of doing all this...?!"`
`"That's the thing about kids. If you just sleep around, they get made all by themselves."`
`"That's not what I'm talking about...!!"`
`"They say that children are bonds, right?"`
`"What?!"`
`"Children are bonds used to tie you to your husband.`
` ...She was a bond to make Rudolf-san acknowledge me, so I could take him back from that woman."`
`"But you've killed Rudolf-san now.`
` ...You understand what that means, right?"`
`"What do you mean,`
` ...I understand?!"`
`"Just that right now, `
`I'm the wife of no man, and I have no intention of being a mother.`
` ...I am me.`
` Kyrie.`
` Now that Rudolf-san's dead, I'm not even an Ushiromiya anymore.`
` I live to benefit me."`
`"Right, Rudolf is dead, so maybe you aren't a wife anymore.`
` But you still have Ange-chan, don't you...?!`
` You're still a mother, aren't you...?!"`
`"Didn't you hear what I just said about bonds?`
` Now that Rudolf-san is gone, Ange is of no use to me."`
`"...Y-`
`You, `
`...how can any mother say that about her own daughter?!"`
`"Eva nee-san,`
` let's put a stop to this.`
` We can be honest here."`
`"Honest...?!"`
`"Did either of us marry because we wanted children?`
` We didn't, right?`
` We married because we wanted to live with the man we loved.`
` And, once you've married, you never want to let that man go, for the rest of your life, correct?`
` Children are just weapons to be used for that goal."`
`"I'd never have children for a reason like that...!!"`
`"But people can have children for just that reason."`
`Kyrie kept on speaking emotionlessly, ignoring the falling rain...`
`Her relaxed smile didn't falter for an instant.`
`"Ange was just a chain I used to tie Rudolf-san to me.`
` ...Or, you could call her a chess piece, someone to play the role of the kid in our family drama.`
` ...To me, Ange was nothing more than a piece, necessary so that I could act the part of the good mother in front of Rudolf-san."`
`"...You... ...Could you say that to Ange-chan's face?!"`
`"That would be just a bit too sad, so I won't say it to her directly.`
` I plan to write her a letter asking her to forgive her bad mother, then vanish from her life.`
` You've seen what Rosa-san and Maria-chan are like, right?`
` Now that Rudolf-san's gone, Ange's just a chain tying me down."`
`"...I'll go back to being just Kyrie, and enjoy the rest of my life at my leisure.`
` A new challenge, and a new life.`
` And maybe even a new love.`
` *giggle*......"`
`"...And you call yourself human...`
` ...You call yourself Ange-chan's mother?!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*`
` Who gives a damn about Ange?`
` I've never liked `
`that little brat."`
`"...H-How can you..."`
`"You've been released from your family drama too, haven't you?`
` Let's sing the praises of a woman's freedom.`
` You should thank me for having George-kun killed for you too."`
`"...Y-You...monsteeeeeeeeeer!!"`
`"Ahhahhahahahahhaaahhhyahhahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"`
`The two yells...and the sound of gunfire...thundered across the dark rose garden.`
`...Slowly, Eva fell backwards.`
`Then, she landed in a puddle, ...scattering countless drops of water.`
`Across from her, Kyrie spun around as though dancing.`
`Beautiful, black rose petals scattered around her.`
`The petals...were a dark, dark red.`
`...As they sprayed from her throat, she spun around in a circle,`
` ...and slowly crumpled.`
`Then, she fell to the ground, sending muddy water flying.`
`The two women had shot...and fallen......`
`However, when the thunder roared, only Eva sat back up...`
`"......*pant*...`
`...*pant*...`
`...*pant*..."`
`Eva hadn't been shot.`
`Kyrie's intensity had made her fall backwards, ...but the bullet had once again slipped right past her...`
`Eva cursed her good luck.`
`Why couldn't this luck have saved her husband or her son?`
`"......Die there, ...for Ange-chan's sake as well.`
` ......You'll be killed in the explosion accident.`
` Until the moment of your death, you worried about the daughter you left behind.`
` ...Yes.`
` I'll write that into the lid of the cat box......"`
`"..............."`
`When Kyrie heard this, ...blood dripped from her grinning mouth, and she seemed to say something in response.`
`However, her voice came out only as globs of blood from the hole in her throat, not words...`
`"M...`
`Mom...`
` ...Mom,`
` uwaaaaaaaaahhhhhh...!`
` It's...`
`a lie...`
` ...It's all a lie...!!`
` Aaaaaaagggghhhhhh...!!"`
`"Ange, ...please, calm down...!`
` This is just a game...!`
` That couldn't possibly be what your mother truly feels...!`
` It's just something that the Game Master made Aunt Kyrie's piece say...!!"`
`But saying that did nothing to calm Ange's sobs.`
`I don't blame her.`
` Even if she knows it's just a game, ...she's been forced to see, not only her mother's death, `
`...but also her mother announcing that she was the culprit of a mass murder, who didn't even love her own daughter.`
` Anyone would sob after hearing that...`
`"Bernkastel-san!!`
` Enough of this!!`
` I don't care who the Game Master is!!`
` Stop this pointless game right now!!"`
`When Lion yelled this, the theater suddenly went pitch-black, swallowed in darkness.`
`However, that wasn't enough to shock Lion.`
`Lion continued to yell Bernkastel's name into the darkness, telling the witch to stop this game.`
`Then, a single beam of light shone down upon the stage.`
`There was Clair, the one who had appeared for just a second right before this cruel game began.`
`"Clair...!!`
` So, ...you were the Game Master after all?!`
` ...I don't get it. Why?!"`
`Clair didn't answer.`
`...In fact, ...it looked as though she hadn't even heard.`
`Her eyes were blank, and you couldn't tell what she was looking at.`
`In fact, she was even forgetting to blink...`
`...She looked...just like a doll...`
`Then, another beam of light lit up the side of the stage.`
`Beneath that light...stood Bernkastel.`
`At the same moment, though there appeared to be no one in the audience, a thunderous applause rang out...`
`"......*giggle*."`
`Bernkastel raised her right hand in response to the applause.`
`She kept doing so until it died down...`
`"Bernkastel-san!!`
` So, ...you were the Master of this game after all...!!"`
`"...Lion,`
` how many times do I have to tell you that I'm not the Game Master?"`
`"Then are you saying it's Clair?!`
` That's impossible...!!"`
`"Yep.`
` Of course it's impossible.`
` After all, `
`Clair died.`
` ...We were just conducting her funeral.`
` Did you forget that...?"`
`"Then just who is standing there...?"`
`"A corpse.`
` She's not a mannequin.`
` So, of course, she still has her insides.`
` ...She's hiding it under a beautiful exterior, but she's actually packed full of guts."`
`When Bernkastel raised her right hand, ...a light fell on it, and a black, shining scythe appeared there.`
`It was a cold, merciless, and cruel object, like something a classic grim reaper might hold.`
`"...Wh-What are you planning to do...?"`
`"...When they're alive, you can enjoy watching them struggle.`
` When they're dead, you can enjoy tearing out their guts.`
` Tales are things you get to enjoy twice.`
` ...That's what it means to be a witch of theatergoing."`
`Bernkastel pressed the blade of her reaper's scythe against Clair's stomach...`
`and slowly slid it across.`
`Then, along the line she traced, Clair's dress was sliced open.`
`It was now clear that the scythe she held was not a fake one for theatrical use.`
` ...And, it was clear just what she planned to do next that made her cruel smile so fitting.`
`"Ange,`
` can you hear me?"`
`"......I hear you...`
` You tear me to bits, make me read!`
` What's next?!`
` Are you showing me this worst possible tale to hurt me even more?!`
` Is this fun for you?!`
` Yeah, I'll bet it is.`
` I had a blast too...!`
` You think...that I'd give up after that?!`
` You think...I'll sit around crying any longer because of that disgusting game of yours?!!"`
`"...Both you and Lion...`
`seem to have the wrong idea.`
` I'm not the Game Master.`
` This tale is not one that I created."`
`"Then that woman in the dress is the Game Master?!"`
`"No, she isn't...!`
` That can't be!`
` Then who is the Game Master?!`
` Who wove this disgusting tale?!!"`
`"You still don't understand?"`
`"What don't we understand?!!"`
`"Ange,`
` you gambled everything on a faint chance of a miracle, throwing yourself forward.`
` ...I invited you to October 4th and 5th of 1986 out of respect for your courage."`
`"...What was your goal?`
` To take your family back.`
` ...That would be a very difficult thing, and without the blessing of a miracle, a thoroughly impossible one.`
` You were prepared for that, weren't you?"`
`"Yes, I'm prepared...!!`
` And I still haven't given up on Onii-chan, Mom, and Dad!"`
`"Whether you give up or not is your choice.`
` That's your own game, after all.`
` I won't support you, and I won't even watch.`
` I've already enjoyed my fill of games that use the piece you are, so I have no need for you any longer."`
`"Glad to hear it.`
` Then why am I here?`
` Aren't you the one who invited me?!"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` I invited you here.`
` ...To thank you for entertaining me for a while, as my piece."`
`"To thank me?!`
` Hah, so this is how witches show gratitude!!`
` Sure, this has been loads of fun, you beast!`
` How could you make this kind...`
`this kind of game...`
`and do that to Dad and Mom?!!"`
`"Ange,`
` you made a wish, hoping to take your family back.`
` However, you also made another wish.`
` Remember?"`
`"No, I don't!!"`
`"You wanted to know what happened on that day."`
`What happened on Rokkenjima on October 4th and 5th, 1986?`
`Didn't Ange leave on her journey with Amakusa because she longed to answer that question?`
`"That's right...`
` So what's your point?!"`
`"...You don't...mean..."`
`Lion realized what Bernkastel was getting at.`
`Realized...and was unable to say any more...`
`The Game Master is neither Bernkastel nor Clair.`
`Then who is it...?`
`That's the wrong question.`
`There is...no Game Master.`
`That could mean only one thing...`
`"Ange,`
` you still don't understand?"`
`"...What...?"`
`"This is the truth.`
` The insides of the cat box of October 4th and 5th, 1986.`
` Afterwards, Eva survived the explosion by escaping to Kuwadorian.`
` ...And, since she never spoke of the inside of the cat box no matter how much you wanted to know, that truth was shut within the cat box for all eternity."`
`"What...are you saying...?"`
`"Only Eva returned alive.`
` Even though the police claimed it was an accident, the public didn't believe it.`
` Then, she took over her husband's company, and the harder she worked to make it more and more successful, the more enemies she made.`
` A public image of her as a great queen of conspiracy grew stronger and stronger."`
`"...I'm sure she wanted to tell people about the truth.`
` That truth that no one would ever believe without proof.`
` ...Bit by bit, Eva's heart began to snap.`
` You rejected Eva, so she rejected you in turn.`
` The relationship between the last two members of your family was strained to the limit.`
` Each time she compared you with her beloved son, she grew more and more twisted and broken."`
`Then, a strange message bottle was picked up and became a topic of conversation.`
`It contained a bizarre story, one that told of a mysterious serial murder connected to Rokkenjima's gold.`
`Everyone rejected the explosion accident theory and started to think up conspiracy theories.`
`Some of those theories named Eva as the culprit, which tormented her even more.`
`However, Eva used even that...to build up the cat box.`
`And until the moment of her death, she protected it.`
`She protected the lock that held the cat box shut.`
`So, no Human would ever reach the truth inside the cat box.`
`Not unless those witches who cross the sea of Fragments opened the lock...`
`"This is the truth."`
`"......You're lying...`
` ...You're lying, ...lying...!!`
` If this really is the truth, you should be able to say so in red!!`
` There's no way you can, of course there isn't!!`
` Nngyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"`
`"Ange...!!`
` Ange, calm down...!!`
` Uu, ...ah...?!"`
`Ange writhed with such strength that the chains on her arms and legs looked like they might snap.`
`All over her body, ...a red, gooey liquid started to seep out.`
`It was as though cracks had opened up all over her and blood was leaking out of all of them.`
`"What's that?`
` You want me to announce it clearly with the red truth?`
` Then I'll say it just for you.`
` '`
`#ff0000That this is all truth`
`"Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!"`
`Ange's yell covered up Bern's red truth.`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*, `
`ahhahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` Stupid kid.`
` If only you hadn't made me say that, you could've shut it up inside the cat box.`
` But you just had to ask, right?`
` I knew you would, of course.`
` And I so wanted to see you scream like that.`
` ...A lovely expression like that should keep me laughing for about a hundred years.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!!`
` Go back to being scrap meat.`
` Ahhahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"`
`"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh, gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!`
` Mom, Dad,`
` ...it's a lie, right?!`
`Lies,`
` ...lies...`
`...gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh......"`
`"A-Ange...!`
` Ange...?!"`
`As Ange held her head and screamed, the blood dripping from her finally grew so thick that it started scattering all over the place.`
`Then, bit by bit, her body began to melt...no, to fall apart.`
`Then, bits of her began to pile up on the chair, ...until she was nothing but a pile of guts and scraps...`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahahah, aaaahhahahahahaaaaahhaahaha!!`
` Is the truth really that sacred?`
` How absurd, how foolish!!`
` Why can't Humans control their own truth?`
` They stupidly search for the truth like that's all that matters, and when they finally find it and can't stand it, they turn themselves into scrap meat!!"`
`"Hey, are you watching?`
` Clair?`
` ......You wanted to hide this truth too, didn't you?`
` For fun, you wrote several cat box tales...`
`and planned to seal them in message bottles like the end of a mystery novel you loved.`
` Then, you threw them into the sea.`
` To save those who would suffer if they knew this truth...!!"`
`"You sealed everything in a cat box, and Eva provided the lock.`
` *giggle*giggle*!!`
` And I've sliced that box open for you...!!`
` Ahhahahahahahahahahaha,`
` all that effort you spent to hide it has gone to waste!!`
` I've exposed all of the truth you hid with your death!!`
` Ahhahahahahahhahhahhahhahha!!"`
`"Is that...what you've been after?!`
` You did all of this just to mock Clair's death?!!`
` And then, ...you showed it to Ange to make her suffer...?!`
` You really were...an evil witch after all!!"`
`"I've been a witch the whole time.`
` A traveler whose only goal is to escape boredom.`
` ...Care for it and love it while it's alive, then eat the guts when it's dead.`
` That's how witches live!"`
`"I cannot forgive you for what you've done...!!`
` You've hurt Ange and humiliated Clair, ...the person I would become in another world...!!`
` I won't forgive you...!!"`
`"Lion,`
` you're still Clair's hope.`
` Even after her death."`
`"............!"`
`"From the moment Clair got thrown off that cliff, her fate was already sealed.`
` I'm sure she felt a little bit of salvation `
`to know that another 'her' lives in happiness in another world."`
`"...That's right.`
` I'm her salvation...!`
` So, I must live life to the fullest...for the both of us...!"`
`"Lion,`
` ...let me show you just a bit more of this tale of the truth."`
`"I'm not interested!"`
`"No, it'll be very interesting.`
` ...After the duel between Eva and Kyrie, the guesthouse is wrapped in silence.`
` Let me invite you to the parlor at that point in time."`
`"The parlor...?`
` The one in the mansion?"`
`Bernkastel snapped her fingers, and the scene of the mansion's parlor unfolded before them.`
`In the cruel tale they had just been shown, the parlor hadn't been particularly important.`
`Jessica had been summoned to the parlor, but she was then immediately led to the dining hall and killed there.`
`So, there hadn't been anything to see in the parlor.`
`And, in fact, there was nothing to see in the parlor now appearing before Lion.`
`"Just what's supposed to be here?"`
`"*giggle*`
` ...As you can see, there's nothing here.`
` But watch.`
` I'm about to show you something interesting."`
`"If you call it interesting, that's a sure sign that it isn't."`
`"*giggle*giggle*`
` ...Go on, take a look.`
` ...It's right there.`
` Right in that corner."`
`Bernkastel was pointing...at nothing more than a corner of the room.`
`There was nothing there.`
`She had told Lion to look there, so the latter was expecting something terrible to be there,`
` ...but there really was nothing there at all.`
`"............??"`
`"...That's right, there's nothing there.`
` At least, not in this world.`
` But what if we peek into the next Fragment over...?"`
`"............?!"`
`On the white, blank wall,`
` ...bit by bit,`
` ...a splash of blood seeped into view.`
`Then, right there, ...a corpse appeared.`
`But...that couldn't be...`
`"...Th-`
`This is...`
`...m-`
`me...?!"`
`It was Lion, ...lying dead against the wall...`
`Ushiromiya Lion's corpse lay there exposed...`
`"Wh-What's going on here...?`
` Why am I here...?`
` This is supposed to be Clair's world, not mine...!`
` Clair and I can't exist at the same time, right...?!"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` That's because I just switched worlds, ...switched Fragments.`
` Switched to your world, that is."`
`"...I don't understand!"`
`"It's very simple.`
` They both end the same way.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"I don't get it!!`
` Why should I be dead here?!!"`
`"In your world,`
` on October 4th, 1986,`
` Beatrice's funeral was held just before the family conference."`
`"Yes, I know that.`
` And for me, that happened today, a short while ago!"`
`"I wonder what will happen between that time and late that night..."`
`"Nothing at all!!`
` The cousins will all play together, and the whole family will have dinner together!"`
`"Then comes the family conference after night falls.`
` ......You were going to succeed the Headship when you turned 20, right?`
` Was the entire family satisfied with that, I wonder...?"`
`"......I don't know if they were satisfied, but the decision had been made.`
` ...The Head made it himself."`
`"Looks like even you don't really believe they were satisfied.`
` That's it right there.`
` ...Kinzo adored you more than anything, ...so he tried to make an exception and have you succeed the Headship directly.`
` Of course, his children wouldn't have been happy with that."`
`The siblings objected to having Lion succeed the Headship.`
`Even Krauss joined in, saying that Lion was still too young.`
`Then, on the night of the family conference, Kinzo tried proposing a difficult riddle...`
`"Could it be......?"`
`"That's right.`
` The riddle of the epitaph.`
` ......As you can tell by the mechanism set into the chapel, Kinzo thought up the epitaph trick near the beginning, when the mansion on Rokkenjima was being built.`
` ...He had the romantic idea of someday using it as a test to select his successor."`
`Kinzo decided to present that riddle at the family conference.`
`Did he plan to give the position of Successor to the person who solved it?`
` Or did he promise to reconsider Lion's position as the Successor if it was solved?`
`Either way, Kinzo was confident.`
`He was confident that no one would be able to solve this tough riddle, which he had created himself.`
`"After that, everything happened exactly like the truth you just saw.`
` The siblings solved it right away, and there was a quarrel over the pile of gold.`
` *giggle*...`
` Then, Kyrie and Rudolf decided to prevent any chance of the crime being discovered the next morning and an outcry being raised... by committing murder late that night.`
` ......They used the phone to call the kids out from the cousin room one by one, then killed them."`
`"...As the first of the cousins, you were the first to be called out.`
` Then, Kyrie shot you dead right here in the parlor."`
`"...No, that's not quite right.`
` You're the Ushiromiya Lion from the early evening of October 4th, 1986.`
` So, I'll say it this way.`
` ...Tonight, Kyrie will shoot you dead in the parlor."`
`"That's......insane...`
` It's... That's right, probability!`
` Just like Lion can be born from Clair thanks to a rare miracle,`
` Aunt Kyrie only commits murder with a tiny probability, close to zero! That must be it!`
` Aren't you the witch who specializes in finding extremely improbable worlds?!!"`
`"That is correct.`
` I had to find one Fragment out of 2,578,917 in order to discover the miracle that is you.`
` ...However,`
` it was very, very easy to find this result for your world.`
` After all, probability isn't a factor.`
` ...I'm a witch who can find any miracle, no matter how unlikely it is."`
`"But I can't find things that don't exist.`
` ...If the Witch of Certainty really guarantees that something is certain, even I can't win against her."`
`"But...`
`...then...`
`...I'm......"`
`"With a 2,578,916 out of 2,578,917 probability,`
` you live in the world where you're Clair, get toyed with by an inescapable fate, and reach a tragic end.`
` And, with a 1 out of 2,578,917 probability, you live as Ushiromiya Lion...`
`and are killed by Kyrie tonight."`
`"...In other words, your fate...no, the fate the two of you share... traps you in an inescapable dead end, a hell of fate, with a 2,578,917 out of 2,578,917 probability.`
` To put it another way, it's a certain fate, with absolutely no chance for a miracle!`
` *giggle*, eheheheheheheheheheh!!`
` Sucks for you, Clair.`
` Or should I say, Beatrice."`
`Just when a bright light seemed to turn the world white, the scene suddenly changed back to the theater.`
`On the stage, Bernkastel's reaper scythe slid across Clair's stomach as the latter stood absolutely still.`
`A red line was drawn across the white skin, exposed now that the dress had been cut, and black blood began to seep out...`
`"Beatrice.`
` Trapped in that inescapable, certain, locked-away pair of days, you became a witch who could give birth to endless possibilities within that two-day cat box.`
` ...In exchange, it was absolutely certain that you would not be saved or rewarded.`
` However, you had a dream.`
` ...You dreamed of Ushiromiya Lion.`
` ...You consoled yourself with the thought of a miracle world, where you could've lived in happiness without ever becoming Clair!"`
`"......I had to work hard to find Lion.`
` Just as Beato dreamed, Lion's existence is a true miracle.`
` And, at the end of your funeral, I wanted to show you.`
` ...To show you that, even with that miracle, you couldn't have escaped from tragedy!!"`
`Through the small crack between the bars of the jail that imprisoned her,`
` the witch called Beatrice dreamed of a world where she might have been happy...`
`However, the space she could see through that crack in the bars...`
`was just another part of the same jail...`
`"The more I hear, ...the less I understand about you...!`
` Why...would you do something like this...?!"`
`"I lost a game to Beatrice, so I wanted to get back at her.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*!!`
` Yeah, now I feel a lot better about losing that game...!`
` Hey, Beato, are you watching?`
` Can you see this?!`
` And do you remember?`
` Remember when I promised you that a miracle wouldn't occur, with certainty?!"`
`"Ahhahahahahahahah, ahhahahahahaahahahahahahahaha!!`
` So, Lion!`
` Allow me to return you to your world, right before Beato's eyes!!`
` It looks like the theatergoing witches are all sick and tired of those happy family get-together scenes.`
` So, I'll send you to the moment just before Kyrie shoots you!`
` Then, I'll make Beato watch that moment!!"`
`"Ahhahahahahahhahhahhahaha!!`
` Die, scum Lion!`
` The last hope of that scum Beato, uhyahhahhyaahhaaaaaaaaahhh!!!"`
`Bernkastel raised her reaper scythe,`
` ...swung it down with gusto,`
` ...and plunged it deep into Clair's stomach...`
`"Did you think you'd get an easy death?`
` Hehihihihihihihi!!`
` But humiliating and tearing out a corpse's guts is my specialty...!!"`
`She took the blade end of the scythe and heartlessly, ruthlessly, brutally...raised it up into the air.`
`...Along a vertical line from Clair's stomach to her chest,`
` ...the blade cut deeply,`
` ...slicing Clair open.`
`The red-black insides...`
`jutted out,`
` ...then burst like a dam breaking, covering the world with dark red entrails...`
`"S-Steal the Italians' gold, you say?`
` You coward, Ushiromiya! And you call yourself a soldier of the Empire?!!"`
`"...F-Father...?`
` I-I do love and respect you, Father...`
` B-But...your feelings are something I, ummm..."`
`"Why...?!!`
` Why did you save me?!`
` Why didn't you let me die?!`
` Because of that terrible injury, ...I've been forced to live in a body like this!!`
` I never wanted to live in a body like this!!`
` This body that isn't even capable of love...!!`
` What's...what's the point in living like that?!`
` This isn't a Human's life...!!`
` It's like being furniture!!"`
`"That's right, I'm...furniture...!!`
` Furniture...!!`
` Why...why didn't you let me die back then?!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh...!!!"`
`"......Huh-"`
`When I came to,`
` ...I was in the parlor of the mansion.`
`When did I get here?`
`...I heard a sound behind me, then slowly turned around...`
`And there......`
`"Sorry. Please don't take this personally."`
`"......Huh-"`
`I could see down the frigid barrel of the gun Aunt Kyrie was pointing.`
`Then,`
` ...she slowly...`
`...pulled the trigger...`
`I could feel a razor-sharp wind pass through my body, like a knife slicing through butter.`
`...Prepared for death, and hoping to see my fate until the end, I slowly opened my eyes...`
`...The world had been cut in two.`
`Kyrie was frozen in place like a statue, still pointing her gun with a cold smile on her face...`
`...and had been cut in half at an angle, the top part of her slowly sliding off to the side.`
`No, that wasn't quite right.`
` That wasn't right at all.`
`It wasn't just Kyrie.`
` The whole world had been sliced in half at an angle...and was slowly sliding off to one side.`
`Then, immediately after fissures seemed to appear across the world, it shattered.`
`"......?!`
` ...Y-You...!"`
`"...When you own a cat, you tend to pick up their habits."`
`He pointed at Bernkastel with the tip of the pitch-black sword that had sliced the world, glaring at her.`
`"*giggle*giggle*...`
` ...What's this?`
` Are you saying you came back here on a whim...?"`
`"...There was no way you'd end things on a happy note.`
` Do you really hate Beatrice so much?"`
`"You think I'd let her win and get away...?`
` I have to pay her back in full for the humiliation she caused me.`
` When I hold a grudge, a mere century isn't long enough for me to forget it."`
`"You're a gloomy person."`
`"Come on, you mustn't neglect my heart.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"Are you okay, Lion?`
` ......Hey, what's wrong?!"`
`Lion had suddenly doubled over, groaning.`
`"......My chest...`
`...hurts...`
` ...It's..."`
`Will roughly grabbed the hand that was pressed against Lion's chest and tore it away.`
`Blood was seeping out from where Lion's hand had been.`
`...It was the place that the bullet would have entered if Kyrie had shot Lion.`
`"*giggle*`
` ...Looks like Lion's body `
`is almost ready to accept its fate."`
`"Lion, hang in there!`
` ...Damn these chains...!"`
`When Will tried to pick Lion's body up, he finally noticed the chains attached to each wrist and ankle.`
`"What's this?`
` Are you trying to take that kid and escape?`
` I won't let you.`
` I'm about to let everyone watch as Lion coughs up blood, despairing at the fact that there's no hope in any of the many worlds,`
` before finally dying in agony."`
`"Lion isn't a show."`
`Will swung his pitch-black sword and destroyed the chains binding Lion.`
`The chains and shackles shattered into little bits like glass, ...then vanished.`
`"You intend to get in the way of my fun...?"`
`"You aren't God.`
` All you can do is sneer at fate.`
` ...Lion's fate is gonna be decided by Lion.`
` You can't treat a human's fate like a toy."`
`"......*giggle*giggle*`
` Hahhahahhahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` You've got guts, saying that to the great Bernkastel, witch of the Senate!`
` I have no more use for you either, get it...?"`
`"You've shown that Beato's fantasy is a mystery and cut it to pieces.`
` You've fulfilled your role.`
` I would've let you be, if only you'd just left quietly.`
` Now that you've strolled back in here, you can hardly complain if I make you my plaything."`
`"Come to me, my cute kitties.`
` ...Scratch them up and tear off their skin.`
` Peel them like grapes...!"`
`When Bernkastel clapped her hands twice, countless pairs of glaring jewels appeared all around Will and Lion.`
`They were clearly cat eyes, but the way the drool hung from their mouths looked far more terrifying than any cat...`
`"...Will...`
` ...Aahhnn..."`
`"I'll handle this.`
` Trimming kitty nails is nothing new to me."`
`The number of jewels surrounding them already reached into the thousands.`
`Will pointed his sword in one direction after another, warding off the surrounding cats...`
`"Get a grip, Lion.`
` You haven't been shot.`
` Don't acknowledge that you have been...no, that you're going to be shot...!"`
`"......Nngggghhh..."`
`Lion tried to fight an incredible tearing pain.`
`No, ...it was a fight against the promised future that Bernkastel had shown.`
`However, the stake of that future, which the Witch of Miracles had guaranteed would contain no miracle, was firm and merciless...`
`Bit by bit, and yet unceasingly, it continued to pierce into Lion's chest...`
`"...Listen up.`
` ...I'm going to break through their perimeter for just a second.`
` When I do, you need to run with all you've got.`
` It doesn't matter where.`
` Just make sure you get far away from this place, `
`and keep on running no matter what happens."`
`"......I'll try...`
`to the best of my ability...`
` ...If I can't do it, `
`...please forgive me..."`
`"...If you can't do it?`
` Enough whining.`
` I won't forgive you.`
` Neither will Clair.`
` ...Did you forget that you're Clair's 1 in 2,578,917 chance?`
` If you give up, you're betraying all the other 'yous' in countless worlds...!!`
` So don't lose heart! Keep on struggling and struggling...!!`
` Don't look for a miracle... Be one!!"`
`"...Be...a miracle..."`
`"You're going to reach a happy future.`
` Don't give up, don't complain.`
` Just you try complaining again.`
` This time I'll pinch your ass...!"`
`"......O-Okay..."`
`"*giggle*giggle*`
` Ahhahahahahhahhahhahhahha!!`
` How very confident you are, telling this kid to be a miracle when you stand before the Witch of Miracles...!`
` Miracles are no more than fantasy!`
` Grovel in this world that has been convicted as a mystery, and die horribly like a worm!`
` The witches of theatergoing are looking forward to watching it!!"`
`"...Hmph.`
` You call that mystery?`
` You think I'd ever accept a mystery without heart?`
` Let the cat who wants to be made into a shamisen strike first."`
`"Aah, what a pain.`
` Let's have all of you at once!`
` I'm Willard H. Wright, SSVD's Head Inquisitor of Heresy.`
` This will be the final time I draw my sword...!"`
`"Trash him, kitties."`
`At once, all of the cat eyes opened wide, undulating and spinning in a spiral, then swallowed Will up.`
`But Will and Lion weren't swallowed up.`
`The cats that had flown in at them from all directions were now being launched away, like they were a balloon popping around the pair.`
`"...Oh, not bad."`
`"I don't give a damn about your kitties.`
` It's just the mama cat I care about.`
` ......Bernkastel, Witch of Miracles!!`
` It's about time someone trimmed your claws!!"`
`Another flash of the black blade spun in a dark tornado and scattered the cats once more.`
`Lion, realizing that this was the opening Will had planned, ran all out, still clutching at a heaving chest.`
`"...Will, ...I'm running!"`
`"Diana has a weak stomach.`
` Make sure you only give her milk that's warm."`
`"Huh?"`
`By the time Lion asked Will to repeat what he had said, `
`he had already leapt onto the stage and was now confronting Bernkastel.`
`It was like the climax of a show.`
` ...Loud cheers erupted from the pitch-black audience seating.`
`On either side of Clair, who lay with her insides exposed,`
` ...stood Will, with his pitch-black sword, and Bernkastel, with the scythe that could harvest miracles from fate.`
`"Kyrie and Rudolf are the culprits, and they massacred the people on the island?`
` They called Lion out to the parlor, then shot Lion to death?`
` Sorry, but I can't acknowledge this 'truth' of yours as a mystery.`
` This is all fantasy."`
`"Fantasy?`
` You're calling it that to try and let Lion escape fate?`
` By all means, try.`
` *cackle*cackle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` Ahhhahhahhahhahahahahahahahaha, hiiyaaaaaaahhaaaaaaaahhh!!!"`
`"#ff0000Rule #1. It is forbidden to have a crime without all clues presented.#ffffff"`
`...Surely, Will's black sword must have cut through Bernkastel's body.`
`However, it had no effect, ...like cutting the reflection of the moon on the water.`
`"What's this?`
` What do you mean by 'clues'?"`
`"I won't accept your 'mystery' with Kyrie and Rudolf as the culprits.`
` ...You won't find clues showing that they're the culprits no matter which game you look at."`
`"Of course you won't.`
` Even if they did exist at one point, the whole island blew up."`
`"Which means there aren't any clues.`
` And that means this is no mystery.`
` It's fantasy."`
`"...Huuh...?"`
`It's impossible for an unprovable truth to become truth in the Human world.`
`In other words, even the actual truth cannot cross the boundary of a cat box.`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Are you trying to shut the truth inside the cat box?`
` *giggle*giggle* Is this how the mystery genre is supposed to fight?`
` Ahhahhahhahhahahahahahahahaha!`
` Hiiyahhhahahahahahaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`With a laugh like the howl of a wild animal, Bernkastel carelessly tossed her scythe aside.`
`"Fighting itself is a waste of time.`
` Get over here, scum.`
` Try and cut me all you like.`
` I'll listen to all you've got to say."`
`"...The twenty wedges will pierce every part of your heartless mystery.`
` Here it comes."`
`"And when you realize that you can't defeat me with those twenty wedges, ...you know what'll happen next, right?`
` *giggle* Come on.`
` I'll play with you, ...if that's what you want!"`
`"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!"`
`Trying to ignore an incredible pain in the chest, ...Lion kept on running and running without stopping.`
`I dashed out of the theater of the theatergoing witches, then ran through an incomprehensible world of blackness.`
`Before I knew it, I was running through a place that looked like a sea of stars,`
` ...or maybe the bottom of the ocean with stars scattered around.`
`If I get careless for a second, I'll probably trip.`
`No, if I get careless, I won't be able to tell if I'm running...`
`or just making running motions as I free fall, endlessly sinking deeper into the ocean of stars.`
`I just kept on running, without any goal or target.`
`I mustn't stop moving.`
`I mustn't fall down here.`
`If I fall, ...I'll crush the hope of the 'me's in countless worlds...`
`There's a happy world that the Beatrices dreamed of.`
`And I'm their last hope, the only one who can reach that world...`
`...Even though I understand this, ...the 'truth' thrust in front of me by the witch who controls miracles, who says there can be no miracle,`
` is cruelly gouging itself into my chest...`
`"......`
`...Sorry, ...Will...`
` ...My body's...already......"`
`Then, Lion finally...`
`...succumbed to the fierce pain and fate...`
`...and fell over...`
`Lion's body was held roughly from behind and lifted up.`
`".........!!`
` ...W-Will...!!`
` You're okay...!"`
`"No, not really.`
` ...Don't you give up. Didn't I tell you I'd pinch your ass?"`
`"...Sorry...`
` ...I'm really sorry...`
` ...But...`
`on that day, in that place, I was fated to be killed..."`
`"That's right.`
` All humans are fated to die in the end.`
` Does that mean their lives are meaningless?`
` Of course not.`
` What a person's life means, what it's worth, what it is...these are things each person decides for themselves.`
` ...No matter what sort of fate is forced upon them.`
` Don't accept it.`
` Create your own world...for yourself...!"`
`"......Will, ...your...left arm...!"`
`"Ah, right... Must have forgotten it.`
` It'd be a pain to go back and get it now."`
`There were rips all over Will's body.`
`Also, his left arm had been brutally torn off from the elbow, his clothes were in tatters, ...and he looked like a bloodstained scarecrow...`
`Then, Lion noticed.`
`Though this place had once felt like a sea filled with stars, both above and below them,`
` ...those stars had now gathered together and were surrounding them...`
`It was a huge, even number of stars, all glaring at the two of them...`
`Will was holding Lion with one arm.`
` He couldn't take his sword out.`
`However, he didn't let go.`
`...He was determined to let Lion escape from here, to lead Lion towards the happy tale that the Beatrices had dreamed of.`
`Behind the cats whose eyes glowed out of the empty darkness, ...the queen of cats who permitted no miracles appeared...`
`"......Willard,`
` put Lion down.`
` If you do, I'll let you go."`
`"Go file a protest with the Great Court.`
` You can put it up for debate."`
`"...Will, `
`...I..."`
`"I won't leave you behind.`
` ...I need to tell you.`
` To tell you why I quit SSVD."`
`"...Come to think of it, even I don't know that.`
` ...Why'd you do it?"`
`"It's because I got fed up with all those damn sob story mysteries.`
` ...We'll survive and reach a happy ending."`
`"I'll show her.`
` Beatrice died in despair, thinking that there were only bad endings.`
` I'll show her that a happy ending can exist. That's why I'll never put you down."`
`"......Will..."`
`"You can take the rest of my left arm, cats.`
` I'll give you my legs too, if you want them.`
` ...But I'm not letting go of Lion here.`
` ...I'll take Lion away from the bad ending you represent, even if I have to crawl my way out of here...!"`
`"Are you okay with this, Lion?`
` Will's planning to die protecting you.`
` You don't want that, right?`
` Go ahead and tell him to leave you be and save himself."`
`"......Will..."`
`"Yeah."`
`"...Please, ...don't leave me here...!`
` ...I'll certainly survive!`
` And so will you...!!"`
`"That's the spirit."`
`As he said this, Will held Lion tight.`
`"There you have it.`
` We'll keep struggling on, Bernkastel."`
`"We won't give up on the chance of a miracle...!"`
`"You're saying that? When the Witch of Miracles has promised with certainty that there will be no miracles?`
` ......*giggle*giggle* `
`Hehehehehehahahahahahaha!!`
` So long, you two.`
` Go collect dust in the depths of oblivion, unable even to die, and disappear!!"`
`"Come, my kitties.`
` I won't order you to kill them.`
` Just clean up the two pieces whose role has ended."`
`A hundred million, a trillion, ten quadrillion cats all bared their fangs.`
`In the starry sky of cat eyes, countless flesh-colored mouths opened, exposing countless teeth.`
`...The world was wrapped in flesh and blood and fangs.`
`Two white pieces were set on the chessboard.`
`...The countless black pieces surrounding them were now just packed together, not even placed on the squares.`
`Bernkastel tipped the two white pieces over...`
`and took them off the board.`
`"Is it really okay to end it like this?"`
`"...Yes.`
` Yes, as usual, your reading truly does fall comfortably on my ears, my miko."`
`"As you wished, I've scraped out even the inner parts of the guts.`
` Was that enough of an answer check for you?"`
`"Indeed.`
` ...I am quite satisfied.`
` Using the answer you have revealed as a key, I will go back through all the tales so far,`
` opening the closed rooms like treasure boxes, one by one."`
`"...It's fun finding the key.`
` And it's even more fun to stick it into all the locks.`
` You have done very well, my miko.`
` From now on, let me enjoy my thoughts alone.`
` This has been enough..."`
`The Witch of Theatergoing sat back in her rocking chair, a satisfied smile on her face, as though enjoying a pleasant aftertaste.`
`There was no need for a game board anymore.`
`She just had to go back in her mind, through the whole set of tales, to check whether her theory was right or not.`
`It seemed to leave her pleasantly drunk, even better than the most expensive wine...`
`"...Are you done with me now?"`
`"You have done well, my miko.`
` I absolve you of your duty.`
` ...I will return to my slumber.`
` I'd like to enjoy this pleasant dream for a few more centuries."`
`"And when I grow tired of that,`
` ...you will find yet another tale to keep me entertained.`
` ...For those centuries, which will pass in the blink of an eye,`
` I grant you your freedom."`
`"Heheheheheh...`
` Splendidly done, Bernkastel, my cute, cute miko..."`
`"...It's not like I care.`
` Go ahead, dry up and die.`
` So long, for the rest of time."`
`"You call a few mere centuries 'for the rest of time'?`
` *cackle*cackle*...`
`......"`
`Featherine's consciousness slowly faded away.`
`As the owner of the study's slumber grew deeper,`
` ...the lights about the room slowly darkened.`
`"Good night forever, Auaurora.`
` ......You don't need this game board anymore.`
` I'll take it."`
`Bernkastel reached out towards Beato's game board, which lay on the table in front of Featherine's rocking chair, and tapped it twice.`
`The game board and the pieces flew into the air, folded up and put themselves away, then landed on Bernkastel's outstretched right hand.`
`"...I still haven't had a chance to do any real Game Mastering.`
` ...I just did Beato's funeral.`
` That, and tearing out the guts.`
` ...I still haven't done anything."`
`Bernkastel's smile twisted evilly.`
`Then, the game board floated up once again, ...and a world unfolded itself above Bernkastel's palm...`
`"Hey, pieces of Beato's game...?`
` I'm gonna have you spin a incredibly brutal tale that I'll find incredibly entertaining.`
` Tremble in fear of the certain fate you've been promised.`
` ...By the name of Bernkastel, Witch of Miracles,`
` ...and as the final Game Master of Beato's game, I proclaim it."`
`"...Though just saying it would be boring.`
` ...Maybe I should follow Beato's rules and say it in red."`
`"Are you sure?`
` There might still be some witches with naive hopes."`
`"Ah, Lambda. So you're here?`
` Of course, you're always wherever I am."`
`"Go on and say it.`
` You tell those naive dreamers."`
`"Yes, I will.`
` ......As the Witch of Miracles, and as the final Game Master, I proclaim the start of the final game...`
`and make you this promise."`
`#ff0000I won't give this game a happy ending.#ffffff`
`*sob*.`
` ...*sob*sob*...`
`A single girl...was crying in a desolate, quiet chapel.`
`She was a small girl.`
` ...Only six years old.`
`The girl who would, for 12 years starting now, lament the fact that she wasn't on this island during October 4th and 5th, 1986...`
`Then, `
`...a single man appeared...`
`The man noticed the girl,`
` walked up to her quietly, trying not to scare her, `
`...and put his arms gently around her shoulders...`
`"......Onii-chan......"`
`"I've been looking for you, Ange..."`
`The girl jumped into her big brother's chest and started crying again...`
`"What's wrong?`
` ...Why are you so sad?"`
`"Today, a kid in class bullied me...`
` He said the people on TV were saying Mom had ties to bad people.`
` ...So, he said that Mom and Dad were the culprits, and that they probably killed everyone...`
` ...I asked Aunt Eva, hoping she'd say it wasn't true, but she didn't say anything...`
` ...Mom and Dad aren't bad people, right?`
` Right...?"`
`"Poor kid...`
` ...Everyone keeps saying whatever they like about what might've happened on that island on that day...`
` ...Sit over here."`
`"......Okay..."`
`When the man pointed to the floor, a cloud of gold butterflies gathered there and created a chair.`
`The girl obediently sat down on it...`
`"...You know, don't you, Onii-chan?`
` You know that Mom and Dad aren't bad people, right?"`
`"Yeah. Of course I know that.`
` ...I know that none of them were bad people."`
`"Then tell me.`
` What happened that day?`
` What happened on Rokkenjima?"`
`"Okay.`
` ...I'll tell you.`
` This is what happened on that day."`
`"Is it...a scary story...?"`
`"Of course not."`
`"Is it a sad story...?"`
`"Not at all."`
`"Then...what kind of story is it...?"`
`"You can decide that for yourself when you hear it.`
` It definitely isn't a painful story.`
` So listen up."`
`"Okay,`
` Battler onii-chan..."`
`"On that day, we all went to Rokkenjima.`
` There were a lot of us.`
` It was an important day, the day of the family conference.`
` ...Hmm, where should I begin?"`
`This is...`
`The final game, made just for Ange.`
`Listen, Ange.`
`This is what happened on Rokkenjima on that day.`
`It isn't sad or painful at all......`
`The majestic Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating set down her pen, looked at the ceiling, and sighed deeply.`
`The desk was covered with a scattered mountain of paper covered with writing.`
`Words were packed onto the pages in a thin, high information density language that only the great ones could read.`
`Each letter of this language carried the same amount of information as several books in the Human world.`
`These letters filled every inch of this huge pile of paper.`
`...Surely, she had written out every little detail of some world.`
`"......Yes, I have written it all.`
` Though to be accurate, I have not truly written it all."`
`She stood up, sat down in her favorite rocking chair, and rocked peacefully for a while.`
`"How far must one write before they can say they've written it all?`
` ...That is what has bothered me in all my years of writing.`
` ...The adventures of Humans can be very interesting as a tale.`
` However, even I still don't know when that adventure stops being an adventure."`
`"...My old friend, who is now gone,`
` once said that a Human's life is an adventure from beginning to end, so there is never a correct time to set down one's pen.`
` ...I do not agree.`
` I think one must put away the pen at some point.`
` I believe one should write a tale to an appropriate point, then leave the aftertaste and opinions to the minds of the spectators."`
`"...In short, the tale must be put inside a cat box at the appropriate time.`
` ...The cat box has been the subject of this long tale, so is it not better to refrain from writing its demise, to instead put it in the cat box and leave it there...?"`
`Featherine...spoke to no one inside the empty study.`
`Of course, no one commented on her words.`
`However, Featherine seemed to hear something.`
`She nodded and grinned contentedly.`
`"Yes, I know.`
` I will write a bit further, then lay down my pen.`
` ...Then, it will be time for us to say our goodbyes."`
`Featherine held up a finger and spun it around, a signal that she wanted to darken the room.`
`The lights in the study dimmed...`
`"Would you mind letting me rest for a while?`
` ...During that time, my cat...or rather, my miko will entertain you..."`
`"Owowowowowowowowow, `
`you suck! Can't you be less clumsy with that needle?!"`
`"...Shut up.`
` If you don't want it sewn by hand, `
`I'll use a sewing machine."`
`"No! No machines!`
` I want you to do it by hand!`
` So please, just be a bit more gentle...owow!"`
`"It'll get better if you spit on it."`
`"Gyah!!`
` Don't just start licking me all of a sudden!"`
`"Hmm, I think this needle should be thick enough.`
` This'll hurt like hell, so you'd better close your eyes.`
` 5, 4, 3, 2-"`
`"D-Don't say that right before you start!!`
` Gyaaah, gyaaaaahhh!!"`
`But despite all this, the two of them truly were close.`
`Though Lambdadelta had been brutally dismembered in the final fight, she had survived.`
`But, unfortunately, she was still dismembered.`
`So, Bernkastel was sewing her arms and head back on with a needle and thread.`
`The left arm, which was still waiting to be reattached, walked around on the bed impatiently with its index and middle fingers.`
`Only the arms were left to do, so it looked like this would be finished soon.`
`Then, Erika returned, slamming the door open.`
`"I'm home, my master!!`
` I bought some sesame salt!!"`
`"...Why sesame salt?`
` You aren't planning to put it in tea, are you...?"`
`"It's Erika's toy.`
` ...Erika, did you bring your chopsticks?"`
`"Yes, my master!!`
` Great detectives have their magnifying glasses!`
` Furudo Erika has her chopsticks."`
`"Are you ready?`
` Pour out that sesame salt and use those chopsticks to separate the sesame seeds from the salt."`
`"Yes, my master!!`
` Please watch my fantastic chopstick-weilding skills!!"`
`"Yeah, good luck.`
` ...When you're done, make sure you put everything back in the bag."`
`"......Are you still bullying her like that?"`
`"How rude. I'm playing with her.`
` ......Ah, yes, Erika.`
` The mailman just came by with a letter addressed to you."`
`"A letter?!`
` I sense a crime calling to me.`
` Don't tell me, I'll guess who sent it!"`
`"......The postmark is from Heaven.`
` It's probably from Dlanor or someone.`
` I'm surprised you're still in touch.`
` ...Just by the presence of this postmark,`
` see how far Bernkastel's reasoning has taken her."`
`"Hey!!`
` You can't do that, my master!`
` Van Dine's 9th!`
` It's forbidden to have multiple detectives!"`
`"...Then you'd better get out.`
` So long, Great Detective Erika."`
`"My master, how could you?!! I'm Erika, Witch of Truth!"`
`"...I still can't tell if you two like each other or hate each other."`
`"Of course we hate each other.`
` You're the only one I love."`
`"H-How could you, my master?!!`
` Lady Lambdadelta!`
` It looks like there's not enough room for the two of us!"`
`"Are you serious?`
` ...Are you challenging the great Lambdadelta?"`
`Erika grinned and grabbed Lambdadelta's left arm, which had been walking around the bed.`
`"I have here Lady Lambdadelta's arm.`
` And here is the sliced-open end of her arm."`
`Erika grinned and wiggled her fingers menacingly.`
`"Wait, ...you aren't thinking......"`
`"Let's see if my rival can handle this."`
`"Gyah, `
`gyahhahahahahahaahaha, `
`ahhhyahahahaha, `
`stoppit that tickleeeeeees!!"`
`...She tickled the inside of Lambdadelta's left arm.`
` Apparently, she was extremely ticklish there.`
`Incidentally, the open end of Lambdadelta's arm had cute, fluffy, white cotton candy poking out.`
`Apparently, her body was made out of sweet candy, with a bit of spice thrown in.`
`Put your mind at ease, as there is nothing remotely terrifying about this scene.`
`Erika ran around, screaming 'I've defeated Lady Lambdadelta all by myself, just like my master!'`
` Lambdadelta growled and hissed at her.`
` Bernkastel kept on sewing, an exasperated look on her face.`
`It was a very peaceful scene...`
`"So?`
` What does the letter say?"`
`"Anything about what Dlanor and the others have been up to?"`
`"Gertrude-san has been promoted to a full Inquisitor or something.`
` Well, good for her, yay.`
` ...Ooh, in addition to her cat, she's got a meowoof now too."`
`"......What's a meowoof...?"`
`"What, you don't know?! You're so out of touch!`
` They've been all the rage lately!`
` Even I got a female meowoof a few days back.`
` You can make awesome konpeitou with them too!"`
`"...I'm totally lost, but I'll make sure I stay far away from your homemade food in the future..."`
`"Cornelia-san is......oooh.`
` During an inquisitor exam, she found that she's really good at fighting, so she's started combat training.`
` Pretty hard to imagine her doing that, right?"`
`"Well, there's all kinds of combat training.`
` What's she doing?"`
`"Looks like kickboxing and Chinese Kenpo.`
` Could that be Eva's influence?"`
`"......I'll bet she'd fight pretty good standing on one leg."`
`"Good point.`
` After all, she's been trained pretty well by a certain someone already."`
`"It also mentions Will-san.`
` Ah, there's a surprise!`
` Looks like Will-san hit it big on the foreign exchange market, and he's now living a life of leisure on the income from his real estate investments...!`
` Sounds like he's started playing badminton lately too."`
`"...I'll bet he has a hellish coach."`
`"His butt's probably swollen by now."`
`"So, what about Dlanor?"`
`"As usual, she's stamping things, `
`stamping things, `
`sealing things, `
`approving things, `
`and sometimes even signing things.`
` She humbly asks us to stir up a crime in her district, since she would get assigned to it personally."`
`"Well, why don't we?`
` Crime sounds fun."`
`"They say crimes occur wherever the detective goes."`
`"One of these days.`
` If I feel like it, I might drop by to bully her.`
` Oh, and there's also something here about the Chiester Sisters Corps."`
`"......Wait.`
` I don't want to hear it all at once.`
` You've gotta pause a bit for dramatic effect.`
` ......Okay, that'll do it."`
`"Ah, I finally grew my right arm back!`
` Do the left one now, please!"`
`"Let's have some tea first.`
` ...Erika, bring in a can of black tea and the pot of dried plums."`
`"Yes, my master!"`
`With this particular journey over and done with, the Voyager witches rested their wings.`
`...It was all so that they could leave on a new journey in search of the next Fragment.`
`A short break between trips, backdropped by the pleasant scent of black tea...`
`"Where are you going this time?"`
`"...If you go north, I'm heading south."`
`"Then if you go east, I'm heading west."`
`"...I hope we can find another charming tale like this one."`
`"Next time, I hope you aren't playing the villain again, Bern."`
`"You do?`
` Being the bad guy was pretty fun."`
`"...I wonder...what kind of tale we'll find next."`
`"And what kind of tale we'll next meet in."`
`"To a pair of lovers, the sea of Fragments is tiny."`
`"Children of Paradise."`
`"The sea of Fragments is pretty huge."`
`"Ghost in the Shell."`
`"We'll meet again.`
` When something else cries."`
`"......Sounds good.`
` Let's do that."`
`""We will meet again. When something else cries.""`
`Ahhahahahahahahahahaha...`
`The happy voices of the witches faded into the distance.`
`So long, everyone.`
`See you again, when something else cries.`
`It was the largest banquet hall in this huge hotel.`
`The many guests that filled the room chattered and applauded the person receiving an award trophy on top of the stage.`
`The sign in front said 'Awards Ceremony from Japan's Greatest Publishers'.`
`"And now, I would like to begin the novel category.`
` The winner...is that fantasy adventure novel we all know so well,`
` the story that started a worldwide movement `
`that continues to grow in leaps and bounds, `
`'Sakutarou's Great Adventure'!"`
`The projector in front of the audience showed a brief summary of the series.`
`It was...a lengthy fantasy adventure novel that was already more than 8 installments long.`
`The thrilling fantasy story told of the adventures of Sakutarou, a cowardly vegeta-lion who makes friends, learns through his experiences, and grows in his search for the One Fragment.`
`The main character's catch phrase, 'I'll become the King of the Beasts', was even one of the candidates for the Buzzwords of the Year award.`
`In addition to being a thrill to read, the books also contained many messages for children to learn from,`
` earning it high praise as an adventure novel that parents and kids could enjoy reading together.`
`However, it hadn't received such praise from the beginning.`
`For the first six volumes, it went almost entirely unnoticed,`
` but last year, when foreign translations of the series began, it got its big break and suddenly became a huge topic of conversation.`
`Even before this series, the author had created quite a lot of works,`
` but none of those achieved any public acclaim.`
`However, after this sudden rise in notoriety, her previous works were being reevaluated one after another.`
`In that sense, it's probably fair to call her an author who went unrecognized for quite a long time.`
`"Miss Kotobuki...!!`
` Congratulations on your award!"`
`"Your latest, 'Sakutarou goes to the Witch's Island', was truly an excellent read!"`
`Publishing company executives repeatedly showered her with praise.`
`'Sakutarou's Great Adventure'.`
`The author's name...was Kotobuki Yukari (寿ゆ㝋り).`
`Nearly all of her royalties were sent to a fund to support needy children,`
` and she herself had served as the director at several protective institutions.`
`Some envious people tried to call this fake charity, `
`but the more that people learned about her, the more those voices withered and died away.`
`Kotobuki Yukari.`
`By now, that name rang loud and clear across Japan.`
`She sat in a chair, cheerfully chatting with the people who came to greet her.`
`Last year, she was diagnosed with the initial stages of cancer, and after the surgery, her physical strength dropped sharply.`
`Because of this, even in this stand-up awards party, she was given a chair and sat down while greeting people.`
`Some people lamented, saying that if only she had been 20, even 10 years younger,`
` ...she might have left her mark in history as one of the greatest authors in the 21st century.`
`It had taken so long for her to receive the praise she deserved...`
`She could no longer be called young.`
`Even so, her determination to write had not wavered in the slightest.`
`The story had gone around that, even during her stay in the hospital, most of her time had been spent typing away.`
`She always said the same thing.`
`...That she hadn't finished telling everything she needed to tell.`
`Did she mean that she hadn't fully completed 'Sakutarou's Great Adventure'?`
`When that question was asked by a journalist, this is how she answered...`
`If, by writing even one more book, I can teach just one more child how to find happiness...`
`Then I will spend the rest of my life writing every book, every page that I can.`
`...Because I still haven't fully conveyed the precious teachings I was given...`
`"Miss Kotobuki, congratulations on your award!`
` I hear the movie adaptation has been getting splendid reviews as well!`
` If you keep this up, you might even pass up Hari-Pota's record!"`
`'Harry the Potato'.`
`It was the name of a fantasy series that had become a worldwide hit.`
`"Thank you very much for your kind words.`
` It's more than I deserve..."`
`"Oh, I forgot to tell you...!`
` My name is Eks, head of Company X's first editorial department."`
`"It is an honor to meet you...`
` I hope we have a chance to work together sometime..."`
`"Actually, Miss Kotobuki...`
` I, uh, apologize for being abrupt,`
` ...but have you heard of the novelist known as `
`Hachijo Tohya?"`
`"Hachijo...Tohya, ...you say?"`
`She remembered that name from several decades ago.`
`She hadn't expected to ever hear it again.`
`"Do you know that name?`
` Have you met Hachijo, by any chance...?"`
`"No, I have not...`
` I did go to visit once, but I was an unknown back then.`
` And, since I suddenly barged into the publishing company office, it's hardly surprising that I was refused an interview..."`
`"Oh, I didn't know that...!`
` Could it be that you're a fan of Hachijo's work...?"`
`"No.`
` I just wanted to find out what sort of person she was..."`
`"I see, I see.`
` ...Well, the truth is...about that novelist... ...Hachijo Tohya would like to meet with you discreetly."`
`".........`
`...To meet with...me?"`
`"Yes.`
` Not as a formal interview, but personally, off the record...`
` If you're interested, we would be happy to arrange the meeting...`
` But, of course,`
` this has nothing to do with work!"`
`......Hachijo Tohya...wants to meet...Kotobuki Yukari.`
`Just like how I realized that Itouikukuro was Hachijo Tohya,`
` ...did she use my name to figure out my identity?`
`The Rokkenjima mystery has been called one of the greatest social phenomena at the turn of the century.`
`That uproar, which dragged in enthusiasts from across the world,`
` suddenly subsided after an event held by Hachijo Tohya, where she was going to 'unveil the diary of Ushiromiya Eva, which contained the truth'.`
`Though she had set up the event herself, she then outrageously disappeared without releasing the contents of the diary, drawing harsh criticism for doing so.`
`However, a very, very obvious feeling had been revived in the public sphere: that they had been prying into a terrible accident with many victims purely out of curiosity.`
`And so, the frenzy surrounding the Rokkenjima mystery had faded away quietly...`
`Hachijo Tohya.`
` No, Itouikukuro.`
`She caught the public eye as a Forger of Rokkenjima mysteries.`
`She claimed to have reached the truth...and released groundbreaking works of fiction one after another.`
` She became famous as the driving force behind the Rokkenjima mystery.`
`After realizing that Itouikukuro was Hachijo Tohya, I went to her publishing company to ask for an interview, but I didn't get one.`
`At the time, I despised her.`
`Back in the beginning, I thought she might have used the Rokkenjima mystery as a publicity stunt to advance herself,`
` ...but now I feel a bit grateful to her.`
`If she hadn't refused to show the diary in such an outrageous way,`
` the Rokkenjima cat box might still be the plaything of countless goats.`
`She was indeed a Forger who had toyed with the cat box, and I still had an uneasy feeling about her.`
`However, at the same time, she was the one who, practically speaking, allowed Rokkenjima to rest in peace.`
`And, ...did she really reach the truth?`
`How had she reached something that seemed infinitely close to the truth, 'even from my perspective'?`
`Even now, after all these years,`
` ......that's something I've wanted to know.`
`"What do you think, Miss Kotobuki...?`
` Of course, this is not an urgent request.`
` I was told to tell you to take your time in making your decision if you wished..."`
`"I understand.`
` ...Does Hachijo Tohya live near the city?"`
`"I was told that a meeting near here would be satisfactory at any time...!"`
`"I see.`
` ...In that case, can I ask you to arrange a meeting for us in a quiet coffee shop next Sunday...?"`
`"Yes, as you wish...!`
` Thank you, thank you very much!`
` I believe Hachijo will be delighted as well...!"`
`"I have one condition."`
`"Yes, whatever you say...!"`
`"I am not going to discuss business, so please refrain from sending anyone from the editing department."`
`"But of course! We will do as you say."`
`"Madam Hachijo and I will meet alone, just the two of us.`
` Can I count on you to keep that promise...?"`
`"Well, as to that......`
` ...We would, umm, appreciate it if you kept this quiet, but..."`
`"What is it...?"`
`"...Well, the truth is...`
` ...The works of Hachijo Tohya were written by two people.`
` To the outside world, those books were written by a single female author,`
` ...but there is actually a second author, a male one...`
` ...The pair of them asked for a chance to meet you..."`
`As soon as I heard that,`
` ...I felt a premonition.`
`...How had Hachijo Tohya, a person with no connections to the Ushiromiya family, managed to write about it in such detail?`
`I was already feeling a premonition of a certain kind of miracle...`
`When I left on my journey, I abandoned the name of Ushiromiya Ange and stepped into a new life.`
`By now, things have settled down, but when the Sumadera family was still a threat, I wanted to distance myself from that name.`
`...Thanks to that, no one was able to get in touch with the new 'me' anymore.`
`However, now that 'Sakutarou's Adventure' has caught the public eye this year and made the name of Kotobuki Yukari famous,`
` ...maybe it finally reached his ears.`
`I used to play with a lion stuffed animal called Sakutarou, along with Maria onee-chan.`
`If those who knew this connected the name Sakutarou with my name, ...then it's only natural that they'd figure out who I was.`
`The number of people who would be able to recognize me from that was very, very small.`
`......This person was also well-versed in detective novels, and a man.`
`I could only think of one person who matched.`
`After all, I knew just how many detective novels he had piled up in his room, from the time when his effects were gone through.`
`It was almost the time we had arranged for our meeting.`
`My heart was racing, ...almost like a girl in love for the first time...`
`At the very instant that the arranged time came, I heard the sound of the chime on the door,`
` ...and they appeared.`
`It was a man sitting on a wheelchair...and a woman pushing him.`
`My eyes immediately fixed on the man in the wheelchair.`
`...And, right away, ...I saw the traces that remained on his face...`
`There's no doubt about it.`
` .........He's my brother.`
`My brother, ...Ushiromiya Battler...`
`When our eyes met, he gave a little bow.`
` I hurried to my feet and bowed back.`
`...It was a somewhat exaggerated and silly way for a pair of siblings to greet each other after several decades apart.`
`However, ...my mind was already blank.`
` ...The miracle I had waited for all this time was now a reality.`
`"...Are you Miss Kotobuki Yukari?"`
`"Yes, I am...`
` ...And you two must be...Hachijo Tohya."`
`"It's a pleasure to meet you.`
` Thank you very much for letting us borrow your precious time today.`
` My name is Hachijo Ikuko.`
` I am mostly in charge of the actual writing.`
` ...This is Tohya.`
` He mostly handles the drafting."`
`Though the woman who called herself Ikuko was far older than me, she seemed to be unbelievably youthful.`
`It wasn't because she was good with makeup or dressed like a younger woman.`
`It feels strange to say it...`
`There was a strange mystique about her, ...as though she was immortal and never-aging.`
`Then, I quickly remembered that she had introduced my brother as Tohya.`
`"...Pardon me for asking, ...but are you two married?"`
`"We are not married, but we have been together for a long time."`
`"True. Looking back on it, it really has been a long time..."`
`My brother smiled as he spoke.`
`...When I learned that, at least for him, those long decades hadn't been a period of isolation and loneliness,`
` I felt an incredible sense of peace and relief.`
`Before I knew it, he was staring back into my face.`
`Well, I was just six years old the last time we met.`
` It must be hard for him to find any traces he can recognize.`
`However, ...I'm sure he'll recognize something, just the same.`
`We kept stealing glances at each other and looking away, like a couple on a blind date.`
`We were both at an age where outside appearances mattered to us.`
` Even though we both knew, we wouldn't let our polite exterior falter.`
`This humorous exchange was extremely embarrassing.`
`...I thought it would be a fated reunion, that we would hold each other and sob tears of gratitude together.`
`However, reality seemed to be different...`
`But that's fine.`
`It feels like my heart will explode with happiness...`
`"Let's take our orders.`
` Is coffee okay?`
` What does everyone want?"`
`"I'd prefer something that isn't so bitter.`
` ...How about you, Miss Kotobuki?"`
`"Oh, ...I don't mind...`
` ...I guess I'll have cafe au lait..."`
`How stiff we're all being.`
`Even my brother seemed to be finding it amusing by now.`
`"......Well now."`
`When she said that, my brother and I fell silent and sat up straight.`
`"Should I start?`
` Or will we start with you, Tohya?"`
`"......I'll go first.`
` I'm the one who pushed so hard for this meeting, after all."`
`As he spoke, he watched me calmly.`
`"I came here today...thinking that you might be a certain person.`
` Her name is Ushiromiya Ange.`
` ...When I read your works and heard your name, I was sure that you were her."`
`"That's right.`
` ...How long it's been since I last used that name.`
` My true name is Ushiromiya Ange..."`
`I gave the exaggerated bow that I'd gotten so used to these long years.`
`...We've both aged, haven't we, Onii-chan?`
`I whispered this in my heart.`
`Now, it was my turn.`
`With a quick apology, I fished around in my handbag and took out a photo.`
`It was a picture from a trip I'd taken to an amusement park with Battler onii-chan.`
`I had many other pictures of us having a good time, but this one had the best shot of his face.`
`I looked between him and the photo.`
`There was no longer any room for doubt.`
`"...Mr. Tohya,`
` your true name is...Ushiromiya Battler...san, isn't it...?"`
`The hands of the clock inside me stopped.`
`I wanted him to answer with a yes...`
`Even though I was already so sure, ...I was still about to burst with the tension.`
`And then, when that instant that seemed far too long ended, my brother answered.`
`"That's right."`
`"............"`
`Unconsciously, I stared at my brother's face.`
`With unbelievable quickness, he acknowledged that he was Ushiromiya Battler.`
`...My eyes immediately filled and overflowed with tears...`
`I took out a handkerchief and wiped them away, but I couldn't hold them back...`
`Onii-chan was alive after all...`
`So, why didn't he come back to me right away?`
`If he had been there during my darkest days, it would have meant so much to me...`
`Normally, the thought would have made me curse my brother, but by now, even that emotion was softened.`
`After all, now that I was faced with the miracle of being reunited with Onii-chan, ...everything I'd felt before fell away with my tears.`
`At this moment, ...I was happy.`
`I was never alone.`
`I worked so hard for decades with that belief in my heart.`
`And now, I've finally...been rewarded...`
`By now, I couldn't even stop my tears.`
`For some time, I continued to sob and sniffle...`
`Watching this, my brother hung his head apologetically.`
`...Why didn't he come back to me sooner?`
` It looked as though he was feeling regret for that.`
`But I'm sure he had some sort of reason.`
`He's probably here today to tell me about it and apologize.`
`Already, ...just by him introducing himself to me today, ...everything inside of me has been washed clean with tears.`
`"...I'm...sorry...`
` ...I must be...embarrassing you..."`
`"No.`
` It's only to be expected.`
` ...For several decades, you've been waiting all alone, believing that your family would return."`
`"I did believe...`
` ...I believed you would come home,`
` ......Onii-chan......"`
`I held out my hand weakly, ...and my brother slowly held his out too.`
`Then, ...I gripped his hand.`
`Regardless of how many long years had passed, ...it was, without a doubt, my brother's hand.`
`Once more, I had to struggle to hold back the tears...`
`"...Aunt Eva avoided the explosion accident by escaping to Kuwadorian.`
` ...How did you escape the accident, Onii-cha...Nii-san?"`
`"On that day, ...I escaped through the underground passage."`
`"The one that goes to Kuwadorian?"`
`"I was told that an underground passage led to a hidden mansion on the opposite side of the island.`
` ...However, the place we escaped to was a submarine base, not Kuwadorian."`
`I don't know why my brother entered the underground passage on that day.`
`At any rate, he went into the underground passage, and unlike Aunt Eva, he escaped to the submarine base.`
`There, he escaped the explosion...and survived...`
`"After that, I got away on a motorboat.`
` ...However, ...it must have capsized somewhere along the way."`
`"It...must have...?"`
`"...Please forgive him.`
` Tohya suffers from memory loss.`
` His memory from around the time he was drowning in the ocean is hazy."`
`"Could it be...that he forgot he was Ushiromiya Battler for a while...?"`
`"That is correct."`
`...Yes, that explains nearly all of the riddles.`
`My brother escaped from the explosion, but either his boat capsized during his escape from the island, or he fell overboard.`
`Afterwards, he must have drifted somewhere, wandered about half-conscious, and probably got into a traffic accident...`
`"On that day, he was lying on the road."`
`"If she had found me even a little later, I probably wouldn't have opened my eyes again."`
`"I believe you suspected that I was the one who hit you for quite some time."`
`"Hey, I've already apologized for that..."`
`This explains pretty much everything.`
`Either because of the time he nearly drowned, or because of the traffic accident, my brother's memory was damaged.`
`His memory probably came back eventually.`
`However, by that time, I had already set foot into my new life as Kotobuki Yukari.`
`Only a handful of people, including President Okonogi, knew where I was.`
`Even if my brother wanted to contact me, there was a very good chance that he wouldn't be able to.`
`......Ironically, the name I abandoned when I decided to live in the future...`
`delayed my reunion with my brother for so long.`
`In that sense, I am responsible.`
` I did it to myself.`
`...However, I'm sure I received the message my brother sent me.`
`That message...was Itouikukuro.`
`I realized that Itouikukuro, the Forger who claimed to have reached the truth, was actually Hachijo Tohya.`
`Then, I requested a meeting with her through the publishing company, to question her about why she was so sure she'd reached the truth.`
`However, I wasn't granted a meeting.`
`In the end, I heard nothing from them, and it's taken all these decades for me to meet Hachijo Tohya.`
`...If the publishing company had only passed my message on, we could have been reunited so much sooner.`
`However, at the time, I was just a bourgeois girl who liked to throw money around.`
`Why would they pass on my message when I just barged in with no introduction and demanded to meet the famous and popular Hachijo Tohya?`
`We probably crossed paths several times.`
`If just one of those had worked out, if we had been able to meet...`
`...Just how much would my life have changed?`
`But this was fate.`
`God had decided that a few decades were needed before this sibling reunion.`
`And during that time, my brother became one half of a mystery novelist.`
` I became a writer of adventure novels for children.`
`You could say that we achieved success in society.`
`My brother and I were reunited after becoming successful.`
`Now, I could do nothing but thank God for bringing about this miracle...`
`"Maybe it was God's will that we would be reunited after achieving success as novelists...`
` ......Back then, I was nameless, so I never got through to you.`
` We've met now because we've both become famous as authors...`
` ...I think all of this was God's will..."`
`"At the time, we heard through the publishing company that you wanted to have an interview with us.`
` ......They said that a fan who discovered Itouikukuro's true identity wanted to talk to her."`
`"...You must've had dozens of fans dying for an interview.`
` You couldn't possibly go to meet all of them..."`
`"No.`
` They let us know that your name was Ushiromiya Ange.`
` ...At the time, I had already realized that Tohya's true name was Ushiromiya Battler, so I thought you should be given a chance to meet him."`
`"I...refused."`
`My brother said that to me.`
`"......What......did you say...?"`
`"I refused, ...because I didn't want to meet you."`
`Once more, my brother spoke clearly.`
`I was completely confused.`
`I could only sit there in shock and silence, waiting for the words that were sure to follow...`
`"...I believe I already mentioned that Tohya suffered from memory loss.`
` ...And then, one day-"`
`"Why did you refuse, when you knew it was me...?"`
`I cut through Ikuko's words and questioned him directly.`
`What reason could my brother have for rejecting me?`
`I couldn't think of anything.`
`That unpleasant emotion brought up long forgotten feelings of anger inside me...`
`"You must have known that your little sister was living all alone, being crushed by loneliness.`
` So why...why did you refuse to meet me...?"`
`My brother hung his head.`
`It seemed more like he was lost for words than apologetic.`
`There was nothing shy about his appearance, and I questioned him again in an even louder voice.`
`When I asked for an appointment with Hachijo Tohya, Itouikukuro was already famous as a Forger.`
`Why did Itouikukuro's forgeries reach the truth?`
`It's obvious.`
`My brother, Ushiromiya Battler, explained to her what happened on the island in detail.`
`So, the appearance of Itouikukuro proves that my brother's memory had returned.`
`Therefore, he can't excuse himself by saying that he didn't remember me.`
`In fact, in reality, he didn't try to make excuses.`
`On the contrary, he's openly said that he refused to meet me, even though he knew who I was.`
`"......Looking back, ...I regret what I did."`
`"You regret it...?!!`
` Did you ever try thinking about how I felt?!`
` For decades, ...for most of my life...!`
` Do you realize what feelings I had to live with...?"`
`Various emotions swirled inside of me.`
`I realized that I wasn't in control of them anymore.`
`I could only moan, to prevent myself from saying something I'd regret...`
`"I feel deeply ashamed for doing something so cruel to you.`
` ...That's why I've searched for you ever since then.`
` For your sake and for mine, ...I should have met you much earlier..."`
`"......Then why...wouldn't you meet me then......?"`
`"...Miss Kotobuki,`
` ...as I said before, ...his memory was damaged.`
` No, perhaps I should say that his brain was damaged.`
` It's an aftereffect of the accident."`
`"But his memory came back just the same, didn't it...?!"`
`"...Yes, his memory came back.`
` However, that did not remove the aftereffects of the damage."`
`"I have Ushiromiya Battler's memories.`
` ...However, because of the damage to my brain, I can't think of those as my own."`
`"......Can't think of those......as your own...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` ...It's true that my memory of my escape from the island is still hazy.`
` However, I've remembered almost everything else.`
` ......Like how those pink hair ornaments of yours that you treasure so much...were something I won for you at the game corner in that amusement park."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` They're a treasure from when I was a child.`
` ...I still keep them with me in my handbag..."`
`"I remember a lot more besides that.`
` ...I remember you giving Mom trouble because you hated eating seaweed.`
` I remember that you tried to move it to my plate and trick her.`
` ...And when-"`
`"If you remember that much, ...then why can't you think of those memories as your own...?"`
`"......That's...the result of the damage to my brain.`
` ...I've been to several hospitals, but it didn't do any good.`
` ...You probably can't understand it.`
` You can't know how painful it is to have your mind suddenly filled with the memories of a man you don't know..."`
`He was...terrified that he wasn't himself anymore.`
`His mind was filled with the memories of a man he didn't recognize, and they threatened to crush and overwhelm him.`
`They must have been his own lost memories.`
`However, ......his brain couldn't accept those as his own.`
`"Those days were painful, terrifying.`
` ......It felt like my mind was being invaded...`
` ......Tonight, when I turn off the lights and go to sleep, maybe 'I' will never wake up again.`
` Maybe a different man will wake up tomorrow morning and start living life in my body.`
` ...I can't count the nights that this terror tormented me..."`
`"......Several times, he tried to convince himself that they were his real memories.`
` ...He told himself that he was Ushiromiya Battler over and over again."`
`"But...nothing worked.`
` ...I am me, ...Hachijo Tohya.`
` ...No matter how much Ushiromiya Battler's memories flow into my mind,`
` ...to me, they're the memories of another person.`
` ......I couldn't accept Ushiromiya Battler......"`
`...As 'Ushiromiya Battler' said this, ...he hung his head and his eyes turned red.`
`"......Then, one day, when he was caught between himself and the other self he couldn't accept, he had a fit......"`
`"............"`
`"Fortunately, his life was spared, but the aftereffects forced him to spend his life in a wheelchair..."`
`"......You mean...he..."`
`Now I know why he showed up in that wheelchair.`
`And now, ...I know why he refused to meet with me...`
`He was afraid...that I would call him 'big brother'.`
`He was terrified of meeting me, fearful that the part of himself that wasn't him would grow still further in his mind.`
`"Even so, he fought.`
` ......He felt that, since Ushiromiya Battler was inside him, it was his responsibility to meet you.`
` Thinking that, ...he kept on fighting in the space between his two selves."`
`And then......he had a fit......`
`...After something like that, it was only natural that Ikuko would tell him that he didn't need to remember Ushiromiya Battler anymore.`
`Bit by bit, he tried to forget that he was once 'Ushiromiya Battler'.`
`Doctor's instructions and medication.`
` With that and Ikuko's diligent care, ...he slowly began to regain his peace of mind...`
`"Even so, `
`......I `
`thought I would have to meet you sooner or later.`
` ...To be honest, I didn't get a wink of sleep last night.`
` ......I was...scared of meeting you..."`
`".................."`
`"If I met you, would I die?`
` ...Yes, I was afraid.`
` ...However, here I am, talking to you normally.`
` ...That's why I regret what I did.`
` ......If only......I could have...met with you earlier...`
` ...You...and the Ushiromiya Battler inside of me......might not have had to suffer for all those years...`
` ...Just thinking that makes me feel so...sorry......!"`
`As the one who was once Ushiromiya Battler said this, he broke down crying.`
`...I already...understood.`
`So, ...it really was true.`
`Ushiromiya Battler...did die that day.`
`After all, ...didn't the witches say that he was dead so often with the red truth...?`
`......How pathetic for the Witch of Resurrection, ...the Witch of the Future, who swore that everyone would be together always...`
`............`
`"...Tohya-san,`
` please, raise your head."`
`"......! ...M-Miss Kotobuki..."`
`They realized why I had called him Tohya-san.`
`By calling 'him' by that name, ...I myself felt the agitation in my heart subside a little.`
`"Thank you.`
` ...You must have suffered so much.`
` ...Thank you, Mr. Tohya..."`
`"......Uu...uuuuuuuuu......uuuuu..."`
`"......Thank you,`
` Nii-san.`
` ......Thanks...for pushing yourself so hard to come here today......"`
`Holding hands, ...we brought our foreheads close and cried together for a while.`
`Then, we talked of the old days.`
`He remembered many things vividly, even things that I couldn't remember myself.`
`Each time, they made me cry even harder, and he hung his head apologetically.`
`I realized how much this hurt him, so I kept nodding in encouragement with a strange look on my face, something between a sob and a smile.`
`......Even if he isn't Ushiromiya Battler.`
`My Onii-chan came back to me...`
`Welcome home, `
`......Onii-chan...`
`It had already gotten dark outside.`
`Even though he had come from far away, he was willing to stay as late as this.`
`We left the store.`
`It's probably best...if I don't meet with Mr. Tohya again.`
`It will cause him pain, ...and of course, I'll find myself bound to the past again.`
`Even so, just one more time.`
`There was one place I felt I had to show him.`
`"...Mr. Tohya,`
` ...would you mind meeting with me just one last time?`
` There's a place I feel I need to show you."`
`"............`
`...Sure, I don't mind."`
`From my handbag, I pulled an invitation written on a folded up piece of A4 paper.`
`The pair of them spread it out.`
`"My, my.`
` Now this looks like a splendid event."`
`"......Come to think of it, you've been involved in a lot of things besides novels, haven't you?"`
`"Would you lend me your time just once more, on that day?`
` ...That way, I think both me and my brother will be satisfied.`
` I think...it might also be a chance for you to free yourself from the weight of my brother's memory, Mr. Tohya."`
`"...I...don't believe we have any plans for then.`
` As long as we can finish the afterword for the book."`
`"Okay, Miss Kotobuki.`
` ...We'd be happy to join you."`
`"Thank you, Mr. Tohya......"`
`The cold, October night was a reminder that winter was approaching.`
`...The two people who called themselves Hachijo Tohya visited the city once again by Ange's invitation.`
`A car stopped in front of a large building.`
`Ikuko unfolded the wheelchair with a practiced hand, lent a shoulder to Tohya as he got out of the passenger's seat, and helped him into the chair.`
`"......It looks splendid."`
`"The Fukuin House.`
` ...It's my first time coming here, ...but I know it well.`
` I believe it's the institution for children that was funded by the Ushiromiya family."`
`"Madam Ikuko, Mr. Tohya.`
` Allow us to welcome you to the Fukuin House."`
`They were welcomed by Ange and some staff members.`
`This was...the Fukuin House.`
`A welfare institution for unfortunate children who had lost their parents.`
`In the past, this institution had been established thanks to Ushiromiya Kinzo's support.`
`However, that support had been interrupted, and the Fukuin House had been forced to shut down for a time.`
`Decades passed.`
`And now, the institution would be revived.`
`Revived by the hand of Kotobuki Yukari.`
`"...It's a pleasure to see you again, Miss Kotobuki.`
` Thank you for inviting us.`
` ...The two of us want you to have this.`
` It's not much, but I hope the children enjoy it."`
`"That's not the reason I invited you here...`
` My apologies..."`
`"Don't worry about that...`
` ...The tales of the future are always woven by children.`
` ...After all, without them, the tale of Humans will not continue."`
`"Children are treasures.`
` So please, let this be useful."`
`"...Thank you very much.`
` ...We have a form for donations, so if it isn't too much trouble..."`
`The Fukuin House had been drastically remodeled in recent years.`
`In the hopes that children would one day be able to remember this as a fun place...`
`Ange used her own money to massively remodel it into a beautiful establishment.`
`...By now, she had accumulated a lot of wealth as a novelist, `
`but even without that, she had been saving the tens of millions of yen she got from the Ushiromiya group each year under the name of living expenses.`
`This money had been used generously to help the children.`
`When they came into the entrance hall, a cheerful scene was spread before them.`
`There were pictures and crafts created by the children.`
` ...Every corner was filled with things on display.`
`The contrast between this elegant building and the school atmosphere was amusing.`
`The yells and laughter of kids running around drifted in from the distance.`
`"...I imagine that many of the children come here hanging their heads in sorrow.`
` To think that they could laugh like that... You really have done something great."`
`"Anyone can use magic to create a future and find their Fragment of happiness.`
` ...This is a witch's school for teaching that magic."`
`"The 'Witch's Dormitory' from Sakutarou's Great Adventure?"`
`"...Oh, how embarrassing.`
` ...So you've read it too..."`
`"We read straight through it right after our last meeting.`
` ...I really must bow my head, not only to your talent as a writer, but to your warm heart."`
`"How embarrassing...`
` ...This way, straight to the end."`
`Pushing Tohya's wheelchair, we advanced through the corridor and reached the great doors at the end.`
`The happy voices of children came from the other side.`
`Apparently, this was where tonight's party was being held.`
`There were several jack-o-lanterns cut out of origami.`
`Tonight...was the Fukuin House's Halloween party.`
`"Here you are, Mr. Tohya."`
`"I see, so it's trick-or-treat."`
`He was handed a bag filled with candy.`
`A teacher warned him in a small voice to watch out for rampaging children.`
`"...Children.`
` Haven't had anything to do with them for years."`
`"Please tell the children stories of dreams.`
` All of us welcome guests here..."`
`"That's tricky...`
` What should I tell them?"`
`"'When you're handing in your manuscript, choose your publishing company wisely?'"`
`"'Don't pay any attention to reader polls.'"`
`"*giggle*giggle*`
` Then I'll open the doors.`
` The children are waiting."`
`Ange opened the large double doors...`
`"This...is......"`
`At the sight of the hall, ...Tohya opened his mouth in wide-eyed shock.`
`This was...the great hall of the Ushiromiya mansion.`
`No, that's impossible...`
`This is definitely the Fukuin House.`
`But its hall...was just like the one in the Rokkenjima mansion.........`
`"...What a splendid hall."`
`"This is...a replica...of the hall in the Ushiromiya mansion...on Rokkenjima..."`
`"Yes.`
` ...I've reproduced it as well as my memory would let me.`
` The details might be wrong though."`
`"...No.`
` ......This really is...the hall of the Ushiromiya family mansion......on that day..."`
`And then, Tohya's eyes fixed...on something at the other side of the room.`
`It was......a portrait.`
`A portrait of Rokkenjima's other master.`
`"...It's...exactly the same as my memories......"`
`"The artist hired by Ushiromiya Kinzo to paint the portrait had a photo.`
` ...I had him draw it again based on that."`
`"............"`
`I was simply frozen in shock.`
`The long, large table was filled with Halloween party food and surrounded with children stuffing themselves.`
`The teacher said 'Everyone, we have guests'.`
`...The children all looked at us at once, ...then stood up and ran forward...`
`Their broad smiles at the arrival of this long-awaited guest enveloped me.`
`The smiles and eyes of the children...welcomed me.`
`Yeah, ......I know.`
` ...I know...all your faces......`
`It's been so long, far too long... I'm finally here, at last...`
