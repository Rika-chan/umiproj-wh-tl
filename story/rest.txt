`".........Should've taken the boat...`
`......the boat......"`
`"Faaalll!`
` Faaalll!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Maria, that's enough!`
` ......But what a surprise.`
` I thought there was nothing that could scare Battler-kun."`
`"This guy can't handle vehicles for some reason.`
` Always yells about falling and sinking and stuff.`
` You're a disgrace of a man, you are."`
`"......Ah, shut up.`
` That thing was seriously shaking way too much...`
` I just got a little stressed, since it was my first time on a small plane like that..."`
`"You call that 'a little stressed'?`
` Heheheh, sounds like it'd be fun to take an overseas vacation with you, Battler-kun.`
` Would you like to go to Egypt with your aunt?`
` You'd get to ride a plane for a full 14 hours."`
`"Ahhahaha!`
` There's a good plan.`
` Battler-kun, you should go let Eva nee-san toughen you up some.`
` Still, it's so hilarious!`
` Ahhahahaha!"`
`"Wahhahaha, now, now. Everyone's got their own strong and weak points.`
` It's bad to laugh at 'em.`
` Wahhahaha...!"`
`"D-Dad, you're laughing too.`
` Hey, Maria-chan, you shouldn't laugh anymore."`
`"Shouldn't laugh anymore?`
` Uu-!"`
`Gyah, dammit!`
` Is being scared of planes really such a big deal?`
`Everyone obviously thinks I'm a big oaf now...`
` Tch!`
`We split up and took separate taxis from the airport to the harbor.`
`From there on, we would be taking a boat to the island.`
`The islands are right next to each other, so the distance of the trip wasn't that great.`
`By boat, it was a leisurely 30 minutes to the island.`
`When we reached the pier where the boat to the island was anchored, we saw a figure waving at us.`
`"George nii-saaan!`
` It's been so frickin' long!!"`
`"Ah, Jessica-chan, it's been a year since I saw you!`
` You've gotten taller again, haven't you?"`
`"Kyah-haha, don't gimme that, it's embarrassing when you say it every year!"`
`"......H-Hey, Aniki, you've gotta be kidding me.`
` Is that really Jessica?!"`
`"Wait a sec, George...`
` Is this big guy...`
`Battler?!"`
`We both stared at each other.`
`...She definitely didn't look like that in my memories, but I do remember her #fefefecrazy way of talking#ffffff.`
`"Yo, Jessica!`
` What's this now?!`
` You're kidding me, you look like a woman now!`
` What're these, boobs? Even you managed to get a chest!`
` Ihihi, let me rub 'em, let me-!"`
`"Don't screw around with me, I'm a blushing flower of 18!`
` Of course my hair grew longer and I got these!`
` What, you think I got boobs just to get fondled by you, loser?!`
` And speaking of you, sure, you got all ridiculously huge, `
`but did ya get a bit stronger too?!"`
`"Don't screw with me, I'll show you how much training I've done since back then!!"`
`"You're pissing me off!!`
` I'll beat you at your own game!"`
`This headstrong girl's name is 朱志香.`
`......She was born under the same unlucky star as me, sharing the same kind of weird name.`
`Anyway, 朱志香 is pronounced 'Jessica'.`
`She's Dad's older brother's daughter.`
`That older brother happens to be the oldest son of the Ushiromiya family, so for now, it means Jessica is the direct family heir.`
`Since Jessica and I are the same age and sometimes had little boy-girl squabbles with each other, `
`we've always been used to fighting and joking around together whenever the relatives gather.`
`Jessica grew more quickly, so she always had me beat in terms of size and physical strength.`
`When we scuffled in a contest of strength, it usually went Jessica's way.`
`So even though I realized I'd grown bigger, part of my mind was still convinced that I couldn't beat Jessica.`
`".........Woh...ah...!`
` What the...what're you getting all serious for...?!`
` Owowow..."`
`"Hey, this is nothing!`
` Jessica, you've gotten weak."`
`"Sh-Shut up.`
` I'm a girl, `
`so of course I couldn't beat a guy with physical strength forever, right?!" `
`"Weeelll, you've got a point there!`
` The meat I put on my arms all went to your chest.`
` It looks like it'd be a pretty even test of strength between my arms and your boobs, don't you think?!"`
`"I told you, my boobs aren't for you to feel up!!`
` Besides, how 'bout you? Did your cute lil' elephant-san get a bit bigger to go with the rest of you?!"`
`"Stop it, idiot! Nooo, you perv! I'll be ruined for marriage... Don't touch my cro-tch!!"`
`"D-Don't say stuff people are gonna misinterpret!!"`
`Honestly, I was so surprised at how feminine Jessica had become that I had to joke around like an idiot to hide it.`
`......Well, considering what a bossy brat she was six years ago, anyone would be surprised.`
`And I guess she's just as surprised.`
`She probably wasn't expecting to lose to me in a test of strength.`
`After losing that easily, she must be shocked at how much I've grown in the past six years.`
`......Six years.`
` Once again, I'm being shown just what a huge gap of time that was.`
`"Crap, ...total defeat.`
` It's like I'm no match for you anymore."`
`"That's not true.`
` Even Battler-kun must have his weaknesses.`
` Right, Maria-chan?"`
`"Uu-!`
` Faaall, faaall!!"`
`"Shh, cut it out, Maria, let's keep that a secret, okay?"`
`"Faaall?`
` The hell are you talking about?"`
`"Heheh!`
` Sorry, but there's no chance you'll see that weakness of mine now!`
` After all, the nightmare plane trip is already over and done with!`
` Only thing left is the nice, quiet splashing of the boat ride.`
` I never thought I'd start loving that piece-a-junk boat this much.`
` Ihihi!"`
`"Huh????`
` George nii-san, is there something wrong with his head?"`
`"You'll understand soon.`
` Very soon."`
`At the time, I didn't get what Aniki meant by that big smile...`
`"What have we here...oooh!`
` Battler-san, how big you've grown...!"`
`Who's it this time?`
` It's an old lady with an apron.`
`.........O-Oh yeah, that takes me back...`
` I remember now!`
`"You remember her, right?`
` It's Kumasawa-san, the servant."`
`"I could never forget you, Kumasawa baa-chan!`
` After all, you haven't aged a bit in these past six years.`
` If anything, I'd say you're looking younger than ever."`
`"Hohohoh!`
` Lately, my skin's been getting quite smooth and silky!`
` And look, hasn't my chest gotten bigger as well?`
` ...How'd you like a little feel?"`
`"Y-You're kidding, right?!`
` My breast fondling is strictly limited to bouncy girls!"`
`"Oh, I was quite bouncy in my youth.`
` Don't be shy, fondle to your heart's content!"`
`"Gyah, gimme a break!`
` It's girls I'm looking for!`
` Not grannies!"`
`The jokes I'd cracked about Jessica were being turned against me.`
` Come to think of it, Kumasawa has always been the type to tease people.`
`"Kumasawa-san, stop that now.`
` People with one foot in the coffin shouldn't jump around."`
`"To sport with the young is the most rejuvenating medicine.`
` Hohohoh!"`
`"It's rare for you to come pick us up, Kumasawa-san.`
` I wonder what's gotten into you.`
` Usually, your lumbago kicks in whenever someone gives you a job to do.`
` *giggle*."`
`"Hohohoh, Eva-sama, you're as harsh as ever.`
` I found myself with some urgent purchases to make, and while I was at it, I thought I would come welcome you all.`
` Although, it does give a bad impression if the one waiting to greet you is a decrepit old woman.`
` Hohohoh...!"`
`Aunt Eva spoke sarcastically, but Kumasawa baa-chan's years of experience were nothing to sneeze at.`
`She was more than capable of smoothly and coolly deflecting that comment.`
`Well, it feels bad to say it, but old Kumasawa baa-chan may be past her prime as a servant.`
`She might act as though she's in good health, but between the headaches and her lumbago, her body is wearing out.`
` To tell the truth, the very fact that she's still working is impressive.`
`...How old is she this year again?`
`She must be pushing eighty at least.`
`It's incredible that she's still able to act so cheerily.`
`"You just seem to get more and more lively.`
` Oh, that's right, here you are.`
` It's the tea I told you about before.`
` Look, I bought you some.`
` Please do try it later on."`
`Aunt Rosa took a souvenir bag out from her suitcase.`
`To think that she remembered a promise that she'd apparently made last year and faithfully bought it.`
` ...This sort of thoughtfulness was just like Aunt Rosa.`
`She wasn't the kind of person who would forget or break a promise.`
`Kumasawa baa-chan seemed deeply touched, not only that Aunt Rosa had remembered this year-old promise, but that she would bring a gift to a simple servant like her.`
`This woman is Kumasawa Chiyo-san (熊沢 チヨ).`
`She's a senior servant who's been working at the Ushiromiya Head Family household for many years.`
`As you'd expect from someone her age, manual labor isn't her strong point, but she's a kind of super servant who can handle just about anything else, from kitchen work to cleaning and laundry.`
`It seems like her only flaw is a tendency to slack off.`
`I hear she tries to get away from heavy or troublesome work by playing up her chronic diseases.`
`......In Kumasawa baa-chan's case, this was probably a sign of craftiness rather than laziness.`
`...Though it probably doesn't impress those paying her salary.`
`Ah well, even if she's pretty flaky when it comes to work, I could never dislike her.`
`I guess that's probably because of her cheerfulness and her constant smile.`
`"Hey, glad to see you're still in fine spirits!`
` How's your back doin' then?"`
`"Even with the medicine, it's not getting one whit better.`
` According to the doctor, nothing can be done for this one.`
` It's what you might call an incurable disease, hohohoh!"`
`"Anyway, Jessica-chan just keeps getting prettier.`
` Good thing she takes after Natsuhi nee-san."`
`"R-Really...?`
` Personally, I don't think we look alike at all...`
` I mean, I don't even wanna be like my parents.`
` 'Cause I got zero respect for 'em."`
`"Now, you shouldn't say such things.`
` *giggle* Though there are quite a few people who don't want to be like their parents in our family."`
`"Ah, that's me!"`
`"You sure as hell better not take after me.`
` Your nose looking like mine already pisses me off."`
`"What are you talking about?`
` You're surprisingly alike, you and Father."`
`"Come on, you can't be serious...`
` Just how am I like Dad?"`
`"You're a lot like him, especially in how arrogant and prideful you are.`
` Father's blood is especially strong in you and Nii-san.`
` Wouldn't you say, Rosa?"`
`"Oh, absolutely.`
` Krauss nii-san and Rudolf nii-san are almost unbelievably like Dad."`
`"All right, all right already, why am I the only one under fire from the girls?`
` Hideyoshi nii-san, gimme a hand, please."`
`"My my, Rudolf-kun, you're always so popular with the ladies.`
` I'm jealous!`
` Wahahahaha!"`
`"Hohohoh!`
` As usual, you're popular enough to make me jealous.`
` Well then, everyone, shall we head over to the boat?`
` Come now, Maria-san, let's get on the boat together, okay?"`
`"Get on the boat together.`
` Uu-!`
` Everyone gets on together.`
` Uu-!"`
`"Hell yeah, this time around I'm not gonna be scared.`
` I'm used to being shaken by the waves.`
` With that piece-a-junk fishing boat, I'm less afraid of the shaking than the engine breaking down and the boat drifting off."`
`"Oh yes, Battler-kun, I forgot to tell you.`
` ...That fishing boat was completely worn out, so it was taken out of commission a few years back.`
` Now we get taken to the island in a different boat."`
`"Ohhh, right.`
` It's Battler's first time in the new boat!`
` It's super comfy!`
` And frickin' fast!`
` It can go at crazy high speeds!"`
`"Ohhh...`
` That means less travel time, right?`
` That sounds great!`
` Having to worry about sinking is less scary than being on a plane, but it'd still be awesome to get it over with as quick as possible!"`
`"...Uu-.`
` Is Battler going to go 'faaall, faaall' again?"`
`"That's only on airplanes.`
` Everything's fine now!"`
`"Anyway, it's the captain's pride and joy, a kind of modded high-speed boat.`
` Seems he's got it pretty souped up.`
` He was bragging about how he attached four-base high efficiency propellers to make it break 40 knots, or something like that.`
` He talks about it all the time, so I've sorta memorized the spiel."`
`"Yeah, I've got it memorized too, since we hear about it every year.`
` The captain says he's been obsessed with modding ever since he lost a speed contest with a foreign boat ages ago.`
` According to him, that opponent managed to break 30 knots with just a fishing boat."`
`"And his thirst for a revenge match got him to build an awesome, all-new, super high-speed modded boat.`
` I'm sure you'll just love it, Battler."`
`...S-Super high-speed modded boat...?`
`...My first thought was that this would be much better than some beat-up boat that might sink at any moment......`
`...but for some reason, I got this feeling of foreboding...`
` ......Probably just overthinking it.`
`"Hey, Battler, maybe you should just swim to the island."`
`"Battler-kun, you shouldn't lean over the railing too much.`
` You might fall."`
`"Uu-uu-!!`
` Faaall, faaall!!"`
`"Daaaaammiiiiit, ...so this is why you were all grinning back there!"`
`So this is the super high-speed boat that the captain started modding...`
` Oh, yes, that piece of junk fishing boat from six years ago doesn't hold a candle to this guy...`
`"Whooooooooa, it's shaking it's shaking it's shaking!!`
` Gonna fall fall faaall!!"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Gonna fall fall faaall!!"`
`"If I fall, I'll land in the ocean and drown...! Where's the parachute...?! I mean, where's the buoy?!`
` Gimme a life jackeeeet!!"`
`"Waah-hah-hah-hah-ha!`
` Battler, what the heck're you doing that for, waah-hah-hah-hah-ha!"`
`"Jessica-chan, Maria-chan, it's not nice to tease.`
` Battler-kun, if you're scared, then just don't come out on the deck.`
` I think you'll be able to calm down a bit if you go inside the boat."`
`"Heheh, that's a no thank you, Aniki!`
` Shipwreck victims are always the ones inside the boat.`
` The survivors are usually those on the deck during the accident.`
` So I'm staying right here!!`
` But it's shaking!!`
` I'm gonna faaall!!`
` Whooooaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"Shake, gonna faaall!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Maria, I told you to behave yourself!`
` ......But Battler-kun, it looks like you really can't handle it...`
` I'll go tell the captain to slow down for you."`
`"Whooooa, Aunt Rosa, thank yooooouuuuu!`
` I can tell you now that safe, slow driving is definitely the way to go, even on the seaaaaa!!"`
`"Heheheh!`
` Don't do that, Rosa.`
` Trials and tribulations are important for young men.`
` Isn't that right, Battler-kun?`
` You'd better be able to overcome a little scare like this.`
` Otherwise, you'll never be able to go to Egypt with your aunt!"`
`"Whooooa, Aunt Eva, you're so meeeeeeeeaaaan!`
` Ooh noooo, I'm gonna faaaaaall!!`
` Life jackeeeet, parachuuuute!!`
` Whoooooooaaaaaaahh......!!!`
` W-Wait, gotta spin it around and think that way!!`
` What's the enemy aiming for?!`
` Is he doing this to scare me?!`
` If that's what he's aiming for, too bad, like hell I'll be scaaaaaaaared!!`
` But noooooo, I'm gonna faaaaaaall!!!"`
`...So, after I made a huge fool of myself for a while,`
` Aunt Rosa had a talk with the boat captain, and he slowed down to a more manageable speed for me...`
`".........Haa...`
` That's a bit better...`
` ...Thought I was gonna die earlier..."`
`Apparently, the max speed I can tolerate is extremely slow.`
`...But that just now was completely insane...`
`The whole boat was shaking!`
` Sliding and leaping on the ocean's surface!`
`It felt like I was riding on the back of a flying fish...`
`Jessica was still guffawing at me as I leaned against the railing, tired and disheartened.`
`"I lost in that strength contest earlier, but I'm glad to know I'm no worse off where it really counts.`
` But seriously, hahahahahah!"`
`"Dammit, ...go ahead and laugh.`
` One of these days, I'm gonna find your weakness and get back at you...and then your boobs will be mine to squish......"`
`"Ahahaha! Yeah, sure, good luck with that!`
` Waah-hah-hah-ha!"`
`"Uu-.`
` Battler, all weak."`
`"Yeah, Battler, all weak...`
` I wanna die on land, not in the ocean or the sky..."`
`Maria was patting my back, so I patted her head in return.`
`...Her expression was blank, as usual, but I realized that she wanted to console me.`
`"Battler-kun, the captain's throwing in drinks to make up for this.`
` Would you like one `
`to calm yourself down?"`
`George-aniki and Kumasawa baa-chan brought us all ice-cold cans of soft drinks covered with beads of water.`
`Judging from Kumasawa-san's big grin, our parents inside the boat were probably all rolling around laughing at my moment of pure terror.`
`Dammit, I'm so embarrassed, I can't bear to face any of them...`
`If I didn't change the subject somehow, I had the feeling I'd be the butt of everyone's jokes for the whole trip, so I tried to think of something harmless to talk about.`
`"...Hey, Jessica.`
` How are Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi doing?"`
`"My old man and Mom?`
` Unfortunately, they're fine.`
` Though every other word out of their mouths is 'study, study', which pisses me off.`
` I'm so jealous, since it doesn't look like Uncle Hideyoshi or Uncle Rudolf would say stuff like that."`
`"Hahaha, oh no.`
` Before I had my exams, my parents kept pressing me about it over and over.`
` I thought it was annoying then, but now I'm grateful."`
`"Hah, I knew it. You really are awesome, Aniki...`
` Anyway, I have to look after myself.`
` No one tells me what to do!`
` Well, it's not like I'd listen if they did, hihihi!"`
`"Battler-san, have you still not returned to your parents' home?"`
`"...Well, I kinda go back now and then.`
` I've got lots of clothes and stuff left at the house I was living in until recently."`
`"......Uu-?`
` Battler has two houses?"`
`"Uh, `
`.........hmmm.`
` ......Something like that."`
`"Why?`
` Why do you have two houses?`
` Uu-?`
` Uu-?"`
`Only Maria, who couldn't really grasp the situation, voiced this naive question.`
`However, the others just shot nervous glances at me, choosing not to respond even though they knew the answer.`
`"Maria!`
` Look, you can see the harbor now...!`
` Look, over there!`
` Can you see it?!"`
`"Uu-!`
` Saw the harbor, saw the harbor!"`
`Apparently, Jessica was trying to be nice by changing the subject.`
`......Ah, well.`
` I'd rather not talk about it if I can help it, but it's uncomfortable to have it treated like some kind of weird taboo.`
`......I don't mind it that much myself anymore.`
`I may be a member of the Ushiromiya family, `
`but the truth is that, for these last six years, I've been living with my grandparents on my late mother's side, and I've even been using her family name.`
`When those grandparents passed away one after the other, I basically had no choice but to go back and live with the old bastard.`
`Don't get me wrong.`
` I didn't just run away from home or anything like that.`
`The only one at fault here is my dad.`
`......I don't really blame Kyrie-san.`
`Being able to hold that old bastard's reins and ride him out is no mean feat.`
`...Still, the way that old bastard betrayed my mom...`
` ......Well, unfortunately, I still haven't fully gotten over that.`
`"*Ahem*.`
` We'll be getting there soon."`
`George-aniki cleared his throat, trying to change the subject.`
`"......Please forgive my indiscretion.`
` It seems this old woman has said too much already.`
` If I have hurt your feelings-"`
`"Heheh!`
` I don't mind it, and no one's feelings are hurt.`
` Don't worry, Kumasawa baa-chan."`
`Kumasawa-san seemed to regret speaking out of turn, `
` but I was more concerned about being worried over for something like that, so I stood up and passed it off lightly.`
`After that, I had a sip of my drink and headed over to Maria and Jessica, who were gazing at the silhouette of the island.`
`"Uu-!`
` Battler, I saw the island, saw the island!`
` There, there, there!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!"`
`"Where is it...oh, I see it now.`
` Even after six years, the island hasn't changed a bit."`
`The small island's silhouette in front of us had gotten pretty close.`
`This island's name is Rokkenjima.`
`It's a small island about 10km around, located in the Izu Archipelago.`
`Since they call this archipelago 'the Izu Seven', lots of people think there are only seven islands, but that's not true.`
`There's actually several more, and Rokkenjima is one of the minor islands that don't get counted.`
`Even if that weren't the case, I doubt you'd find many people who knew about this island.`
`Only people connected to the Ushiromiya family ever go there.`
`In other words, outsiders and tourists never have any reason to care about it.`
`So, you'll never find this island's name in a travel brochure.`
`After all, all of Rokkenjima is an estate possessed by the Ushiromiya Head Family.`
`Only the Ushiromiya family lives there, and only people connected to the Ushiromiya family come and go to and from there.`
`There's nothing there except a harbor and a mansion.`
`The vast majority of the island is still just uncultivated forest.`
`Such a waste, when it could be made into a nice golf course or something.`
`However, when you realize that the entire coastline is a private beach, it starts to sound pretty magnificent.`
`You've probably guessed by now, but to put it simply...`
`...well, the Ushiromiya family is just rolling in dough.`
`The Head Family apparently possesses a vast fortune,`
` and Dad and the others who make up the branch families have built up plenty of wealth for themselves, finding success in their respective businesses.`
`I've been living a commoner's life at my grandparents' home these six years, so I'd completely forgotten, `
`...but the old bastard's house really is elegant, and everything about it is tuned to match the snobbish tastes of the annoyingly rich.`
`Come to think of it, I guess that makes George-aniki, Jessica, Maria, and me wealthy, high-class gentlemen and ladies.`
`Needless to say, none of us think of ourselves that way at all.`
`I don't see myself as being rich, and George-aniki, who takes self-discipline very seriously, doesn't let himself get too comfortable.`
`Jessica is always complaining that she'd rather move to the city than be rich,`
` and Maria is still a kid who isn't even interested in money at all.`
`...Does that attitude really make us any less snobbish?`
`From the perspective of people in poverty who can't pay the bills, we really have been blessed with a lot.`
`This isn't the place to explain any further, so I won't.`
`Anyway, it's the same as not being able to choose the parents you're born from.`
`I didn't ask to be born into a rich family.`
`And I don't think it's really something to be envied.`
`It can be pretty trying when people are prejudiced against you just because you're rich and refuse to judge you by your merits...`
`As I pondered these sentimental thoughts, Maria started shouting and leaned over the railing.`
`"............Uu-.`
` ......Gone."`
`"What's wrong, Maria?`
` Did you drop something?"`
`"Uu-uu-!`
` Gone, gone!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`Maria kept yelling 'gone, gone'.`
`At first, it sounded as though she had dropped something, but while she shouted, she also pointed out over the ocean.`
`"What's wrong?`
` What's gone?`
` I'll look for it too, if you want.`
` What is it?`
` ............?"`
`If she'd dropped something, she would probably have looked down at the floor, but Maria was pointing out over the ocean.`
`One would assume by that gesture that she had spotted something, but she kept saying that something wasn't there...`
` ......Strange.`
`However, since my last memories of this place came from six years ago, I was able to spot it before Aniki, who comes here every year.`
`"............Huh...?`
` ......If I remember correctly, wasn't there a Torii or something on top of a small crag around here?`
` ...That's right, it was definitely there.`
` I remember it well, since as we get closer to the island, it's the first thing to greet us, like a landmark."`
`"Wow, you're amazing, Battler.`
` Even though it's been six years, you remembered."`
`"It was here, wasn't it...!`
` I remember too.`
` The #fefefetutelary god#ffffff's shrine and that #fefefeTorii#ffffff-like thing were standing all alone on that crag.`
` ......And now that you mention it, they are gone, aren't they?`
` I'm pretty sure they were still there last year."`
`"Gone.`
` Gone.`
` Uu-uu-uu-!"`
`"Maybe they were washed away by the waves or something.`
` It was a small crag, so it probably got worn away over time."`
`"Well, that's my theory too.`
` It was last summer that it disappeared.`
` But they say-"`
`"They say an enormous lightning bolt came crashing down one evening and smashed the shrine...`
` ...The fishermen whisper that having a thunderbolt fall upon our honored tutelary god must be a portent of approaching misfortune.`
` ...Kuwabara, kuwabara..."`
`Kumasawa-san smiled impishly as if teasing us, rubbing her hands together while entoning a Japanese phrase meant to ward off lightning.`
`However, Maria apparently took this seriously...`
`and stared fixedly over the ocean to where the crag housing the shrine god was supposed to be.`
`".........A portent...of misfortune.`
` .........Uu-."`
`"Enough, Kumasawa-san.`
` Maria isn't old enough to get that kind of joke."`
`"It's okay, Maria-chan.`
` It's just a coincidence.`
` Nothing scary's gonna happen."`
`George-aniki put a hand on Maria's shoulder to calm her down, but Maria's sharp-eyed expression didn't waver.`
`"............Misfortune.`
` ............Misfortune."`
`Maria muttered that word over and over.`
`Apparently, repeating a single word over and over is a habit that Maria's had for a long time.`
`However, since the word she was saying was literally an ill omen, it was a bit creepy.`
`"Hey now, Maria.`
` If you say it over and over like that, misfortune will really end up happening, you know?"`
`I tapped Maria's other shoulder.`
`Maria whipped her head around, stared into my face, and spoke unblinkingly.`
`"Uu-.`
` .........Misfortune...is coming."`
`"Huh?`
` And just where is it coming from?"`
`I answered light-heartedly, trying to break the tension in the air.`
`...At that moment, Maria held up a finger, raised her arm high, ...and pointed up to the heavens.`
`When I looked up, I saw that the sky was still just as cloudy, but it had grown a great deal more leaden than it had been that morning.`
`That's right, they were saying that a typhoon was approaching.`
`...We had planned to spend one night on the island, but if this storm doesn't pass quickly, I won't be able to make it to school on Monday.`
` Well, I guess it makes for a pretty good excuse to be absent.`
`".....................Uu-..."`
`...She apparently sensed some kind of misfortune in this cloudy sky.`
`She's been muttering that non-stop for a while now.`
`Girls at Maria's age tend to be very impressionable.`
`She's just about the age that many girls start to get excited about sixth senses and whether they have any psychic potential and stuff.`
`...For all we know, this might be due to her childish, sensitive nature.`
`"It's okay, Maria-chan.`
` The weather might get worse tonight, but tomorrow it'll clear up and become a pretty blue sky."`
`"Uu-.`
` Pretty blue sky.........`
` .........Uu-..."`
`"That's right, by tomorrow it'll be a pretty blue sky.`
` There's no rain that doesn't end, and no clouds that never clear."`
`"Uu-...`
` .........Rain that doesn't end.`
` ...Clouds that never clear.`
` ..................Uu-........."`
`"I know the typhoon's coming, but soon it'll go away!`
` It'll be okay, Maria."`
`"...............Uu-.`
` ...Uu-!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`Maria started yelling 'uu-uu-'.`
`...It looked as though she was having a tantrum because no one could understand what she was trying to say.`
`What in the world is Maria trying so desperately to warn us about?`
`Unable to understand her, we couldn't help but feel a vague sense of misfortune...`
`......I've heard that everyone can feel the supernatural, but that it weakens as you age.`
`That might mean that Maria, the youngest one of us all, still possessed some kind of sense that the rest of us had lost.`
`...I wonder if that sense is sending her a warning.`
`At that moment, Kumasawa-san quietly opened her mouth.`
`".........Rumor has it...`
`...that long ago, Rokkenjima was-"`
`"Kumasawa-san.`
` Let's not talk about that now."`
`Just as Kumasawa-san was about to tell some kind of story, Jessica sharply interrupted her.`
`Jessica's tone was extremely firm, for her.`
`I wanted to push her further, just out of simple curiosity, `
`but judging by the look on Jessica's face, whatever Kumasawa baa-chan was likely to say would probably make Maria even more uneasy.`
`...If I did try to press her for the story, the odds were pretty good that it wouldn't be anything bright and cheery.`
`"......Hoh hoh hoh, I do apologize about that...`
` ...The wind here is hard to bear for the elderly, so if you would excuse me for now..."`
`Gossipers have no reason to hang around after they've been told to stop chatting.`
`When Kumasawa-san finally realized that she'd overstepped her bounds, she went back inside the boat.`
`After she left, Uncle Hideyoshi showed up in her place.`
`Since he'd arrived mid-conversation, he completely failed to notice the complicated atmosphere that hung about the scene,`
` so he refreshingly and unwittingly swept that atmosphere aside.`
`So, in the end, it was his lack of tact that brightened the mood.`
`"Looks like we're almost there!`
` Oookay, just a bit more!`
` Took forever at the speed we went today, didn't it?`
` Wonder whose fault that was!`
` Wahhahahahaha!"`
`"Aww, Uncle Hideyoshi, gimme a break already... Tahaha!"`
`"Ahaha, come on, don't stop there.`
` Seriously, thanks to Battler here, it's takin' forever!"`
`".........Uu-."`
`Maria probably thought that everyone was refusing to listen to her.`
`She hung her head, wearing a fretful expression.`
`As she did, George-aniki crouched down to meet her eyes and spoke to her kindly.`
`"Maria-chan.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of.`
` Because we're all together.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of if we're together.`
` Go ahead and say it."`
`"............Uu-.`
` ...There's nothing to be afraid of...if we're together..."`
`"Yes.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of if we're with each other."`
`"............Uu-."`
`"That's right, exactly what George-aniki said.`
` If we stick together, there'll never be anything at all to be afraid of.`
` Right, Jessica?"`
`"Yeah, no doubt about that.`
` What George nii-san says is always true, Maria."`
`"......Uu-.`
` George onii-chan always true."`
`"Yes.`
` I don't lie.`
` So trust me.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of if we're all together."`
`"Uu-.`
` ......George onii-chan doesn't lie.`
` I trust you.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of if we're all together.`
` .........Uu-, not afraid!"`
`Maria jumped into George-aniki's arms and hugged him tightly.`
`After Aniki patted her head, she jumped away again.`
`Her facial expression had undergone a 180 degree change, turning back to normal.`
`She was once again the ordinary Maria.`
`"Uu-.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of anymore, because we're together.`
` ...Uu-uu-."`
`"Yeah, that's it.`
` ...You look all better now.`
` You're strong, and that's awesome!"`
`"......Uu-!`
` I'm awesome!"`
`"Hey now, what's goin' on here?`
` Maria-chan didn't get seasick, did she?`
` Hmm?"`
`"Hahaha, well, something like that.`
` We'll be arriving soon."`
`The harbor was already drawing near.`
`The boat gave a big shudder.`
`Seems we've docked at the harbor.`
`The boat driver came out and jumped to the pier with the mooring rope.`
`A large man in a tuxedo was waiting there for us with a warm smile.`
`......I didn't recognize his face, but judging by his clothes, I guessed he was a servant of the Ushiromiya Head Household.`
`"Welcome home, Milady.`
` You were so late in returning that I began to worry."`
`"Ah, thanks for caring!`
` This moron got so scared, `
`we had to slow down.`
` It was seriously annoying!"`
`"Sh-Shut up... Someday, when the shoe's on the other foot, you'll remember this...ugghh."`
`At this rate, word'll spread to the whole family, and I'll be the big conversation piece during dinner.`
`Even without this, everyone'd be talking about me because of that six year gap, ...but now I've given them an even juicier topic...!`
`Dammit, why does the Ushiromiya Head Family have to live on this isolated island?!`
`In the meantime, the boat had finished its mooring.`
`A small plank was lowered so that we could get down.`
`One by one, our parents came up from inside the boat.`
`"You must all be quite tired from your long trip.`
` Madam, please allow me to assist you."`
`"Thank you.`
` It's been a while, Gohda-san. How are you?"`
`"I thank you for your concern.`
` It is always my pleasure to serve."`
`"Battler-kun, isn't this your first time meeting Gohda-san?`
` If I'm not mistaken, you weren't working here six years ago, right?"`
`"Indeed.`
` So please, allow me to greet him for the first time.`
` It is an honor to meet you, Battler-sama."`
`"......I'm pretty confident about my height, but you're huge.`
` ...This is definitely our first meeting.`
` I'd never forget meeting a big guy like you...!`
` It's a pleasure.`
` I'm Battler."`
`"I was looking forward to meeting you.`
` I am Gohda (郷田), your servant, and I have been working for the Ushiromiya Head Family since the year before last.`
` It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.`
` If there is anything you need, please feel free to rely on me at any time."`
`"Gohda-san, it's been some time."`
`"It has been too long, George-sama.`
` Please, allow me to assist you."`
`"As usual, you're a pro at welcoming guests...`
` If you ever need a job, just let me know, okay?`
` I'd hire you anytime!"`
`"You do me too much honor.`
` Please allow me to assist you, Hideyoshi-sama."`
`Gohda-san then lent a hand to everyone as they disembarked, greeting them as they passed.`
`His speech and mannerisms had the refined polish of a professional.`
`He was very graceful, in contrast with his initially tough-looking appearance.`
`His large size made him seem a bit scary at first, but he was much more polite than my first impression had led me to believe.`
`He claimed to have served on the island for two years, but he had doubtless worked at a similar job somewhere before.`
`After everybody disembarked, the mooring rope was untied and the boat started to steer away from the harbor.`
`It was probably returning to its home port on Niijima.`
`The captain waved his hand in farewell.`
`Maria conscientiously waved her hand back. `
`"............Hmmm, now that I think about it, that must be why I've felt something out of place for a while now.`
` I can't hear the cries of the seagulls."`
`"Seagulls?`
` The birds?"`
`If I remember correctly, whenever we came to this island in the past, the seagulls always greeted us with their lively 'nyaa nyaa' cries.`
`Because of that, whenever I hear the cries of seagulls anywhere else, I get the feeling that I'm coming to a family conference.`
`Except for the small part of the island where those of the Ushiromiya Head Family live,`
` Rokkenjima has been left uncultivated, which apparently makes it a paradise for wild birds.`
`Supposedly, there was a cliff somewhere that housed a huge seagull colony, so this island was always full of seagulls.`
`Not having those seagulls here to greet us made me feel a bit lonely.`
`"What's wrong, Battler-kun?"`
`"Oh, Aunt Rosa.`
` ...Nah, it's nothing really, I was just thinking it's a bit lonely without the cries of the seagulls."`
`"My, that's true, now that you mention it.`
` Even though they're always so noisy, today there isn't one to be seen."`
`"......Uu-?`
` Why no seagulls?"`
`"Hmmm, maybe it's because the seagulls are having a get-together somewhere too?`
` Maria, did you want to see the seagulls?"`
`"Uu-, wanted to see them."`
`"Still, it's a bit strange there isn't even a single one around.`
` Maybe Jessica grilled 'em all and ate 'em!"`
`"......Uu-?!"`
`"The hell, don't say disturbing stuff like that!`
` You'll get Maria believing it!!"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!`
` Jessica onee-chan grilled 'em, Jessica onee-chan grilled 'em!`
` Uu-!!"`
`"I did not, I did not!`
` Why the hell would I do something like that?!"`
`"That's right, that's riiight, Jessica grilled 'em!`
` Skin 'n meatballs, liver 'n oniooon!"`
`"Swim in meat dolls!`
` Liver 'n oniooon!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!`
` Ahaha, ahaha!`
` Hahahaha!"`
`As I made fun of Jessica, Maria tagged along, looking like she was having fun.`
`Ooh, I never guessed she was such a good sport!`
`Alrighty then, from today on I'll make you my number one follower!`
`As I smiled at her, she beamed, looking overjoyed, possibly because she was happy about this little connection we'd made with each other.`
`"That's not it, Maria-chan.`
` I've heard wild birds are attuned to changes in the weather and atmospheric pressure.`
` The weather will probably get worse tonight.`
` The seagulls might've returned to their nests early."`
`".........Uu-.`
` Not grilled?`
` Jessica onee-chan didn't grill 'em?"`
`"No, no!!`
` I-I wouldn't do something like that!`
` Battler, you admit right now that you lied!"`
`"Battler-kun,`
` Maria-chan is a naive girl, so she takes even jokes seriously.`
` You should choose your jokes more carefully."`
`...George-aniki gently scolded me.`
`...Even though I outstripped Aniki in height, Aniki was Aniki, of course.`
` There was no choice but to obediently apologize.`
`"S-Sure,`
` my bad, my bad...`
` Maria, that was a joke.`
` The seagulls are all taking it easy in their nests today, that's all."`
`"......Battler lied?`
` George onii-chan told the truth?"`
`Had she actually been tricked, despite all that fun she was having...?`
`Her pure eyes made me feel guilty.`
`......Maybe I went a little overboard with her after all.`
`"Yeeaah, that's right, that's right.`
` What George-aniki said is true.`
` The weather's bad, so they probably went home for the day.`
` It doesn't mean they're gone.`
` Right, Aunt Rosa?!"`
`"That's right.`
` Tomorrow, when the weather gets better, I'm sure they'll come back so we can hear them cry 'myaa myaa' like they always do."`
`"Uu-.`
` I'll wait until the weather gets better and they come back.`
` Gonna wait until tomorrow.`
` Gonna wait until the weather's better.`
` Uu-uu-!"`
`Maria was in a lighter mood and was looking forward to tomorrow, when the seagulls would come back and fill the skies.`
`Still, George-aniki really was amazing at taking care of kids.`
`...I think I remember Aniki taking good care of me as well when I was a brat six years ago.`
`......Aniki, that's probably your gift.`
`"George-kun is amazing at taking care of young kids.`
` If you wanted to, I'll bet you'd do great with a job in childcare, don't you think?"`
`"Yeah, it's almost like George nii-san was born to do something like that.`
` Personally, I think that'd suit you better than doing business in some company president's office."`
`"Oh, no.`
` Childcare is a fine career path,`
` but it's not a job where merely liking children is enough."`
`"You really are modest, George-kun.`
` But Battler-kun is quite good with children too!`
` Just a second ago, even though it didn't last long, Maria seemed to be having a lot of fun.`
` Please, keep on playing with her like you did just now.`
` Just choose your jokes more carefully, okay?`
` *giggle*."`
`Aunt Rosa winked at me, giggling a little.`
`She's a real mother, I thought to myself, who's happy to see Maria having fun.`
`"Come ON, Rosa.`
` And you brats too, what the hell're you doing? Let's get going."`
`"Okay, okay, we're coming."`
`The old bastard was waving for us to hurry up.`
`Yeah, we needed to get moving.`
`We might as well have this conversation after setting our luggage down in our rooms.`
`"Now then, everyone, allow me to lead you to the guesthouse, where you will be spending the night.`
` Please, this way."`
`Gohda-san called to everyone and led the way.`
`Kumasawa-san brought up the rear.`
`A serpentine, twisting path led through a dim forest.`
` It ran a bit uphill.`
`I'd guess the path was made all twisty so the slope wouldn't seem too steep,`
` but personally, I'd have been happier if they'd had the guts to make some stairs in a straight line.`
`......No doubt they made the path twist on purpose, to put on airs of distance and importance...`
`Before long, we saw garden-style stone steps. `
`...Aaah, from here on, I do have some memories.`
`Go up these, and...`
`At the top of the stone steps, we saw a beautiful guesthouse.`
`Its facade was lovely, of course, but more importantly, `
`......we couldn't enter its doors without having our hearts stolen away by the splendor of the beautiful rose garden spreading before it.`
`"Aaah!`
` It's as beautiful as ever this year...`
` A real delight for the eyes..."`
`After climbing the stone steps, the people greeted by this rose garden gave voice to their impressions one by one.`
`"Is it just me, or are the flowers a little less lively this year?`
` It's probably because it wasn't that hot this summer."`
`"I also believe that was a factor.`
` Sadly, this year's blooming is a tad inferior when compared to last year's."`
`Even so, it was a delightful rose garden.`
`I remembered that even six years ago, huge numbers of roses had greeted us every year.`
`...This rose garden was the first thing that greeted the people who came to Rokkenjima.`
` Even our parents, who came every year, couldn't help but give voice to their admiration.`
`In fact, it seemed to have undergone a power-up from the garden in my memories of six years ago.`
`"This place is always so amazing.`
` It would be wonderful to have a rose garden like this at home."`
`"Give it up.`
` Who do you think would take care of it? Roses are a real pain, with bugs and diseases to worry about."`
`"Well, from what I've heard, `
`Kyrie nee-san takes care of her rose every day and makes sure no bugs get anywhere near it, right?"`
`"Huh?`
` What are you talking about?"`
`"That's right.`
` Though in this person's case, the rose goes after the insects like some nasty carnivorous plant."`
`"...Oh, so that's what you mean.`
` C'mon, Rosa, can't you give that a rest just for today?`
` I've put that sort of thing completely behind me."`
`"I wonder.`
` After all, you're a womanizer on an almost genetic level...!"`
`"No need to worry, Rosa-san.`
` When a rose gives you too much trouble, it's always best to snip it at the root."`
`"Hohohohoh, such frightening talk this is."`
`"Guys who're popular with the ladies are always forced to live dangerously.`
` I sure hope I turn out a bit prettier in my next life!"`
`"Hideyoshi nii-san, like I keep saying, it isn't like that at all.`
` ...And Kyrie...stop it, you're freaking me out.`
` You've made my rose wilt."`
`"Hey, Maria-chan, look over here.`
` These roses are especially magnificent."`
`"...Magnificent roses.`
` ...Uu-!"`
`"Hmmm, smells pretty sweet.`
` Look, this suits my elegance perfectly."`
`"Hey, cut it out!`
` Maria's gonna imitate you and get hurt by the thorns!"`
`She yelled at me as I leaned in to smell the rose's scent with an exaggerated gesture.`
`...I thought she was overreacting, but when I turned around, I saw Maria imitating my every gesture and George-aniki smiling broadly at us.`
`"Hey now, Maria-chan, be careful.`
` Rose thorns can hurt."`
`"......Uu-?`
` ......George onii-chan,`
` only this rose is strange.`
` Uu-."`
`"Strange?`
` What's wrong?"`
`Maria pointed at a single rose.`
`I immediately understood why she found it odd.`
`In the midst of all these magnificent roses, one single rose was just starting to wilt.`
`There wasn't any particular reason.`
`Some roses flourish, and others wilt.`
`That's all there was to it, but Maria seemed very concerned about the only unhealthy one in the group.`
`...It must have made her feel lonely.`
`"So, you feel sad for this rose because it's the only one that isn't healthy...?"`
`"......Uu-.`
` The others are all healthy, but this one's sad."`
`"Well, they all bloom and wither at their own paces.`
` I'll bet this one's just starting to wilt early 'cause it got to bloom before any of the others."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` It probably just bloomed like crazy, fulfilled its duty and went to sleep.`
` You shouldn't get so worked up about it."`
`".........Uu-."`
`It seemed that Maria's pure, sensitive nature was making her feel some emotional pain for the rose that wilted alone.`
`Even though she understood the logic of it, it still felt lonely to her.`
`"Then, Maria-chan,`
` why don't you look after this rose until we leave?"`
`"Uu-?"`
`George-aniki straightened up and felt around in his pocket.`
`He then took out the wrapper from the candy he had been sucking on the plane.`
`He twisted it into a thin string, then gently tied it to the rose as a sort of marker.`
`"Heeey, that's pretty cute!"`
`"Let's mark it with this.`
` Later on, you can come and give it some water.`
` I'm sure Mr. Rose will be happy."`
`"......Uu-!`
` Come to give it water!"`
`"I think you should give Mr. Rose here a name.`
` I'm sure that'll make it happy, and you'll get to know it a little better."`
`"A name...?`
` A name...`
` ......Uu-uu-..."`
`Though she still wore her usual sullen face, Maria crossed her arms and began to consider this intently.`
`At the very least, she appeared to have been completely pulled out of her slump.`
` Nice going, Aniki.`
`"George nii-san has always been really understanding.`
` Can't help but respect him."`
`"Yeah.`
` I guess he was just born that way.`
` We've gotta start picking up tips!"`
`"Was this garden just as magnificent when you all were kids?"`
`"It was only after I stopped living here that it grew so big.`
` Before that, the garden was simpler, though I'm still attached to that one.`
` Nii-san fiddled with it too much, with that vaguely bad taste of his.`
` I liked it much better before."`
`"Eva, you've gotta think positive!`
` Settin' aside how it used to look, its beauty now is somethin' to be admired.`
` You'll be able to relax a lot better if you look at it that way."`
`"I didn't mean it like that...`
` I was just saying that I wanted you to see this garden the way it was before too."`
`"Everyone, if you please,`
` I shall guide you to your rooms now."`
`Gohda-san called to everyone to ask if we were ready, `
`but our hearts had been completely stolen away by the rose garden that none of us had seen for a year, so we didn't pay much attention to him.`
`Since we weren't a travel group, it wasn't like we had a strict schedule to follow.`
`Besides, since our parents were visiting their old home, full of nostalgia, it wasn't like they had to let themselves be urged on by anyone or anything.`
`Understanding the situation, Gohda-san continued to wait, smiling widely, until our parents got tired of the roses and told him to guide us to our rooms...`
`"Oh...?!`
` Heeey!`
` If it isn't Kanon-kun!`
` It's been so long! How are ya doin'?!"`
`Uncle Hideyoshi suddenly shouted.`
`In the direction he was waving...`
`...was a slender boy.`
`Meeting him right after a huge man like Gohda probably emphasized his small stature.`
`The boy was in the middle of transporting piled-up gardening tools and the like in a wheelbarrow.`
`When he realized he was being called to stop, he set down the wheelbarrow, took his hat off and bowed his head.`
`"............`
`...Good afternoon."`
`...I figured he was probably younger than me.`
`And I realized by the general atmosphere surrounding him that he was another servant.`
`He greeted us in response to Uncle Hideyoshi's call, but he seemed like he might be pretty unsociable most of the time.`
`It was a greeting that lacked feeling.`
`When Gohda-san noticed that our interest had shifted towards him, he went to the boy's side and introduced him to us.`
`"Battler-sama, allow me to introduce you.`
` This is one of the servants of the Ushiromiya Head Household.`
` ...Kanon-san, greet our guest."`
`"............I'm pleased to meet you.`
` I am the servant.........`
`Kanon (嘉音)."`
`Yep, my first impression wasn't wrong.`
` He seemed to be unsociable, or at least not so good at talking.`
`Compared to Gohda-san, who was extraordinarily polished as a servant,`
` you couldn't help but feel an inexperience typical of his age.`
`When Gohda-san urged him in a whisper to give a bit more of an introduction, the boy named Kanon only cast his eyes downwards.`
`"Kanon-san,`
` could you perhaps give them a little more of a greeting...?"`
`".........No.`
` .........Because we...`
`are furniture."`
`He didn't seem to be refusing to greet us out of spite.`
` Rather, he seemed to have fallen silent because he didn't know what else to say to us in greeting.`
`"W-Well, Kanon-kun's shy and doesn't tend to talk much.`
` He might not be that sociable, but deep down he's really a good person!`
` Don't get him wrong...!`
` You've been working here for three years, haven't you?`
` Pretty sure you started a year before Gohda-san, right?"`
`Even though he wasn't exactly giving a terrible first impression, Jessica hurriedly backed him up.`
`...I see, apparently his unsociable nature causes him trouble a lot.`
`"Okay then, nice to meet you.`
` I'm Battler!`
` I'm 18. How old are you?"`
`"..........................."`
`He fell silent, as though wondering whether or not it was a question he'd have to answer.`
` ...But here again, Jessica plowed ahead.`
`"Um, uhh...!`
` If I remember correctly, Kanon's two years younger than us, so...sixteen, right?"`
`".........Yes, ...that is correct."`
`It looked like he would've preferred not to tell us his age if given the choice.`
`That was probably because he thought we'd look down on him for it.`
`...I remember that when I was around his age, I hated being asked how old I was by adults.`
`...I see, sixteen huh?`
`That's gotta be a delicate time.`
`...Which means I probably asked something I shouldn't have.`
`"Heh heh, I'm glad you're about our age!`
` Just be cool and call me Battler!`
` And I'll call you Kanon!"`
`".........Thank you very much.`
` But the sentiment alone is sufficient, ...Battler-sama."`
`Jessica looked panicky for some reason.`
`She seemed to think my impression of Kanon was getting worse because of his refusal.`
`Well, as a girl, Jessica probably couldn't understand the fretful male heart at this age.`
`As his elder, even by just two years, I took it upon myself to be understanding of that.`
`"Kanon-san, could you perhaps be a little more courteous?`
` A smiling face is also part of a servant's duty."`
`"...............My apologies.`
` ...I shall make an effort."`
`"Hohohoh...`
` Gohda-san, Kanon-kun is trying his best, yes?"`
`It looked like he was often warned about being unsociable.`
`And apparently he hadn't improved one bit.`
`Gohda-san kept his business smile but let a small sigh of resignation escape.`
`"...Well then, I still have work to do.`
` ......If you'll excuse me."`
`It looked like Kanon himself was uncomfortable with remaining silent here any longer.`
`After another perfunctory bow, he turned around and started pushing the wheelbarrow again.`
`Just then, the wheelbarrow suddenly wobbled and fell, scattering the load.`
`I guess the wheelbarrow's single wheel got caught on a pebble and lost its balance.`
`"What do you think you're doing...? Now, now, clean it up quickly...!"`
`Gohda-san urged him to hurry in a quiet voice, as though hinting that it was shameful for a servant to appear clumsy in front of guests.`
`Kanon-kun wordlessly reloaded the wheelbarrow with the fallen objects, as if to say that he understood quite well without being told.`
`He seemed to be fine with the light-looking gardening tools, shovels and such, but he looked like he was having trouble getting his arms around and lifting up some sacks of fertilizer.`
`"Are you okay? You're so careless.`
` Here."`
`"Milady, you will dirty your garments.`
` Please, leave this to us."`
`With a smooth motion, Gohda-san took the shovel that Jessica had picked up.`
`Behind him, Kanon-kun was having trouble with the sacks of fertilizer.`
`"......Uu-.`
` You'll dirty your garments?"`
`"Don't worry, the ones I'm wearing aren't that expensive.`
` Besides, I hate guys who just sit there and make the waitress pick up the fork they dropped at a restaurant."`
`I lifted up the other bags that had fallen.`
`Of course, they weren't light, but for me it was a piece of cake.`
`Kanon-kun looked at me, surprised.`
`It was the face of someone who never would've expected to receive help from a guest. `
`"............B-Battler-sama,`
` don't worry about it... I will take care of everything, so..."`
`"Don't you worry!`
` I may not look it, but I've got it where it counts!`
` Heheh!"`
`Since Kanon-kun looked like he hadn't yet gone through his growth spurt, he was stuck with a sorta weak body.`
`This kind of weight might've been too much for him.`
`"It's quite heavy.`
` It's natural that it would be difficult for you.`
` Don't worry about it, Kanon-kun."`
`"Okay, my time to shine.`
` This makes up for the boat stuff from before, right?"`
`"Ha!`
` As if this could make up for freaking out like that!`
` Ahahaha!`
` Later, I'll tell you about it too, Kanon-kun! Battler was totally hilarious!"`
`"Gonna faaall, faaall!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`As they did this, I piled all the stuff back into the wheelbarrow.`
`"............I beg your forgiveness...for letting you witness such unsightliness."`
`"Come now, that's quite enough.`
` Please, go."`
`Letting the guests, who were supposed to feel welcome, see such a disgraceful thing...`
`must have been hideously embarrassing for a servant.`
`Pressed by Gohda to hurry up and go, Kanon-kun left.`
`"You're too harsh on him, Gohda-san.`
` Shouldn't you have helped him, instead of being a bully?"`
`"...That was wrong of me.`
` I deeply implore your forgiveness."`
`Without even a twitch in his smile, Gohda-san apologized elegantly.`
`"Kanon-kun has a ton a things he's good at too.`
` It's just that bein' young works against him all the time.`
` It's a cryin' shame."`
`"Well, it's a prickly age.`
` Let's just leave him be.`
` After all, closed-mouthed servants are the best kind.`
` Isn't that right, Kumasawa-san?"`
`"Hohohohoh, Rudolf-sama, you truly are harsh!`
` There is no servant as silent as me, of course!"`
`Everyone smiled wryly at that obvious lie.`
`Even she herself didn't believe that, not in her wildest dreams.`
`So, she must've said it to lighten the mood.`
`Yeah, that's the kind of character Kumasawa baa-chan used to be.`
`The once stiff atmosphere had cleared up at once thanks to her cheerful smile.`
`"I'd like to set down our luggage soon.`
` Gohda-san, what rooms are we all going to take?"`
`"It shall be the same as the previous year.`
` Allow me to guide you.`
` Please, this way."`
`We headed towards a trim, elegantly simple guesthouse.`
`This was gonna be our temporary quarters for the night.`
`".........................................."`
`Kanon watched over a hedge as the guests all entered the guesthouse.`
`Then, he let his eyes fall on those heavy sacks of fertilizer, piled up in the wheelbarrow.`
`In his mind, he kept going over his previous mistake.`
`Battler, big and strong, had picked up the sacks in front of him, the sacks Kanon couldn't lift himself, as if they were feathers.`
`It would be extremely difficult for an outside observer to guess what emotions that favor had stirred up in Kanon.`
`But as far as you could tell by watching him hang his head, there was something that he just couldn't let go of.`
`...Muttered words escaped his lips.`
`But those words he murmured were so soft that they didn't reach even his own ears.`
`'!s1`
`.................."`
`Kanon hung his head, slightly biting his lower lip...`
`"I remember the rose garden,`
` ...but I don't remember this guesthouse at all.`
` Was it built recently?"`
`'Toraian' (Visitor's Retreat) was written on a gatepost-like thing, but since everyone called it the guesthouse, I followed their lead.`
`The brand-new Western-style guesthouse, which stood overlooking the roses, had a magnificent design carefully done in harmony with the garden.`
`"Correct!`
` It was built the year before last.`
` Ever since then, they've had us sleep over here."`
`"Heheh, this place is more fun than that junky old mansion you knew.`
` I wish my room was over here!"`
`"Uu-!`
` I want a room here too!`
` I want one!"`
`...I guess you could say my own house was upper-class, but to me, it felt completely ordinary compared to the Head Family.`
`The display of wealth was shocking, as was the fact that they'd build this kind of awesome guesthouse for guests who came over only a few times a year.`
`"Eva-sama, Hideyoshi-sama,`
` please, do make use of this room.`
` Rudolf-sama, Kyrie-sama, please take this room here."`
`"I really do love how beautiful and elegant this place is.`
` Western-style architecture truly is wonderful."`
`"I can handle Western design for a few days, but any longer than that and you need the good old Japanese look!`
` Japanese people just relax best on tatami mats."`
`"...Haha, they've been fighting over whether to make our new house Japanese-style or Western-style.`
` Mom still holds a grudge about Dad having the construction started with a Japanese layout, and they bicker all the time about it."`
`"I'm really jealous, George nii-san. Your parents get along well, don't they?`
` Mine are so frosty.`
` Then again, they're always in sync when it comes to my grades."`
`All the rooms seemed to be for two people.`
`I was grateful, since I wasn't gonna be forced to share the same room with the old bastard, under the pretext that we were family.`
`And anyway, I figure those two wouldn't be able to enjoy themselves with someone like me around, ihihi.`
`"What's with that creepy smile? `
` You're thinking about something dirty, aren't you?"`
`"Ihihihi!`
` Something diiirrrty? Of cooouuurse not!`
` Please enjoy your staaay!`
` Ow, owowowow!`
` That hurts, you old bastard!"`
`Once again, Dad pulled my ears from behind.`
`"Cut the crap.`
` I'm getting a stomachache, and I'm not in the mood for this.`
` You're the guest of honor this time around,`
` so play as nice as possible with Dad and Aniki and the rest.`
` ......At the very least, be careful of what you say in front of Dad, got it?`
` Because wisecracks don't go too well with him.`
` ......Jessica-chan, what's the Head's mood been like lately?"`
`"...Hmm......`
` Same as last year, I guess.`
` ......Considering they say he's got three months left to live, he's as lively, `
`grumpy, `
`and irritable as ever."`
`"Meaning, this year he's in his usual bad mood.`
` ......And as usual, the only one who's able to look after him is Genji-san?"`
`"It seems the Master will open his heart to no one else.`
` Lately, us small people have not even been granted an audience with him..."`
`"He's shut himself up in his study again, probably doing nothing but that weird black magic of his.`
` What he does for a hobby is his own damn business, but when he starts stinking up the house, it really gets on my nerves.`
` ...I wish he'd never come out of that study again.`
` Heheheh!"`
`"You shouldn't talk like that about the elderly.`
` We're all indebted to him, since he rebuilt the Ushiromiya Family. We should be more grateful."`
`"Hm, ...well...`
` ......Sorry."`
`After being rebuked by George-aniki, Jessica had no choice but to take back her thoughtless remark.`
`The Ushiromiya family was wealthy beyond belief, but of course, that meant all its members were a bit strange...and completely out of touch with the world at large.`
`And at the top of the chain, the Family Head--our Grandfather--seemed especially strange and terrifying, even for our family.`
`Dad said he was getting a stomachache earlier, ...and I imagine that reflected the honest feelings of all the adults here today.`
`No doubt they were jealous of us grandchildren, who could just play around and laugh without a care.`
`From the stories Dad told me, the Family Head was a violent man who ruled with his fists, beating his children, even his daughters, mercilessly with a wooden sword.`
`If he was so strict and uptight about that, why couldn't he have been a little more conservative with his kids' names?`
`Because of that, even us grandkids have had to suffer.`
`...Anyway, I can't say I have any trouble believing those terrifying stories about him.`
`I don't remember meeting him very often, but I think I recall him looking extremely grumpy all the time, always making people cower with that sharp gaze of his.`
`I remember that the room's atmosphere got so tense whenever he was around, you couldn't even breathe.`
`What my dad said about me being the guest of honor now carries a little more oomph for me.`
`".........Six years ago I was in elementary school, but I'm a high-schooler now.`
` If I act up, things could get serious.`
` ...Oooh, scary."`
`"He does look frightening, but he's not so terrifying that you need to tense up like that.`
` Nothing of what he says is truly unreasonable.`
` He may be clumsy at talking, but he's a very logical person."`
`"But George nii-san, you've been the family darling since like forever because of your awesome grades, right?`
` Grandfather treats us completely different!`
` I've even gotten slapped with a wooden sword.`
` On my ass, my ass!`
` On my maidenly, innocent ass!"`
`"Well, you're the heiress of the Head Family, Jessica-chan.`
` Grandfather is giving you special attention.`
` You've got to realize that his strictness reflects his high hopes for you."`
`"Oh, come on. `
` ...Seriously, I could just turn the succession over to you, George nii-san.`
` It's a bit of a heavy burden for me to carry."`
`I think I already said it before, but Jessica's the girl heir to the Head Family.`
`We're only cousins in branch families, so she probably feels a totally different sort of pressure than we do.`
`".........Uu-?`
` Jessica onee-chan, is that heavy?`
` If I help hold it, will it get lighter?"`
`"Hmm?`
` Ahahahaha, thanks.`
` It's okay, I'm not gonna push it on you, Maria.`
` ......I'm gonna bear this cross until my grave.`
` ...Don't worry."`
`She was grateful for Maria's innocent concern, but Jessica's face still seemed to contain some of the uneasiness she felt towards the future. `
`...Maybe we were in the same boat.`
` Any high-schooler with exams approaching would have trouble hiding their anxiety for the future.`
`"Maria, come here.`
` You and I will be in this room."`
`"Battler-kun, I heard you're gonna be with me in this room here."`
`"Oh?`
` Now there's a surprise!`
` It's bigger than our parents' rooms, dang!"`
`"Well, I figured we cousins would all want to hang out together,`
` so I told them to get a bigger room ready."`
`"Uu-!`
` I like it here more too!`
` I'd rather be here than with Mama!`
` Uu-uu-!"`
`"Oh, you like it better here too, Maria?!`
` Okay, this room is George's and mine, but we'll give you special permission to come in!`
` Better keep it a secret from your mom, okay?"`
`"Uu-!`
` It's a secret!"`
`Aunt Rosa was right behind us, but Maria still answered, striking the air with her fists clenched tight.`
`After setting down their luggage in their rooms, our parents had gathered again in the corridor.`
`"Hey, what are you brats planning to do?`
` Are you cousins just gonna stay here and chat?"`
`It seemed they were heading to the mansion to announce their arrival.`
`...Normally, they would make us follow them and greet everyone together, `
`but if that had been the case, Dad would've just told us to come, and that'd be the end of it.`
`He's saying it's okay if we don't come, so what'll we do?`
`"Well, it's gonna be lunchtime before long anyway.`
` Better let the kids unwind here.`
` Besides, if worst comes to worst, this might be their last chance to play outdoors."`
`"Uu-!`
` I'll go too!"`
`"Maria, you house-sit for Mama, okay?`
` Behave yourself and wait here."`
`"......Uu-."`
`Since Maria was being told to house-sit here, we certainly couldn't leave her on her own.`
`George-aniki noticed this immediately and gave a clear reply for all of us cousins.`
`"Well then, we'll accept your offer and house-sit.`
` We've got lots of stories to tell each other, after being away for a year."`
`"That sounds wonderful.`
` And Battler-kun has six years' worth of stories to tell, doesn't he?"`
`"Yeah, yeah.`
` I'll take care of the house like a good boy."`
`"Kumasawa-san, I'm gonna stay here too!`
` We'll break rank and leave the rest to the adults, heheheh!"`
`"Perhaps that would be best, hohohoh.`
` I'll report it to Madam..."`
`"Then allow me to guide you all to the mansion.`
` This way, please."`
`"...The other children are one thing, but George is getting to be an adult. Wouldn't it be better if he came with us?"`
`"If we make him come, then poor George will be the only one out of place.`
` Interactin' with his cousins is also important.`
` Okay, see ya'll later!"`
`The adults left one after the other.`
`They left in the same formation as our trip from the harbor, with Gohda-san leading and Kumasawa-san taking up the rear.`
`As we gathered in the room assigned to us cousins, George-aniki asked us to excuse him for a second.`
` He rushed over to Kumasawa-san, who was following behind the disappearing adults, and seemed to ask her something.`
`He soon finished his business and came back.`
`"What's up, Aniki?"`
`"Ah, nothing.`
` I just wanted to ask her something."`
`"Uu-!`
` Tell me too!`
` Tell me too!"`
`"...Hmm?`
` Heheheheh.`
` What could George nii-san be asking Kumasawa-san and not me, I wonder?`
` Ah, I don't have a clue!"`
`"No, it's a misunderstanding...!`
` ...Not that I know what you're misunderstanding...!"`
`Aniki was getting pretty tongue-tied.`
`It was almost as though he felt guilty about something, and Jessica knew exactly what he was worried about.`
`At any rate, it's no fun if Jessica gets to know about it and not me!`
`"Hey, Maria, it looks like we're the only two out of the loop, right?`
` Don't you wanna know what they're talking about?!"`
`"Uu-!`
` We wanna know too!`
` We wanna know too!"`
`""Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!""`
`I fooled around while 'uu'-ing together with Maria.`
`"No, I'm telling you... It's no big deal, ahahaha..."`
`"Liar!`
` I'm surprised you'd tell such a terrible lie, Aniki. Confess!`
` Maria, you tickle his right side, I'll tickle his left!"`
`"Uu-!`
` I've got his right side, Battler's got his left!`
` Uu-!"`
`"Wait a second!!`
` Wait, you two...!!`
` Ahahaha, `
`stop, `
`ahahahahahaha!!"`
`Maria and I played around, chasing George-aniki as he tried to escape, rolling on the bed.`
`I realize high-schoolers aren't supposed to bounce around like kittens, but I still missed this kind of fun.`
`A warm, cozy kind of fun.`
`"Haahahahaha, George nii-san, what were you asking Kumasawa-san?`
` Hmm?`
` Well, I've got a good guess.`
` It's been a year since the last time he visited the Head Family.`
` Who knows what servants might've come and gone during that time? Either way, it looks like he'd like to go and say hi."`
`"......Uu-?`
` Say hi, I wanna to say hi too!"`
`"What the hell, that's nothing to feel guilty about, Aniki.`
` ......Hmmmm?`
` I'm not buying it.`
` Maria, don't be fooled, Aniki's still hiding something!`
` More torture!!`
` Uworyaaa!!"`
`"S-Stop it, seriously!`
` Aahahahahaha!`
` Maria-chan, you too, stop already!!"`
`"Aahahahahaha, aahahahahaha!`
` Hahahaha!!"`
`"She's probably busy cleaning or getting lunch ready.`
` Don't worry, she'll drop by to say hi sooner or later.`
` Heh, I'll bet you'd rather've been welcomed in by Shannon instead of that nosy Gohda.`
` Heheheh!"`
`"Shannon?`
` ......Shannon.`
` ...Aaaaahh...`
` Yeah, I remember a girl with that name!`
` Is she still a servant?`
` How's she doing?!"`
`"By the way, Natsuhi nee-san,`
` how's your headache been lately?`
` It seemed pretty serious before."`
`"...I have been much better lately.`
` Thank you for your concern."`
`"Oh, right. Here.`
` A present for you, Natsuhi nee-san."`
`"......Thank you very much.`
` I'm always receiving gifts from you.`
` ...Is this black tea?"`
`"It's herb tea with peppermint and lemon balm.`
` It's a blend from a well-known store, and it's supposed to be good for headaches.`
` I thought it might help you too."`
`Rosa was always a conscientious woman.`
`...Probably because she was the youngest of four and much younger than the other three, `
`she managed to grow up without gaining the venomous nature of her siblings.`
`Her kind words got Natsuhi to soften her expression for just a moment,`
` but it wasn't enough to melt her stony gaze, hardened as it was by long years of mental stress.`
`"Come to think of it, you're always complaining about those headaches.`
` Pull yourself together.`
` Jessica-chan has her exams this year, right?`
` That's going to be a turning point in her life.`
` Will she really be able to rely on you as a mother if you're like that?`
` Besides, Natsuhi nee-san, you're three years younger than me.`
` You should get your act together."`
`"............`
`.........I apologize.`
` I've had a tendency for headaches all my life."`
`Even under normal circumstances, Eva sometimes failed to choose her words carefully,`
` but her comments aimed at Natsuhi contained shards of obvious malice, though she hid it with a smile.`
`Of course, that fact didn't escape Natsuhi.`
`She frantically contained her urge to grimace and pretended to ignore Eva.`
`"Our Battler-kun will have his exams this year too.`
` Rudolf-san, shouldn't you be a little concerned as well?`
` For the sake of your own son, you'd better get serious to the point of having headaches like Natsuhi nee-san."`
`"If I say anything, he automatically rebels.`
` So what should I say? Should I say the opposite, that it's okay for him to mess around?`
` That's probably the only way I could get him to listen to me.`
` Hideyoshi nii-san, George did really well on his exams, right?`
` Please, you've gotta teach me the trick to handling children."`
`"Hmm, well...`
` It's probably because I got him to understand why he should study!`
` Study isn't worth anything on its own.`
` That's right, the real point of studyin' is to practice researchin' stuff on your own whenever you bump into something ya don't know!`
` If ya can't do that, ya can't be useful to society!`
` I'm not talkin' about math or writin'.`
` Ya gotta learn how to learn!"`
`"...That's splendid.`
` I wish our Jessica could understand that as well.`
` If she is to be the heiress of the Ushiromiya family, then at this rate-"`
`"Do you really have to force her into becoming the successor?`
` After all, a woman has to find a woman's happiness.`
` Parents shouldn't force such things on their children, don't you think?"`
`"Hold your horses, Eva.`
` Each family has its own way of raising their kids.`
` You shouldn't be pushy."`
`"I'm sorry.`
` Natsuhi nee-san, don't take it the wrong way."`
`"..........................."`
`Though the light shining in through the window was quite warm despite the cloudy weather, there was a dark mood about the room,`
` ...which was probably causing headaches for more than just Natsuhi.`
`As if to sweep away that mood, Kyrie brightly made a suggestion to all present.`
`"Still, this black tea has a really lovely aroma.`
` Let's drink it right away.`
` In Japan, surely you couldn't find something like Leopold's black tea anywhere but Ginza, right?"`
`"I see you know a lot about it, Kyrie nee-san.`
` I guess it was worth going to the trouble of buying it."`
`Kyrie and Rosa stood up from their seats and made as if to prepare the black tea, `
`but Natsuhi forestalled them.`
`"......I thank you both,`
` but we can try that later.`
` One of our people will soon be coming to bring some tea, so please relax."`
`"Leave it for later, you two.`
` Let's enjoy our 'welcome drink'."`
`Rudolf gave a subtle signal with his eyes for them to sit down again.`
`...Kyrie and Rosa understood instantly and obediently returned to their seats.`
`The initial greeting of the guests was complete, so it was time for them to be served some tea.`
`...It was embarrassing for the host that the tea was late, especially now that the guests were talking about making tea themselves.`
`Natsuhi bit her lower lip, frustrated by the ineptitude of the servants who were late bringing in the tea.`
`...Seeing her face, Eva immediately started to giggle.`
`......Of course, Shannon had no way of knowing what was taking place in the parlor.`
`She came pushing a serving cart piled with tea cups.`
` For no apparent reason, Natsuhi gave her a pained look, and Shannon couldn't help but flinch without knowing what she had done wrong.`
`"......E-Excuse me.`
` Your tea is ready."`
`"Oh, Shannon-chan, it's been a while!`
` You keep getting prettier every time I see you!"`
`".........Oh, `
`...um, `
`.........thanks..."`
`"Save the chatting for after you've set the table.`
` The tea will get cold."`
`"......I-I apologize, Madam."`
`She apologized like a small frightened animal, bumped against the serving cart, and made a jarring racket as she dropped several teaspoons.`
`Her clumsiness made Natsuhi's expression turn even darker, which made Shannon quail even more.`
`"Come on, Natsuhi nee-san.`
` There's nothing wrong with her exchanging a few words in greeting.`
` The tea must be plenty cold already, considering how long we've been kept waiting.`
` Heheheh."`
`"Th-There's no need to worry...`
` It's not cold yet..."`
`".........Shannon, finish setting the table, quickly."`
`"I-I'm sorry, Madam......"`
`Natsuhi's irritation was obvious by now.`
`...The ineptitude that delayed the tea, the clumsiness of the servant...`
` Everything pointed to the incompetence of Natsuhi's everyday leadership, making her lose face.`
`As the person in charge of the Ushiromiya Head Family's kitchen, allowing that clumsiness to be exposed--today of all days--was surely nothing less than total humiliation.`
`"Lay off, Natsuhi nee-san.`
` Don't you think it's a little harsh to bully Shannon-chan when she's trying her best?"`
`"I'm not bullying anyone...!"`
`"What a nice aroma.`
` May I ask what brand this is?"`
`"............Umm, `
`...I-`
`I'm terribly sorry...`
` I'll find out for you later..."`
`Kyrie was trying to be nice, hoping to cut through the tense mood.`
`...However, Shannon had embarrassed herself instead, darkening Natsuhi's face and the room's mood.`
`By this point, Eva was audibly giggling.`
`"Whaat's this?`
` Shannon-chan, don't you even know what you're pouring us?`
` Come now, you mustn't serve something so suspicious to guests.`
` We'll need a silver spoon at the very least before we can drink this."`
`"...I-`
`I'm sorry...`
` I'll go get one immediately..."`
`"Shannon-chan,`
` do you know what silver spoons are used for?`
` They have to be silver.`
` Do you know why?"`
`"......No, `
`...umm..."`
`A teasing smile rose to Eva's face as she stared at Shannon setting the table.`
`By itself, Eva's expression was sweet in an impish sort of way.`
`However, the words being spun from her lips held the keenness of a razor within them.`
`Shannon tried with all her might to avoid Eva's continuing gaze.`
`Realizing that Shannon was hard-pressed for an answer, Rosa gave some timely help.`
`"They say that if silver is touched by poison, it darkens.`
` ...*giggle* Guess you've learned something today, Shannon-chan."`
`They were acting as though this tea needed to be tested for poison before it could be drunk.`
`In Natsuhi's eyes, this was an insult both to the tea...and to herself for serving it.`
`Rudolf laughed flippantly and patted Eva's shoulder.`
`"Haha, silver cutlery wouldn't do any good for you, Aneki.`
` Just one lick of your poisonous tongue, and even a silver plate would turn pitch black."`
`"Wahahahaha!`
` Since I get to hear that poison tongue every day, I must be poison-proof myself by now!`
` Eva, I don't mind when you use it on me, but you'd better hold back when talking to people who haven't built up a resistance!`
` Wahahahaha!"`
`"My, how cruel.`
` All I did was teach Shannon-chan a bit about tea, didn't I?`
` *giggle*"`
`Everyone followed the lead set by Hideyoshi's horselaugh and chuckled, though not easily.`
`Only Natsuhi didn't join in, but for the time being, the conversation inside the parlor could now be mistaken for a lively and friendly chat.`
`As Shannon finally finished setting the tea table and tried to leave, Kyrie apologized to her in a low voice for not being able to help.`
`...Shannon gave a light bow and made a hasty retreat......`
`Shannon cast her eyes downwards as she pushed the cart down the corridor...`
`Anyone seeing the pitiful way she looked might easily conclude that she'd been bullied in some way.`
`"...Don't be sad.`
` You didn't do anything wrong, Nee-san."`
`"......You were watching."`
`"That is my role."`
`".................."`
`"Madam and Eva-sama can go to hell.`
` ......But the worst coward is that guy."`
`Kanon glared hatefully in the opposite direction of the parlor.`
`The preparations for the tea had been delayed by some trifling problems in the kitchen.`
`These problems were not Shannon's fault.`
`In fact, it had been Gohda's mistake.`
`After all, there was no way a showoff like Gohda would give up a flashy job like bringing in tea when the guests arrived.`
`He had ended up wasting time preparing the tea once again.`
`So, when he realized he wouldn't be able to score any points for this job, `
`he pushed the task of setting the table on Shannon, who happened to be passing by.`
`...You might call it a clever move on his part, but there could be no doubt that it was a cowardly one.`
`"......It's okay, Kanon-kun. Thanks.`
` I'm not bothered by it at all..."`
`"................................."`
`Kanon's silence vividly expressed the distance between Shannon's words and how she actually felt.`
`"......Thank you.`
` Even if you're the only one who understands, I feel a bit better."`
`"......You keep your feelings too bottled up, Nee-san.`
` ......You should be less hard on yourself for once."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Thanks."`
`Suddenly, they both felt someone's presence and whirled around.`
`A middle-aged man stood there.`
`It was Genji, the head servant.`
`".........What are you doing there?`
` ...Shannon, hurry back to the kitchen."`
`"Y-Yes.`
` ......If you'll excuse me......"`
`"................................."`
`Shannon humbly obeyed and promptly made to push the cart and leave.`
`However, Kanon appealed to Genji in silence, bearing something in his eyes that he could not express in words.`
`"......What is it?`
` Did something happen...?"`
`"...Sh-`
`Shannon didn't do anything wrong.`
` But even so, they..."`
`"Stop it, Kanon-kun...`
` ...Please excuse me.`
` I'll return to work immediately.`
` Kanon-kun, you should go back to your post too.`
` ......Please."`
`"......If you say so, Nee-san."`
`"............`
`...If that is all, then go."`
`"...Yes.`
` ...If you'll excuse me."`
`From the shadows in the hallway, an old woman wearing an apron watched over them.`
` It was Kumasawa...`
`......Poor Shannon-san, Kanon-san...`
`There's no reason for those two to be picked on. `
`...Still, Gohda-san's dislike for them is an undeniable fact...`
`Until Gohda-san was taken in by the Ushiromiya Head Family, I hear he worked for a fabulous hotel somewhere.`
`The manner of work he learned there was quite impressive, I believe.`
`It's just that...Gohda-san is the newest servant here.`
`...He must have a lot of pride accumulated from his previous positions.`
`Because Shannon-san and Kanon-kun are his seniors here at the mansion, and yet are inexperienced and have gone through much less in life than he has, he picks on them at every chance he gets...`
`And also, ...sad as it may be, they are disliked by Madam Natsuhi too...`
`Of course, if we're talking about experience, the Madam has been in this family much longer.`
`And yet...this is one point where I cannot help but sympathize with the Madam as well.`
`...Truly, the Master is a man with many sins on his conscience...`
`Why didn't he realize that such a trifling whim of his would give the Madam such an inferiority complex...?`
`...Of course, on the inside, even the Madam is fully aware that those two don't deserve to be treated so harshly...`
`...However, the heart has reasons that reason knows not...`
`Aah, I feel so sorry for them...`
`I can't do anything but watch over them from the shadows......`
`The four of us cousins were enjoying our stories, just shooting the breeze.`
`Anyway, there were both girls and guys here.`
` Plus, we had people over a wide spread of ages: adult, high school, and elementary school.`
`Even if we just talked about our own lives, the other three kept listening attentively.`
`"I think I'm finally getting used to all this.`
` Jessica and Maria have grown more than I could've imagined in the past six years.`
` To be honest, I was feeling a bit uncomfortable, but talking like this, I guess that on the inside, nothing's really changed since back then."`
`"I agree.`
` You haven't changed a bit, even after six years.`
` Even though your body's gotten gigantic, you're still a kid inside."`
`"Uu-!`
` I'm a kid too!`
` I'm a kid too!"`
`"Well, even you aren't gonna be a kid forever, are you, Maria?`
` I mean, you're gonna transform from a kid into a cute young lady, aren'tcha?`
` And when that happens, that flat-as-a-board chest'll reach Jessica's level, huh?`
` When that happens, you gotta let me touch 'em, okay? It's a promise!!"`
`"Uu-!`
` Let you touch 'em!`
` Promise!`
` Uu-!"`
`"N-No, Maria-chan!`
` You can't make that kind of promise, that's bad, bad, bad!"`
`"Uu-?`
` I promised, so I'll let him touch 'em!`
` I keep my promises!`
` Always keep them, uu-!!"`
`"...Mariaa, you really are an earnest, good girl...`
` The guy you marry's gonna be really lucky."`
`"Hey, stop trying to change the subject by making it sound pretty!`
` Maria, that promise never happened!`
` Never!"`
`"Uu-.`
` The promise is cancelled?`
` Uu-......"`
`"As I thought, without Battler-kun in our little quartet, this group of cousins just didn't feel complete.`
` These six years have been kind of lonely."`
`"...That's true.`
` We didn't really goof off like this.`
` Still, we did have have some pretty constructive conversations, right?`
` Stuff about preparing for our future, exam-taking, finding jobs."`
`"Oh, I'm so, so sorry!`
` Now that I'm here, we just talk about stupid stuff and mess around!"`
`"But I'm having more fun this year.`
` Uu-uu-!"`
`"That's true.`
` I agree, this year's the most fun yet."`
`Maria's sincere words probably spoke for everyone present.`
`George-aniki stroked Maria's head, and she giggled like a happy kitten...`
`"......Pardon me.`
` Your meal is ready."`
`A timid knocking sound and the equally timid voice of a young woman came through the door.`
`Jessica answered brightly.`
`"Shannon, come in!`
` You remember Battler, right?!"`
`Jessica stood up from the bed and opened the door.`
`There stood a servant girl who must've been about our age.`
`"I-It's been quite some time since we last met, Battler-sama.`
` It's nice to see you after six years. It's me, Shannon."`
`Trembling a little as she noticed me, she bowed deeply.`
`"...Ah...!`
` Jessica had me surprised, but look at you, Shannon-chan!`
` You've turned into a total beauty too, haven't you?!"`
`"Y-You are too kind..."`
`"Still, the food on this island must be reeeally nutritional, huh?`
` What are you eating and how are you training to get boobs that big?!!`
` Guess I'll have to feel 'em a bit and see whether yours or Jessica's are bigger, okaaay?!"`
`With both hands poised and saliva dribbling from my mouth, I closed in!`
`......For the sake of justice and my personal honor, `
`I'd like to point out that I don't suffer from some strange disease that makes my lymph nodes itch until I scratch my neck open and which can only be prevented by fondling breasts.`
`This is just a Battler-style method of communication.`
`If I slowly close in on her like this, odds are eight or nine out of ten that I get slapped or clobbered, right?`
`So, I can use this Battler-sama original technique to spark a gag like that and break the ice!`
`.........W-Well, it also means I really do get to touch them on that one-in-ten chance though, right?`
`Ihihyahyahya, like that'd ever happen!!`
`At that point, my hands were less than a centimeter away from Shannon-chan's boobs, ......but the counterstrike had yet to come.`
`She blushed and lowered her head in embarrassment when she realized what was going on,`
` but she just stood there with both hands politely joined in front of her, not even trying to resist or cover her breasts.`
`'!s0`
`P-P-Please, hit me right now, or I'm seriously gonna...!`
`...Which is why I was glad that Jessica chose that time to drive her elbow into the back of my head.`
`"Guaaaah, ooooowww! Thank you so much, Jessicaaaaaaa!!"`
`"W-W-Why the hell are you thanking me?!`
` ???"`
`"Seriously, my bad, Shannon-chan.`
` I almost got overwhelmed by your hypnotic chest...`
` More importantly, anyone who gets that close has gotta be a molester.`
` You've gotta fight back when people do that!"`
`"...B-But you are...`
`...an important guest, Battler-sama......"`
`"Now look here, a pervert's a pervert whether he's a guest or not!`
` A girl's chest has got an Air Defense Identification Range of about 10cm or so.`
` Once someone trespasses within two centimeters, that's already an invasion of airspace, so you'd better scramble the jets immediately and give 'em an instant slap!"`
`"...I-I couldn't do such a thing...!`
` Because we are......umm, furniture..."`
`Of course she didn't want her breasts touched, ...but if a guest so desired, she was prepared to sacrifice herself to suit their wants.`
`...A girl like this needs some urgent protection...`
`"...T-To think such devoted girls still existed in this era...`
` It's enough to make a man dizzy.`
` ......But, no!`
` NooOoo!!`
` I'm coming at you with a perverted face again!`
` Knock me down!!`
` Look out, pervert on the loose!`
` This gag can't end until you deliver the punch line, so slap me!`
` Please!`
` Hit meeee!!"`
`"I............I cannot fulfill your request, `
`because I'm furniture.`
` ......But, `
`............if it were an order, I'd obey you.`
` ...Because that is my duty."`
`"Ahaha, then I'll make it an order.`
` The next time Battler-kun tries to touch your breasts, counterattack with a slap.`
` Got it?"`
`"......Y-Yes.`
` As you wish.`
` From now on, that's what I'll do.`
` Please understand, Battler-sama..."`
`Shannon-chan announced this while bowing elegantly to me.`
`Her expression was radiant.`
`I gave her a thumbs-up to show her I was fine with that.`
`"Six years ago, you might've been mistaken for a servant's daughter who lent a hand at your parent's work,`
` ......but now you're a full-fledged adult servant.`
` How long have you been working here?"`
`"Well,`
` I've had the pleasure of serving this household for about ten years."`
`She's 紗音.`
` ......The kanji for her name are read as "Shannon".`
`Now here's another name that's far from typical for a Japanese person.`
`Back in the day, I was a kid myself, so I accepted her name without paying it much attention.`
` Thinking about it now though, her name's pretty unusual, even though she's not a member of the Ushiromiya family.`
`...Maybe it's like a servant's 'professional name' or something.`
`...If so, that might explain why her name's so similar to Kanon-kun, that kid I met earlier in the rose garden.`
`She's a long-term servant who's served here since she was six years old.`
`Her appearance had changed so much that I couldn't match her to the person of my memories, but we both knew each other six years ago.`
`That shy part of her had always been there, but she did seem to have developed the allure you'd expect of a girl her age.`
`Especially in her breasts. Yes.`
`"That kid we met earlier, Kanon-kun, is her little brother."`
`"...He's not exactly my little brother...`
` Still, he loves me like a big sister.`
` ...He didn't cause you any trouble, did he?"`
`"Haha!`
` He's the same as always.`
` If only he were just a bit more sociable."`
`"...I...apologize if he's caused you any trouble......"`
`"Nah, he didn't cause any trouble at all!`
` As a fellow man, I understand how moody you can get at that age.`
` It's no surprise he's unsociable!"`
`"Uu-!`
` I get called that all the time too!`
` I get called unsociable!`
` Just like Kanon!`
` Uu-!"`
`"*giggle* ......You aren't unsociable at all, Maria-sama."`
`"Uu-?`
` Wanted to be like him...`
` Uu-."`
`"Umm, you said the meal was ready, right?"`
`"Ah, ......yes!`
` I'm sorry!`
` ...Your meal has been fully prepared, so please allow me to guide you all to the mansion."`
`Shannon bowed again formally and returned to her 'duty mode'.`
`We realized that if we made her stick around for any more light conversation,`
` it would actually make it harder for her to do her job.`
` We got up off our butts to avoid interfering with her work any further.`
`"So, shall we go to the mansion?`
` Everyone's probably hungry, right?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I'm really looking forward to Gohda-san's food.`
` That guy was apparently a chef at this famous hotel, so he's super good at cooking!"`
`"Ooooh!`
` I can't wait!!`
` Let's go, Maria!`
` We're gonna stuff ourselves like pigs!!"`
`"Uu-!`
` Stuff ourselves like pigs!"`
`"No, no!`
` You can't take everything Battler-kun says seriously, okay?`
` Because he's always just joking around.`
` Okay, let's go."`
`Under Shannon-chan's guidance, we headed towards the mansion.`
`Met once again by the magnificent rose garden, we continued onward...as the intimidating mansion of the Ushiromiya Head Family came into view.`
`It had apparently been built shortly after the war, so you could feel the dignity of almost a half-century hanging about it.`
`The building was gorgeous on the surface, but old as it was, equipment such as its AC and heating were apparently quite frail.`
`According to Jessica, midwinter was especially tough, what with all the drafts.`
`...Haven't these people ever heard of a kotatsu?`
`As we entered the entrance hall, an aged servant greeted us.`
`Now him, I remembered.`
`Genji-san (源次), who had been working here longer than anyone, filled the role of head servant.`
`".........Battler-sama, it has been quite some time since last we met."`
`As our eyes met, he greeted me with a calm, composed voice.`
`His bow wasn't as graceful or refined as Gohda's, `
`but despite its simplicity, it communicated his feelings very well.`
`"Genji-san, it really has been a while!`
` You look well."`
`"Thank you. I have been quite well...`
` ...And Battler-sama, you have become a splendid young man.`
` .........You are beginning to resemble the Master in his youth."`
`"I look like Grandfather?`
` Guess that means Grandfather was pretty popular with the ladies when he was young, ihihi!"`
`".........From here on, I shall take Shannon's place and accompany you.`
` Please, come this way."`
`Shannon-chan bowed deeply and watched us leave.`
`After that, we headed towards the dining room under Genji-san's guidance.`
`Genji-san, just like Kumasawa-san, stood in stark contrast to us young people who had grown beyond recognition over the last six years.`
`His appearance was exactly the same as in my memories from six years ago.`
`It was as though time had stopped since the last time we met.`
`Genji-san was an extremely quiet and diligent person.`
`He was basically Grandfather's close aide or caregiver, `
`...and you might even call him Grandfather's companion of many years.`
`In fact, it seems he was by Grandfather's side even more often than my late Grandmother was.`
`According to Jessica, Grandfather trusted him more than any of his blood relatives.`
`But I wonder how long he's served.`
`I never got the details, but I heard something about him being here since the very beginning, when this mansion was first constructed.`
`...Which would mean that he's dedicated half of his life to serving here.`
` ...It's easy to see why he's so trusted.`
`As we passed through a massive hall that extended up into the second story of the mansion with no separating floor...`
`...I spotted something that hadn't existed in my memory of six years ago.`
`It was an awfully big portrait hanging right in front of the stairs that rose to the second floor.`
`Without thinking, I stopped walking, captivated by it...`
`Since I'd stopped so fast, Maria, who was following behind me, ran into my back.`
`"Uu-?"`
`"......Aah, sorry.`
` ...Hey, Jessica.`
` Has that picture always been there?"`
`I pointed at the big, prominently-displayed portrait in the hall.`
` Everyone else stopped too.`
`"...Oh, ...right.`
` When you last came here, that hadn't been hung yet, had it?`
` When was it again..."`
`"Well, `
`......if my memory doesn't fail me, it was put on display sometime around the year before last."`
`".........You are correct, sir.`
` In April of the year before last, the Master put it on display there, having previously ordered a painter to create it."`
`"Grandfather did that?`
` So, he paid to have it painted just for him, huh...?"`
`The portrait suited this Western mansion, and that woman in the elegant dress gave off a sense of refinement.`
`......I couldn't have guessed her age, but her sharp eyes and the strong will she seemed to possess made her look youthful.`
`She seemed somehow different from the composed, middle-aged women you often see in famous pictures.`
`If she'd had normal black hair, I might've assumed it was a portrait of my long-deceased Grandmother in her prime.`
`However, she had beautiful blonde hair and didn't look Japanese at all.`
`"So,`
` ...just who is this lady?"`
`Maria answered that simple question enthusiastically, as though proud she knew the answer.`
`"Uu-!`
` I know.`
` She's Beatrice!"`
`"Bay-uh...what?"`
`"......Beatrice.`
` She's a witch.`
` Didn't you ever hear stories about her, long ago?"`
`"A witch?`
` ...You mean, `
`...the witch of this island?"`
`...I think I already said this, but Rokkenjima is a small island, only ten kilometers in circumference.`
`However, that's actually pretty massive, considering that only the Ushiromiya family lives here.`
`So, only the harbor and the area around the mansion were set up to be lived in.`
` Beyond that, the island remained as untouched as when it was uninhabited.`
`The vast and empty forest had absolutely no lights, phones, or people passing through.`
` To understand how dangerous that is, you need to forget your common sense as a city dweller.`
`After all, if you happened to fall down a hole in the depths of the forest and sprain your ankle,`
` no one would come save you, no matter how much you cried or screamed.`
`Then, once the sun went down, the forest would be wrapped in complete darkness, since there were no streetlights.`
`And, since there were no signs, it'd be easy to get lost and confused, losing your sense of direction inside that dark forest.`
`Nowadays, most people see a forest as a peaceful place, `
`but to the people of bygone eras, before the light of civilization drove out the night, forests were as geographically separated from civilization as the sea.`
` They were oceans above the ground.`
`Fishermen who go out into the ocean are putting their lives at risk, despite their technical knowledge...`
`In the same way, hunters who go out to the forest are in danger, despite having specialized knowledge of their own.`
`...If children were to go play in such a dangerous forest, something terrible might happen.`
`Someone's parents must have thought so.`
` ...Maybe Grandmother first said it, or maybe it was Grandfather himself.`
`Or perhaps the story's been passed down on this island since ancient times.`
`.........There's a terrible witch in the forest, so you must not go in.`
`At some point, this ghost story of Rokkenjima was born.`
`This is the legend of Rokkenjima's witch.`
`That's why, when we talk about a witch on this island, we're referring to the master of that vast and savage forest.`
`Come to think of it, when I stayed at this mansion as a little kid, during those eerie nights when the wind and rain pounded on the windows,`
` I remember being terrified by a story of the forest witch, who roamed around searching for human sacrifices...`
`So, `
`...Beatrice, huh?`
`.........When Aniki mentioned it, I searched my memory and was sure I recalled hearing a name like that when I was little.`
`"...I see.`
` Still, I totally forgot that the witch in that legend had an elegant name like Beatrice.`
` ......So, did Grandfather go out of his way to have a portrait made, just because we grandchildren didn't believe the story?"`
`"...She's the witch from Grandfather's delusions.`
` ...Ever since he had this picture hanged, he's been having a harder and harder time telling the difference between truth and fantasy.`
` ...To us, she's just a witch that exists in Grandfather's mind, ...but to him, she's a being that 'exists' on this island.`
` ...'Exists'.`
` He says he had that painting made because the rest of us would be incapable of understanding otherwise.`
` ......Hmph, the whole thing's creepy as hell."`
`"...Milady,`
` ...this portrait is precious to the Master.`
` ......I beg of you, do not say such things in front of him."`
`"......I know.`
` Even if you didn't tell me, I'd never do something like that."`
`Jessica glanced at the portrait with an irritated gaze before turning away.`
`"...Let's go.`
` We're making everyone wait in the dining room."`
`"Uu-!`
` I'm hungry!"`
`......Only a small portion of this island was controlled by the Ushiromiya family.`
`All of the lawless remainder...was the domain of the witch, Beatrice.`
`......You might even call her the true ruler of Rokkenjima.`
`I felt a faint revival of that unsettling sense of misfortune...`
`which I'd felt when I learned of the tutelary god's shrine being struck by lightning.`
`And I remembered that Kumasawa-san tried to tell an ominous story about Rokkenjima...before Jessica stopped her.`
`...I don't know what she was planning to tell us about this island.`
`But I do know one thing.`
`...It isn't the Ushiromiya family that rules Rokkenjima.`
`It's the witch, Beatrice.`
`That's right.`
` ......After all, this is the witch's island.`
`"Battler!`
` Uu-, you're slooow!"`
`When I looked around, everyone was already heading towards the dining room.`
`I hurriedly chased after them...`
`We walked up to the huge double doors that led to the dining room.`
`Genji-san knocked.`
`"...I have brought the children.`
` Please pardon the intrusion..."`
`The doors were opened, and we were invited inside.`
`The dining room, which looked exactly like you'd imagine a rich person's dining room to be,`
` had a super-long table that was obviously positioned with no purpose other than to make the guests conscious of their rank.`
` Our parents were already sitting in accordance with that ordering.`
`"You're late, brats.`
` Hurry up and take a seat."`
`The old bastard pressed us to sit.`
`The only gaps in that group of people were the spots we were supposed to sit, which only made us feel our tardiness all the more.`
`The seat at the head of the table, called the Incipient's Chair, was for the most highly ranked, reserved for Grandfather.`
`It was still empty.`
`...He probably wanted to show up last for dramatic effect.`
`From the perspective of someone facing the Incipient's Chair head on, the seating order went from left to right, with the lower ranking seats progressing in rows of two further away from it.`
`So, the left-hand side of the first row, closest to the Incipient's Chair, was where Uncle Krauss should have sat, since he was the second highest in rank.`
`.........It looked like he hadn't arrived yet, so that seat was empty.`
`Across from his chair, on the right side of the first row, sat the eldest daughter of the family, Aunt Eva, who was the third highest in rank.`
`The left-hand side of the second row was for the fourth highest in rank.`
`There sat my damned dad, Rudolf, the third of the siblings.`
`Across from him, on the right side of the second row, sat Aunt Rosa, the youngest sibling.`
`At this point, you might expect their husbands and wives to come next, `
`but nope, the left-hand seat in the third row, rank number six, belonged to Jessica.`
`Opposite her was George-aniki.`
`I sat next to Jessica, `
`...and Maria sat across from me.`
`Then, finally, next to me on the left-hand side of the fifth row, sat Aunt Natsuhi, the tenth highest in rank.`
`...Opposite her was Uncle Hideyoshi.`
` Next to Aunt Natsuhi, in the sixth row and the final seat on the left-hand side, sat Kyrie-san.`
`The seat opposite to Kyrie-san was empty, even though silverware had been set there and everything.`
`According to this ranking system, that spot was where Aunt Rosa's husband should be sitting.`
`......Even though he wasn't supposed to be coming, his place was made up.`
`Normally, ranking systems of this sort give spouses equal positions as their partners, but the Ushiromiya family's system was unique.`
`......Maybe it's a remnant of male chauvinism.`
`If you start with the assumption that a woman's womb is just something to be borrowed, then the children of direct descent would come first, directly followed by the grandchildren.`
`In other words, spouses have no blood ties and are therefore placed at the end of the line.`
`......It's terrible, but by this system, my Grandmother would be ranked even lower than me, if she were still alive.`
`In their youth, they obey their father; after they get married, their husband; after aging, their children.`
`There's the old saying: 'Women have no home in any realm'.`
`Long ago, when I was still incapable of figuring all this out,`
` I'd thought it was so great that we could all chat in our little groups, adult siblings with adult siblings and cousins with cousins.`
` However, now that I can reexamine the seating order after growing up a bit, it stirs up some very complicated feelings in me...`
`Aunt Natsuhi, who was married to the eldest son and was the de-facto number two in managing this family, sat to my right,`
` ...which meant that she was two steps lower than me in the ranking order.`
`...It was hard to imagine what might be going on inside her heart.`
`That's why I made a small apologetic gesture towards her before sitting down.`
`"How nice to see you, Battler-kun.`
` You've grown quite tall, haven't you?"`
`"Oh, uh, yep!`
` Six long years of eating well, sampling various cuisines, and deriving sustenance from Mother Earth's bountiful gifts. Hard work, but I pulled through."`
`"Growing just like a boy, I see.`
` How tall are you now?"`
`"I guess about 180 cm?`
` But Aunt Natsuhi, that's where you're supposed to say 'Heck, sounds like all you did was eat'!"`
`"Huh?`
` ...Oh, *giggle*, I'm sorry."`
`After a short pause, she did laugh with me, but it seemed she couldn't quite figure out what she was supposed to be laughing at.`
`This woman is Aunt Natsuhi (夏妃).`
`She's the wife of the eldest son of the family, meaning she's my father's older brother's wife.`
`Is it simpler if I just call her Jessica's mother?`
`...It feels bad to say it like this, but while I didn't exactly dislike her, I didn't particularly like her either.`
`She hardly ever spoke with us kids, and all my memories of her involve her talking to the adults about complicated things, with a scary look on her face.`
`...In fact, since we hardly ever exchange words, I spent a long time trying to figure out how I should approach her.`
`...Though my efforts seem to have ended in failure.`
`The silverware sat neatly on the table, but the meal itself hadn't been brought in yet.`
`As a general rule, you couldn't start a meal until the person sitting at the head of the table arrived.`
`So, as long as Grandfather didn't come, lunch would be put on hold indefinitely.`
`Not even the appetizers would arrive.`
`Simply put, the silence in this room was caused by our parents enduring their hunger while they waited for Grandfather to arrive.`
`However, the Grandfather from my memories would always show up on time to meals like this.`
`...He was the kind of person who would never be so late that it kept everyone waiting, especially after the entire group had arrived.`
`"Grandfather's pretty late.`
` ......As far as I can remember, he was always strict about time."`
`"Well, that might've been true six years ago,`
` ...but it hasn't been that way lately.`
` In fact, he's off in his own little world so often that he doesn't even show up at family meals.`
` ...Still, I figured he'd at least come down today.`
` ...Then again, I feel a lot more relaxed and happy without him."`
`"...Jessica!"`
`When her mother scolded her, Jessica stuck her tongue out and looked away.`
`......No way around it.`
`Might as well wait until our host arrives.`
`When I glanced at the clock, I saw that it was almost 12:20...`
`Ushiromiya Kinzo (金蔵), the aged Family Head of the Ushiromiya Head Family.`
`This man...could be seen in his study.`
`The clock had already passed noon, but he didn't even attempt to rise from his seat.`
`With his spectacles on, he built up a growing pile of books with elaborate bindings, which he then read intently.`
`You couldn't really say that he was having too much fun to stop.`
` Rather, he filled the room with a sense of impatience, or perhaps a sense of impending danger, as though every second wasted was a tragedy.`
`In this sealed room, a dense dust danced through the air, which was thick with the stench of chemicals that exuded a mix of suspicious odors.`
`...Those odors were somehow sweet...and heavy.`
`If anyone with a normal nose came in here, the first thing they'd do would be to open a window and ventilate this room.`
`The knocking against the study door had been going on for a while.`
`A voice calling 'Father' sometimes mingled with the knocks.`
`As Kinzo heaved a deep sigh, he snapped shut the old book in his hands and slammed it on the table.`
`Then, he yelled at Krauss, who was still knocking on the door.`
`'!s0`
` Enough with that racket, you fool!!!`
` Who told you the door would be opened if you but knocked?!`
` I'll crucify the imbecile!!`
` Do you wish to suffer the same fate?!!"`
`"......Father,`
` this is the day of the family conference, which happens only once a year, is it not?`
` Everyone's gathered down below.`
` Please come out."`
`Krauss called out to his father through the door.`
`...Kinzo always shut himself up in the study, hating it when nearly anyone, even his family, entered the room.`
`For that reason, Krauss had no choice but to call to him from the corridor like this...`
`"Molest me not!!`
` Just who is this 'everyone' of which you speak? Do you mean the fools trying to drag me out of here?!!`
` Then kill them all!`
` Tear them apart, use their bodies for firewood, and feed them into the witch's hearth!!`
` Put a pot in that hearth to boil the wormwood!`
` Force the imbeciles who dare try to lure me out of here to drink the broth of the Apocalypse!`
` I will soak their dregs in liquor!`
` Aah, where is Genji?!`
` Call for Genji!!`
` Have my demonic absinthe prepared!`
` The whispering of the green fairy reaches me no longer!!`
` Aah, where is Genji?! Bring him heeeeeere!!!"`
`...On the other side of the door, Krauss, Nanjo and Genji kept waiting for the master of the house, who stubbornly refused to come out.`
`"Hmph...`
` ...Looks like he hates me to the core.`
` My voice doesn't reach him anymore."`
`Krauss shrugged as though saying 'It's no use' and smiled bitterly.`
`...From the beginning, he hadn't really expected his Father to respond to his calls.`
`However, since it was the duty of the eldest son, he had tried as a formality.`
`"......Kinzo-san,`
` your sons, daughters and grandchildren have come to see you, have they not...?`
` Could you just let them see your face, if only for a short while...?"`
`'!s0`
` You dare to admonish me, Nanjo?!!`
` I never told anyone to get you, I told them to get Genji!!`
` Now call for him immediately!`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, kin_1e95:`
`Kinzo slammed an old, heavy book against the table over and over.`
`That racket clearly expressed his great displeasure.`
`Kinzo put his spectacles down and flew up from his chair.`
`He spread his arms wide open, as if to sing to a packed opera house, as if appealing to someone, and yelled.`
`"Why?!`
` Why is there always something in my way?!`
` I would throw it all away, I would offer up everything, and there is only one thing I ask in repayment!!"`
`"Ooh, Beatrice, if I could see your smile but one more time, I would plunder the smiles of the Earth and offer them all up to you!!`
` Oooh, commanders of the legions of locusts, reap the smiles of the Earth, *cough*cough*, *cough*cough*!!!`
` Aah, everything is filthy, everything is irksome!!"`
`"Why must I suffer this impediment on this most precious of days?!?!`
` *cough*cough*cough*cough*!!`
` *cough*cough*!!!`
` Call for Genjiiiii!!!`
` *cough*cough*cough*!!"`
`"......I have no idea what he's yelling about.`
` He's probably lost his mind by now."`
`"Krauss-san, `
`...isn't it a bit harsh to say such a thing of your own father...?"`
`"My father is already dead.`
` ......There's nothing here but a phantom of what Father once was.`
` At any rate, as long as he has no intention of coming out, there's nothing we can do."`
`".....................Kinzo-san."`
`Choking coughs continued to pour from the study...`
`"I'm going back downstairs.`
` ......It would be a waste to let the fruits of Gohda's prized cooking talent get any colder.`
` It's one of the few things our relatives can look forward to when they come to this house.`
` ...Hmph."`
`Krauss spun around.`
`He looked at his watch, mumbling and acting as though he had wasted time doing something he knew would be in vain.`
`"Genji-san,`
` ......Father is calling for you.`
` Keep him company."`
`"......Certainly."`
`"Doctor Nanjo, `
`let's go eat.`
` ......If we stay here any longer, this sweet stench will ruin our sense of taste."`
`Without waiting for Nanjo, Krauss went downstairs.`
`Genji urged Nanjo to go and eat.`
`...Nanjo glanced between the study door and Krauss's back as the latter disappeared down the stairs, then let out a deep sigh.`
`"......Sorry, Genji-san,`
` but please allow me to leave this in your hands."`
`"Yes, ......please leave it to me."`
`"Do what you can to avoid giving him alcohol.`
` ......That's a habit that's far too difficult to break."`
`"Is Genji not here yet?!!!`
` Who dares keep Genji from coming?!!`
` Aah, where's Genji, call for Genji!!!"`
`"Please, `
`......allow me to handle the situation here."`
`"...Very well.`
` .........Forgive me."`
`Nanjo bowed slightly and descended the stairs...`
`Genji watched him leave, then knocked on the study door.`
`".........Master,`
` it is Genji."`
`"Genji?!!`
` Why have you kept me waiting so long?!!`
` You're alone, I trust?!"`
`"Correct.`
` I am alone."`
`Kinzo returned to his seat in the study and pressed an old-fashioned switch on the table.`
`...After a small delay, the heavy sound of the door unlocking could be heard.`
`Kinzo was convinced that his family wanted to make a mess of his study.`
`Or perhaps someone had once opened the window for some air and ended up scattering things that, to him, were important research materials,`
` leaving him in a terrible mood.`
`...Kinzo had outfitted his room with a formidable lock, `
`preventing anyone from entering without his permission and thereby sealing himself in a jail of his own making.`
`Genji, whom he trusted the most, was relatively free to enter the room, but even that didn't always hold.`
`If Kinzo was in a bad mood, even Genji wouldn't be able to enter.`
`.........Anyone else would be limited to holding a conversation through the door, unable even to see Kinzo's face.`
`And most of the time, what they got could hardly be called a conversation.`
`However, this didn't trouble the rest of the family much.`
`After all, it just wasn't worth the effort to disturb this aging Family Head, who was impossible to please and always stayed shut away, immersed in his research.`
`Taking advantage of his refusal to leave his room, they supported his isolation, putting his care entirely into the hands of the servants.`
`"Genji, my usual.`
` I'm busy."`
`"......Yes sir."`
`Genji headed to a corner of the study.`
`There, suspicious-looking bottles boasting venomous colors were on display.`
`...They were actually liquor, but considering the shady atmosphere of this room, one might easily suspect them of being some ghastly poison.`
`Inside the study, the mysterious collection of books gathered by Kinzo had grown into a mountain.`
`They were bizarre ancient or banned books, all of them either forbidden, cursed, or sealed.`
`But if you tried to call them 'old books', Kinzo would fly into a rage and say...`
`"Call them Grimoires!"`
`There were also many mysterious objects that presumably held some meaning with regards to black magic, like candles suspiciously melted and molded into strange shapes.`
`The constellations drawn on a certain celestial globe contained quite a few shapes that would draw puzzled looks from anyone familiar with today's night sky.`
`The carelessly strewn-about books contained many illustrations, all of them of a religious or mysterious nature...`
`including some depicting demonically grotesque subjects or bizarre diagrams of various magic circles.`
`And above all, a sweet, poisonous smell filled the room, profoundly assaulting the eyes and noses of those who entered for the first time.`
` Eventually, it must surely make a person go numb and lose their grip on reality.`
`Inside that study, Genji prepared Kinzo's usual drink with a well-trained hand.`
`No one would even think of drinking such an ominous dark green liquid in that complex and ornate glass, unless someone first told them it was alcohol.`
`......He poured a little into the glass.`
` Then, he placed a cube of sugar in a strangely shaped spoon and poured water from a pitcher over it.`
`Strangely, when the transparent water was poured, the dark green liquid turned a cloudy white.`
`...It was a strange optical illusion, as though the water had caused a chemical reaction and made the drink become even more unrecognizable as liquor.`
`Then, Genji added original flavors Kinzo loved, fine-tuning its taste.`
`...There was no recipe.`
`Its success was measured only by Kinzo's mood swings when he drank it, and it had taken Genji many decades to learn how to do it right.`
`Genji placed the glass on a tray and walked over to Kinzo.`
`By this time, Kinzo was gazing out the window.`
`".........Here, Master."`
`"Thank you..."`
`Kinzo had regained his composure and was now unrecognizable as the shouting, screaming, yelling man from a few moments ago.`
`Looking at this man from behind as he tilted his glass and gazed down at the scenery beyond the window, `
`...he projected a sense of dignity and intelligence.`
`To allow Kinzo to set his glass down at any time, `
`Genji motionlessly waited behind Kinzo and to his left, as though he were a living sideboard.`
`Then, without averting his eyes from the window, Kinzo held out his glass.`
`There was only a mouthful remaining.`
`It was not a gesture intended to set it upon the tray, but a motion to hand the glass over to Genji.`
`"......Drink,`
` ...my friend."`
`"...............Your words are too kind for me."`
`"No need for ceremony between us.`
` ......Drink, `
`my friend."`
`".........Thank you."`
`Genji respectfully received the glass and inclined it a little to taste its contents.`
`After that, he gulped it down.`
`"I attempted to imitate your concoction, but no matter how I try, I cannot replicate the taste.`
` ......The way you make it is pure relish."`
`".........Thank you very much.`
` It is the fruit of your guidance, Master."`
`"Hmph..."`
`Kinzo smiled at his loyal subject, who refused to put aside rank even when asked to.`
`However, he was not making fun of him.`
` His smile was relaxed, as though chuckling at a close friend's old, unshakable habit.`
`".........We have grown old together.`
` I stopped counting the years long ago."`
`"It is entirely thanks to you, Master, that I have been able to live like this until today."`
`Kinzo gave a faint smile, as if to say he didn't need any flattery.`
`".........Until now, you have served me exceedingly well.`
` ......My sons call me eccentric.`
` The servants that were once many have all quit in fear of me.`
` ......Only you serve me even now."`
`"...Your words are more than I deserve."`
`".........My life will not last much longer.`
` ......My sons are vultures, lazily waiting for my inheritance to fall into their hands."`
`"........................"`
`"Krauss is a fool who squanders money like water, who throws away two gold coins to obtain one.`
` And then he has the gall to claim that he's earned money!!`
` Eva is a slave to money, who thinks of me as a mere chicken!!`
` When I die, she plans to use my bones to make a broth!!"`
`"That dunce Rudolf just wants to fool around with women!!`
` Rosa bore the baby of a man who came from nowhere and about whom we know nothing!!`
` Jessica is incompetent and uneducated!!`
` George has none of what it takes to be a man!`
` Battler is a fool who threw away the honor of the Ushiromiya family!!`
` And Maria is obscene to the eye!!"`
`"Why is the Ushiromiya blood so incompetent?!?!`
` Is there no one worthy to inherit the glory I built?!`
` Aah, of course, I know, this is part of Beatrice's curse, I know it!!`
` ...Hah, you Golden Witch, are you trying to take revenge against me in this way?"`
`"If you want to hate me, then do so!`
` If you want to run away, then run!!`
` I won't let you go, I won't let you go won't let you go won't let you go!!`
` You belong to me!!`
` You must always be in my arms!`
` For all my life!`
` You must stay in my birdcage for all eternity, whispering only to me!!`
` Beatrice......`
` Why...won't you smile back at me...?`
` OOOoooooh, OOOooOOOoooh...!!`
` BeatriceeeEEEeeee!!`
` OOOoooOOOOoohh......"`
`After howling, Kinzo choked once again.`
`Genji set the tray and glass down and rubbed his master's back...`
`Genji's facial expression did not change.`
`.........It was always like this.`
`"......*cough*...`
` Nnggg.`
` ......Thank you, my friend."`
`"........................"`
`When his seemingly deranged fit subsided, Kinzo regained his composure once again.`
`...It was like seeing two different people, a wild Kinzo and a composed Kinzo, living together inside one body.`
`"And so,`
` ......I have decided.`
` ............I cannot bear to spend my dimmed, remaining years procrastinating like this.`
` If I have one final coin to bet, then I choose to abandon it to the whims of the Demons' Roulette.`
` ......The power of magic is always determined by the risk of the gamble.`
` Like visiting a shrine at the Hour of the Ox in ancient Japanese sorcery, to nail a curse doll to a tree.`
` Magical power is produced specifically because of the risk that it will be seen within the seven days the curse takes.`
` The greater the risk, the stronger the magic power will be."`
`"Many miracles that happened in myth might be called the crystallization of shocking magic power, with a low probability of occurance and astronomical risk!`
` That Moses parted the waters of the sea was not a miracle of God--`
`the risk of that desperate situation, cornered by soldiers on the Red Sea's shores, weighed upon the scales of slaughter and gave birth to that miraculous magic power.`
` If the same thing occurred again on the same scale, the sea would surely fail to part."`
`"After all, Moses was able to magnificently summon a miracle engraved on but one of the countless, enumerable results on the roulette of those with power.`
` That is the force that can triumph over astronomical odds!!`
` Indeed, good fortune that can grasp miracles is magical power itself!!`
` To obtain this mighty power, one must face the risk of despair!!`
` Those who possess no magical power may call that desperation rather than a bet!"`
`"However, people who truly do possess magic power can grasp hold of that miracle and make the enigma come into being!!`
` And if that power exists within me...!`
` I'll seize that miracle! I'll have a chance at making the wish I devoted my life towards come true!!"`
`Kinzo looked up to the sky outside the window.`
`He spread his arms as if appealing to someone up in the skies.`
`"If only!!!`
` If only I were capable of grasping that miracle!!`
` .........Oooh, `
` ...Beatrice, `
` ...Beatrice...`
` Show me your lovely smile once more...`
` No matter how much time passes, your face does not vanish...`
` I just want to see your smile, that is all...!`
` I'll return everything you granted me!`
` I'll return all the glory I've gained since that day!`
` I don't need fortune, prestige, or gold!!`
` I'll return everything you gave me!!`
` I just want to see your smile!!`
` I beg you, Beatrice!!`
` OOOoooooOooh...oOoOOoh...ooh...!!"`
`......His nonsensical yells became a scream...and then a wail.`
`Kinzo slumped to the floor, tearing at it with both hands.`
`Genji had no choice but to wordlessly watch over his master's lamentations...`
`"Well, ladies and gentlemen,`
` ......the Family Head's health is not at its best.`
` He seemed extremely sad not to be able to share lunch with you all, now that you have gathered for this event that occurs but once a year.`
` ......Gohda, let the lunch begin."`
`"Certainly. I shall begin today's luncheon."`
`"......Doctor Nanjo, is Father's condition really that bad?`
` Couldn't he have at least let us see his face?"`
`"It's more a problem of mood than of physical condition...`
` And for that, there is no medicine I can prescribe."`
`"Hey, are we talking about his 'mood' again? You've gotta be kidding me.`
` We took time out of our schedules during this damn busy autumn season just to come and find out how he's doing.`
` And now he's-"`
`"Hmph, ...then you should be happy, Rudolf.`
` You now know how he's doing.`
` ......Or what, would you rather take my place and try to persuade our ill-humored Father to come join us?"`
`"............Are you kidding?"`
`Rudolf shrugged.`
`Apparently, though Rudolf was willing to be indignant at how self-centered his father was, he wasn't particularly disappointed to be spared a face-to-face meeting.`
`"Does it seem like his mood will improve before dinner, `
`Krauss nii-san?"`
`"I have no idea.`
` If you want to know that, you should ask him directly.`
` ...Although, I think his mood will improve faster if we don't bother him."`
`"Genji-san's the only one who can get Grandfather out of a funk.`
` It's pretty pathetic though, making the servants deal with your own parent's bad mood."`
`"Jessica.`
` Don't speak out of turn."`
`She'd planned for her complaint to be heard only by her cousins, but it had reached even Krauss's ears.`
`Scolded, Jessica scowled and turned away, sulking.`
`"...If he's as cranky as they make him sound, he can't be that terribly sick, right?`
` I mean, they're saying he's in a bad mood, not that he's got no energy, which at least proves he's got his wits about him."`
`"It's because Grandfather has especially strong willpower.`
` ...However, that doesn't necessarily mean his body will be able to keep up.`
` Since last year, they keep saying that he has three months left.`
` ...If the initial diagnosis was correct, Grandfather has been prolonging his life by willpower alone.`
` ......It's right for us to worry about him."`
`Lunch started with the Family Head's seat still empty.`
`...The man who should be sitting there had already grown old, `
`and the brilliant glory which had rebuilt the Ushiromiya family in the span of a single lifetime was being forgotten.`
`Even though they were beginning the meal with that seat still empty, no one felt it was that odd anymore...`
`The Ushiromiya family conference was held once every year, on the first weekend of October.`
`If a normal family were to hold a so-called 'family conference', `
`you'd expect it to be nothing more than a reunion of rarely seen relatives who greet each other around buckets of sushi or something.`
`However, part of the family's great fortune had been lent out to Grandfather's children,`
` and no one in this family was considered an adult until they had met with success in business, `
`so this meeting literally was a conference.`
`How much of the fortune was invested? What sort of business was conducted? How much profit was earned?`
`As a result, how much of the fortune borrowed from the main family could be repaid?`
`Or, possibly, how much more would be borrowed for future business ventures?`
`What lessons had they learned, and what could they learn from their mistakes?`
`It seems that topics like these were discussed very seriously in the past.`
`My dad said it was like lying on a bed of nails.`
`Apparently, it used to be a very serious family meeting, where people were bathed in scornful and angry voices, and some people even got slapped despite their age.`
`However, that had become a thing of the past.`
`Now, with everyone pursuing their own business ventures and achieving success, `
`it was becoming more of a normal yearly get-together.`
`Even so, telling Grandfather about recent events was extremely stressful, `
`so while it was nothing more than a simple get-together for us grandchildren, it was still a real stomachache for our parents.`
`The absence of the man who was the source of all this trouble, regardless of the reason, probably made today's lunch taste much more delicious.`
`The phrase 'While the demon is not around, everyone can relax' comes to mind.`
`Anyway, let's introduce Jessica's father, whose face I haven't seen for six years.`
`The man sitting to my father's left is his older brother and Jessica's father, `
`Uncle 蔵臼.`
`......This name sure is easy to read.`
`Krauss (蔵臼).`
`...Now that we've gotten used to this string of weird names, our perspective is totally skewed,`
` so Krauss doesn't actually seem that bad.`
` It even starts to sound kinda cool...`
`Just like with Aunt Natsuhi, I didn't have many memories of speaking with Uncle Krauss.`
`He had never been one to chat to children, and I felt like he was always talking with the adults, just like Aunt Natsuhi.`
`According to my father's gossip, he was a spiteful and violent man.`
`If what he said is true, Uncle Krauss used to be very domineering from his position as the oldest sibling...and was despised by all the other siblings.`
`...Though, despite that, those siblings all seem to be chatting happily together.`
`Oh, well. Even if their relationship was bad when they were children, sometimes when people grow up and live apart from each other, their relationships change.`
`That's probably what this was.`
`After all, they all had children of about the same age.`
`By sharing the same family environment, they probably profited by exchanging opinions.`
`Maybe because of that, a short while ago the circle of parents began to discuss the exams Jessica and I would be taking.`
`Jessica, in order to escape questions about exams from my father on her left, `
`purposefully faced right while firing off a rapid series of comments, not giving him any chance to get a word in.`
`Moving on, let's look at the end opposite from Krauss and the others.`
`In the very last seat at the table, an old gentleman with a sturdy physique sat facing Kyrie-san.`
` This was my first time meeting him.`
`I had only just been introduced to him, but it seems he's Grandfather's personal doctor, a man called Nanjo (南條).`
`I heard he used to own a huge clinic on the nearby island of Niijima, but he turned it over to his son and began living a life of leisure in his old age.`
`He had known Grandfather since the very beginning, when the mansion was first constructed on this island, and had built up a relationship over several decades.`
`I thought at first that the two of them might've gotten to know each other through Grandfather's suspicious hobbies, but it seems he was actually Grandfather's chess partner.`
`......I see. That kind of hobby seems very like our Grandfather, what with his love of all things Western.`
`Nanjo's probably the only person who could enter Rokkenjima despite being neither a family member nor a servant.`
`He looked like a calm old gentleman as he listened to the discussion between Kyrie and the other women, who sat near to him.`
`...Considering how long he stayed by the side of our short-tempered Grandfather, his generous heart was probably nothing to laugh at.`
`...Still, even if he was a family doctor, having anyone outside the Ushiromiya family attend the family conference was a little odd.`
`It made me think that Grandfather's condition might've worsened so much, it'd be a major topic of discussion at today's conference...`
`After all, George said something like that just a second ago.`
`Something about how we've been getting continuous reports since around last year that Grandfather didn't have long to live.`
`...It's nasty to think about it, but consider how rich Grandfather is.`
`At the time of his death, his wealth will suddenly be released, probably along with a fair share of our parents' stomach acid,`
` and it'll lead to ulcers for everyone.`
`After all, this sort of thing just gets messier when there's more wealth to be divided.`
`There's a good chance they'll be talking about stuff like that at the family conference.`
` ...Still, it's not like it's got anything to do with us kids.`
`......Finally, even though he hasn't shown up, let me introduce our Grandfather.`
`The person who should be sitting in that 'Incipient's Chair' is Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
`...It really sucks.`
` Everyone else in the family has these weird names, but he's got this perfectly normal one himself.`
`If only his name were written Kinzo (金蔵), but he let us call him 'Goldsmith' or something, `
`I'd totally freak out.`
`As you can probably guess by now, he's a frightening person with an extremely short temper.`
`I'm one of his grandchildren, not a son, and I haven't seen him since elementary school.`
` Thanks to that, I have no memory of being beaten myself, but our parents were apparently raised with an iron fist.`
`That earlier conversation between my dad and Uncle Krauss, about who should go convince Grandfather to come down, `
`seems pretty darn funny once you know their background.`
`You can't really tell Grandfather's story without covering that pivotal event back before the Showa era (1926-1989).`
`Until the Meiji (1868-1912) and Taishou (1912-1926) eras, the Ushiromiya family was great and prosperous.`
`They owned several spinning mills, making them rich enough to just double over laughing every day as the money kept rolling in.`
`Incidentally, Grandfather was a member of a branch family and had pretty much nothing to do with the main family.`
`Not only was he way down the list of people who could inherit the Headship, but he had hardly any contact with the glamorous main family.`
`However, during the Great Kanto Earthquake in the year Taisho 12 (1923), the mansion owned by the Ushiromiya family in Odawara was flattened.`
`The spinning mills in Tokyo were all burned down in a huge fire, `
`and the Ushiromiya family lost most of its wealth and family members in an instant.`
`So, once they started trying to figure out who the successor to the Ushiromiya family should be, they apparently found no one remaining except Kinzo in his branch family.`
`In Kinzo's later reminiscences, he referred to this as good fortune so great that it overturned fate.`
`With that, Grandfather's boring, everyday life did a 180.`
`He was entrusted with reviving the dying Ushiromiya family, which had lost nearly all of its wealth.`
`However, just because he had been entrusted with this task didn't mean he could accomplish it.`
`Apparently, those around him weren't really expecting much.`
`However, this is when Grandfather began displaying his extraordinary talent and good luck.`
`Grandfather used all of the family's remaining wealth, as well as everything from the hair on his head to his toenails, as collateral in order to borrow a massive amount of money.`
` Once he'd built up a gigantic war chest, he immediately invested in businesses.`
`It was like someone tumbling down a hill on a bike without any brakes...`
`...And then jumping onto a neighboring bike, and then another one!`
` Just like some crazy street performance.`
` I'll bet everyone thought Grandfather had no business ability whatsoever.`
`However, after several miracles and turns of good luck, with coincidences piling up and every chance taken advantage of, `
`he was suddenly in control of powerful connections with the occupying forces.`
`At that time, McArthur and the GHQ were the ultimate authority in Japan.`
`Grandfather, in a twinkle of an eye, began succeeding in business under the protection of the occupying forces, quickly becoming very rich.`
`By this point, it's probably safe to say that information, not luck, saved the day.`
`He must have made some seriously deep connections with the occupying forces.`
`......Grandfather knew beforehand about emergency demands that would be made for the Korean War.`
`No, it was more than that.`
` He must have predicted those emergency demands from the very beginning, when he started investing his money.`
`The history books make it sound like all of Japan made a large profit off of the emergency demands during the Korean War, but that isn't actually true.`
`Only a very limited number of the super rich played the money game and made an easy profit.`
`Most of the citizens remained poor.`
`...In other words, Grandfather was a member of this extremely lucky group of winners.`
`I'm pretty sure this all happened during the year Showa 25 (1950) or so.`
`The Great Kanto Earthquake happened in Taisho 13 (1924), so...`
`......That means Grandfather was able to revive the near-dead Ushiromiya family in only about 20 years to a level even higher than it had ever been before.`
`With that, you'd think he'd revive the main family in Odawara, `
`but for some reason, he went and did something as crazy as buying an entire small island in the Izu archipelago.`
`Buying an entire island is not something that you can ordinarily do today.`
`However, Grandfather was clever.`
`He contacted the GHQ and applied for the establishment of a marine resource base.`
`He acquired this island as a business property, then tossed that project aside and claimed it as his own plot of land.`
`After the war, there were prevention measures against food shortages, and having the sponsorship of the GHQ meant that nobody could oppose him.`
`From what I've heard, the Tokyo Metropolis of that day offered this land to him practically for free.`
`Later, Tokyo made difficulties by telling Kinzo to return the land, but the pushy GHQ intervened.`
`Anyway, it seems under-the-table bribes did their work well.`
`In the end, the city gave up in frustration.`
`Grandfather, with considerable skill and good luck, managed to weather the stormy seas of that period, `
`obtaining a vast fortune and his own island.`
`Of course, it probably wasn't all luck.`
`He was obsessed with all things Western, which helped him cultivate his English skills.`
`He was able to use this to his advantage and sink his teeth into the GHQ.`
`A mansion was built on the island soon after.`
` This mansion, in fact.`
`Grandfather, with his love of the Western style, made this once uninhabited island a canvas upon which he could realize his dreams to his heart's content.`
`...He now had the Western mansion of his dreams, overflowing with emotion and atmosphere, and a beautiful garden featuring all sorts of roses.`
`And, he had a private beach where nobody other than himself would ever be permitted to leave a footprint.`
`......This would be a dream come true for any boy.`
`After that, he made good use of his huge fortune, `
`becoming a large stockholder in the extremely stable iron and steel industry, and was able to live an easy and comfortable life just using the dividends.`
`Well, he's just that incredible.`
`This kind of person usually has the ability to foresee and predict the future, or at least that is how they're portrayed after the fact.`
` But Grandfather denies all of that, repeatedly saying that he was simply blessed with extraordinary luck...`
`......Anyway, even a lord like that can't help but grow increasingly eccentric when locked up alone on an island, where all his dreams are made real.`
`Everyone knows that he's had a Western obsession from the start, `
`but none of our parents really know when his bizarre black magic hobby began.`
`Did his love of black magic begin way back when he became fascinated with everything Western, `
`or did his miraculous stretch of good luck while reviving his family cause him to feel a mysterious power in himself?`
`At some point, Grandfather began to make the research of black magic his life's work.`
` He filled his study up with suspicious books, chemicals, and magical items as he became increasingly bizarre.`
`From what I've heard, those around him warmly (?) watched over him, figuring that someone who had achieved success in life had a right to do as he pleased, but...`
`...There's no way that's true.`
`They were probably just creeped out, thinking 'That's disgusting, I don't want to get involved.'`
`Anyway, ...that agitated period was an age of big gambles, with both opportunities and risks.`
`Let's say Grandfather was born in this time period.`
`He would've had no opportunities and would probably have advanced like a chess piece from mandatory education to college at a leisurely pace, `
`never becoming more than an average salaryman.`
`If that happened, he'd probably have sat somewhere, happily talking behind his boss's back.`
`No, no. Not in a fancy dining hall like this. More like at a table in some bar.`
`Then again, I'll bet this family conference would be a whole lot more relaxing if that were the case.`
`Okay, that's enough about the old geezer.`
`More importantly, let's talk about this incredible lunch!!`
`"I'm already convinced by that sashimi salad appetizer!`
` Gohda-san's an excellent chef!`
` Plus, these fish were caught in the adjacent seas, weren't they?!`
` They're totally different from the sashimi you get at the supermarket!"`
`"Hey, quit it, Battler.`
` Your upbringing will be exposed."`
`Everyone let out a big laugh.`
`Damn it, you say that even though you love those cheap pubs.`
`"Hahahaha.`
` I've eaten at many unusual places because of work, but this stands right up there with the best of them.`
` I'd be willing to bet Gohda-san used to be pretty well known in those circles."`
`"Well, I don't know the details,`
` but stuff got complicated at the long-standing hotel he used to work at, what with them opening a new establishment with the same name and breaking into factions or whatever it was.`
` In the middle of all that, he was apparently forced to retire.`
` At that time, Mom just happened to be sending out job offers for a servant."`
`As Gohda removed the empty plates, he began to recount his own bumpy past without losing his smile.`
`"The world is a difficult place.`
` However, thanks to the Madam, I was given a chance to display my skills as a chef once again, this time for the Ushiromiya family.`
` Although I enjoy experiencing the smiles of a larger number of people, `
`I also find it quite entertaining to perform more delicate work that can please the limited number of those who have employed me.`
` All this is thanks to the opportunity given to me by the Madam."`
`Gohda-san respectfully bowed his head towards Aunt Natsuhi.`
`"That's because you were the most talented of the applicants.`
` The decision was purely objective, not based on personal feelings, so there is no need to thank me."`
`...Dang, why does Aunt Natsuhi always have to sound so indifferent?`
`If only she spoke with a bit more kindness, she might leave a different impression.`
`Shannon-chan and Kumasawa-san entered from the hallway with a serving cart.`
`"...Please excuse us."`
`"Now then, let us move on to today's dessert."`
`Gohda-san and the others laid the beautifully adorned dessert out in front of us all.`
`I guess it's true when they say you have another stomach for dessert...`
`I'd thought I'd already filled up on delicious food, `
`but as soon as I laid eyes on that dessert, my stomach started yelling 'More!'`
`I don't know much about desserts, but this looked really good.`
`A white pudding-like substance was garnished with two shades of red sauce, `
`and elegant rose petals adorned the dish.`
`Normally, during a high-class meal like this, you're supposed to wait for the chef to extol the virtues of this particular meal before eating.`
`However, Maria was completely indifferent to strict rules like that, so she got excited by this beautiful and delicious-looking dessert, jumping into the fray as soon as it was placed before her.`
`Aunt Rosa scolded her, calling it bad manners, but George responded by saying 'Now, now, it's okay.'`
`"Uu-?!`
` This part's sour!`
` This part's sour!`
` Battler, this one's no good!`
` Uu-!"`
`Maria exclaimed as she sampled the two colored sauces.`
`"What, some are good and some bad? Okay, I'll give it a go!`
` Mmmmm?!"`
`Apparently, one sauce was sweet and the other sour.`
`Despite it being bad manners, I also stuck my little finger in and licked it.`
`Whoa, one of the sauces was sour enough to make you pucker up.`
`If it were yellow, I'd have suspected lemon, but I couldn't guess what kind of sourness would be red.`
`I decided to ask Shannon, who was putting away the serving cart behind us.`
`"Shannon-chan, what kind of sauce is this sour stuff?"`
`'!s1`
`............uhh, `
`......aaah..."`
`'!sd`
`Maybe her job was just to set the table, so she doesn't really know.`
`Still, even considering that, she seems pretty stressed.`
` ......Maybe I shouldn't have asked.`
`Or did they use some ingredient that we'd be better off not knowing about?`
`While Aunt Natsuhi made a gesture that seemed to indicate an oncoming headache, Kumasawa-san, who was setting the table at the opposite seat, began to chuckle.`
`"What do you think we made it out of?`
` Hohohoh, it'll shock you..."`
`"Huh? I-I don't have a clue.`
` Wait a sec, Kumasawa baa-san, that laugh's pretty creepy.`
` So, what is it?!"`
`"...Don't tell anyone, okay?`
` Listen very carefully."`
`Kumasawa-san leaned across from the other side of the table.`
`I leaned forward myself when she asked.`
`Their interest caught, Jessica, George-aniki, and, of course, Maria also put their ears closer.`
`"Uu-.`
` What?`
` Whaaat?`
` Quickly!`
` Quickly!"`
`"You see, the sour part is made from...`
`juice squeezed from a mackerel, hohohoh!"`
`'!s0`
`'That's crazy,' we all thought, horrified.`
`Only Maria accepted it, nodding sagely.`
`"Uu-?`
` Mackerels are sour.`
` This is what comes out when you squeeze them!"`
`'!s0`
`When Maria started clamoring that mackerel were sour, the adults were unable to contain their laughter.`
`Only Aunt Rosa, her face red, whispered to Maria that mackerel is sour only once prepared as shimesaba.`
`Aaahh, now I totally remember.`
` Kumasawa-san was always like this, wasn't she?`
`I think I remember her tricking me too in all sorts of ways when I was young!`
`The most lethal has gotta be that one!`
` Those flimsy black things in Chinese dishes!`
` They're kikurage mushrooms!`
` She told me they were penguin meat and I went all around school like a smartass telling everyone, didn't I?!`
`"Kumasawa baa-chan, you sure haven't changed...!`
` You know Maria's gonna believe it now, right?"`
`"Hohohoh, it's just a joke.`
` Now Gohda-san's going to tell us what the sauce really is, won't he?"`
`Gohda looked a little put off about his masterpiece being laughed at for such a bizarre reason, `
`but after clearing his throat once, he introduced the dessert to us.`
`"Well then, allow me to introduce our dessert.`
` After seeing how much you all enjoyed the rose garden earlier today, I finished this panna cotta in a rose garden style.`
` The rose petals scattered across were selected just now from that very rose garden.`
` The sauce is a combination of two reds, strawberry and rose hips.`
` Please enjoy this mixture of the strawberry's sweetness and the rose hip's sourness.`
` Furthermore, the rose petals are merely decorative, so please avoid them while you eat.`
` With that said, please, enjoy."`
`......Whoa...... Man, I almost want to applaud before eating.`
`Just like with medicine, reading the detailed description first seems to make it work a whole lot better.`
`As Gohda-san elaborated on the details of this dessert, it started to feel even more appetizing.`
`Seriously, should you call him subtle or just talented?`
` The dessert was probably planned from the beginning, but taking the hint when we all stopped in front of the rose garden earlier today, `
`he displayed an incredible and timely awareness by just adding a few rose petals from that garden.`
`This combination of sweet and sour was also exquisite.`
`If it was just sweet, you'd just get used to it and bored halfway through.`
`But if you reached the sour sauce at that point, you'd get a really vivid taste.`
` And then, once you returned to the sweet sauce, all of the sourness in your mouth would be replaced with an enjoyable sweetness.`
`I'm sure everyone else felt the same way.`
`Every time Gohda-san passed by one of our seats, someone praised the taste and his presentation.`
`"How is it, Madam?"`
`"Splendid, as always.`
` It is worthy of entertaining our guests."`
`"I am most grateful for your words.`
` ......Madam, did you know?`
` I have heard that rose hip has the ability to cure headaches.`
` I thought that you in particular would appreciate it, so I had it specially prepared."`
`"...Is that so?`
` Thank you."`
`"See, didn't I tell you, Natsuhi nee-san?`
` Rose hip is great for headaches."`
`"So it seems.`
` ...I do hope it actually helps."`
`"Haa-!`
` Gohda-san, I love ya!`
` Hey, later on, why don't you tell me how they're treatin' ya?!`
` Or if ya can't, just let me know what sort of salary you'd like!`
` Havin' your talent confined to this small island is sacrilege to humanity's cookin' culture!`
` What d'ya think about working your craft for my company and delightin' all our customers?!"`
`"Hahaha, Hideyoshi-san, `
`are you trying to steal away our Gohda?`
` Now that won't do at all.`
` We'd better start treating Gohda better, or he'll get snatched up."`
`"*giggle* Yes, you really should.`
` If you don't, someone's gonna grab him, and you'll be stuck with three meals of Kumasawa-style mackerel cooking a day, won't you?"`
`"Hohohoh, that's harsh.`
` It seems someone's holding a grudge against me."`
`"""Wahahahahaha!!!"""`
`Everyone let out a huge laugh.`
`According to Jessica, Kumasawa-san's mackerel jokes were a running gag that our parents had long since gotten used to.`
`Kumasawa-san often claimed that mackerels had precious nutritional value, which could slow aging, make people smarter and more.`
`...Supposedly, while it couldn't stop the outward signs of aging, it helped prevent aging on the inside.`
`Since she was still spirited enough to tell these kinds of jokes at her age, there must be something to that theory.`
`"Hohohoh...`
` In that case, if you'll excuse me...`
` Prepare yourself for tonight's dinner!`
` I'll be cooking plenty of mackerel dishes for you all, so you'd better look forward to it!"`
`"Wahahaha, we sure will.`
` Can't wait to get all puckered up from tonight's shimesaba!"`
`"That sounds wonderful.`
` I wonder if they'll be serving any good Japanese sake."`
`"Oh, we certainly will.`
` Haven't you heard of Rokkenjima's famous mackerel shochu...?"`
`"""Wahahahahahaha!!!"""`
`Kumasawa-san, together with Shannon-chan, bowed and pushed the serving cart away.`
`It was pretty funny to watch Gohda-san, who looked like his show had totally been stolen, explain in a serious voice that we would be having calf steak for dinner.`
`"...Umm, `
`......Kumasawa-san, ...thanks for doing that back there..."`
`As she pushed the serving cart, Shannon bowed her head very deeply.`
`"Hohohoh, I haven't done anything that requires thanks."`
`Kumasawa may have played dumb, but she had obviously understood and saved Shannon in the nick of time.`
`Back when Battler had asked about dessert, Shannon had unfortunately hesitated.`
`There may have been several ways to dodge the question, but all of them would have required some quick wits.`
`Shannon, who hesitated when hard-pressed for a response, was always suffering because of this small weakness.`
`If only Shannon had a little of the craftiness needed to cleverly shake off a mistake, like Gohda, her life would've been a bit easier.`
`The fact that she could perform other tasks flawlessly made this weakness even more unfortunate.`
`However, there were some who understood Shannon's honest nature, her inability to gloss over a mistake and draw attention away from it.`
`...That was why Kumasawa had smoothly come to her rescue.`
`"I just heard from Genji-san that there will be a change in the afternoon shifts.`
` I believe you were given a break until this evening.`
` Hohohoh, I'm jealous."`
`"Huh? ...Oh, sorry, I haven't checked the shift chart yet."`
`"Ah, yes.`
` I was thinking I might start cooking some mackerel in the oven.`
` If you don't mind, I would be happy if you would help out a bit before your break."`
`"Ah, yes...!`
` I would be delighted to help."`
`To Shannon, Kumasawa was like a mother among the servants.`
`The dining hall needed to be cleaned up, so we were chased out.`
`Instead, tea was being served in the parlor.`
`Apparently, they'd prepared the black tea that Aunt Rosa had bought for Aunt Natsuhi.`
`Maria said she also wanted to have some black tea, but my old bastard said she couldn't and told us children to go play outside.`
`"Battler-kun, why don't we all go for a walk outside?"`
`"Go ahead and take a look at the roses or somethin'.`
` But keep a close eye on the weather.`
` The sky's still clear, but the weather report kept on talkin' about rain."`
`"Uu-!`
` I wanna go to the beach, the beach!!"`
`"Oh, that sounds wonderful.`
` Playing on a sandy beach isn't something you get to do often, is it?"`
`"Ah, good point.`
` Okay, let's all go to the beach then!"`
`"Uu-! Let's go, let's go!"`
`"Maria, be careful not to get your clothes wet.`
` Or your shoes."`
`"Uu-!`
` Won't get wet!"`
`"*giggle* That obedience is so cuuute.`
` Battler-kun, make sure you keep an eye out for Maria-chan, okay?"`
`"Sure, leave it to me!"`
`"Hey, you're pretty obedient and cute yourself, listening to Kyrie like that.`
` ...Why don't you also listen to me obediently for a change?"`
`"Hah!`
` Hell no!`
` Let's go everyone, c'mon!"`
`The children flew out of the parlor.`
`They were replaced by Genji, who pushed a serving cart in and prepared to serve the tea.`
`The parlor was filled with a sublime aroma which delighted everyone while they waited to sate their thirst...`
`"Hahahahah, ha...`
` Rudolf's family certainly seems close.`
` It's a wonderful thing."`
`"Quit it. We're no match for your family, Aniki."`
`"That's true.`
` You've raised Jessica-chan to be so adorable.`
` I imagine that's yet another fruit of your talents at education and training, Natsuhi nee-san."`
`"......Thank you."`
`Natsuhi answered coldly.`
`...The conversation broke off then, and the parlor fell silent.`
`Maybe Hideyoshi couldn't bear the silence, because he broke it himself with an exaggerated gesture.`
`"Still, they sure do grow fast.`
` ...I thought they'd be kids forever, but they start gettin' huge all of a sudden, and then they're adults like us.`
` Battler-kun looks like a completely different person now!"`
`"His body has grown much bigger, but he's still just a kid.`
` Though you could say the same about my husband."`
`"...I wonder where the border between child and adult is.`
` I still don't feel as though I've grown up."`
`"Hmph, isn't that pitiful.`
` That's not something the mother of a child should say."`
`"That's right.`
` We're not children anymore.`
` We're all adults now.`
` So I wish we could talk together on an intellectual level, rather than an emotional one."`
`When Eva smiled with sharp sarcasm, everyone seemed to get more tense.`
`...It felt as though that pleasant tea aroma had been tossed out the window.`
`"Since long ago, we've always endeavored to engage in intellectual conversations.`
` ......It seems your sarcasm occasionally misses its mark.`
` Just as it always has."`
`"...Oh, what is it you've 'always endeavored' to do?`
` My, my.`
` I wish I could wrap those words up and send them to this room a few decades ago.`
` Right, Rosa?"`
`"..............."`
`Rosa gave a vague smile.`
`She knew that, whether she agreed or disagreed, she'd earn the displeasure of one of her siblings.`
`It was a bit of worldly wisdom that had been essential for someone growing up as the youngest sibling.`
`"Quit it, Aneki.`
` We'd better get started on our main topic while the brats aren't around.`
` Let us make that our intellectual discussion."`
`As Rudolf glanced over the faces of all present, some let out a slight sigh and some let a small look of resignation cross their face.`
`......They were approaching their unavoidable...`
`true agenda.`
`"Last year, his life expectancy was estimated at about three months.`
` Which I guess means he's got negative 9 months left now.`
` Should we take that to mean it might suddenly happen at any time?"`
`"...The Family Head is still alive and well.`
` The fact that you'd bring up such an inappropriate topic under the light of day...makes me doubt your sanity, Rudolf-san."`
`"Still, Natsuhi-san,`
` this is the sort of thing you can't put off until after somethin' happens.`
` He's still healthy now, which makes this the perfect time to talk about this, while we've still got time to plan.`
` It's just a bit of financial etiquette, you might say."`
`"It seems Father is the focus of everyone's concern.`
` ...Doctor Nanjo,`
` could we hear the details from you?`
` That appears to be what everyone else is waiting for, after all."`
`".....................*cough*."`
`Nanjo, who had been standing by the window and staring out at the rose garden, let out a single cough when he realized that he was being called.`
`"...Doctor Nanjo, `
`...how is Father's condition?"`
`"Well, to begin,`
` ...allow me to start with a revision, since my estimate last year that he had only three months left was not borne out."`
`"No need to explain.`
` You're saying that measuring remaining life is only a prediction, not a promise, right?"`
`"...That is correct.`
` Because of that, while I will accept everyone's repeated questions, I can by no means confirm when he will pass away.`
` A human's life is supported by their body and their mind.`
` ...If the body is weak, the situation becomes more dangerous, but if the mind is strong enough to compensate for that weakness, the effects of one's condition can sometimes remain in a subdued state."`
`"So you're saying that even if his body is weak, his mind is still firm and spirited."`
`".........Kyrie, sorry, but please stay quiet for a bit."`
`"......I'm sorry."`
`"That is correct.`
` Kinzo-san's body is being overwhelmed by the demon of ill health.`
` This will hold especially true as long as he continues to partake of such strong alcohol..."`
`"So, he's in a crisis now because he drinks.`
` And maybe he's lived this long because he drinks.`
` There's Dad for you, the heavy drinker."`
`"Well then, Doctor, I know you can't give anything more than a prediction, `
`...but what do you think about Father's chances of living until this day next year...?"`
`"That's quite a rude question to ask about the Family Head."`
`Natsuhi jumped on Eva, not even bothering to hide her astonished expression.`
`Eva stared back daringly, but Hideyoshi realized what was going on and tried to smooth things over with a forced smile.`
`"Ah, Natsuhi-san, forgive her!`
` Eva, choose your words a bit more carefully, okay?"`
`"I'm sorry.`
` I was just so concerned about Father's condition.`
` *giggle*."`
`"...Is that so?`
` I hadn't realized."`
`"Doctor Nanjo, please tell us.`
` For the sake of the beautiful love of a daughter worried about her father's lifespan."`
`Krauss laughed sarcastically, and Eva, smiling sweetly, returned an identical chuckle.`
`"...You ask whether he will still be healthy next year,`
` ......but as a doctor, it is very hard to say.`
` Because while I do think this lull in his condition will continue for a while,`
` if he suffers some kind of fit, there may be nothing we can do.`
` ......After all, Rokkenjima is a solitary island.`
` It is not as though an ambulance could quickly jump in to save him.`
` Normally, I would want to have him placed in a large hospital on the mainland, but..."`
`"Father stated that he does not want his noble research interrupted.`
` ......It seems he holds a grudge over the way we tried to force him out last year.`
` Apparently, he strongly suspects that he'll be shut away in some hospital if he goes outside.`
` And that's how things are now."`
`"Has Doctor Nanjo been examining him?"`
`"Father trusts Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...It seems he can be examined when in one of his better moods..."`
`"I can examine his condition, but if I try to recommend medicine or hospitalization, he refuses to listen.`
` ......I've really only been able to look."`
`"It's true some people hate doctors...`
` Still, what a hassle!"`
`Nanjo sighed deeply.`
`The purpose of an examination is to determine what medical treatment would be appropriate.`
`Receiving an examination and then not following the advice given makes the whole thing pointless...`
`"So, to sum it up,`
` he's still expected to live three months.`
` There's no way to guess how long he'll continue to live while still on the verge of death."`
`"......Rudolf-san,`
` couldn't you be a little more discreet with your words?"`
`"Ah, sorry.`
` I've always talked this way.`
` Give me a break."`
`"I understand how Doctor Nanjo sees it.`
` ...What about you, Krauss nii-san?"`
`"......Hmph.`
` To be perfectly honest, I have to disagree with Doctor Nanjo.`
` I find it truly difficult to think of Father as a person so sick that he has only three months to live.`
` His yell is as healthy as ever, and I still get chills at the thought of his fists raining down on me.`
` ......Pushing the care of your father solely on the shoulders of the eldest sibling is far from fair."`
`"Hahhaha.`
` In the next world, get born after me.`
` .........Okay, let's get back on track.`
` So, in the opinion of our impartial and neutral doctor, it wouldn't be odd for him to go any time.`
` No offense to you, Aniki, but I'd rather trust the opinion of an expert in his field.`
` Which means it's definitely not too early to start talking about Dad's assets."`
`"Father's personal funds probably reach as high as several ten billion yen, right?`
` But it's not as though that's all neatly gathered as ready cash.`
` It's not as simple as simply cutting a birthday cake with a knife."`
`"...That's an interesting way to put it.`
` That's right, you sometimes get strawberries or chocolates on top of the cake, making it hard to cleanly cut it into equal parts.`
` Given that, don't you think it's important to discuss beforehand how best to stick the knife in...?"`
`"I cannot understand how you all can openly discuss this as though the Family Head is dead, even though he's still alive."`
`"Come now, don't you see how important this is?`
` After all, when the time comes, the inheritance of his fortune must be carried out immediately, right?`
` Moreover, the glorious Ushiromiya house's wealth is vast.`
` Don't you understand that careful discussion is necessary beforehand?`
` There's a huge difference between this family's resources and your family's wealth."`
`"......How rude!`
` My birth family has nothing to do with this."`
`Natsuhi responded indignantly, though in a low voice, and the already dark atmosphere grew even more hostile...`
`"Give it a rest, Eva...`
` Natsuhi-san, forgive us!`
` Pardon her rudeness."`
`Hideyoshi tried to smooth things over by glancing at both with a forced smile, but it only resulted in making the hostility between Eva and Natsuhi even more intense...`
`"............It seems I'll just get in the way if I stay any longer.`
` Please excuse me."`
`Nanjo rose from his seat and exited the parlor.`
`...To an outsider, it may have seemed like a normal act of courtesy, but his back was watched by several glances envious of his ability to escape.`
`After the doctor had exited and his footsteps had disappeared into the distance, Krauss recrossed his legs.`
`"In other words, this is what you all would like to say...`
` Father's remaining life is short.`
` You want to quickly enter into a practical conference concerning the distribution of the inheritance.`
` ......Why are you so eager, I wonder?`
` Certainly, as you say, estimating and distributing the Ushiromiya family's wealth is no simple task.`
` In that case, shouldn't we make careful and deliberate calculations?`
` It seems to me that you are all impatient to split up the cake tonight.`
` Isn't that true, Rosa?`
` What reason is there to be hasty?"`
`".........We aren't being hasty.`
` ...However, we need to have an agreement between the siblings.`
` It doesn't matter when we do that, `
`but if the day Father's condition worsens is approaching, `
`discussing the matter beforehand hardly seems hasty to me..."`
`Rosa shot a glance at Eva and Rudolf.`
`...As the youngest sibling in the family, it was hard for her to be cross-examined by the eldest.`
`"......Oh?`
` Is that your true opinion?`
` I didn't expect that the most honest and pure-hearted of the siblings would say something like that.`
` I wonder if those two told you to say it..."`
`"........................"`
`"Quit it, Aniki.`
` Rosa's one of Dad's kids too.`
` She's got as much right to his inheritance as the rest of us.`
` It's only natural that she'd be interested.`
` ...After all, Dad'll definitely die, and that's not something that'll happen in the distant future.`
` ......On the contrary, Aniki, you're way too relaxed.`
` It almost seems like you'd like nothing better than to turn the discussion away from the inheritance issue."`
`".........What do you mean by that?`
` Are you trying to accuse my husband of something?"`
`"C-Calm down, Natsuhi-san.`
` Listen to what we have to say..."`
`"Nii-san, I hear the times have been extremely good lately.`
` Yes, since last year, we've been in an unprecedented boom, and the yen keeps on rising.`
` It seems that it's no longer a dream that the dollar will reach 100 yen.`
` Also, the ruling party says that it'll establish health resort maintenance law by next year.`
` At this moment, resort development companies across Japan are running about, trying to gather as much funding as they can."`
`"...You certainly seem to know a lot about it.`
` Japan is about to experience an unprecedented boom.`
` It'll be a repeat of the Korean War Demands, the time during which Father revived the Ushiromiya family.`
` ...The people of Japan have been working like mad, achieving vast economic growth and becoming the most well-off people in the world, reaching the height of our prosperity.`
` We've reached an era where private spending is vast, which means easy money for institutions that can capitalize on that fact."`
`"The three kinds of electrical appliances no longer represent the people's needs.`
` The people need ski resorts, golf courses, public pools.`
` Resort hotels and theme parks!"`
`"Have you gone to Delsney Land, which opened just a few years ago?`
` What an excellent theme park!`
` It's a place where even an adult can be a kid and have fun with his family.`
` No longer do we count our sole virtue to be selfless devotion while failing to care for our families.`
` We have become the most prosperous people in the world, and now we can finally enjoy the benefits."`
`"Krauss-san, your foresight's nothing to sneeze at.`
` ...When I heard that sort of thing several years ago, I thought it was crazy.`
` ...But when I heard about the G5 nations' Plaza Accord, that all changed.`
` The yen shot up, and I'll bet the price of land skyrockets soon too.`
` It won't be long before Japan becomes the economic center of the world.`
` ......You've got a great sense of the direction the world's movin', Krauss-san.`
` At least there can be no debate about that."`
`"I feel the same as Hideyoshi-san.`
` Aniki, you can read into the next decade of history.`
` I'll bet you got that keen sense from Dad, `
`and it's incredible.`
` ......However, unlike Dad, the timing of your predictions has been a bit off sometimes, right?"`
`"Nii-san, you've been starting resort projects everywhere, convinced that Japan will soon see a boom, but almost all of them continue to fail.`
` ...While I'm sure that the era you predicted will soon arrive, it seems you misread the timing of that boom."`
`"...You were too early.`
` You then panicked and tried to sell everything off, which only opened the wound even further.`
` ...If your nose was really so reliable, then there should be no reason for you to sell off your property.`
` Is this proof that you mistrust your own ability?"`
`"......How rude!`
` Are you trying to insult my husband?"`
`Natsuhi's forehead creased as she rose from the sofa.`
`Eva, paying this no heed, stared at Krauss with a confident smile.`
`...Krauss, who also maintained his confident appearance, told Natsuhi to sit down.`
`"Please stop, Natsuhi.`
` Eva's always been incapable of talking any other way.`
` ...Calm down a little, `
`or your headache will get worse."`
`"There's proof of your lack of talent right next to us.`
` ......After all, Nii-san, weren't you all excited about turning this island into a resort?`
` You built a wonderful resort hotel and beautifully maintained the garden...`
` I'm just an amateur and don't pretend to understand, but you must have used a significant amount of money for that, right?"`
`"And what is that to you?!`
` My husband's business is none of yours!"`
`"Actually, that's not true, Natsuhi-san.`
` Rokkenjima doesn't belong to Aniki.`
` It belongs to Dad.`
` Of course, the hotel does belong to Aniki, right?`
` In fact, we'd be more than willing to pay lodging fees for tonight.`
` What do you think, Rosa?"`
`"......Well, hmm.`
` ...If what I have on hand will suffice."`
`"If I can make it into a resort, this island's financial worth will rise.`
` It is true that expenses have piled up, but we can expect a large harvest in the future.`
` When that happens, all of you stand to profit as well, do you not?"`
`"I understand that.`
` If the value of this island rises, that'll increase our portions when we distribute the inheritance.`
` Of course, I won't ask you to divide the island and the mansion into four equal parts.`
` We can just resolve the matter with money equal to the value of the property."`
`"If you understand that much, what about my business makes you so dissatisfied?"`
`"We aren't dissatisfied, we're uneasy.`
` In the first place, Aniki, `
`when do you plan to open that hotel?`
` Left this way, you won't get anything out of it except our grubby hand prints, right?"`
`"That's right.`
` It's an important tool for your business, isn't it?`
` Surely you can't keep it locked up until the moment you open it.`
` Buildings go bad if you don't use them and air them out every once in a while.`
` Even so, it's a bit extravagant for a guesthouse that we only use once a year.`
` Right, Rosa?"`
`".........That's right.`
` Considering how wonderful it is, I'm sure it will become quite popular once you open it."`
`"Oh, `
`......so the hotel you keep talking about is the guesthouse..."`
`"It's splendid.`
` Just as Rosa said, if you were to open it, I'm sure it would become popular."`
`The lodging they had been guided to wasn't originally intended to serve as a guesthouse.`
`...It was originally constructed as a resort hotel.`
`However, even though it was built two years previously, there was still absolutely no prospect of it opening.`
`"Nii-san, it's just like all of your enterprises.`
` Your attention and planning are both fabulous.`
` Then, it always becomes unmaintainable partway through...and ends before you have a chance to earn any profit."`
`"You were brilliant when you saw that using this island only as a place to live was a waste.`
` I think it was a pretty good plan to turn it into a resort that could use the prospect of marine sports, fishing, honeymoons and the like to attract customers.`
` If I were the oldest son, I'm sure I'd have strained my brain looking for a way to make a profit off this island."`
`"But two full years have passed since you finished building, right?`
` After two years, you still haven't had the opportunity to open it.`
` Where's the managing company you entrusted it to?"`
`"......Impertinence!`
` That is not my husband's fault!`
` There has just been some trouble with the company that my husband contracted with. No matter how you look at it, we are victims here!"`
`"And yet,`
` the rumors we've heard about this company you hired...`
`...haven't been good at all."`
`"Let's be clear about this, dear.`
` ...Did you really think we wouldn't hear about how lack of payment, embezzlement, and other issues led to the project disintegrating mid-flight?`
` We even have evidence."`
`"I don't know what kind of evidence you think you found, but it's all baseless!`
` As new members in the tourism industry, it is necessary for us to lay the groundwork with various people.`
` It is also important to investigate the trustworthiness of our partners.`
` It's merely taken us some time to meet that goal!"`
`"......I'll admit that, in my rashness, the hotel was completed too early.`
` However, it's not as though we're paying maintenance costs.`
` It's a foundation that will eventually become immensely significant."`
`"Liar.`
` I'll bet you want to liquidate it but can't.`
` After all, there's no reason for anyone to buy such an extravagant hotel on an isolated, empty island without any established sightseeing routes.`
` And anyway, what about all the loans you made for this project?"`
`"Even if you aren't incurring maintenance costs, the borrowed money that you can't return just keeps growing.`
` ...Sorry, Krauss nii-san,`
` but I've investigated the development plan for this island a bit.`
` ...To be honest, I haven't heard anything good either."`
`"Hideyoshi-san,`
` I can see how you might be left with that impression by looking only at the current financial situation.`
` However, this is a forward-looking investment.`
` I have no choice but to admit that my prediction was mistaken, and that up until now, several liabilities have been created."`
`"However, the times have finally caught up with me.`
` I will soon regain everything that I have lost up to this point.`
` No, actually, all of the investments I have made until now will finally return to my possession.`
` That's right, just like throwing away a small fry which then becomes a salmon, they will come back even bigger than before."`
`"I'll accept that.`
` The resort business will probably see an unprecedented boom before long, `
`though I don't know if it'll be enough to cover all your debt..."`
`".........However, Krauss nii-san,`
` after all your failures in the past, who exactly do you expect to provide you with funding?`
` And this isn't some small amount we're talkin's about.`
` You'll need enough funding to fill the massive hole you've dug."`
`"......What are you trying to say, Hideyoshi-san?"`
`"Ahh, Natsuhi-san, please don't get angry!`
` We looked into this, too.`
` We checked to see who might've provided Krauss nii-san with enough financing to support his recent large-scale projects, despite his string of failures."`
`"...And we discovered...`
`that no such backer exists.`
` The iron rule of the money roulette is that you bet against the loser.`
` Aniki, you're a fairly well-known loser in this field.`
` It's true that prosperous times are about to come, but when we looked for people who considered that enough to overlook your string of failures...`
`and also had enough for the investment, `
`we found no candidates."`
`"So, `
`the big question now...`
`is where you got that money from."`
`".........Hoh.`
` Now isn't this intriguing.`
` And?"`
`"D-Dear!`
` How long do you plan to let these ridiculous remarks stand?!!"`
`"Sit down, Natsuhi-san.`
` Let's cut to the point.`
` Aniki, you've been diverting Dad's private funds for your own businesses.`
` There's pretty much no room for doubt.`
` If you think we've made some kind of mistake, please, feel free to explain."`
`"Rudolf, don't call it diverting funds.`
` This is embezzlement, plain and simple.`
` A huge crime that can be criminally prosecuted."`
`"Th-This sort of rudeness cannot be tolerated!!`
` How can you face the Successor to the Ushiromiya Head Family and level these absurd accusations?!!"`
`"They aren't absurd, they're right on the mark.`
` I'm sure he'd like to somehow make his business succeed and recover his losses, but his debt keeps getting bigger!`
` He's just trying to cover up the failure of one gamble by making an even bigger one.`
` It's only natural that he'd try to grab any source of funding close at hand!`
` Let me be frank. Nii-san, what you're doing is embezzlement.`
` You're betraying Father.`
` You know that we'll have the courts settle this after it's all over, right?`
` Do you think that kind of person has any right to call themselves the Successor to the Ushiromiya Head Family?"`
`"O-Of all the... Y-You dare to claim that he has betrayed the Family Head?!!`
` You no longer have the right to straddle the threshold of the glorious Ushiromiya family!!`
` Leave this place at once!!`
` Now!!`
` Get out!!"`
`Natsuhi, who had already reached the limits of her anger, shouted at Eva in a rage.`
`She then pointed alternately at Eva and the hallway, demanding that she leave.`
`Eva took out a folding fan and fanned herself with it, glaring maliciously at Natsuhi as though silently daring her to repeat what she'd said.`
`However, her mouth was still smiling, curved in the shape of a crescent moon.`
`...In that unpleasant silence, Rosa gulped.`
`"Hey, ...Natsuhi nee-san?`
` To whom do you think you are speaking in such a tone?"`
`"I'm speaking to the exceedingly rude sister of my husband!!`
` As the person in charge of the main family's kitchen, I cannot overlook any more of this!!"`
`"In charge of the kitchen?`
`'!s1`
`hahahaha, `
`ahhahahahaha!!`
` Be silent, `
`lowly maidservant!"`
`Eva folded the fan with a snap and rose to her feet energetically.`
`Compared to the elegance and playfulness she'd shown until a second ago, she was now unimaginably aggressive.`
`"How foolish. You stand down!!`
` Before Eva of the Ushiromiya family!"`
`"You tell me to stand down? Me, Ushiromiya Eva, the third ranked in the Ushiromiya family hierarchy and the one allowed to sit at the left shoulder of the Head?!!`
` Know your place!!`
` And then look at your shabby self in a mirror!!`
` Where is the symbol of the wing on your clothes?`
` Where are you permitted to wear the One-Winged Eagle?`
` Aren't you nothing more than a borrowed womb to house the next Successor to the Ushiromiya family?!!`
` Understand your place, you common housemaid!!"`
`Eva's face twisted hideously as her words gouged into Natsuhi's heart like talons, wrenching at it.`
`"........................!!!"`
`There were a hundred ways Natsuhi wanted to respond.`
`However, her anger and sorrow crushed her throat...and none of those words managed to make it to her mouth.`
`...Her anger had nowhere to go...and became a single hot tear that slowly dripped down...`
`"What's wrong?`
` If you have something to say, please do so.`
` Come on."`
`Eva faced her with a provocative gaze.`
`......However, Natsuhi could do nothing but tremble, her clenched fists quivering...`
`Krauss quietly broke that powder-keg tension.`
`"Natsuhi,`
` leave your seat.`
` You should go cool your head."`
`"Wha...!!"`
`Natsuhi, resenting the fact that her husband had not come to her aid, shifted the focus of her attack.`
`"D-Dear, don't you understand what they're saying about you?!`
` These people are baselessly calling you a traitor to Father!!`
` They are making light of the fact that we protect the glory of the Ushiromiya family, even though we are constantly expending every effort to earn that glory from Father.`
` They trample all of that underfoot with their hateful rambling!!!`
` And you don't even try to fight back! Why?!`
` I'm only standing up for us because you won't, but you've been putting the entire burden on me for some time now!!`
` And now you tell me to go cool my head?!`
` It's always me!!"`
`"Even though I have always considered this family's affairs so seriously, you've...!!`
` Aaaaaaaahhh, gaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!"`
`Natsuhi was already unable to hide her tears.`
`She flew from the room in that state.`
`After that, all that remained was a somewhat embarrassed mood about the parlor...`
`When the sound of footsteps grew distant and silence returned, Krauss shrugged his shoulders slightly.`
`"...I apologize for my wife.`
` She has always been bad at controlling her emotions.`
` It's even been rough for me."`
`"If that's what's been managing your household, you must suffer to no end, Nii-san.`
` *giggle*giggle*...!"`
`"Aaaaaaahhh.`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!"`
`"...M-Madam......"`
`"It's nothing...!`
` Leave me be...!!"`
`Natsuhi flew into her room and threw herself onto her bed, lamenting...`
`Those heartwrenching sobs reached Kumasawa in the hallway...`
`......Poor Madam Natsuhi...`
`There is a deep enmity between her and Eva-sama.`
`Explaining their relationship would be very trying for me, as a woman...`
`The Ushiromiya family holds blood in high regard, but if a woman marries and leaves the family, they are normally removed from the family register.`
`...Thus, under normal circumstances, Eva-sama should have been removed when she married Hideyoshi-sama.`
`However, `
`...there is no one deserving of blame in this matter.`
`The Madam certainly bears no guilt.`
`There nothing to call it other than a whim of God.`
`...Krauss-sama and Natsuhi-sama were not blessed with children for some time.`
`After all, this is the male-dominant Ushiromiya family.`
`A wife is merely a tool to create a heir.`
`...If such a wife cannot fulfill her only duty, she will not even be treated as a human.`
`It pains me to remember how the Master tortured Madam during that time...`
`Back then, a wedding between Eva-sama and Hideyoshi-sama was being discussed.`
`Eva-sama was sly.`
`...Taking advantage of Madam's inability to become pregnant, she gained the favor of the Master.`
`She inspired him to allow her to marry and give birth to a Successor herself, making sure to avoid transferring her name out of the Ushiromiya register.`
`There was a vast difference in the Ushiromiya hierarchy between Madam, who married into the Ushiromiya family and was treated like an outsider, `
`and Eva-sama, who was related to the family by blood and whose husband took on the Ushiromiya name.`
`Furthermore, Eva-sama actually gave birth first, and to a boy...`
`As for how much weaker Madam's position was than Eva-sama's...well, I believe you could see for yourself...`
`...I'm sure Madam is tormented by the thought that, if only she had gotten pregnant earlier, the Master wouldn't have accepted Eva-sama's request to keep her last name after marriage, `
`and Eva-sama wouldn't have been permitted to act as arrogantly as she did today...`
`However, ...that was not Madam's fault......`
`All of the blame lies with God's whims and the stork that delivered Jessica late......`
`Even so, Madam won't allow herself to see things this way...`
`......She probably can't help but cry bitter tears as a woman...at her inability to carry out the duties expected of a wife...`
`Ahh, how sad...`
`I cannot do anything except watch over her from the shadows......`
`We crossed the hall again on our way to the entrance.`
`As we did, we once again spotted that witch's portrait.`
`However, 'spotted' is probably not the best word to describe that experience.`
`......It was more like our eyes were inexorably drawn to it.`
`That woman's eyes, with their sage-like glamor, definitely had the power to make those who viewed it stand rooted to the spot.`
`"............So this is the witch, Beatrice.`
` ......Wonder if that story's true."`
`"Uu-?`
` Battler doesn't believe...?"`
`Back when he had asked what this picture was, the first person to tell him had been Maria.`
`Therefore, when Battler showed signs of doubt, Maria must have felt that Battler didn't have faith in her.`
`...Of course, that wasn't what Battler meant.`
`Maria ran up to the portrait and began banging on a plate hanging below it.`
`Maybe the title of the portrait was written there.`
`Maria, trying to prove that she wasn't lying, obstinately continued to hit the plate.`
`"Ah, sorry about that, `
`it's not like I doubt anything you said, Maria."`
`"Uu-!`
` Battler believes!`
` Uu-!"`
`When he patted Maria's head and apologized, she seemed to accept it, sticking out her chest and proudly uu-uu-ing.`
`"......What's this?`
` 'My Beloved Witch Beatrice'.`
` ......'Behold the sweetfish river-', `
`...what's with this weird, huge epitaph?"`
`The plate did have the title of the portrait written on it, but it was much too big to contain only that.`
`Beneath the title was what appeared to be a long epitaph.`
`If you just skimmed over it, several unnerving words would jump out at you.`
`"Incredible, isn't it?`
` Grandfather had that made.`
` ...Pretty deep, huh?"`
`"Uu-!`
` I know!`
` It's the place where the gold's hidden!"`
`"...Wait, is it that story about the Ushiromiya family's hidden gold?`
` ...Now there's another thing I remember from long ago...`
` ...Hold on, Aniki, ...is this for real?"`
`"Grandfather had this made, but he never said anything about this picture or the epitaph.`
` ......Even so, amongst the family, it is often whispered that it indicates the location of Grandfather's hidden gold......`
`and that he will relinquish the inheritance and the gold to the person who solves the riddle."`
`"Uu-!`
` I heard that too, I heard that too!`
` Lots and lots of gold!"`
`"...Well, something like that.`
` Something like 10 metric tons of gold bars.`
` I think it's fake, though."`
`"Still, when you read about it in an epitaph like this, it almost seems real."`
`......I think I already explained Grandfather's upbringing, `
`but let me also mention the Ushiromiya family's 'Legend of the Gold'.`
`Grandfather succeeded the Ushiromiya family after it was destroyed in the Great Kanto Earthquake, `
`and by successfully riding the stormy seas after the war, he managed to accumulate great wealth.`
`...That much of the story everyone knows.`
`However, this is where the strange part begins.`
`...Part of it involves Grandfather's black magic obsession, so its credibility is extremely low, but......`
`......Well, wait until the end before you doubt or make fun of it.`
`After the war, Grandfather correctly predicted what the future would hold and won in a huge gamble, accumulating a vast store of wealth,`
` ......but there's a mysterious legend about how he gained his initial funding.`
`Grandfather came from a branch family and had no connections in the business world or the financial world.`
` Even though he later built connections with the occupying forces, he supposedly started as a nameless person who hadn't yet gained anyone's trust.`
`It takes trust to gather money.`
`There's no way anyone would lend money to someone they didn't trust.`
`......How did Grandfather, who had no reputation at all, manage to obtain his first vast chunk of funds?`
`When asked that question, Grandfather supposedly answered like this...`
`'On a certain day, I encountered the Golden Witch Beatrice.'`
`Grandfather then went on and on about his continuing research into alchemy and techniques for summoning demons in order to become a great magician.`
`...And the entity summoned as the result of the demon-calling ceremony...was the Golden Witch Beatrice.`
`He then apparently made a contract by which he would receive fortune and honor in exchange for his own soul.`
`The witch then granted Grandfather 10 tons of gold.`
`Grandfather used this gold as collateral to prepare a vast quantity of funds, `
`which he then used to multiply his wealth many times over and revive the Ushiromiya family...`
`It seems this story's so old that even our parents were told it when they were still children.`
`So, back when our parents were young,`
` they explored this island in all sorts of ways, believing that the gold Grandfather had received from the witch might be hidden somewhere.`
`However, since there was the danger of them getting lost in the abandoned forest,`
` Grandmother began to spread the story that the witch lived in the forest and approaching it was forbidden.`
`"...I remember that old story.`
` When we were little, we also went all over the island searching for treasure after our parents told us about it.`
` ......Didn't we get lost in the forest once, then start crying until some of the servants found us? Our parents got so mad.`
` ...Dang, that takes me back."`
`"We sure were idiots, weren't we?`
` After all, Grandfather only bought this island after using those funds to get rich, right?`
` That means he must've had the gold before coming here.`
` There's no way the gold's on this island."`
`"That's not necessarily so.`
` Maybe the gold was hidden on the island from the beginning...and he bought the whole island just to ensure that it'd be his and his alone.`
` There was a whole 10 metric tons of it, right?`
` It seems more realistic that he'd try to secure the place where it was hidden, rather than try to move it all."`
`"This epitaph was made two years ago.`
` And since Grandfather wrote it himself...`
`...yeah, it does make the Legend of the Gold seem more believable.`
` The so-called witch's gold that revived the Ushiromiya family weighed 10 tons.`
` ......Maybe that's sleeping somewhere, ready to be turned over to whoever can solve Grandfather's riddle. Maybe that's why he did it.`
` ......Haa, I guess that sounds like Grandfather's style or something......`
` Ihihi!`
` If it's true, that's pretty incredible."`
`The epitaph carved into the plate was very mysterious, with something like a poem or a song written on it.`
`That text was incredibly disturbing, filled with the signs of Grandfather's black magic hobby, and its contents were in truly bad taste,`
` but it could definitely be viewed as a puzzle which, if solved, might lead to the hidden gold.`
`"Whether that's what he intended or not, I can't even imagine what his true motive might've been.`
` ......All we know for sure is that Grandfather put this shady epitaph here so that everyone in the family could see it.`
` We also know that he's hinted at the existence of the gold without ever talking about where it might be hidden, at least so far.`
` ......These facts then were embellished by the imaginations of our parents, who were convinced that Grandfather was challenging us to a battle of wits..."`
`"...Sounds just like my dad, so greedy that he'd take something like this so seriously.`
` He may laugh at Grandfather's black magic obsession, but he'd still believe this story about the hidden gold.`
` It just sounds so good."`
`"......Well, it's certainly not a realistic story.`
` At that time, when Grandfather was still nameless and had no connections, there was no way anyone would just lend him a massive quantity of gold bars for free.`
` ......If such a person actually did exist, it's not unthinkable that Grandfather would call such a sponsor a witch."`
`"Yeah, but it's 10 tons. 10 tons!`
` If you cashed that in, how much would it come to?`
` I mean, it'd have to be a ridiculous amount, right?!"`
`"......It certainly would be a ridiculous amount.`
` They say that the total amount of gold mined by humankind since the dawn of history is 100,000 metric tons, at most.`
` That 1/10,000 of all of the gold humankind has obtained throughout history should belong to just one person is just insane.`
` ...On top of that, this 'witch' supposedly had all that gold collected in one place and was able to lend it to Grandfather just like that.`
` We're not talking about any ordinary person."`
`"Well, to me, that '10 tons' number seems pretty fishy.`
` After all, no one's actually seen it except Grandfather, right?`
` Even if we assume that some generous witch existed and lent him some gold, maybe it was closer to 10 kilograms than 10 tons.`
` Even 10 kilograms would be a pretty incredible sum, right?"`
`"Uu-.`
` ...10 kilograms of gold is how much?"`
`Maria, who wasn't following the story and felt like she was being spoken to in riddles, finally found a place where she could ask us a question.`
`It was a question I also wanted answered right then.`
`Whether it was 10 kilograms or 10 tons, it still felt like a huge amount, but I had no idea exactly how huge.`
`George-aniki folded his arms and tried to remember the market price of gold.`
`"......Well,`
` even the value of gold is affected by the market, and the value of physical gold can change depending on its purity and the trustworthiness of the foundry.`
` You'd also need to pay handling fees to cash it in.`
` However, that doesn't change the fact that it's a precious metal, and some people estimate that humanity will mine all the world's gold within half a century if gold mining continues at its current rate.`
` ............Just guessing haphazardly, `
`......I think you could expect a price of about 2 million yen per kilogram."`
`"Whoa...!`
` ......Just now, I randomly said 10 kilograms since it sounded smaller, `
`...but even that would be worth 20 million yen, wouldn't it?!"`
`"Uu-?`
` I weigh 28 kilograms."`
`".........Which means that if we had Maria-chan's weight in gold,`
` we could estimate its worth at over 50 million yen."`
`"That's just unbelievable...`
` How much would 10 tons be then?`
` 10 kilograms is 20,000,000 yen, which you multiply by 1000, so......umm.`
` .........Huh?!`
` 20 billion yen?!`
` What the hell!"`
`How much is 20 billion yen actually worth?`
` ......We can only measure it relative to our own pocketbooks.`
`Anyway, let's say that a person's wages over a lifetime are about 200 million yen.`
`...You grow up and work like crazy, sacrificing your life for your company, and you're finally freed as you approach old age.`
` Everything including retirement money might add up to about 200 million yen.`
`...In other words, that's the amount of money that'll be made throughout a human's life.`
` No, you could even call it the value of a life.`
`...So 100 times that sum is an unbelievable amount of money.`
`......If you work from age 20 to age 60, that's 40 years of work, `
`......so it's equal to 4000 years of work wages.`
`If you worked every day starting from the Jomon period, you'd only reach that number about now.`
`"...Uu-.`
` Is 20 billion yen a lot...?"`
`"Heck yeah, it's a lot.`
` Maria, you love shortcake, right? You could buy more shortcake than you could possibly eat for the rest of your life."`
`"......However, while that might be possible with 20 billion yen in cash, `
`I don't think it would be very realistic to have that much in gold bars all in one place.`
` Just as I said, gold is extremely heavy, so it isn't exactly convenient as a method of storing wealth.`
` Sure, you could imagine someone gathering their fortune together as incredibly high-value stocks or precious gems.`
` ...You often hear of people who traded their wealth for precious gems so that they could carry it around with them during the chaotic times of the war.`
` ......But you don't usually hear stories of people exchanging their wealth for gold."`
`"It may be heavy, but it's the most trusted and stable form of wealth internationally, so maybe that was important?`
` For example, bonds are just scraps of paper if the whole country goes under."`
`"You can also look at it that way, `
`...but even one 10 kilogram ingot is pretty heavy to carry around.`
` Haven't you heard?`
` A 50 kilogram person can't carry a 50 kilogram bag over their shoulder.`
` With that many gold bars, the amount of labor and risk for one person would be hard to calculate."`
`"So what you're saying is, while it'd be one thing if you had a stack of banknotes worth 20 billion yen, `
`20 billion yen in gold would be such a big mountain that practically it'd be kinda pointless."`
`"That's right.`
` ...Although the Legend of the Gold does have a pretty interesting ring to it, just the part about the 10 tons of gold makes it pretty much impossible..."`
`"If you think about it logically like that, it sounds obviously fake.`
` Haha, kind of brings you back down to reality."`
`"Anyway, that's Grandfather for you.`
` Maybe he exaggerated the story of how some kind, wealthy person gave him a loan by saying he got 10 tons of gold from a witch.`
` Even the number '10 tons' feels pretty symbolic."`
`"You mean like his gratitude for the money he borrowed was worth 10 tons of gold, or something?"`
`"Hehehe, maybe some rich man's leisured wife generously granted it to Grandfather.`
` And maybe he started calling this person a witch."`
`I see. Jessica's example isn't bad.`
`...Someone who'd generously lend a huge sum of money to Grandfather when he still had no reputation might as well be called a witch.`
`......Furthermore, Grandfather actually did use that money to build a vast amount of wealth later on.`
`...The fact that this person was so great at judging people might also justify calling her a witch.`
`Also, since she went to the trouble of lending all that money, she might've enthusiastically overseen how it was spent.`
`The decision to unexpectedly get involved with the occupying forces and profit from the Korean War Demands might've been inspired by the witch herself.`
`That might explain why he claimed to have received both wealth and honor from her.`
`"I see.`
` ......So, in other words, this witch lent Grandfather the funds necessary to revive the Ushiromiya family, and he owed her big time.`
` ...And then, he felt so grateful that he had that huge painting drawn and displayed... Yeah, it's not that crazy a story."`
`"It's even possible this person was an old granny who looked like a witch.`
` Maybe Grandfather idolized her, and that's why he had her drawn to look so beautiful.`
` Hahahahaha, I'll bet if we ever did meet this person, she wouldn't be nearly this pretty!"`
`"Hahahaha, that's possible.`
` The name Beatrice sounds pretty Western, and if you think about how everyone in our family has Western names, `
`maybe even the name Beatrice is the result of Grandfather trying to rearrange some Japanese person's name to make it sound Western."`
`"I get it, I get it.`
` That means this pretty girl doesn't exist outside the picture.`
` Guess that means I won't be able to rub those elegant breasts, ihihi!`
` In the first place, isn't having a witch pretty bizarre by itself?`
` Like you could find something like that anywhere on Earth."`
`I laughed and made fun of the witch, trying to distinguish myself from the kid I was six years ago, who feared the witch of the forest, ...when Maria tugged on my sleeve.`
`...I could tell by how hard she pulled that she was a bit upset.`
`"Hmm?`
` What is it, Maria?"`
`"Uu-!`
` Uu-!!`
` Beatrice eeexiiists!"`
`Maria stared up at me.`
`She had on her usual sour look, but I could tell she was angry by the color of her eyes.`
`"Witches exist!`
` Witches exist!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"Well sure, they do exist...if you turn the TV on and watch anime or something."`
`"Exist!!`
` Witches exist!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`I started getting impatient, not knowing why Maria was jumping on me like this.`
`Then, Jessica tapped me on the shoulder and whispered.`
`"Dumbass, you're smashing a kid's dream.`
` Maria really believes things like witches and Beatrice exist."`
`"Come to think of it, Maria-chan, in social studies at your school, when you were asked to write what you wanted to be when you grew up, you wrote 'a witch', didn't you?"`
`Maria nodded seriously.`
`Tears started to run from the corners of her eyes.`
`.........I see. To a girl who wants to become a witch in the future, `
`the existence of Beatrice was proof that witches do exist in this world, `
`and was therefore an image that she yearned after and admired.`
`'!s0`
` Exist!`
` Witches exist!!`
` But Battler still doesn't believe!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"It's okay, witches do exist.`
` I believe it."`
`George-aniki kneeled down and hugged Maria's head.`
`...Watching this, Jessica poked my side.`
`...So that's what it is.`
`It's like shouting that Santa Claus doesn't exist in front of a child who believes in him on Christmas Eve.`
`...I'm not the kind of guy who likes to shatter kids' dreams.`
`"......Oh, I'm sorry.`
` I wasn't trying to make fun of your dreams, so I apologize.`
` Beatrice does exist.`
` Even now, she's living in the forest and comes to the mansion every night to peek in and see what everyone's doing.`
` ......So you shouldn't go into the forest.`
` At night, you mustn't stare into the dark forest.`
` You might be seen by the witch of the forest, Beatrice.`
` .........After all, Grandmother said so."`
`"Uu-......`
` Really?`
` Battler really believes?"`
`"Yep, I believe.`
` Sorry for doubting it.`
` ...C'mon, let's make up."`
`I stuck out my hand, Maria grabbed it with her tiny hand, and we made up.`
`Maria didn't grumble any more than that, so George-aniki and Jessica were relieved.`
`"...Oh.`
` So this is where all of you were.`
` I was sure you had just left to go to the beach."`
`Shannon-chan, carrying a basket, was surprised to find us all gathered in front of the portrait.`
`"Ah, Shannon.`
` Well, this is the first time Battler has seen Beatrice's portrait.`
` He was just fascinated by it."`
`"That's right, it certainly is fascinating.`
` ...Beatrice-sama is truly beautiful.`
` I am sure that she captivated the Master."`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` In addition to the patron theory, there's also a theory that she was Grandfather's first love.`
` ...Either way, although it's been several decades since he met her, even now she holds a special place in his heart.`
` ...Which must mean that he's still captivated by her."`
`"Sheesh.`
` That must've made Grandmother pretty jealous, huh?"`
`"I'm not really sure, but that might actually be true.`
` Apparently, Grandmother believed he was cheating on her with some blonde."`
`"......Uu-?`
` Good smell!`
` Good smell coming from Shannon!"`
`Maria, sniffing, approached the basket Shannon-chan was holding with interest.`
`After hearing that, I noticed a fragrant scent with a touch of vanilla.`
`"Ah, I apologize.`
` I was told by Kumasawa-san to bring them to everyone."`
`"What is it, I wonder?`
` ......Ooh, excellent!`
` Cookies."`
`"Uu-!`
` Wanna eat cookies!`
` Wanna eat cookies!`
` Uu-!"`
`"Please, eat as much as you would like.`
` ...But, umm..."`
`Would it be appropriate to serve cookies in a place like this, in front of the portrait?`
` Shannon-chan sent us a glance that seemed to ask what we wanted to do about it.`
`...Well, yeah, guess eating here would be bad manners, generally speaking.`
`"Maria, why don't we eat someplace else?`
` Let's put the cookies in a bento and have a picnic."`
`"Uu-!`
` Have a picnic, have a picnic!!`
` If we can eat cookies, let's go!"`
`"Yeah, let's go get some fresh air.`
` We shouldn't stuff ourselves right in front of the witch."`
`"That's right, didn't we say that we wanted to go down to the beach in the first place?`
` Let's go, let's go."`
`"Shannon-chan,`
` sorry, but could I ask you to get us a blanket to sit on and some flasks of tea?"`
`"Right...!`
` Certainly."`
`Shannon-chan received her instructions and gracefully bowed before retracing her steps.`
`We headed for the beach on our own.`
`Everyone headed for the entrance in a group.`
`...Feeling as though that witch was staring down at our backs, I turned around once more.`
`"...Uu-.`
` ...Battler, you still don't believe...?"`
`"Nope, I believe.`
` ...It'd be so much cooler that way!`
` The Golden Witch Beatrice gave Grandfather 10 tons of gold!`
` And that gold might be sleeping around here somewhere.`
` Besides, didn't Grandfather write that strange epitaph as though challenging us to find it if we can?`
` I'd say that kind of adventurous story's way better."`
`"20 billion yen worth of gold, huh?!`
` Heheh, even if we split it up between the four of us, that's still a ridiculous amount of money!"`
`"5 billion yen for each of us...`
` ...Incredible!`
` With that kind of money, you could probably make any sort of business prosper.`
` In fact, we could live our whole lives fabulously without working at all."`
`"Uu-uu-!`
` I don't want 5 billion yen, I want cookies, cookies!!"`
`"Wahahaha, Maria would take cookies over money.`
` Still, 5 billion yen, that's like a dream!"`
`"Ridiculous.`
` ......Is it possible that you all truly believe in Father's Legend of the Gold?"`
`".........Of course we don't believe that story about a witch giving him gold,`
` but there's no mistake about the gold itself."`
`"The fact that Father obtained gold bars from an unknown source has been confirmed in several ways.`
` We've heard that, before the president of the Marusoo company died, Father showed him a large pile of gold somewhere.`
` Father used that man's claim as proof that there were 10 tons' worth."`
`"That's just the nonsense of a senile old man.`
` Along with Father, he was just fabricating a story.`
` You can't take it seriously."`
`"If that gold didn't exist, he wouldn't have been able to gather so much funding...!`
` Before the president died, he was a person with such a sincere personality that he earned the respect of many in the business world.`
` He wouldn't have become a partner to such fraud...!"`
`"Aniki,`
` the president of Marusoo definitely saw it.`
` 10 tons of it, clearly with his own eyes.`
` Even more, Dad let the president take one ingot at random and have it examined.`
` The results of the examination showed that the 10 kilogram ingot was 99.99 percent pure.`
` He said that the Ushiromiya family crest, the One-Winged Eagle, was imprinted on it."`
`"Almost instantly, the Ushiromiya Legend of the Gold spread amongst the fixers of the business world.`
` Gold from an unknown foundry has a poor rate of conversion into money.`
` Thinking that it was a chance for decisive profits, they accepted it as collateral, and as a result, Father was able to receive massive loans..."`
`"Is there no limit to the absurdity you're willing to accept?`
` ...How old are you people?`
` Are you still taking that nursery tale you heard as children seriously?`
` Where is the proof that this 10 tons of gold even exists?`
` Aren't you just parroting the lies of Father and few of those close to him?"`
`"......Of course it's just a story.`
` But still, Aniki,`
` the amount of money Dad raised required a suitable amount of collateral.`
` Even if the gold itself was just a rumor, it's an undoubtable fact that he showed them a treasure of comparable worth."`
`"It was just an illusion of money created by our penniless father.`
` He acted as though he actually had gold that didn't exist, fooling his sponsors.`
` It was probably the gamble of a lifetime.`
` ...Luckily, his use of those funds proved successful.`
` If the Korean War Demands hadn't come and the Ushiromiya family had not been restored, Father would probably have been hounded after as the crook of the century."`
`"So, are you saying the gold never existed, and Father made it all up?"`
`"Of course.`
` And because of that, the illusion of gold became a mere inconvenience once he'd achieved enough success.`
` That's why, later on, Father added all that about a witch and black magic, weakening the credibility of the entire story.`
` In other words, he revealed that the illusion of the gold was a fabrication.`
` If he claimed to have received the gold from a witch, no one would believe that it existed at all, right?"`
`"It's also possible he said it for all of your sakes.`
` Nevertheless, here come some stupid offspring wanting to divide up this nonexistent gold, along with the rest of the inheritance.`
` ...Rosa, don't tell me that even you believe in a fabrication like this..."`
`".........I can't prove whether or not Father really had the gold.`
` ...I just want to claim my rightful share, as one of Father's four children."`
`"Hoh...`
` It seems even you have started to talk that way, Rosa.`
` I see, so that's what you're all getting at.`
` You're trying to claim that I'm attempting to keep all the gold for myself..."`
`"Nii-san, you've gathered a massive supply of funds. That's a fact.`
` If we rule out the possibility that you've been embezzling Father's personal funds, `
`...then there's only one possibility left, right?"`
`"...Aniki, we've been thinking...`
`that you might've found those 10 tons of gold bars."`
`"Ridiculous.`
` Such a thing never existed in the first place."`
`"Then explain yourself.`
` Was it embezzlement of Father's assets or Father's hidden gold?`
` How could you have gathered so much funding if not by one of these methods?"`
`"Even I have many friends in the political and financial realms.`
` I have earned their cooperation, nothing more.`
` ......And on that matter, I have no responsibility to explain myself to you.`
` You understand, don't you?`
` There are some topics that ought not be spoken of."`
`"......If you insist on that point, that's all well and good for now.`
` But Aniki, Dad doesn't have long.`
` Nobody can ensure that he'll live to see this day next year.`
` The inheritance process will begin at the instant of Dad's death.`
` We'll arrange for lawyers and accountants who are impartial to all of us and have them inspect Dad's financial situation."`
`"At that time, if it comes to light that you've unjustly interfered with Father's money, `
`......you understand, right?"`
`"I don't have a clue what you're talking about.`
` You're starting to make me feel as indignant as my wife was."`
`"...Of course, Father's gold is part of Father's fortune!`
` We understand it's money you can't reveal openly,`
` but the four siblings should have an equal right to it."`
`"In other words, we're gonna have your financial situation investigated as well as Dad's, to determine whether you're hoarding the gold or not."`
`"Isn't this a great opportunity?`
` Right now, prove the existence of your so-called support from friends and acquaintances.`
` That way we can sportingly apologize for foolishly doubting you.`
` Right, Rosa?"`
`"......That's right.`
` Krauss nii-san, you are the one who's dodging the issue.`
` If you were guiltless, you could just prove that you were in the right, but you aren't even trying to do so."`
`"However, Aniki, we still have to consider your position here.`
` As Dad's representative, you're probably bearing a larger share of the burden than we are.`
` We've been living terribly relaxed lives until now, so it wouldn't be fair for the rest of us to complain without taking your efforts into account."`
`".........Hoh.`
` It seems you cannot make up your mind whether to flatter me or slander me.`
` Please get to the point."`
`"Basically, ......randomly investigatin' nit-picky aspects of Father's wealth seems like a pretty crude way to go about it.`
` As you said, Krauss nii-san, there may've been movements of money that are difficult to explain.`
` We've come to consult with you today while fully aware of that point.`
` ...Both sides stand to gain from talkin' 'bout this now."`
`"A consultation?`
` Hoh."`
`"......When the inheritance is divided, you'll be rewarded for your years of hard work taking care of Dad by an agreement that's generous in your favor."`
`"Don't misunderstand us, Nii-san.`
` We aren't saying that we'll abandon our rights.`
` But when we make our claim for what we deserve,`
` we might as well offer a generous understanding for your position. That's what we mean."`
`"In other words, if you accept our conditions,`
` then when the inheritance is divided, we'll leave the investigation of Father's financial situation to you, Krauss nii-san."`
`All of the siblings from Eva downward suspected that Krauss was trying to steal their father's wealth.`
`So, letting Krauss report the state of that wealth was extremely contradictory and a huge concession.`
`If, as they claimed, Krauss was actually embezzling money, Krauss would be able to hide that fact.`
`Besides which, it'd be possible for him to control the distribution of the inheritance in a manner favorable to himself.`
`Krauss, realizing that this sounded too good to be true, couldn't help but feel suspicious...`
`He couldn't help but worry about what they'd ask for in exchange...`
`"...Hoh.`
` After mistrusting me completely, you now say that you're willing to restore your confidence in me as the eldest sibling?`
` So, what is it you want in return?"`
`"Just what we deserve as siblings.`
` ......You aren't the kind of person who'd steal Dad's property,`
` but you also aren't being financed by some patron.`
` ...Considering all that, there is a certain explanation that'd satisfy the rest of us."`
`"......Nii-san, you found 10 tons of gold `
`and used that as collateral to gather some funding.`
` ...Yes, just like Father did in the past, right?"`
`"If that's the case, there won't be any funny business in Father's finances.`
` You've always been a good son, lookin' after Father.`
` Why'd we mistrust a person like that?"`
`".........You're being so roundabout, I can barely understand you.`
` Please speak in clearer and more practical terms."`
`"Our first condition:`
` Aniki, you must admit that you've found Dad's gold."`
`"...Are you asking me to admit I possess gold that doesn't exist?"`
`"Our second condition:`
` You'll acknowledge that each sibling has a right to a share of the gold, and you will pay out those shares."`
`"How foolish.`
` With that nonexistent 20 billion yen of gold, that would be 5 billion yen per person. Are you telling me to pay a total of 15 billion yen?`
` ......Ridiculous!"`
`"Keep listenin' 'til the end!`
` We know that much money can't just pop up out of nowhere.`
` We're not asking you to make an impossible deal!`
` Of course, regardin' the portions of the gold, we plan to reward you plenty for your hard work until now."`
`"Our third condition:`
` The portion of the gold to the one bearing the title of successor to the Ushiromiya Head Family will be 50%. The remainder will be considered the fair share for the siblings and divided up.`
` Of course, this also includes you, Krauss nii-san."`
`"Of the 20 billion, 12.5 billion will go to Aniki,`
` 2.5 billion will go to Eva nee-san,`
` 2.5 billion will go to me,`
` and 2.5 will go to Rosa."`
`".........That division scheme makes me so grateful I could cry.`
` So you're saying, for the sake of the gold that doesn't exist, I must pay you 7.5 billion yen."`
`"What's wrong?`
` Nii-san, your share is five times the size of ours.`
` These are such good terms, I'd be jumping for joy.`
` Heheheheheheh..."`
`"Our fourth condition:`
` The gold will be liquidated and distributed along with the inheritance at the time of Father's death.`
` However, as a deposit, 10% of our portions are to be paid to us promptly.`
` These payments must be made before March of next year."`
`"......What do you think, Krauss nii-san? This is an ideal chance for you to restore the trust regarding your handling of Father's assets, isn't it?!`
` Of course, it might be impossible to get a whole 7.5 billion before Father dies,`
` but it should be possible for you to manage a deposit of 750 million, right?"`
`"Paying 700 million in half a year might sound like a pain, `
`but you should be able to manage it, what with all your friends in the political and business spheres."`
`"Normally, we'd hope to receive the 7.5 billion right now, all at once.`
` But out of concern for you, we'll show our sincerity by asking for only ten percent of that for the time being.`
` The remaining 90% can wait until the inheritance is distributed.`
` ...See?`
` Even you'd be capable of managing a mere 10% to show your sincerity."`
`"............So, you're trying to sell me the right to assess Father's financial situation for 750 million yen?`
` .........Heh, heheheh.`
` How impressive.`
` You all certainly have grown.`
` To think that I'm now the one being offered deals."`
`"Nii-san, if you accept these terms, the rest of us siblings will leave the investigation of Father's assets to you.`
` However, the results of that investigation will be subject to scrutiny.`
` ...It's only natural, right?`
` We'd be so sad if you managed things so that our 7.5 billion share shrank."`
`"We'll avoid complaining, as a general rule.`
` Just make sure you do it neat and tidy.`
` ...As long as you don't try anything that's blatantly obvious, we've got no intention of stirring things up.`
` We want our inheritance quickly too.`
` We don't want it to get all drawn out and left hanging."`
`"......If a complaint is made, who would carry out the follow-up investigation?"`
`"............We don't mind if it's you.`
` This is probably the first and last chance for us siblings to reach a consensus.`
` ...I believe it won't come to that."`
`"Heheh, *cackle*cackle*!`
` Looks like even you can speak up now and then, Rosa."`
`By this point, it's obvious that Krauss wasn't at all trusted as the oldest sibling, so there's no need to go into detail.`
`The formerly tyrannical oldest brother had always abused his privileges and violated the other siblings' shares.`
`...It was in response to this that the other three, now adults, were finally teaming up and striking back for the first time...`
`"Sorry, but there's more.`
` Our fifth condition:`
` This decision must take precedence over Father's will.`
` .........Later on, we don't want some will to appear and make this decision completely irrelevant."`
`".........I see that you're very cautious.`
` ...Then let me ask, if the gold really were found, what would you do?"`
`"Since you'll be making payments to us for what the gold's worth, `
`the rest of us`
` 'really'`
` don't care if we ever see the gold or not.`
` ...You can think of our share as an advance payment."`
`"*giggle* It's good to have dreams, isn't it?`
` You plan to turn this island into a resort, right?`
` You might stumble upon the gold by chance during construction."`
`Eva let out a high-pitched laugh.`
`Krauss watched but didn't even flinch.`
`"......Let me add a seventh condition before I accept.`
` In the situation that any sibling other than myself finds the gold, they will immediately turn it over to me."`
`"Yes, yes. Of course, we'll hold onto it for you.`
` *giggle*!"`
`It was a play on words.`
`Of course the others, who were forcing Krauss to pay money for some nonexistent gold, `
`wouldn't save Krauss his portion if they actually found it.`
`From the beginning, this deal had been nothing more than a threat directed at Krauss.`
`Regardless of the actual facts, it was still extremely likely that Krauss was embezzling his father's assets.`
`When Kinzo faced death at last and had his inheritance distributed, some unpleasant facts would surely come to light.`
`That could easily become fatal to Krauss.`
`The others had spotted this weak point and were threatening their brother under the veil of compromise, trying to wring a huge sum of money out of him.`
`......However, they had forgotten one thing.`
`They'd forgotten that their brother's brain moved so swiftly, at least when it came to cunning and guile, that they'd been forced to band together to combat him.`
`While Eva couldn't stop smiling, sure of her victory, Krauss let out a gloating laugh to show how relaxed he was.`
`"Hahaha.`
` This all makes for such a touching story.`
` ...My estrangement from you all has left a deep pain in my heart.`
` If accepting these conditions means we siblings can become friends again, it would please me to no end.`
` I'd be happy to agree to your deal.`
` ......Rejoice, Rosa.`
` We have reached an understanding."`
`".................."`
`Rosa's expression dimmed.`
`......It was never a good sign when her brother started talking like this.`
`...Eva also keenly picked up on this.`
`That's why she was unable to wipe away a sense of unease, even though Krauss had obediently accepted the deal.`
`"...My, how obedient of you.`
` It's not like you at all, Nii-san."`
`"What a cruel thing to say.`
` Are you implying I have some ulterior motive?`
` Of course I don't.`
` I'm just the same as all of you."`
`'Just the same as all of you'.`
`He seemed to emphasize just that one part.`
`The color of Rudolf's face darkened.`
`To him, it sounded as though Krauss was saying 'I have a plan similar to yours'.`
`So Rudolf panicked.`
` He rushed to bring this nearly resolved discussion to a conclusion.`
`"......Then we're good.`
` ...So, Aniki,`
` would you mind signing here?`
` This is a written contract summarizing the discussion we've just been having.`
` There's one for each of us.`
` Everyone will sign for the same contents."`
`Rudolf took four written contracts out of his breast pocket that had the details of their deal written on them.`
`"The seventh condition you proposed will, of course, be added right now.`
` Don't worry about that."`
`"Aniki, need a pen?"`
`Rudolf took a fountain pen out of his breast pocket and offered it to Krauss.`
`Krauss made as if to accept it, but then, with a small laugh, he drew back his hand without taking it and spoke.`
`"............Actually,`
` in order to ensure that this agreement is properly executed, I'd like to propose an amendment on just one point."`
`As soon as Krauss said that single sentence...`
`...All of the siblings felt as though something ominous was creeping up their backs at the same time.`
`"...Th-That won't do.`
` We've already decided, haven't we?`
` Just stay quiet and sign it."`
`"Why are you in such a hurry, Eva?`
` Of course I'll sign.`
` I promise the share of the gold going to all of you will be 7.5 billion yen.`
` I also promise that, when Father's inheritance is distributed, I will cleanly and neatly liquidate it.`
` .........However, there is one point that I simply must insist that you compromise on."`
`".........What are you talking about?`
` What don't you like...?"`
`"The part about promptly paying ten percent of your share, 750 million yen.`
` As you pointed out, my financial situation is far from prosperous.`
` While I can guarantee that I will collect on various future investments,`
` I must admit that I am quite poor at the present moment."`
`"In short, I have absolutely no money that I can move around right now.`
` I am incompetent, and my business sense is dull.`
` Since I am the loser you all claim me to be, I don't have the power to move 750 million yen in just half of a year."`
`"Th-That can't be true.`
` Are you trying to deceive us with such a half-baked trick?"`
`"At the time of the division of the inheritance, I will liquidate everything at once.`
` Remove the condition that I must pay you 10% in advance.`
` ...That is the only condition under which I am willing to sign."`
`"......Krauss nii-san, that 10% is nothin' more than a number to measure your sincerity, isn't it?`
` All things being equal, you shouldn't have any room to negotiate at all.`
`" We're doin' you a huge favor by offerin' to let things slide for just ten percent in good faith money.`
` Now that we've explained that, you rejectin' our offer would seriously damage our trustin' relationship, right...?"`
`Hideyoshi had a humble expression on his face and was rubbing his hands together,`
` but his eyes weren't calm at all.`
`......Krauss had already seen through to the shadow in the depths of those eyes.`
`".........Hmph.`
` Why are you all in such a rush?`
` Or could it be that you're afraid of something?`
` .........Rosa, won't you tell me alone?`
` ...Secretly, so the rest of the siblings can't hear."`
`"............I-It's not as though I......"`
`"Quit it, Aniki.`
` All we're asking is whether you're gonna sign or not.`
` Just forget about making any strange deals or any other suspicious moves."`
`"......Hoh?`
` You say I have no room to negotiate?`
` ...Are you trying to claim that I am in a weak position, which therefore puts us in an unequal relationship?"`
`Shivers began to crawl up Rudolf's back...`
`He began to feel himself getting overwhelmed by the height of his brother's completely insurmountable wall...and the long shadow that had existed since they were children...`
`"Shouldn't deals be made between those on even footings?`
` From my perspective, this deal will help restore the long-lost trust of my younger siblings and deepen the love between us.`
` It's an old problem that's been eating at me, and one I would prefer to resolve as soon as possible.`
` I would be overjoyed if we could resolve it today.`
` .........However, it seems I'm not the only one who'd be quite glad to close this deal quickly. Am I wrong...?"`
`Krauss stared at each of his siblings.`
`...They avoided his gaze with animal-like instinct.`
`Only Hideyoshi was slow in avoiding it.`
` ...So he was caught by Krauss's gaze.`
`"Hideyoshi-san, `
`I hear your company has been doing extremely well lately.`
` At a brisk pace, it went public, and both its track record and its stock prices have soared.`
` I am truly jealous."`
`"...W-We aren't here to talk about my husband."`
`"However, it is unfortunate that you have neglected your stockholders.`
` It's even more unfortunate that you were unable to solidify your base when you became stock-listed.`
` ...Before you realized it, some bad-natured colleagues of yours had bought up a huge share of your company's stock, right?"`
`".........H-`
`How could you know about that...?"`
`"The same way you knew about me.`
` If it's possible to collect evidence proving that no one would offer a loan to me, then it's possible for me to collect evidence on you.`
` Hahaha, is it really so unexpected as that?"`
`Krauss grinned broadly.`
`...In contrast, Hideyoshi's face was rapidly turning pale......`
`Hideyoshi's company was a restaurant chain management company that he'd started from nothing.`
`Thanks to Hideyoshi's management efforts, the company had achieved success repeatedly, expanding its range, and a petition to make it a stock-listed company had recently succeeded.`
`The greatest advantage of being in the stock-holding system is that you can sell stock certificates and gain a large amount of financing.`
`That amount tends to be far greater than a business's normal profits.`
`So, this is an extremely effective way to gather massive funds to expand a business even further.`
`However, in exchange for financing the company, the stockholders gain certain rights.`
`They're given rights that allow them to observe and guide the company they've invested in, leading to profits even greater than their original investments.`
`......This right is guaranteed to the stockholders, and they sometimes use it to dismiss ineffectual management.`
`The 'right' allows them to keep an eye on management and prevent the money they've invested in the company from going to waste.`
`However, if they use it forcibly, they can eject the former management and take over the company.`
`...After all, dismissing management and nominating new management are powers held by the general body of all shareholders.`
`That power is determined by the majority decision of the stockholders.`
`And people who hold more stock get to cast more votes.`
`In other words, if some person or group holds a majority of the stock, they can freely chase out the old management and make the president anyone they'd like.`
`If they want, it's also possible for them to make themselves president.`
`Most companies take various defensive measures to stop malicious people from buying up their stock and threatening their position,`
` like ensuring that lots of stock is bought by those close to them, such as company employees.`
`However, Hideyoshi's company had only recently become stock-listed, and he hadn't had time to strengthen those defensive measures.`
`Or...maybe Hideyoshi was so engrossed in the management of his company that he couldn't properly understand the dangers of being stock-listed.`
`It's hard to say whether he should be viewed as a kind-hearted manager immersed in the work of management, or a foolish manager who had his feet swept out from under him...`
`...In other words, there existed some people who wouldn't let him get away with that naivety unscathed.`
`They began repeatedly buying up stock in Hideyoshi's company, rapidly gaining such strength that they couldn't be ignored.`
`They then sent anonymous documents to the shareholders in an attempt to gain control of a majority.`
`The documents read: 'The current management continues to make pointless investments and is ignoring the needs of the stockholders.`
` Let us force the current management to retire, cut the current wasted investments, and let this company be born again as one that gives more back to the stockholders.'`
`It's very difficult to make the actual state of a company's management known.`
`...The fruits of Hideyoshi's sleepless nights and constant concern for his company were cruelly distorted, and he lost the trust of his stockholders.`
`Thanks to these efforts, this group had almost collected a majority of the company's stock.`
`...At that point, even Hideyoshi noticed and started to buy back the stock, but the stockholders realized that the company was undergoing an acquisition maneuver...`
`and each demanded a ridiculous price for the shares that Hideyoshi was trying to buy back.`
`They continually tortured Hideyoshi, who had no leeway in the negotiation of the price.`
`One of the certainties of capitalism is that the price will rise when two parties vie for the same thing.`
`And one of the certainties of democracy is that the majority controls everything.`
`So in the end, whoever manages to buy up the most stock wins.`
`...Put another way, whoever has the most money wins.`
`Unless Hideyoshi could obtain a large sum of money at this critical time, he could easily lose all he had built so far...`
`'!s0`
`MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, `
`HE WANTED A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW...!`
`He couldn't wait for the division of Kinzo's inheritance, since no one knew when he would die.`
`"And you, Rudolf, have been in quite a lot of trouble lately too, haven't you?`
` You always hear people say it's terrifying overseas, but it seems it really is true.`
` American trials are settled quite emotionally.`
` They never hand down generous judgements to foreigners.`
` ......Weren't you advised by your lawyer that making a settlement with the other party would be more economical in the long run?"`
`"............What's this all about...?"`
`"......Well, it's just some trouble from work.`
` No big deal.`
` Nothing you can't settle with money..."`
`Kyrie immediately guessed the meaning behind the subtle expression on Rudolf's face.`
`......Her husband had gotten wrapped up in some kind of trouble without her knowledge...and had been worrying over it alone.`
`"That's right.`
` In this world, anything can be settled with money.`
` After all, it can even buy back the broken bonds between siblings!`
` America is very fussy about the violation of rights.`
` But with money, anything can be settled.`
` Long live capitalism.`
` ...Though, rumor has it that the settlement money could be as high as several million dollars."`
`Rudolf had been building a large amount of wealth with a certain type of niche industry.`
`...However, a niche is a niche.`
`It definitely wasn't a business exposed to the light of day.`
`An American corporate giant was trying to accuse Rudolf's company of violating their rights.`
`For various reasons, it was thought that victory for Rudolf in this trial would be extremely unlikely, and he was being forced into an all-out surrender.`
`...But even so, there was a way for this to be resolved with money.`
`If he could just pay that money, it might still be painful, but he'd be able to pick himself back up.`
`...But if he didn't pay, he'd lose everything.`
`'!s0`

`After all, the person the younger siblings were threatening...was the only one who had no urgent need for a large sum of money.`
`The other three, however, wanted a lot of money quickly, no matter the cost.`
`In other words, the longer it took to establish this deal, the better position Krauss would be in.`
`Krauss was extremely sly.`
`He had known of their Achilles heel from the beginning.`
`Even so, he had not been certain.`
`Therefore, he had hidden his knowledge until the very end, striking back only after analyzing their attitudes.`
`"If it were possible, I would like nothing more than to raise some money for my adorable siblings in their time of need.`
` ...But unfortunately, I have nothing on hand.`
` ......If you know of any sponsors that might be able to raise a whole 750 million, I suggest you try there first."`
`Krauss's elated words were so obviously detached from what he actually felt.`
`The other siblings could do nothing more than listen, grinding their teeth.`
`.........If they could think of a sponsor that convenient, they wouldn't have kept up this charade.`
` They had entered this huge battle specifically because they had exhausted all other options.`
`"...However, if you do insist on relying on your big brother, `
`I wouldn't mind using my influence to help you find such a sponsor.`
` .........Oh wait, I do believe you said that I have no influence.`
` Well then, I'm afraid I won't be much help to you.`
` ......Hehheheheheheheh!"`
`Krauss's low, gloating laugh began to fill the parlor.`
`The younger siblings, who had been driving the oldest brother into a corner until a moment ago, could do nothing more than grimace and grind their teeth...`
`"......E-Eva..."`
`"......Don't make me laugh...`
` As if I'd ever put myself in your debt...!`
` Don't make me laugh,`
` ...don't make me laugh......!"`
`"......I-`
`If we relied on you, how exactly would you help us...?"`
`"I told you, didn't I?`
` All I can do is find other sponsors for you.`
` Of course, I will negotiate for the highest interest rate possible.`
` Hehheheheh, gahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"......Damn you, `
`...taking advantage of us......"`
`"......Honey,`
` please calm down."`
`"I am calm. I'm extremely cool...`
` ......You bastard...!"`
`Kyrie grabbed her husband's hand.`
`But that action made him feel even more pitiful, so Rudolf shook it off.`
`...Krauss laughed as though watching something highly amusing.`
`"In times like these, it certainly would be nice to find Father's hidden gold.`
` If you did, you could split it up into 2.5 billion yen portions right now.`
` How sad, how sad. How very sad!`
` How extremely, totally, truly, hopelessly sad!"`
`"......Tonight, let us all drink together...`
`as we solve the riddle of Beatrice's epitaph and discover the location of Father's hidden gold.`
` If we four friendly siblings work together, there is surely no puzzle we can't solve.`
` ...Hahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"............Hmph.`
` Quite an entertaining scheme.`
` Well then, what are the conditions they've attached?"`
`"...Well,`
` whether or not Krauss-sama actually discovers the gold, he'll pay Eva-sama, Rudolf-sama and Rosa-sama a total of 7.5 billion yen for their shares.`
` However, 10% of that will be paid before March."`
`"Heh, hahahahahahah...`
` Krauss, you dunce.`
` To think he would have his feet swept out from under him by his younger siblings...`
` How truly amusing.`
` ......But it sounds as though they tripped when going in for the kill, yes?"`
`".........Yes.`
` Krauss-sama exposed the fact that Eva-sama and the younger siblings all have an urgent need to get money."`
`"Hmph.`
` Is there even any need to 'expose' such obvious facts?`
` That irresolute, incompetent man.`
` .........What are they doing now?"`
`"......That conversation has been put on hold for the time being.`
` Now, Beatrice-sama's epitaph is being discussed."`
`"So, they're trying to solve the riddle and find out where my gold is hidden?"`
`"............Yes."`
`Kinzo set down his spectacles and snorted.`
`".........Will the miracle be fulfilled first, `
`or will those fools expose the gold first?`
` ...What a show this will be.`
` ...At the very moment those fools solve my puzzle, I will suffer utter defeat.`
` They can suck my corpse down to the last fragment of bone.`
` The greed of fools can allow great magic to bring forth a miracle.`
` ...And yet!!`
` If the fulfillment of the miracle comes first...`
`if it comes first!`
` Beatrice will be resurrected again!!`
` The smile I have been chasing half my life will be restored...!"`
`"Oooooohhh, Beatrice!!`
` Soon will come the sacred night when we shall bet upon a miracle, and the game of demons shall begin...!`
` I will surely prove triumphant and survive!!`
` I'll let you have the lives of all those others!`
` I don't need wealth or honor or assets or gold or anything!`
` All I want is to see your smile one last time!!`
`'!s0`
`Kinzo choked, apparently in great pain.`
`Kanon got closer and tried to pat his master's back, but Kinzo motioned for him to stop.`
`".........Do you know why I went to the trouble of exposing the hidden location of the gold in a place that everyone can see?"`
`"......No."`
`"It is because magical power is determined by risk.`
` If the number of people who try to discover Beatrice's gold is great...`
`and the danger of them succeeding is great as well, then the power of magic will bring about a grand miracle if we succeed despite the odds.`
` ...In other words, magic is a game.`
` It is not the case that the one who performs the best becomes the victor.`
` The victor performs the best because he has been granted magic.`
` Do you see?`
` It is similar to how the miracle of life can be granted only after winning against the divine odds of several hundred million to one.`
` ......Is this a little difficult for you?"`
`"......My apologies."`
`"That's fine.`
` ...It all comes down to this.`
` I will give all that I have built up to the one who solves the mystery of Beatrice's epitaph.`
` Wealth, honor, gold, and the inheritance of the Ushiromiya family. Everything that I have established!`
` My children certainly aren't the only ones with the right to attempt to solve this riddle.`
` Anyone who solves the riddle will have the right to gain everything, even you."`
`".........Yes.`
` However,`
` ......I couldn't possibly understand such a difficult riddle."`
`"Of course.`
` I made it difficult.`
` ...But you must try to solve it as well.`
` That will form the seed that summons the miracle of my magic.`
` If everyone attempts it and everyone fails, that will be that.`
` However, if the miracles come together and give birth to magical power, it will happen!`
` Beatrice will revive.`
` That is why you must attempt it too.`
` Everyone must attempt it.`
` And in so doing, they will give strength to my magic!!`
` Do you understand?!"`
`"............Yes.`
` ...I will try."`
`For a long while, Kinzo repeatedly muttered to himself, agitated and clutching at his head.`
`Kanon stayed where he was, alert and unmoving, until he was given the next order from his master.`
`...Kinzo eventually realized this.`
`"Very well, leave me.`
` ......There is a bag of sweets on the liquor cabinet.`
` You can take some with you as a reward."`
`"......I'm fine.`
` After all,`
` ......I am furniture."`
`"......Hmmm.`
` ...So furniture doesn't eat sweets?`
` ...Well, I suppose it stands to reason.`
` In that case, leave me."`
`"Yes.`
` ...Excuse me."`
`Kanon bowed and left the study.`
`As the door closed, a heavy locking noise sounded out.`
`But it was not the sound of Kanon locking the door.`
`It was the door locking automatically.`
`No one could enter without Kinzo's permission, and once they left, they could not enter again.`
`......It was a mechanism that Kinzo, unable to trust his blood relatives, had created to seal himself up in his own study and isolate himself from the outside world.`
`He was already unable to trust anyone excepting, not the children who shared his blood, but those servants who called themselves furniture...`
`"......Nanjo-sama, how are you feeling?"`
`"...Ah, Genji-san.`
` Oh, it's just that there's no place for me to be anymore."`
`With a bitter laugh, Nanjo turned to face the door to the parlor.`
`...That look was apparently enough to tell Genji what Nanjo wanted to say.`
`For the most part, Genji also understood the family's situation.`
`...It must have made him want to frown, knowing that right now in the lounge, the master he served was being discussed so disrespectfully.`
`But it would have been very difficult to gather that from his indifferent expression.`
`"......Still, `
`...I don't understand.`
` ...Why did Kinzo-san have something so provocative written, I wonder."`
`Nanjo looked at the portrait of Beatrice.`
`...No, he actually directed his gaze beneath the portrait, at the plate with the epitaph.`
`"......I do not presume to understand the Master's thoughts.`
` However, I'm sure he had a deep reason for doing so."`
`"Since long ago, when Kinzo-san played chess, he would always prepare his moves according to some far-reaching judgement.`
` Yes, sometimes even to make moves I couldn't understand.`
` ......For an average person like me, it was impossible to see through to whatever it was he was planning..."`
`"Sometimes I wonder if this might be some kind of will, in the Master's eyes.`
` ......Perhaps he wishes to hand over his wealth and title to the one who can understand it."`
`"...So, you're thinking he may have wanted the four siblings to work together and solve the riddle...`
`before some outsider like myself solved it?`
` Kinzo-san may speak of his children in insulting terms, but perhaps he also wants them to repair their relationship."`
`"..............."`
`It certainly would be heartwarming if, as Nanjo had suggested, this epitaph had been made to repair the siblings' relationship.`
`...However, both Nanjo and Genji knew that nothing could be more impossible than this.`
`They'd known Kinzo longer than anyone, and Kinzo trusted them more than his own relatives, `
`but even they could not guess at his true motives...`
`"......The Master always says that everyone has the right to try and solve the riddle, even if they aren't a member of his family.`
` ......What about you, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"No, no...... It's a little too difficult a puzzle for this senile old man.`
` ......Actually, I once wrote this epitaph down on my notebook.`
` Night after night, I would try to solve it before going to sleep, `
`......but, hahaha, it really is hard.`
` It looks like we might have some free time to relax and consider it before someone comes to get us.`
` What do you say, Genji-san?"`
`".........I am nothing more than furniture in service to the Master.`
` Gold and assets are unnecessary to me."`
`"My, you're very modest.`
` ...I imagine that's why Kinzo-san trusts you so much."`
`"If so, I am honored..."`
`As Nanjo lightly laughed in response, he once again looked at the epitaph.`
`"......Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved hometown.`
` You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key..."`
`The epitaph on the portrait called My Beloved Witch Beatrice goes as follows:`
`Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved hometown.`
`You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key.`
`As you travel down it, you will see a village.`
`In that village, look for the shore the two will tell you of.`
`There sleeps the key to the Golden Land.`
`The one who obtains the key must then travel to the Golden Land in accordance with these rules.`
`On the first twilight, offer the six chosen by the key as sacrifices.`
`On the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close.`
`On the third twilight, those who remain shall praise my noble name.`
`On the fourth twilight, gouge the head and kill.`
`On the fifth twilight, gouge the chest and kill.`
`On the sixth twilight, gouge the stomach and kill.`
`On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill.`
`On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill.`
`On the ninth twilight, the witch shall revive, and none shall be left alive.`
`On the tenth twilight, at journey's end, you shall attain to the power of the Golden Land's treasures, once and for the last time.`
`The witch shall praise the wise and bestow four treasures.`
`One shall be all the gold from the Golden Land.`
`One shall be the resurrection of all the dead souls.`
`One shall be the resurrection of the love that was lost.`
`One shall be to put the witch to sleep for all time.`
`Sleep peacefully, my beloved witch, Beatrice.`
`"So...on the tenth twilight, the journey ends, `
`and you reach the Golden Land.`
` You really are diligent, Maria.`
` You did a good job writing this all down."`
`"Uu-!`
` I forget a lot, so I always write things down!`
` Mama told me to!"`
`There was a notebook inside the handbag Maria was always carrying around,`
` and Beatrice's epitaph was copied onto it.`
`Thanks to that, `
`we were all able to challenge the puzzle of the epitaph while walking down this beach.`
`Jessica and the rest had already tried to solve it several times...`
`and had already gotten bored with it.`
`However, since this was a first for me, `
`I was so excited that I couldn't stop.`
` It really tickled my sense of adventure!`
`"Let's start with the first line.`
` Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved hometown.`
` Where was Grandfather's hometown again?"`
`"I heard that before the war, the Ushiromiya family had a mansion near Odawara.`
` Which makes you wanna know which sweetfish river flows through Odawara, right?"`
`"Yeah, 'cause that river would be the starting place.`
` Anyone searching for the Golden Land would head down that and search for the key.`
` What's this river in Odawara?`
` Does it have sweetfish swimming in it?"`
`"If you're looking for sweetfish in Odawara, it'd have to be Hayakawa.`
` It's famous for its mountain stream fishing."`
`"Uu-.`
` I hate fiiish."`
`"Ihihi, Maria, you'll understand when you get a bit older!`
` Licklicklick salty roasted sweetfish!`
` Yummy!`
` Even though we just ate, I'm getting hungry again."`
`"...Umm, shall I bring you a biscuit?"`
`"Huh?`
` Oh, sorry. That's not what I meant, don't mind it!"`
`Shannon-chan was faithfully keeping us company, since she didn't have any afternoon chores for a while.`
`I would've thought that, since she's a servant, accompanying us would force her to take care of us and tire her out, but that didn't seem to be the case for her.`
`...On the contrary, she seemed to enjoy joining in on a conversation with people close to her age.`
`When I asked, I heard that she was the sort of worker whose room and board were supplied by her employer.`
`So normally, the only person close to her in age was Jessica.`
`Yeah, I can imagine how that might be pretty dull.`
`"Okay, so I get that the sweetfish-filled river near Odawara is Hayakawa.`
` In that case, we've gotta go down it!`
` Do you find anything if you head down Hayakawa river?"`
`"Ummm,`
` .........if you follow it downstream, you'll arrive at the ocean."`
`"Of course, you'd reach the mouth of the river!`
` And the third line of the epitaph was 'As you travel down it, you will see a village.'`
` By the way, since long ago, the mouths of rivers have been key points in transportation, and large cities tend to be built there.`
` That'd be the next checkpoint."`
`"Hmmmmmm.`
` That's a pretty good theory.`
` Just like you guessed, there's an old city there that was very prosperous in ancient times.`
` That's where Odawara Castle is."`
`"Ah, I think I might have gone to Odawara Castle on a field trip once.`
` It really was a wonderful castle."`
`"Yeah, I also went there.`
` Even though I live in a Western-style house, it's true that Japanese people feel calmer with a Japanese layout!"`
`"Uu-.`
` Castles are boring.`
` Theme parks are better.`
` Uu-!"`
`"I see, I see. Okay!`
` If we find the gold, the great Battler-sama will generously reserve a whole theme park for a day and let you play in it!`
` .........Still, Odawara Castle, huh?`
` The hidden gold of Odawara Castle...`
` Oho?!`
` It's actually starting to sound pretty good!"`
`"Hahahahaha!`
` Well, we figured out that much two years ago.`
` The village down the river where the sweetfish swim in Odawara.`
` We figured it was probably somewhere near Odawara Castle.`
` The problem is the next line.`
` Okay, let's see where Battler's strange reasoning can take him."`
`Jessica grinned broadly.`
`She seemed to be implying that she would've solved the puzzle long ago if it was that easy.`
`...Damn it,`
` I'll definitely find it and keep it all for myself!`
`"The fourth line.`
` ...In that village, look for the shore the two will tell you of.`
` .........I don't know what it means by 'the two', but anyway, the shore...`
` ......What does it mean by the shore?!`
` No, wait,`
` ...is there any place near there with 'shore' or 岸 (kishi) in its name?"`
`"Ummm,`
` ...I've heard there's a place called Sogakishi in Odawara."`
`"Huh?!`
` Wow, `
`you sure know a lot about it!`
` Heheh, what could that mean?`
` Shannon-chan, are you trying to solve the riddle and get the gold too?`
` That makes us rivals!"`
`"I-It's not like I'm interested in gold...`
` It's just that...George-sama told me about it before..."`
`"That's because we reached the same conclusion two years ago.`
` We even went to the trouble of laying out a map and looking it up!"`
`"It was about five kilometers to the north of Odawara.`
` We definitely found a place called Sogakishi there.`
` ...However, after that, we get stuck.`
` The fifth line doesn't say where the key is hidden in that place.`
` Maria-chan, could you read it for us?"`
`"...Uu-.`
` ......There sleeps the...`
`key to the...`
`Golden Land.`
` Uu-!`
` I could read it!"`
`"Sogakishi is probably large, and there wasn't ever any house built there by the Ushiromiya family.`
` Not much we can do to find a key in such a vast area without any hints."`
`"You're right.`
` ...And without the key, we can't advance to the next line.`
` George-aniki, what kind of place is Sogakishi?"`
`"Let's see...`
` I've never been there, so I don't really know, but according to the map, it's in the mountains.`
` I'm pretty sure it was at the base of Mt. Asama."`
`"......Hmmmm.`
` Something doesn't feel right.`
` You'd expect a riddle pointing the way to hidden gold to be a bit more exact.`
` I get the feeling that even the part about Sogakishi was a mistake."`
`"Well, I think it could be Sogakishi.`
` It could be talking about some house that Grandfather lived in when he was a kid that we don't know about.`
` After all, the first line mentioned his beloved hometown.`
` ...Shannon, you've served Grandfather alcohol and stuff lots of times, right?`
` Hasn't he ever talked to you about his past?"`
`"...The Master almost never speaks of the past.`
` ...However, he talks of the Great Kanto Earthquake as though it was someone else's story, `
`so he may have been living far away from the Kanto area."`
`"The Ushiromiya family may have been living in Odawara, but not all of the branch families were.`
` Grandfather often called himself part of a branch of a branch family, `
`the least connected to the successor."`
`"And that means...`
`the beloved hometown might not even be Odawara at all...!"`
`"I've never heard anything about Grandfather's hometown.`
` And I doubt he'd actually tell me if I asked."`
`"If the so-called beloved hometown isn't referring to the Ushiromiya family's roots, then the Odawara theory is wrong from the beginning.`
` Of course, this doesn't completely remove the possibility that it was Sogakishi.`
` For example, perhaps he lived in Odawara when he was very young, but then moved far away later."`
`"Uu-...`
` I don't understand what you're all talking about.`
` Uu-."`
`Maria had been completely left out of the conversation, and she now sat puffing out her cheeks in boredom.`
`"So, basically, `
`if we can't even agree on the starting point for this dice game of gold, we're totally stuck.`
` .........But wait...`
` After the first five lines, the thing we end up finding is a key, right?`
` Even if you don't have a key, it's always possible to bust through a door.`
` Can't we just skip the first five lines and start figuring out the rest?"`
`"Ooh...`
` I hadn't thought of that.`
` Oh well, we're just wasting time anyway.`
` Let's hear the rest of Battler's reasoning!"`
`"...But in the next part, it gets dark really fast..."`
`Shannon-chan frowned slightly.`
`After looking back at Maria's notebook to recall what was written there,`
` ...yeah, I was forced to agree.`
`"On the first twilight, offer the six chosen by the key as sacrifices...`
` It sure does get horrible quickly."`
`"On the second twilight, it says to tear apart the two who are close.`
` Does that mean to make them break off their loving relationship?`
` Or does it mean to literally tear them apart?`
` I don't know, but either way, it's pretty disgusting."`
`"Even if we set that second line aside, it mentions 6 people for the first twilight, `
`then 5 people for the fourth through eighth twilights,`
` so at least 11 people must be sacrificed."`
`"Uu-.`
` They're sacrifices to revive Beatrice!"`
`"...I see, sacrifices to restore the witch...`
` Yeah, that's what it'd mean.`
` Near the end, the witch'll be revived on the ninth twilight...`
` ...That last part is guaranteed."`
`".........On the ninth twilight, the witch shall revive, and none shall be left alive.`
` ...So everyone will die in the end."`
`"And after that, the tenth twilight is the goal line.`
` Not sure how you're supposed to reach the Golden Land if everyone's dead by then."`
`"...Depending how you interpret it, the traveler who holds the key may or may not be included in the 'none shall be left alive' part."`
`"But at the end, there's something pretty interesting.`
` After reaching the goal,`
` the witch gives out four treasures.`
` One shall be all the gold.`
` The problem is the next one.`
` It says the dead souls will be resurrected, right?`
` Doesn't that sound like it means everyone who died in the earlier lines?"`
`"......If you put it like that, then the part about reviving lost love `
`might refer to the pair torn apart on the second twilight."`
`"That's right.`
` And the fourth one refers to the ninth twilight.`
` The fourth treasure is putting the witch, revived on the ninth twilight, to sleep."`
`"If we put a happy spin on all this,`
` it'll be hectic with people dying and breaking up all over the place, but it'll all be made right in the end.`
` The awakened witch will sleep again, ...and everything'll be like it was at the start, except with a huge pile of gold."`
`"The witch must be pretty busy, what with all the killing, reviving, breaking up, and reuniting people."`
`"Not to mention waking up and sleeping.`
` Hahahahaha."`
`"Sheesh, just when the tale of the hidden gold was getting interesting, it all gets pretty dubious once the witch starts showing up."`
`"Too true. Ahahahahahaha!"`
`I laughed along with Jessica.`
`After all, the idea of a witch was just too ridiculous.`
`...Of course, once we started laughing like that, Maria, who believed in the witch, got angry.`
`"Uu-!`
` The witch is incredible!`
` She can do anything with magic!`
` Even kill.`
` Even bring back to life.`
` Even give love, even take it.`
` She can fly in the sky, can become invisible, can even make gold and bread out of nothing!`
` Uu-!`
` Uu-!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Erk, dang...`
` My bad, ...we were just joking!"`
`Jessica apologized, sticking out her tongue, but Maria didn't accept it.`
`She grabbed her notebook back out of my hands and, opening to some other pages, tried to prove that the witch existed.`
`Those pages had colorful drawings of witches on them...`
`and well conveyed the fantastical image Maria had of witches.`
`It wasn't the normal sinister image of a crooked-nose hag flying around on a broom,`
` but a dreamlike person with unnatural powers, who could do anything and wore a beautiful dress.`
` It was just what you'd expect from an imaginative young girl.`
`Flitting through the sky, crossing a rainbow, `
`dancing around all night with a teacup and a teapot that would never get empty no matter how much you poured out of it.`
`With a flourish of her staff, the stars in the sky would become candy and pour down,`
` and flowers that produced sweets would bud by the roadside.`
`......To Maria, witches were the only concept that could embody the magical dream that so captivated her.`
`As she grew older, it was the last remaining thing that could give richness to her dull and plain everyday life.`
`That's why Maria believed in witches.`
`She didn't want that dream of hers to be tarnished.`
`That's why she didn't want anyone to tarnish the epitaph, which affirmed the existence of witches.`
`Because the witch named Beatrice is Maria's dream...`
`"To Maria-chan, the epitaph isn't a guide to the hidden gold, `
`but magic to revive the witch."`
`So it was the single link between Maria and the witch.`
`Maria was very angry and clung to George-aniki.`
`Jessica and I scratched our heads and apologized.`
`...It might not be possible to smooth things over again like the time she got mad in front of the portrait.`
`Maria didn't seem willing to be easily consoled.`
`Unlike Jessica and I, who hung our heads wondering what to do, Shannon-chan timidly opened her mouth.`
`"Umm,`
` .........Maria-sama, did you know...?`
` There's a ghost story about Beatrice that has been passed down amongst the servants."`
`"......Uu-?"`
`"A-Ah, yeah, that's right!`
` Shannon, tell us about it.`
` I don't really know, but it's apparently pretty famous among the servants."`
`"What is this?`
` A ghost story?"`
`"Yes.`
` It seems it's a story from before we were born.`
` I also heard about it from my mother."`
`"...Yes.`
` It has been passed down since the time of the mansion's construction.`
` ...The servants of that time whispered that the mansion had two Masters, one of the Day and one of the Night."`
`The tale that Shannon told was just like a typical campfire ghost story.`
`If there was a forest with a witch living inside it,`
` ...then of course the witch would come pay the mansion a visit from time to time.`
`At some point, this ghost story naturally sprouted up between the servants.`
`"When people do the rounds a second time to check doors, windows and locks that were supposedly closed, they'd find some of them left open.`
` Lights that were supposed to be off were turned on,`
` and lights that were supposed to be on went out.`
` Things left lying around would disappear,`
` and things would appear when no one had any memory of putting them there.`
` When any of these things happened, the old servants would say that the witch had visited the mansion, invisible, and was playing pranks."`
`"Uu-!`
` See, she exists!`
` Beatrice exists!!"`
`"Yeah, she exists.`
` Long ago, it was always right before leaving for school that I wasn't able to find my bag, and stuff..."`
`Maria puffed out her chest with an 'uu-uu-' as though this was final proof of the witch's existence.`
`If I opened my mouth, Maria would probably be hurt again, so I didn't.`
`...I mean, you hear this kind of story everywhere.`
`Depending on the place, they might blame it on a dwarf or an elf.`
`The only difference is that they call it a witch on this island.`
`Of course, walking around a vast, elegant mansion at night would be a little unsettling.`
`It's an island devoid of people.`
`Since the mansion is so drafty, walking around on the night of a thunderstorm would certainly be eerie.`
`"In addition, some servants have also seen will-o'-the-wisps and glittering butterflies dancing around.`
` ...Kanon-kun also saw something like that when he went patrolling one night.`
` And recently, you often hear servants talking about strange footsteps heard inside the mansion near midnight.`
` We've whispered together that the Beatrice-sama in the portrait sometimes makes herself invisible and walks through the mansion.`
` ...It happened a while ago,`
` but even I have heard footsteps while patrolling at night that resemble these stories."`
`"......Whew.`
` That's scary..."`
`"Ah,`
` ...but there's nothing to be afraid of.`
` Beatrice-sama is another ruler of this mansion, separate from the Master.`
` So, there's no need to be unnaturally afraid. If you respect her, I hear she won't do anything bad."`
`"However, she can be quite terrifying if you don't respect her, right?"`
`"...Correct.`
` I've heard that, just before I began working here, `
`someone who spoke badly about Beatrice-sama fell down the stairs and quit after receiving a large injury to their back.`
` Because of that, there was a rumor between the servants that Beatrice-sama's anger had been brought down upon this person..."`
`"Uu-...`
` Anger will definitely be brought down on Battler and Jessica...`
` Uu-..."`
`"I-I-I'm sorry!`
` I don't want her anger brought down upon me!`
` I apologize, Maria.`
` Of course, I also apologize to the witch.`
` I'm sorry, Beatrice-sama. Please forgive an outsider's nonsense."`
`"I'll apologize as well.`
` I'm sorry, Beatrice-sama.`
` .........Will the witch be able to forgive us now?"`
`"...Uu-.`
` Don't know.`
` Witches are fickle, so they forgive when they want to, and don't when they don't.`
` Uu-`
`"That's no good...`
` Maria-chan, isn't there some kind of good luck charm that could prevent Battler-kun and Jessica-chan from suffering Beatrice-sama's wrath?`
` Maybe something that can block against magic?"`
`By relying on Maria, who was proud of knowing the most about witches, George was trying to revive her self-esteem.`
`...Once again, I've gotta admire his ability to calm kids down.`
`After taking a moment to cross her arms and seriously ponder whether there might be a charm that could save us,`
` she started flipping through the pages in her notebook.`
`I'd thought it was just a scribbled diary, `
`......but there also seemed to be quite a few pages that looked like they'd come from a book on black magic.`
`Maria solemnly considered a group of these pages, which contained things that looked like magic circles.`
`.........Apparently, Grandfather wasn't the only one with a black magic hobby.`
`When Maria finally found what she was looking for, `
`she snapped the notebook shut and threw it into her handbag. She then began fishing through that bag's contents.`
`There seemed to be various jumbled up things in there.`
`After a while, she took out various pieces of junk--although they were probably important magical items to Maria--`
`and repeatedly threw them back in, saying they were wrong.`
`It was all a little humorous, just like when Dora○mon took out the wrong tool.`
`Finally, she seemed to discover what she was looking for.`
`With a face that was unimaginably cheery when compared to the intense expression she had worn until now, she held 'those' out to Jessica and me.`
`"Uu-!"`
`I grabbed it...and saw that it was a very cheap-looking charm.`
`It looked like a bracelet made from a plastic rosary, `
`...with a scorpion-themed medal attached.`
`Haven't you ever seen those cheap, zodiac-themed accessories?`
`The kind you might win in a crane game at an arcade.`
`It really looked like something like that.`
`There were two of them.`
`Probably one for me and one for Jessica.`
`...However, the very fact that there were two of them made them feel even more like cheap, manufactured goods,`
` making it pretty hard to think of them as magical items.`
`"You're giving these to me and Battler?"`
`"Uu-!`
` With these charms, you don't even need to worry about Beatrice!`
` Because scorpions have the power to ward off magic!"`
`"Huh, really?`
` Didn't know scorpions could do that."`
`"Uu-, Battler doesn't believe!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!"`
`I'd said too much and angered Maria again...`
`Maria took out her notebook again,`
` pointing out various pages as she went on and on about how the scorpion had such incredible holy power that it had been used in magic-repelling magical circles since ancient times.`
`"......Ah, I've heard about that from some of the other young servants.`
` Something about how the scorpion is drawn as a magic-repelling symbol in sorcery..."`
`"Huh, really...!"`
`"Uu-!`
` The scorpion protects against bad magic and calamity.`
` And emerald brings peace to the heart.`
` Therefore, its effects are two-fold!`
` Uu-!"`
`"It's true.`
` The scorpion wraps around the emerald and protects it.`
` Yes, that certainly does sound like it'd work well."`
`I really wanted to make fun of those worthless looking charms, `
`but as I watched Maria explaining with all of her heart and realized that she'd found them for our sakes,`
` I started to feel like it might actually work, even if it was just a prize from some game center.`
`The material quality of the charm didn't matter.`
`What mattered was the strength of her feelings.`
`Even I don't think of myself as the sort of loser who'd laugh at something like that.`
`"Okay, thank you.`
` I apologized to Beatrice-sama, but even if I do end up getting cursed, I'll be safe now thanks to Maria's charm.`
` Right, Jessica?"`
`"Yeah, that's right!`
` Thanks, Maria."`
`"Uu-!`
` Wear it on your arm when you want your heart to be at peace.`
` Put it in your wallet and your money won't decrease!`
` If you hang it from a doorknob, bad things can't get in!`
` It's a really convenient charm!"`
`"What an incredible effect.`
` If Maria-sama gives it her confident seal of approval, then it surely must be reliable."`
`Shannon-chan clapped her hands together, and Maria stuck out her chest.`
`She was totally in a good mood again.`
`It's probably best if we let her lead the conversation a bit longer, if it'll keep her in such a good mood.`
`Come to think of it, she looked a bit bored when we were getting excited about the hidden gold, probably because she couldn't keep up.`
`While eating the cookies Kumasawa-san had baked, Jessica and I asked Maria this and that about black magic.`
`Maria happily chatted away in response to our questions.`
`Each time, George-aniki and Shannon-chan would act surprised or chime in.`
`The clouds in the sky grew darker and darker, but we cousins really enjoyed communicating freely after a year of separation...`
`"...Nn?`
` Did I just feel a drop on my forehead?"`
`"Huh?`
` I wonder."`
`As George-aniki rubbed his forehead, he looked up at the sky.`
`Considering the color of the sky and the dampness of the air, it wouldn't have been odd for a raindrop to hit him.`
`The wind also seemed to have grown a bit stronger.`
`"Uu-?`
` I didn't feel a drop.`
` Only I didn't.`
` Uu-!"`
`"Don't worry, neither did I.`
` Anyway, I'm sure it'll rain so much tonight that everyone'll get to feel plenty of raindrops."`
`"That's right.`
` Maybe we should head back soon..."`
`Shannon-chan looked down at her watch.`
` It was probably well into the evening by now.`
`"Is it already time for you to return to your work?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...Thank you very much...`
`for allowing me to enjoy some time together with you all."`
`"Tell Kumasawa-san thanks for the cookies.`
` Okay everyone, help out with the cleanup."`
`Shannon-chan declined our help, saying that this was a servant's job,`
` but picking up a dropped fork before the waitress has to is like my purpose in life.`
`We folded up the blanket, gathered up the trash, and helped clean everything up.`
`"Uu-!`
` The trash is getting awaaay!`
` Uu-uu-!!"`
`"I won't let it escape, I'll grab it before Maria does!"`
`"Uu-!!`
` I'll grab it!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!"`
`"Maria!`
` Don't get your shoes wet, you'll get in trouble!"`
`To Maria, chasing after some trash sent flying by the powerful winds was just another game.`
`By the time we finished, the wind was blowing pretty strongly.`
`Probably a good time to head back.`
`"You've all helped me out a lot.`
` Thank you very much."`
`"...It looks like you're really out of time.`
` It's okay if you head back first."`
`George-aniki perceived from her hurried appearance that very little of her free time was left.`
`"Genji-san's very strict about time.`
` If you don't show up where you're supposed to be at the right time, I bet he'll be pissed."`
`"We'll see you later.`
` Do your best with your work."`
`"Y-Yes!`
` ......Then if you will excuse me."`
`After making a respectful bow, Shannon-chan ran towards the rose garden.`
`"Okay, let's head back to the guesthouse.`
` We can watch TV or something and relax a little."`
`"Uu-!`
` Wanna watch TV!`
` Wanna watch TV, uu-!"`
`"Then it's decided.`
` Let's all head back and watch TV together."`
`Maria, who wasn't done having fun, agreed once television was mentioned.`
`We climbed up the gentle stairs and returned to the rose garden.`
`The wind had grown very strong, and roses shook throughout the garden like ripples on the water.`
`This might be our last chance to see these beautiful roses...`
`I'll bet tonight's typhoon ruins them...`
`"These roses might be done in by tonight's winds."`
`"You're right.`
` Still, I think the roses were pretty lucky.`
` After all, they got to welcome all of you before the typhoon."`
`"All flowers lose their petals eventually.`
` But that means we can admire them even more when they're in bloom."`
`"That's right.`
` ...Maria, burn this image into your eyes.`
` At this moment, they're the best roses of the year."`
`"Uu-.`
` Burned into eyes."`
`Right then, Maria suddenly clapped her hands.`
`It looked like she'd remembered something.`
`"......My rose...`
` The typhoon will send it flying.`
` ......Uu-!"`
`"Oh, you mean that sad-looking rose George-aniki marked with a ribbon?"`
`Maria apparently remembered where the rose was.`
`She ran at full speed.`
`The rest of us followed her.`
`"............Uu-?`
` Uu-."`
`"Where was that again...?`
` I'm sure it was somewhere around here."`
`We searched everywhere around that area, but it was only a single flower among all of these roses, after all.`
`Even though we knew it was somewhere close by, we weren't able to find it.`
`The winds making up the typhoon's front lines made roses throughout the garden undulate.`
` It was almost like it was teasing us by making the location of Maria's rose impossible to find...`
`"Maybe it wasn't here...`
` Let's try spreading out a bit in our search."`
`"Sounds good.`
` Let's go for strength in numbers.`
` .........Hmm?`
` What's up, Maria?"`
`As we made to split up and search, Maria tugged on my jacket with an unhappy face.`
`......You could tell that she didn't want us to leave that spot.`
`"What is it? What's wrong?"`
`"......Uu-.`
` My rose is here.`
` It's here...!"`
`"But it's actually not, right...?`
` Maybe it was on the other side of the flower bed.`
` If we all look, we'll find it fast, okay?"`
`"Uu-!!`
` It's here!`
` My rose is here!!`
` Look for it!`
` Loooook fooor iiit!!`
` Uuu--!!"`
`Maria stomped her feet in irritation.`
`...She pointed at that spot and said it was definitely there, but in actuality, it wasn't.`
`Even so, Maria got mad when we said we were going to search elsewhere.`
`...We were at a loss for what to do.`
`For a while, we had to stay near Maria and pretend to search through that rose thicket.`
`"......Uu-.`
` Uu-...!`
` Not here.`
` ......Not here!`
` Not here!`
` Uuu--!!"`
`Maybe she's saying that it should be here but isn't.`
`Maria became increasingly irritated...`
`"...Oh man, `
`Maria's really losing her temper."`
`"Sometimes, Maria starts to really care about really pointless stuff.`
` If she gets what she wants, that's okay, but..."`
`"You can't find something that isn't there...`
` That's not good..."`
`Just when we were at a loss of what to do, `
`Maria called out in a loud voice.`
`"Mama!!`
` Uu-uu-!!"`
`We could see Aunt Rosa in the direction Maria was waving her hand.`
`Maybe she wanted to look at the garden one more time before the typhoon came, `
`or maybe she had some business at the guesthouse.`
`Aunt Rosa was coming from the mansion.`
`She quickly noticed her daughter's voice and came over.`
`"My, my, what happened, everyone?`
` Are you looking for something?"`
`"Look for it!`
` Mama, you look for my rose too!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Your rose?"`
`"We found an unhealthy rose around here and marked it."`
`"We tied a candy wrapper around it.`
` ...But Maria, if I remember correctly, it was growing right in front and really stood out, didn't it?`
` Unless it grew legs and ran off somewhere, it must've been somewhere else.`
` Maybe you remembered it wrong."`
`"Uu-!!`
` It is here!!`
` Iiit iiis heeere!!`
` Battler doesn't believe!`
` Uu-uu-!!"`
`"How many times do I have to tell you to stop saying 'uu-uu-' before you'll understand?!`
` Mama will look for it, so stay quiet!!"`
`I'd never seen Aunt Rosa be anything other than kind and gentle, so her anger surprised me a bit.`
`Aunt Rosa began searching as well, so we went along with her for the time being,`
` but we were already more than sure that it wasn't around here.`
`...So, it didn't take long for Aunt Rosa to realize that too.`
`"The rose isn't here.`
` Did you mistake this place for somewhere else?`
` There are so many roses around-"`
`"Uu-!!`
` Uuuu---!!!`
` That's wrong!!`
` It is here!!`
` Mama doesn't believe!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"I already believed you and looked hard for it, didn't I?!`
` But it isn't here!"`
`"Uu-uu-!!`
` But it is here!!`
` It is here but it isn't!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Then someone must have ripped it out!`
` Anyway, stop saying 'uu-uu'!!"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Who ripped out my rose, who did?!?!`
` Give it back, give it back!!`
` Uu-uu-!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"How should I know?!!`
` Stop it, stop saying 'uu-uu-'!!"`
`Aunt Rosa slapped Maria's left cheek with her palm.`
`In that instant, Maria was shocked into silence.`
`Of course, it was only for an instant.`
`When Maria realized that her wish was being rejected, she started yelling even louder.`
`"Uu-uu-!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` My rose!`
` My rose!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"Didn't I tell you to stop that weird habit?!!`
` That's why all the kids in your class make fun of you!!`
` Cut it out!!"`
`Once again, her palm slapped Maria's cheek.`
`This time she didn't go silent.`
`She choked as she started crying...and began to bawl in an increasingly loud voice...`
`Aunt Rosa was clearly irritated and lifted her hand once more to try and shut her daughter up...`
`"A-Aunt Rosa...`
` Now, now... She's just a little kid, so there's no reason to get so serious...ihihi."`
`I tried to cut in with a bitter smile, rubbing my hands together, `
`...but Aunt Rosa glared at me with a serious face, and I realized that I should've stayed out of this.`
`"I'm sorry, but could the rest of you go back to your room for a bit?`
` I need to have a little talk with Maria."`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Nobody believes in my rose!!`
` Even though it was here!!`
` Uu-uu-!!`
` Look for it!!`
` Looook fooor iiit!!`
` Here, it was here!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"But it's not here!!`
` So you must've confused this place for somewhere else, right?!"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!`
` It is here!!`
` It's definitely here!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Then it disappeared!!`
` Give it up!!"`
`"Why?!`
` Why did it disappear?`
` Why, why?!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"I don't know that!!`
` So stop saying 'uu-uu-'!!"`
`Aunt Rosa once again raised her hand, overcome by emotion, and slapped Maria's cheek.`
`It was strong enough to knock Maria over.`
`"H-Hey, Aunt Rosa, `
`even if she is your daughter, violence isn't the answer..."`
`I stepped between them to protect Maria, who was still on the ground, crying 'uu-uu-'.`
`......I knew that, as an outsider, problems between parent and child were none of my business.`
`But I wasn't brought up to just silently observe something like this...`
`"Don't you think it's weird, Battler-kun?`
` Are there any girls at your school who mutter 'uu-uu-'?"`
`"Well, I am in high school...`
` But for an elementary schooler, I think saying 'uu-uu-' is pretty cute..."`
`"Cute?`
` Saying 'uu-uu-' is cute?`
` Cute?!"`
`My careless words seemed to have earned me Aunt Rosa's wrath.`
`She grabbed my collar with a terrifying expression...`
`"Don't say such nonsense!!`
` Do you know how old Maria is?`
` She's nine!`
` She's a fourth grader!`
` Not a kindergartener!`
` But she still makes that sound during class!!`
` Don't you get it?!`
` Do you know what they say about this kid when they bully her?!`
` Thanks to this weird habit, she still hasn't made a single friend!`
` Don't turn your eyes from reality and carelessly call Maria cute!!`
` Think more seriously about this kid's future!!!"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"I told you, stop making that sound!!!`
` Didn't I tell you to stop it?!!"`
`Aunt Rosa struck Maria's quivering head, from which an increasingly unhappy voice was rising.`
`I tried to stop it, but Aunt Rosa pushed me away...`
`My back hit George-aniki.`
`"......A long time ago, Aunt Rosa also thought of it as nothing more than one of Maria-chan's baby words,`
` ...but now that it hasn't been fixed even midway through elementary school, she's been worrying about it a lot..."`
`"How she talks isn't really that big of a deal, right...?"`
`"She'll never make it as an adult if she's like that.`
` ...So, even though it isn't fun to watch,`
` ......this is a problem between parent and child."`
`".........Well, `
`even I get chewed out by Mom all the time 'cause of how I talk."`
`When they put it that way, maybe even a scene as painful as this isn't something an outsider like me should butt in on...`
`"Battler-kun, when you were a kid, didn't you have any bad habits that you couldn't fix and that got you into trouble?"`
`"......Well, one or two.`
` On Parent's Day once, I kept getting yelled at in front of everyone, and it was embarrassing as all hell."`
`"Well then, you can understand how the two of them must feel right now.`
` ......I'm sure they don't want us to be here now.`
` ......You understand too, don't you, Jessica-chan?"`
`".........I don't think anyone likes to be seen when they're being scolded."`
`"Let's go.`
` We'll return to the guesthouse.`
` Then, after Maria-chan comes back,`
` let's welcome her as if nothing happened.`
` That's probably for the best, isn't it?"`
`We thought George-aniki's point was probably a reasonable one,`
` and we may have been eager to use that reasonable-sounding argument as a justification to retreat from this heart-rending scene.`
`Jessica and I nodded at George-aniki, and we all left.`
`We called towards Maria, telling her that we were going to head to the guesthouse, `
`but she didn't seem to hear, and we felt sort of guilty and shameless after saying it...`
`"In that case, look by yourself as much as you want!`
` Mama doesn't care!!"`
`"Uu-!!!`
` I'll look for it!`
` I'll look for it by myself!!`
` Even if Mama doesn't care!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Have it your way!!"`
`After blasting her with those last few words, Rosa spun on her heels and quickly returned to the mansion.`
`Maria probably viewed that as a cold gesture meant to injure.`
`But that wasn't Rosa's intention.`
`...It was because the hand with which she had so emotionally struck Maria's cheek...was still numb.`
`...It was because, if she stayed there screaming, she might again be taken over by her emotions and continue slapping her daughter's cheek over and over.`
`After Rosa left, Maria was left alone in the rose garden.`
`The wind began to blow stronger and stronger, and every once in a while, a raindrop would fall on her forehead.`
`...However, Maria couldn't leave that place.`
`Not until she found that poor, wilting rose.`
`It had definitely been there.`
`......Even so,`
` it wasn't.`
`Even though she knew the place and even though it had been there,`
` it wasn't.`
`Maria bitterly stared at the place it was supposed to be and thought frantically.`
`Maybe the angle I'm looking from is wrong.`
`Maybe the height I'm looking from is wrong.`
`......While gazing at a single point, `
`Maria repeatedly stood up, changed her position and continued to stare.`
`The wind was getting stronger and stronger......`
`But Maria kept on looking for that rose in front of the flower bed...`
`.........Kinzo noticed the sound of the raindrops beating on the window.`
`It seemed to be pouring down thickly.`
`It had begun to rain later than the weather report had predicted.`
`Kinzo approached the window as if being summoned by the sound of the rain.`
`The sound of rain is a sound of silence.`
`That sound feels quieter than any silence...`
`and makes humans remember that, in the end, they are alone from the moment they're born to the moment they die.`
`"......You're late, Beatrice."`
`Were those words directed at the rainy sky...?`
`There was no one to be seen in the direction of Kinzo's gaze.`
`"......Well then, let us begin.`
` Let us begin our banquet of miracles.`
` ......This island has now been cut off from the world.`
` Now there are none who can interrupt my ceremony.`
` There are many fitting sacrifices for you.`
` Four of my children.`
` Three of their companions.`
` Four of my grandchildren.`
` Me and my guests and my servants!`
` You may devour as many as you please.`
` The key of fate will select the sacrifices in accordance with the Demons' Roulette.`
` If that roulette chooses me, even I will become your sacrifice.`
` ...However, because of that,`
` ...because I will bet on such madness,`
` ......I will most assuredly bring forth a grand miracle."`
`"...Come, devour to your heart's content...!!`
` I will achieve victory over that roulette.`
` Yes, I'll put everything on the line.`
` First, I'll return the inheritance of the Ushiromiya family.`
` Accept it!!"`
`Kinzo tore the window open, ripped a golden ring off his finger, and forcefully threw it away.`
`......At that time, the sound of thunder rang out, giving the illusion that the lightning had accepted the ring.`
`"And, ......when you are resurrected, `
`surely I will be the one who stands witness.`
` I will survive until the end and watch over you as you awaken.`
` .........So come, Beatrice...`
` Welcome to my banquet...!`
` In exchange for all that I have created, show me another miracle just this once.`
` ......Oooooohh,`
` ...Beatriceeeeeee........."`
`A news ticker popped up on top of the TV program we were watching.`
`The disaster report told how municipalities all over were continually sending out rain, flood, and wave warnings.`
`Of course, the raindrops beating harshly on the window were even more convincing.`
`"......This rain's incredible.`
` Still, when it's raining this hard, it also feels like it might stop at any moment."`
`"You wish!`
` They said the typhoon's moving slow, so it might be like this all day tomorrow.`
` And even a little bad weather stops the boats from coming."`
`"It looks like we won't be able to head out on Sunday after all.`
` ...Just in case, I cleared all outside business from my Monday schedule, and I'm glad I did."`
`"Which means...ihihi, looks like we'll get to skip school Monday.`
` Living on an island's starting to sound pretty good!`
` ......Come to think of it, Jessica, you've gotta take a boat to school every day, don't you?`
` What do you do when the boats stop running?`
` Do you stay home when it rains and show up late when the wind's blowing, like King Kamehameha?"`
`"If the boats don't come, I stay home.`
` Still, it's not as good as it sounds.`
` Usually, I'm ordered to study by myself, and it's not that fun with someone standing right behind you watching everything you do."`
`"During the rainy season, does the weather ever stay bad for a long time`
` and make you miss a bunch of days in a row?"`
`"That does happen sometimes.`
` Still, I'd get a call from my homeroom teacher every single day, who'd sourly guide me on how I should teach myself and what I had to turn in."`
`"She can't skip school as easily as you're imagining, Battler-kun.`
` She's got to follow the rules for people that travel to school by boat and get a good amount of studying done."`
`"It'd actually be easier to just go to school.`
` In my own room, I get distracted and can't concentrate.`
` After being made to do nothing but workbooks for several days straight, it's pretty hard to handle all that mental stress.`
` ......When I get into college, I really just wanna go to some dorm and quickly say goodbye to this inconvenient island."`
`"Ah, okay...`
` By the way, what do you do when the weather's good in the morning, but then gets so bad on your way home that the boats are closed?`
` Do you spend the night at school?"`
`"That actually happens a lot.`
` Because of that, they've built some lodgings there for people who can't get back to the island they live on.`
` That's where you'd spend the night.`
` Sometimes, when it gets really bad, you can't get back home for a few days at a time."`
`"Someone commuting to school or work on a train packed to twice its capacity might carelessly think that `
`commuting by boat would be pretty interesting and fun, `
` but it sounds like it comes with troubles of its own."`
`"You hear thoughtless tourists saying stuff like that all the time.`
` I've had enough of island life.`
` I really wanna just graduate high school and say goodbye to this island."`
`"But there are all-dorm schools even for high school, right?`
` Why'd you choose that Niijima school, of all places?"`
`"I've wanted to go to one of those from the beginning!!`
` But Mom's always going on about how I need to learn manners and discipline as the Successor.`
` ...So, I ended up sticking close to home even for high school.`
` Man, I hate this island.`
` I just wanna go live in a city.`
` I don't care if rain or even spears fall from the sky, as long as I can move to a city where I can wear casual clothes and sandals...`
`and can get to a convenience store in less than five minutes..."`
`"Hahahaha.`
` Hold out just a little longer.`
` Just a bit more and you'll graduate high school, right?"`
`"I can't wait a little longer.`
` Aaaaaah..."`
`Jessica stretched out and reclined in the sofa.`
`Maybe it was a bad time slot, because there weren't any interesting programs on, `
`and we had nothing to do but languidly kill time until we were called for dinner.`
`After that episode, Maria never returned to the cousins' room after all.`
`Aunt Rosa probably took her back to the mansion.`
`It had to be pretty boring for Maria, all by herself while the adults had a confusing conversation.`
`......We thought we might as well head over to the mansion to see her, but the weather really was awful...`
`and since there wasn't much time until dinner, we stayed where we were.`
`At that time, we heard the sound of a humble knock.`
`Jessica answered.`
`"Ye-s!"`
`".........The preparations for dinner are complete.`
` Please come to the mansion."`
`It was Kanon-kun's voice.`
`Did he go to all the trouble of coming from the mansion in this rain just to get us?`
`Couldn't he have just called us on the telephone?`
`...Well, I guess servants at work don't always get to take the most efficient route.`
`"Just when I was getting hungry.`
` Let's go."`
`George-aniki turned off the television and stood up.`
`"My stomach's been growling for a while!`
` I've always been a huge fan of the main family's dinners!`
` And didn't Gohda-san say it was calf steak or something?`
` Oohh, I can't wait!!"`
`"Our dinners are always even more fabulous than usual when the family conference comes around.`
` Even I'm looking forward to it!`
` Let's go, let's go."`
`As we left the room, Kanon-kun bowed silently and respectfully.`
`"Okay, let's go.`
` Is the rain pretty nasty out there?"`
`"......Yes.`
` Take care not to get your garments wet."`
`After seeing the three of us out, Kanon-kun peered into the empty room.`
`".........Wasn't Maria-sama with you...?"`
`"No, she's not.`
` Wasn't she with Aunt Rosa?"`
`Rosa was lying on a sofa in the empty parlor, having fallen asleep before she knew it.`
`...She was bearing a burden that the children couldn't even imagine.`
`That's why she only needed to let her guard down a little...before the weariness immediately dragged her into the world of sleep.`
`Realizing this, Genji brought a blanket over to her.`
`When he tried to spread it over her, her eyes snapped open as though she'd been shocked with electricity.`
`'!s1`
` ............`
`'!sd`
`When she realized that the thing that had touched her was just a blanket, and that Genji had been considerately giving it to her, she let out a sigh of relief.`
`"......Did I wake you?`
` My sincere apologies."`
`"No, it's okay.`
` I hadn't planned on sleeping in the first place.`
` ...What time is it now?"`
`When he was asked for the time, Genji checked a pocket watch that he took out of his chest pocket.`
`".........It is slightly after 6:00."`
`Rosa gave her head a little shake when she realized that not much time had actually passed, even though it'd felt like she'd slept for ages.`
`...Even though she didn't feel rested at all, the drowsiness that had enveloped her must've been pretty deep.`
`"Thank you, I'll be fine without the blanket...`
` I mustn't sleep at such a strange time.`
` My sense of time has been completely thrown off.`
` ...............The rain...`
`has finally started pouring down in earnest, hasn't it?"`
`Rosa finally realized that the peaceful sound that had put her to sleep was actually the rain.`
`"The wind's blowing hard too.`
` ...I wonder if the typhoon's finally here."`
`"......That's what they said on TV.`
` The typhoon is moving slowly, so they think it will be like this all day tomorrow."`
`"Really...?`
` .........So, our last chance to see that wonderful rose garden must already have passed by."`
`From the window, what she could see of the rose garden was completely blurred by the wind and the rain.`
`"...Maria...`
` ......That's right, what about Maria?!"`
`"............I have not seen her.`
` Did she not return to the guesthouse?"`
`Rosa knew her daughter's nature well.`
`So a chill ran down her spine.`
`Maria was stubbornly honest,`
` ......and if she was ordered to find something that didn't exist, she would look forever and ever.`
`......Even in pouring rain...!!`
`"......No.`
` The cousins left before I did, so Maria was alone...!`
` Unless someone told her to stop, she'd stay there even if it started raining spears!`
` Without even opening an umbrella!!`
` .........Aaah, how could I have lost control of my emotions and done such a thing?!!"`
`Even though she'd known about Maria's simple honesty better than anyone, she'd once again lost control of her emotions and done something terrible!!`
`'!s0`
`Rosa pushed Genji away and ran down the hall.`
`The outside really looked like a typhoon, and the rain was pouring down spectacularly.`
`Maybe because of some aspect of the terrain, the winds weren't typhoon-class, so an umbrella wouldn't be torn out of one's hands.`
`Even so, it certainly was a windy rain.`
`There was no time to admire the roses being drenched.`
`"Anyway, I'm getting pretty worried about Maria.`
` .........You don't think she's still rebelliously searching for that rose alone, do you?"`
`"...I wonder.`
` Surely she wouldn't do it in this rain...`
`or at least, I wish I could believe that, but Maria-chan sometimes gets really stubborn and intensely straightforward."`
`We hadn't worried much, thinking that Aunt Rosa had taken her back to the mansion.`
`...However, when Kanon-kun had come from the mansion to call us and thought Maria was here, we got a little worried.`
`".........I did not see her in the mansion, so I was sure she was here.`
` After all, Rosa-sama was taking a nap..."`
`"You didn't see her on your way over here?"`
`".........My apologies.`
` I opened my umbrella and ran as fast as I could, so I did not pay much attention."`
`If he had cut through the rose garden, taking the shortest line between the mansion and the guesthouse, then he would've just barely missed the place where Maria had been looking for her rose.`
`And it was raining this hard, too.`
`It certainly would've been possible for Kanon-kun to fail to notice her.`
`"Instead of arguing around here, it'd be faster to just check it out directly.`
` ......Aniki, why don't we race over there?"`
`"Oh, do you think you can beat me now that you've been growing for six years?`
` Okay, let's settle this.`
` ............Go!!"`
`George-aniki and I flew out into the rain.`
`Jessica and Kanon-kun followed us.`
`"Mariaaa!!`
` If you're there, answer me!!`
` Mariaaa!!"`
`"It's Aunt Rosa.`
` Hey, Aunt Rosa!!"`
`When George-aniki called back, Aunt Rosa jumped at him and grabbed onto him.`
`"Where's Maria?!`
` Isn't she with you?!"`
`"No, we didn't meet with Maria-chan after that."`
`'!s0`
`'!sd`
`She was a cute and pure kid who'd just accept whatever anyone said.`
`...But six years have passed since then!`
`She's nine now, and experiencing the ups and downs of life should've taught her something.`
`......But Maria, are you telling me you're still as innocent and pure as you used to be...?!`
`"Mariaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`As I circled the rose bed, something white unexpectedly turned to face me.`
`......It was a white umbrella.`
`Maria was crouching down, holding a white umbrella and still searching for that rose...`
`"............Uu-."`
`Her face, which had turned bright red from her crying her eyes out, was dirtied with water and mud.`
` It was a truly pitiful sight.`
`"Maria,`
` ......are you still looking?!"`
`"......Uu-......`
` Can't find it...`
` Can't find...`
`...my rose......`
` ...Uu-......"`
`Maria had probably been here since the rain started pouring down.`
`Her shoulders were freezing.`
`She looked tired to the bone, but fortunately, since she was holding an umbrella, she wasn't completely soaked.`
`...The umbrella probably came from the handbag Maria always carried around.`
`......Thank goodness.`
` Seriously, thank goodness.`
`"Battler-kun!`
` Thank goodness, you found her!"`
`"Mariaaaaaaaaa!!`
` I'm sorry, I'm so sorry...!!"`
`Aunt Rosa threw her umbrella aside and hugged Maria.`
`"......Uu-.........`
` It's not here.`
` ...My rose isn't here...`
` ......Uu-......"`
`"I'll look for it with you later...`
` Okay?`
` So just put it on hold for today.`
` ...Okay?"`
`".........Uu-...`
` Put it on hold for today......"`
`It looked like Maria still wasn't able to accept it, but she no longer had enough energy left to resist.`
`Jessica and Kanon-kun caught up with us.`
`"......I'll have a towel ready in the mansion immediately."`
`"Maria, `
` ...were you here this whole time......?"`
`"I'm sorry......`
` I'm sorry for being such a bad mother........."`
`"......Aunt Rosa, why don't we head back to the mansion for the time being?`
` If we stay here, Maria will catch a cold."`
`".........You're right.`
` Maria, let's go.`
` If we don't get you cleaned up, Grandfather will be mad."`
`"Uu-...`
` Hungry."`
`"It's already time to eat.`
` You did a good job holding out, Maria.`
` Once the weather gets better, we'll all go search together."`
`We couldn't stay in the rain forever.`
`We took Maria with us as we headed back to the mansion.`
`Maria apparently wasn't as worn out as I'd thought.`
`When she remembered we were having calf steak for dinner, she started chanting "I'm hungry, I'm hungry, uu-uu-!", and returned to her usual spirited self.`
`......Aunt Rosa didn't chide Maria for saying 'uu-uu-'.`
`"I see.`
` So she had an umbrella on her.`
` Maria sure is good at packing the right stuff."`
`"......Uu-.`
` I didn't bring an umbrella.`
` Uu-."`
`"What? Then how did you get that white umbrella you're holding?"`
`"Uu-!`
` I borrowed it!"`
`Some caring person must have brought her an umbrella.`
`A normal kid would look for shelter once it started raining, but Maria was too stubborn to give up so easily.`
`...So, maybe that caring person gave up on telling Maria to find shelter, then decided to at least give her an umbrella.`
`"I see.`
` I'll have to thank that person.`
` Who was it?"`
`"Uu-!`
` Beatrice!"`
`The name Maria cheerfully mentioned...was that of the island's witch.`
`Rosa took a deep breath and asked again, trying to do so in a way that wouldn't damage Maria's good mood.`
`"Really? That's wonderful.`
` So, who was it?`
` Who brought you that umbrella?"`
`"Uu-.`
` Beat-`
`ri-ce-!`
` Uu-uu-!"`
`Maria immediately realized that her mother didn't believe her and started crying out unhappily again.`
`So Rosa stopped pursuing the subject.`
`It'd probably be faster to ask whoever lent Maria the umbrella during dinner, rather than ask Maria herself...`
`"Father,`
` please at least join us for dinner.`
` It won't be a family conference otherwise."`
`Along with a dull pounding on the door, the sound of Krauss's entreaty could be heard.`
`However, that voice seemed to be resigned to the fact that nothing it said would be heard.`
`".........Kinzo-san,`
` won't you at least come out for dinner?`
` All your children have gathered here to see your face, haven't they?"`
`"Silence, Nanjo.`
` ............So, the bishop won't work.`
` ...............One move too short......"`
`Apparently, Kinzo was completely focused on the final battle of his long-lasting chess match with Nanjo.`
`Kinzo's brow was wrinkled as he continued to glare at the game board through his spectacles.`
` Krauss's voice didn't reach his ears.`
`".........Kinzo-san,`
` I'm hungry myself.`
` Why don't we go down and eat?"`
`"Go by yourself if that's what you want.`
` Let me consider this next move for a little longer.`
` ...We are going to finish it tonight.`
` ............Otherwise, it's doubtful we'll finish before the world ends."`
`Nanjo rose from his seat, hoping this would prompt Kinzo do the same, but Kinzo's eyes never left the chessboard.`
`He knew well that Kinzo always displayed a blind concentration when it came to chess,`
` but he'd never seen Kinzo concentrate as hard as this.`
`...It was almost as though Kinzo was telling the truth, and there would never be another chance for them to continue their contest if they didn't finish tonight...`
`It seemed that, no matter how obstinately he called out to Kinzo, it wouldn't reach the latter's heart.`
`Nanjo gave up and headed to the door that Krauss was still banging on...`
`The door to the study opened.`
`Krauss was taken aback, thinking that maybe Kinzo was actually coming out.`
`However, Nanjo was the one who appeared, and Krauss let out a sigh of relief.`
`"......Doctor Nanjo,`
` is Father..."`
`"......I'm sorry I couldn't be of service...`
` ...Right now, this room is Kinzo-san's whole world."`
`Nanjo shook his head with a completely defeated expression.`
`Krauss raised his fist once more and banged on the door, shouting.`
`"......Father, can you hear me?!`
` We're heading down now, but please join us any time you feel like it.`
` All of your children are waiting for you...!"`
`His voice was very loud, and he was making a racket pounding on the door.`
`There was no way it wouldn't reach Kinzo's ears.`
`............Well, it certainly was reaching him.`
`But he ignored it anyway.`
`However, unlike the time he'd been called down for lunch, he didn't fly into a rage.`
`......By now, Kinzo was calm at heart, ...almost as though he had taken on a philosophical view and turned himself over to fate.`
`"Neither dinner nor the faces of my children interest me in the slightest.`
` ......I will only leave here if Beatrice is resurrected, or if I am chosen as a sacrifice for the key.`
` The Demons' Roulette has already started spinning.`
` What meaning does dinner have at this point......?"`
`As though the painfully loud banging on the door completely failed to enter his hearing...`
`...Kinzo silently thought about his next chess move, still in his philosophical state...`
`Just as always, Kinzo's figure couldn't be seen anywhere in the dining hall.`
`Krauss, wearing a bitter smile, returned with Nanjo.`
`"Father says he still is not feeling well.`
` He truly regrets missing this once-a-year opportunity to sit together with his gathered family."`
`Eva and Rudolf sniggered.`
`Given Kinzo's personality, there was no way he'd show signs of regret,`
` ...and none of his relatives showed any regret at his absence.`
`"Then why don't we start dinner?`
` Gohda, begin."`
`"Certainly.`
` Well then, if you will allow me..."`
`When Gohda was told to start the family conference dinner, his biggest time to shine of the whole year, he nodded with a broad grin.`
`"......Umm, may I ask who lent Maria an umbrella?"`
`When Rosa timidly cut through the silence of the dining hall, everyone noticed.`
`"...An umbrella?`
` What's this about?"`
`"Umm,`
` ...a short while back, Maria was in the rose garden when it started raining, `
` and she apparently borrowed a white umbrella from someone. I wanted to thank them..."`
`"It wasn't one of us.`
` After you left, we moved to a different room and had a 'friendly' chat that whole time."`
`"Haha, ...that's right.`
` Even after that, the siblings had a real friendly chat."`
`The word 'friendly' fell awkwardly from Hideyoshi's lips,`
` so even those who hadn't been present could tell the conversation hadn't been a pleasant one.`
`"At the very least, it couldn't have been me, Eva, Rudolf, Hideyoshi-san or Kyrie-san."`
`"We were together the whole time, even after Natsuhi nee-san and Rosa-san left.`
` The whole time until the meal started."`
`"Nii-san went up to the study with Genji-san to call Father.`
` At that time, the rest of us went straight to the dining hall.`
` So it wasn't one of us.`
` ...Couldn't it have been a servant kind enough to lend an umbrella?"`
`"So, was it you, Gohda-san?"`
`"...I have been in the kitchen the whole time preparing.`
` My sincere apologies..."`
`Gohda looked slightly disappointed about missing this chance to show off.`
`At that time, Shannon and Kumasawa appeared, pushing a serving cart loaded with hors d'oeuvres.`
`"Then what about Kumasawa-san or Shannon-chan?"`
`"...Yes?`
` H-Has something gone wrong...?"`
`Because Shannon had come in partway, she shrank back, mistakenly thinking that the others were searching for the one responsible for some error.`
`"It isn't like that.`
` It started to rain when Maria-chan was alone in the rose garden.`
` After that, someone lent her an umbrella.`
` Aunt Rosa said she wanted to thank that person."`
`"......Uu-.`
` ......Beatrice..."`
`Maria, her mouth a thin line, said the witch's name in a small voice.`
`Aunt Rosa explained the situation one more time.`
`As she did, Kumasawa-san cackled.`
`"Hohohoh.`
` It wasn't us.`
` Shannon-san and I were preparing the rooms together, so we did not go outside."`
`"...Yes.`
` ......I'm sorry I wasn't able to be of assistance......"`
`"Preparing the rooms?`
` ...What do you mean by that?"`
`"...............Because of the rain,`
` we thought it would be troublesome for all of the guests to return to the guesthouse,`
` so the servants were ordered to prepare the guest rooms inside the mansion."`
`"...Really? How thoughtful.`
` Yes, it certainly would be rude to chase us outside in this rain."`
`"Could you give it a rest..."`
`"Yes.`
` After receiving the order from Madam, ...Kumasawa-san, Kanon-kun and I started preparing the rooms.`
` ...Then it became time for dinner, so Genji-sama ordered Kanon-kun to go to the guesthouse and summon the children."`
`"Yes.`
` So, did Kanon-san find Maria on the way to the guesthouse and hand her the umbrella?"`
`"......Uu-.`
` Wroooong!!"`
`The person who had actually received the umbrella denied it.`
`Rosa was troubled.`
`All she wanted to do was give a word of thanks to the person who had lent the umbrella, but she couldn't find them.`
`And she'd thought asking like this with everyone gathered for dinner would work immediately...`
`"...Then, was it you, Natsuhi nee-san?"`
`"I'm sorry.`
` After everyone's 'friendly' chat, my headache was so bad that I have been resting in my room.`
` Therefore, I did not go outside."`
`".........Then who was it?`
` George-kun and the kids?`
` ......That can't be right."`
`"No, it wasn't us.`
` We were watching television in the guesthouse the whole time."`
`"Actually, we thought Maria had just gone back to the mansion with you..."`
`"Then Kanon-kun came, and he asked whether Maria was with us. That's when we first realized she wasn't in the mansion.`
` I mean, if it were me, I'd have grabbed her hand and pulled her under a roof before giving her an umbrella."`
`Rosa was completely baffled.`
`One by one, the relatives and the servants denied that they had done it.`
`...Even though it really wasn't something anyone would need to hide.`
`So, by process of elimination, the number of remaining candidates wasn't large.`
`"Of course, it wasn't me.`
` Right after it began raining, I visited Kinzo-san's room, and I was playing chess with him until just now."`
`"......Which means that it also wasn't Grandfather."`
`"Wait a sec...`
` Isn't this starting to get a bit weird?`
` Who's left?"`
`"Then, ...who was it?`
` ...Genji-san?`
` Huh?`
` Um, wait a second, don't get me wrong.`
` It's not like I'm searching for some culprit or anything.`
` All I want to do is, as a mother, thank the person who gave Maria an umbrella in the middle of the rain......!"`
`...Giving an umbrella to a girl loitering in the rain was something to be praised, not hidden.`
`...Despite that, no one raised their hand.`
`......Why not?`
`Everyone started whispering about how strange this was getting...`
`"......Calm down, Rosa.`
` Why don't we just ask the person who was lent the umbrella?"`
`That's what everyone had been thinking since the beginning.`
`They were all scratching their heads at why she didn't just ask Maria, who had been given the umbrella.`
`However, Rosa bit her lower lip.`
`After all, she already knew how Maria would answer if asked.`
`"Of course!`
` Rudolf-kun here's got it right.`
` Maria-chan, tell your uncle!`
` Who lent you the umbrella?"`
`"Beatrice!"`
`The dining hall was wrapped in silence for an instant, but it was soon interrupted by a burst of laughter.`
`"Hahahaha.`
` I see, so Beatrice, the witch of the forest, felt pity and lent her an umbrella.`
` What a lovely story.`
` Rosa, there you have it."`
`"......Nng,`
` ............nnnggg."`
`Rosa couldn't believe it.`
`...Even though she just wanted to say thanks for the umbrella, why did everything have to be so clouded in smoke...?`
`"Uu-!`
` Just like Uncle Krauss said.`
` Beatrice let me borrow it!`
` Uu-uu-!"`
`"Hahahahaha...`
` Isn't that wonderful?`
` We should all be jealous of such purity.`
` What do you think, everyone?`
` Hahahaha..."`
`Krauss was laughing with a face that was clearly mocking, `
`but Maria was overjoyed, apparently convinced that her claim was being believed.`
`"......How did that work?`
` Does that mean a witch really appeared and lent her an umbrella?"`
`Jessica asked me in a small voice that wouldn't carry over to Maria, who was sitting across from me.`
`"Has Maria ever been the type to make jokes?"`
`If we'd heard that kind of story pop out of my old bastard's mouth, we would've just taken it as another joke.`
`......However, it was hard to explain it away like that when Maria said it.`
` This was getting pretty unnerving...`
`"No way.`
` She's always been frank and serious.`
` She's the sort who'd believe any joke, even ones normal people could instantly tell were lies.`
` I've never even heard of her cracking a joke."`
`Aunt Rosa probably knew that better than anyone.`
`It appeared that because of this weird situation, she had no idea what was going on anymore.`
`"So, if Maria says she borrowed an umbrella from Beatrice, that must mean it really was Beatrice?"`
`".........We're talking about Maria here, so I can't think of it as some kind of metaphor or joke.`
` ...It might be best to take what she says at face value."`
`"Then what's going on?`
` Are you saying Genji-san or someone put on that fancy dress from the portrait and gave Maria the umbrella?"`
`"...I'm not sure about that...`
` Actually, that's what I want to know."`
`Jessica shrugged jokingly, but her expression didn't completely match her attitude.`
`Once the hors d'oeuvres were set out and Gohda showed off his vast store of knowledge, the meal began.`
`A couple casual chats broke out here and there, but they seemed somehow distant,`
` and the meal ended up being so quiet that you couldn't ignore the sound of the rain sneaking into the dining hall.`
`Kumasawa and Shannon, pushing the serving cart, ran into Genji and Kanon on their way to the kitchen.`
`"...Oh, it's Genji-san. Did you lend Maria-san an umbrella?"`
`".........An umbrella?`
` What are you talking about?"`
`"Well,`
` ......I heard that when it started raining, Maria-sama was alone in the rose garden.`
` ...It seems she borrowed an umbrella from someone there,`
` but we don't know who it was."`
`"It wasn't me.`
` After all, I actually thought Maria-sama was in the guesthouse.`
` When Battler-sama first found her, she was already holding a white umbrella."`
`"My apologies, but it was not me either..."`
`'!s1`
`...the Master?"`
`Both in the dining hall and right here, everyone had stated that they hadn't done it.`
`...That left only Kinzo, but...`
`"Maybe he went walking down the corridor for some reason...when he just happened to see Maria-sama in the rose garden without even an umbrella..."`
`"............The Master...`
`is not particularly fond of Maria-sama."`
`"I agree.`
` ............I can't imagine that, for Maria-sama's sake, he'd go to all of the trouble of descending the stairs with an umbrella."`
`"Oh my, ......how troublesome.`
` Does that mean the one who lent Maria-sama an umbrella really was Beatrice-sama?`
` Hohohohoh..."`
`Kumasawa laughed, just like the relatives in the dining hall who had laughed it off.`
`......She couldn't think of any other way to break through the smoke veiling the current situation.`
`Just then, the crisp sound of hands clapping twice rang through the hallway.`
`They all turned around at once to see Gohda coming out of the dining hall.`
`"Okay, everyone.`
` When serving a dinner, proper timing while setting the table is essential.`
` Please immediately see to setting out the soup.`
` Genji-san, the women are in the middle of an important job, so please don't get in their way."`
`"....................."`
`Kanon glared at Gohda for being rude to Genji, a person Kanon respected.`
`Genji, realizing this, patted Kanon once on the shoulder as a warning.`
`Kanon reluctantly turned away and returned his expression to normal.`
`"......Obey Gohda's instructions.`
` Hurry and prepare the dinner table."`
`"Come now, there's no time.`
` Don't dawdle!`
` Hurry...!"`
`Gohda grabbed the serving cart from Shannon and steadily pushed it towards the kitchen.`
`"...Then please allow us to return to the kitchen.`
` ...After all, Gohda-san's temper is very short, ...hohohoh."`
`"P-Please excuse me as well..."`
`Kumasawa and Shannon left.`
`Only Genji and Kanon remained.`
`Through the window, the darkness of the rainy night could be seen, along with the occasional thunderbolt.`
`"............Genji-sama,`
` did Beatrice-sama...`
`...really return?"`
`".........I don't know."`
`"...Shall I inform the Master?"`
`"That is not necessary.`
` .........If she truly has returned, she will eventually appear before the Master of her own accord.`
` .........Furthermore, she is a fickle person.`
` It would be pointless to report to the Master only to find that she does not appear..."`
`"...............I wonder if this means the Master's ceremony has already begun."`
`"...Probably.`
` However, that has nothing to do with furniture like us.`
` ......We must continue to return the favor we received from the Master...until our final moments."`
`"......Yes.`
` ...That is furniture's...`
`...duty."`
`The thunder crashed once more.`
`Except for those instants when lightning lit up the sky, nothing could be seen out the window but the darkness of night.`
`Just as humans rule when the sun is up, those that are not human rule when the sun is down.`
`The darkness of night that now surrounded Rokkenjima was ruled by another Master, not the Ushiromiya family.`
`Did this Master take pity on Maria when she was alone and being pummeled by the rain in the rose garden, lending her an umbrella...?`
`Kanon looked at the rose garden's lights, dimly visible beyond the window.`
`The dim lights weren't enough to illuminate the surrounding area.`
`Looking at those lights felt like making eye contact with the witch, and Kanon forced himself to avert his gaze.`
`...If he didn't, it felt like his eyes would be absorbed by that light......`
`Can the weather change how people act?`
`You often hear stories about how things like atmospheric pressure can influence people's moods and physical health.`
`For some time now, everyone had been struggling to clear the gloomy atmosphere,`
` but any conversation was quickly cut off, and in the end, the dining hall was simply filled by the sound of the rain.`
`Dessert was some kind of chocolate cake accompanied by pear sherbet.`
`Gohda-san enthusiastically explained the recipe as soon as this final dish was presented,`
` but I quickly forgot the details.`
`The guest of honor, Grandfather, was absent, the weather was horrible, and the identity of the one who'd lent Maria an umbrella remained a mystery.`
`When dinner ended, no one felt even one bit refreshed.`
`...It was too late now, but I realized painfully that taste wasn't the only important part of a meal. The whole atmosphere was also critical.`
`Gohda-san, the supposed conductor of this musical piece called dinner, did his best to enliven the place, `
`dropping little jokes left and right, but apparently not one of them succeeded.`
`After taking orders for after-dinner coffee, tea, and orange juice, he left for the kitchen.`
`As soon as he disappeared, Uncle Krauss spoke.`
`"......My, my.`
` What a waste that the dinner Gohda worked so hard to create has met with such a gloomy atmosphere."`
`".........Yes, absolutely.`
` It just feels like nothing would taste good today."`
`"Hoh.`
` I'd like to know why you feel that way.`
` Later on, I'll do all I can as your older brother to help cheer you up."`
`Aunt Eva grimaced slightly.`
`...I'd already heard she wasn't on good terms with Uncle Krauss, but it was pretty clear now.`
`When I looked around, I noticed that my father and Aunt Rosa were also grimacing.`
`Apparently, there was something besides the weather troubling all of them...`
`"......Both Aunt Eva and my Dad...`
`aren't looking too happy."`
`"Really?`
` I don't think so."`
`I asked Aunt Natsuhi, who was sitting on my right, ...but she seemed to be in a bad mood as well.`
`She snapped back as if to say she was absolutely not interested.`
`"Well, our adult conversation got a little complicated.`
` It isn't somethin' kids like you need to worry about, Battler-kun.`
` Hahahahaha,`
` isn't that right, Natsuhi-san, Kyrie-san?"`
`Uncle Hideyoshi laughed as he spoke, but without his usual brightness,`
` so I could vaguely imagine just how complicated their adult conversation had become.`
`On top of that, even Aunt Natsuhi and Kyrie-san, the people he had directed his comment to, ignored him as though they hadn't heard anything.`
`...I didn't know what kind of conversation they'd been having while us kids were away, `
`but it reminded me of how Dad said he had stomach cramps when we arrived at the mansion.`
`The family conference might've been a playful reunion to us kids, but it was definitely different for the adults...`
`After Uncle Hideyoshi's comment was ignored by the other adults and an awkward silence fell over the room, Kyrie-san spoke up.`
`"......We were talking about how the kids' careers would turn out.`
` Such as what lies in your future, Battler-kun.`
` Will you just drift on to college?`
` Wouldn't that be a little disheartening as a starting line for the long race of life?"`
`"Hey! Wait a sec...`
` Kyrie-san, if you start talking about something like that in the middle of a meal, it won't digest well and we'll all end up getting constipated."`
`"Wahahaha...!`
` That's right, that's right! We were talking about Battler-kun's and Jessica-chan's careers!`
` You've gotta think seriously about the future!`
` Wahahaha..."`
`Hideyoshi heartily agreed as if they really had been talking about that, but that was probably wrong.`
`Kyrie-san had been obviously trying to change the subject.`
`However, if Kyrie-san had determined that this was the best course of action for now, then she was probably right.`
`Taking this into account, I cast aside my suspicions as to the cause behind Aunt Eva and Dad's bad moods...`
`At long last, the serving cart returned, filled with coffee and tea.`
`Kumasawa-san and Shannon-chan served it to everyone.`
`Gohda-san then explained that this concluded tonight's meal.`
`If only the mood had been a bit more cheery, it might've been the best dinner in my life.`
`It was a shame this best of dinners couldn't have been had under the best conditions.`
`"Uu-!`
` George onii-chan, is dinner over now?`
` Over?"`
`"Yes.`
` With this, dinner is finished."`
`"Don't be rude.`
` Stay in your seat, and calmly drink up."`
`"...Uu-."`
`Maria looked like she was really excited by the occasionally crashing thunder.`
`Maybe she wanted to quickly finish eating and run over to the window.`
`She had been fidgeting for a while, waiting for the meal to end.`
`......Some people are afraid of thunder, while others find it interesting, and Maria was apparently one of the latter sort.`
`Therefore, when she heard from George-aniki that dinner was over, a huge smile broke across her face.`
`She then rose from her seat, took out her handbag--which she'd set under her seat, never having left it even while she was eating--and began fishing around inside of it.`
`No one seemed particularly concerned by this behavior...`
`'!s1`
`that?`
`'!sd@`
`George was the first to notice it.`
`As he spoke, Battler noticed too.`
`They saw that Maria was now holding a beautiful, Western-style envelope.`
`On the front of the envelope, the Ushiromiya family crest--the One-Winged Eagle--was done in gold leaf.`
`Furthermore, the fact that it was sealed with dark-red wax made it clear that this wasn't something Maria could have brought as a prank.`
`"......Maria-chan, what is that?"`
`It seemed that Natsuhi had also noticed the strangeness of the envelope Maria was holding.`
` Her voice sounded too serious for someone admonishing a small child, so the relatives around us finally noticed too.`
`"What happened, Natsuhi nee-san?"`
`".........What...`
`is that?"`
`"Maria,`
` ...where did you pick that up...?"`
`"That envelope has...`
`Kinzo-san's......"`
`When Nanjo muttered that, even us kids could understand why everyone seemed to be frozen solid.`
`The envelope that Maria held was one of the Ushiromiya Family Head's custom-made envelopes for private use.`
`......In other words, it could only mean one thing.`
`This envelope contained a message from Kinzo.`
`"Hoh......`
` ...What is an envelope like that doing here...?"`
`"......N-Now that's an interesting thing to come jumping out at us."`
`"......J-Just let me have a peek...!"`
`"Uu-!!`
` No way, I'll read it!`
` I was told to read it to everyone!!"`
`Uncle Hideyoshi tried to snatch the envelope out from Maria's hands, but she protected it as though hugging it and didn't let go.`
`"Hideyoshi-san, you can't use force against a child.`
` .........Maria-chan, where did you get this envelope?"`
`"Uu-!`
` I got it from Beatrice when she gave me the umbrella.`
` She told me to read it to everyone after the meal was over!`
`'!s1`
`Me-`
`Messenger>!`
`'!sd@`
`"<Messenger>...?`
` Ihihihi, the almighty witch of the island sure likes to mess around."`
`Battler tried to joke about it, but no one laughed.`
`"...............I-I wonder what's written inside of it. Maria-chan...?"`
`"Uu-.`
` Gonna read it!`
` Uu-!"`
`Maria casually opened the envelope.`
`...It was sealed only with wax, so she just had to remove the sealing wax to open it.`
`...That sealing wax fell onto the desk.`
`Hideyoshi hastily picked it up and stared fixedly at it.`
`He then set it in the center of the table, where Natsuhi, Kyrie, and Nanjo stared at it.`
`Imprinted in the sealing wax...was the One-Winged Eagle, which was the Ushiromiya family crest and also Kinzo's personal crest.`
`"......This...is the Family Head's personal crest..."`
`"......I know it from the letters I have received from Kinzo-san before.`
` Without a doubt, this is his wax seal."`
`"But aren't there several things in this mansion bearing that crest?`
` For example, if there was some kind of stamp for wax seals, couldn't someone other than Kinzo-san have used it?"`
`"No, Kinzo-san would always use a ring on his finger, his Proof of the Ushiromiya Family Headship, when he sealed the wax.`
` This shape and complex design is definitely Kinzo-san's seal..."`
`"That is not necessarily so.`
` Anyone in the family must have received a letter from Father at least once.`
` We can't eliminate the possibility that someone used that wax as a model to create a fake seal and pass themselves off as Father."`
`"I agree with Aniki.`
` No matter how much the seal resembles Dad's, we can't prove that it's the real thing.`
` So it doesn't prove this envelope came from him."`
`"I absolutely agree.`
` I cannot approve of arbitrarily deciding that this letter came from Father...based solely on the wax seal.`
` Doctor Nanjo, couldn't you use a bit more discretion with your vague words...?!"`
`"............I apologize...`
` It was not my place to speak..."`
`One after another, all of the siblings from Krauss on downwards rejected Nanjo's statement, saying that the envelope Maria held wasn't necessarily from Kinzo.`
`They were afraid.`
`They feared from the bottom of their hearts...`
`that Kinzo's intentions were written in there...`
`and that it might be some announcement regarding the inheritance that would be decidedly unfavorable to them.`
`"...Maria,`
` ...the person who gave you that envelope was the same person who lent you that umbrella, right...?"`
`"Uu-!"`
`"I don't know what 'uu-' means!`
` Is it true?!"`
`"Uu-...`
` ......Yes.`
` Uu-."`
`"So, in other words,`
` ...the witch,`
` Beatrice, gave Maria-chan that envelope along with the umbrella...?"`
`"Uu-!"`
`Maria nodded forcefully.`
`"...I-I agree with my husband.`
` It's a dubious letter handed over by some suspicious person.`
` It isn't even worth reading."`
`"There's nothing wrong with just reading it, right?"`
`Battler said it to Jessica in a small voice, trying to act tough, but Natsuhi heard him clearly and glared at him with threatening eyes.`
`"A-And then,`
` err,`
` ...Beatrice told you to read it after the meal was over, right, Maria?"`
`"Uu-!"`
`".........It's okay, everyone.`
` This envelope didn't come from Grandfather, but from Beatrice.`
` Regardless of who actually wrote it, why can't we just hear what's inside before we decide?"`
`"Th-That's right.`
` Even if Father didn't necessarily write it, I'd still like to know what's written inside.`
` ......Maria-chan, I'm sorry I tried to take it from you by force earlier!`
` I apologize, so will you read it aloud in front of everyone?"`
`"............Maria,`
` read it."`
`"Uu-."`
`As all the relatives stared fiercely at Maria, she spread the letter open with a rustle...`
`"......Do you think it really did come from Dad?"`
`"Impossible.`
` Whenever Father has announced something to us in the past, he would always send Genji if he didn't do it directly, correct?`
` ...I cannot believe that he would use such a joke-like approach."`
`"That's right.`
` Maria, a <Messenger>?`
` That definitely doesn't suit Father's tastes...`
` Rosa, could this be Maria-chan trying to surprise us by putting on some kind of show...?"`
`".........M-Maria isn't really a kid who'd be capable of something so thoughtful."`
`"Gonna read it.`
` Uu-."`
`The words came out of Maria's mouth, but for some reason, her voice seemed different than usual.`
`Everyone went suddenly silent...`
`"Welcome to Rokkenjima, members of the Ushiromiya family.`
` I am Beatrice, the alchemist for this family employed by Kinzo-sama himself."`
`".........Hah, that's crazy...!"`
`"Quiet!"`
`"I have served him for many years in accordance with our contract, but on this day, Kinzo-sama has announced the final suspension of that contract.`
` Therefore, I ask that you acknowledge my resignation from the position of family alchemist from this day forth."`
`"......How foolish... What nonsense...!"`
`"I-I can't stand to listen to it...!"`
`"And now, there is one part of the contract that must be explained to all present.`
` I, Beatrice, lent Kinzo-sama a vast quantity of gold under certain terms.`
` One of these terms specifies that all the gold is to be returned to me upon the termination of the contract.`
` Furthermore, I am to receive everything of the Ushiromiya family as interest."`
`"R-Ridiculous!!"`
`"...I-It's been ridiculous from the very beginning..."`
`"So it's basically one of those things, right?`
` Doesn't it sound just like one of those contracts with the devil?`
` The contract has expired, so they've come to collect the interest.`
` Is she trying to grab some retirement money for her old age or something?`
` What a cheeky witch."`
`"Battler-kun, now isn't the time to joke around..."`
`Battler made a face as if to ask, "If I can't make fun of this, what can I make fun of?"`
`Some of the adults' faces were pale, while others looked dazed.`
`"After hearing this, you may feel as though Kinzo-sama has been savagely ruthless.`
` However, Kinzo-sama did append a special clause to the contract so that you would have a chance to preserve your wealth and honor.`
` If and only if that special clause is fulfilled, I will lose my rights to the gold and the interest for all eternity."`
`"......A special clause...?"`
`"Wh-What is it...?!"`
`"Special clause.`
` Beatrice retains the right to collect the gold and accumulated interest upon the termination of the contract.`
` However, if someone is able to discover the hidden gold of this contract, `
`Beatrice must abandon these rights for all time."`
`"......The collection of the interest will proceed shortly, but if any one of you fulfills the terms of this special clause, `
`I shall return everything, including the portion that has already been collected.`
` Furthermore, as the first step in this collection of Kinzo-sama's debt, I have taken possession of the Ushiromiya family 'Head's Ring', which signifies the passage of the Ushiromiya Family Headship from one individual to another.`
` I ask that you confirm this for yourselves by examining the imprint on the wax seal."`
`".........Are they trying to claim that ~ib~that's~ib~ the meaning behind this seal...?!`
` That Father would relinquish his ring is unthinkable...!"`
`Krauss stared at the sealing wax as if trying to burn a hole through it.`
`Eva and Rudolf were doing the same over his shoulder!`
`"C-Come to think of it, when we were playing chess, I did have a strange feeling that something was missing from Kinzo-san's finger........."`
`"Doctor Nanjo!`
` Don't say something so careless just because of a vague memory!"`
`"We can't prove its authenticity here.`
` Only by asking Father directly...can we determine whether he really handed over his ring and whether this letter tells the truth."`
`"Th-That's right.`
` It's just as Kyrie-san says..."`
`".........Do you really think...`
`...Kinzo-san will tell you...?`
` After all, that person's thoughts sometimes surpass the bounds of common sense..."`
`"No matter what happens, it's still nonsense...!`
` In the first place, the illusion of gold itself is one of Father's tricks.`
` I've already heard enough talk of that gold from the rest of you!"`
`"But this is the witch speaking, right?`
` About how the inheritance and all of the assets will be handed over to the one who finds the gold, right?`
` So, maybe Beatrice-sama is Father's legal advisor or in charge of his funds..."`
`"W-We can't possibly trust some strange person who entrusts such a suspicious paper to a child!"`
`"Aniki, ...we need you to be frank with us.`
` Is it possible Dad's assets are being managed by someone you don't know?!"`
`"N-No, that's impossible!`
` As the Family Head's representative, I control all of Father's assets!`
` It should be impossible for anyone to do as they please with them without me knowing it!"`
`"So, this must mean there are some assets you don't control, right, Krauss nii-san?"`
`"How foolish! Such assets could not possibly exist!"`
`"...............Oh, but there is such a thing.`
` An asset of Father's that you don't control."`
`"There is no way such a thing could exist!!"`
`"No, it does.`
` ............It's Father's...no, Beatrice's hidden gold!!"`
`"Let's keep it simple.`
` In short, Dad had some trusted confidante that Aniki doesn't even know about.`
` Furthermore, this person has always been in charge of watching and managing the gold.`
` Or, it could be some eccentric, rich person who offered him a loan with rules like a devil's contract."`
`"......Could it be that this confidante called Beatrice...is trying to test which of Kinzo's children is most worthy to be financed by her gold?"`
`Kyrie's question was one that all the siblings wanted answered.`
`Upon reflection, they realized that Kinzo's strange epitaph had hung in the hall beneath the witch's portrait for quite some time,`
` and while it had long been whispered that whoever solved the puzzle would receive everything, ......no one had ever clearly stated it.`
`It was just something that everyone had hoped might be true.`
`And right here, right now, the thing they'd hoped for had been clearly stated in Beatrice's letter!`
`It clearly specified that everything of the Ushiromiya family would be given to the one who found the gold.`
`"Kinzo-sama has already publicly displayed the location of the hidden gold within the epitaph under my portrait.`
` The rules apply equally to all who can read the epitaph.`
` If you discover the gold, I shall return everything to you.`
` Tonight, I ask that you enjoy your battle of wits with Kinzo-sama to the fullest.`
` I sincerely pray that this night will be both intellectual and elegant.`
` --Beatrice the Golden."`
`"......Father, I know you can hear me!`
` Please respond!"`
`The door to Kinzo's study was being violently, harshly beaten against over and over again like a percussion instrument.`
`The yells coming from the other side belonged to Krauss, Rudolf, and sometimes Eva.`
`It was the siblings, who were trying to intrude upon Kinzo's study to question him about the truth behind that mysterious letter.`
`Kinzo was eating.`
`An elegant tablecloth was set over the desk, and the fabulous dinner that had adorned the table down in the dining hall was reproduced here.`
`Kinzo continued his meal in silence.`
`...Shannon, taking away an empty plate, looked uncomfortably between the door being pounded on and Kinzo's face.`
`"............Everyone is calling for you, `
`...but what should I do...?"`
`"...Leave them.`
` God and my meals both hold silence as a virtue."`
`"Should I silence them?"`
`"There's no need.`
` It does not even reach my ears."`
`Kinzo enjoyed his food, apparently indifferent.`
`Genji quietly lowered his head and took a single step back.`
`...As he did, Kanon, who stood in reserve like a shadow behind and to the side of Genji, opened his mouth.`
`".........Maria-sama apparently received a letter from Beatrice-sama, so I imagine they want to test its authenticity."`
`"...Hahahaha...`
` .........Has she started already then?`
` ............Come, Beatrice.`
` I have no shortage of coins to be wagered.`
` Shall we enjoy this night to the fullest?`
` ......I don't think I'll lose.`
` Your smile will be mine for all eternity.`
` If I could see it one more time, I wouldn't regret losing my wealth, my honor, or even my life."`
`"......Well then, the roulette has begun to spin.`
` Which pocket will the ball fall into?`
` Noir? Rouge?`
` Or house takes all?`
` Come, you may begin, Beatrice.`
` I'll show you the power of miracles once more...!"`
`The strange letter that the witch had entrusted to Maria wiped all memories of dinner from our minds.`
`Maria was repeatedly barraged with questions by Aunt Rosa and the other parents...`
`and became increasingly ill-tempered when they refused to believe her.`
`If we kids tried to butt in, they'd probably ignore us.`
`Our parents were all stirred up, firing back and forth about the gold and the distribution of the assets and completely forgetting that we were even there.`
`...I'd already guessed they'd been talking like this in the shadows,`
` but I hadn't thought they'd be so blunt.`
` It gave all of us kids a considerable shock.`
`...From what we could overhear, all the parents wanted more money as soon as possible.`
`Back and forth about Grandfather's inheritance.`
`Back and forth about the distribution of the gold if it was found.`
`About advance payments and cash.`
`......It was so despicable, I could hardly bear to watch, even though one of them was my father.`
`...It looked like Jessica felt the same way.`
`We left our seats without being asked to and went to hang out somewhere well away from our parents...`
`".........I get it.`
` Now I totally see why Grandfather hates coming down for meals.`
` I'm so disillusioned with our parents right now!`
` All that about money and the inheritance!`
` How can they act like that right out in the open?!"`
`"Well, I'm already completely disillusioned with my old bastard.`
` There's no way I could think any worse of him.`
` Ihihi!"`
`"Th-That's exactly the same for me!`
` Still, ...that freakin' shocked me.`
` Shocked me to the core..."`
`Jessica looked down at the floor, irritated.`
`...She was always talking about how bad her parents were, but maybe she hadn't really felt that way deep inside.`
`The depths of Jessica's shock made that clear.`
`"...You're all minors being supported by your parents, so you might not understand,`
` ......but getting money is neither a simple nor a pretty thing.`
` I won't try to force you to understand right now, since you're still kids.`
` ......But even so, I want you to realize that your parents are just doing their best in their own way."`
`"......Oh great,`
` George-aniki's gotten all mature."`
`"George nii-san, I know you're working hard as a full-fledged member of society,`
` ......but does that mean you turn into a shameless, greedy vulture like our parents whenever you start talking about money and assets...?"`
`".........If it were only for my own benefit, then no, I wouldn't want to do that.`
` However, when your family and your employees, your subordinates and their families are all counting on you, ...there are some times when you must fight."`
`".........I hate that kind of fight.`
` That back and forth about Grandfather's inheritance just makes me wanna puke."`
`Jessica pretended to spit violently.`
`...That harsh reaction made the depths of her pain very clear.`
`"...Let's stop talking about this.`
` All this about Grandfather's hidden gold, property and inheritance is our parents' problem, not ours."`
`"I agree.`
` ......At the very least, I think children have a duty to be considerate and stay out of their parents' way when they're talking together."`
`"......Tch.`
` ...Sounds pretty boring..."`
`Everyone knows the phrase "Adults are filthy", `
`...but we had now seen that for ourselves, and that really did give us a considerable shock.`
`George-aniki was now pretty much an adult, and I'd already been disillusioned with my dad, so the shock wasn't that big for us,`
` ......but Jessica seemed to be taking it hard.`
`Apparently, she'd received a bigger blow than I'd thought.`
`.........She always talks badly about her parents, but it looks like she hadn't changed at all on the inside.`
`...Even now, she's still a pure-hearted, delicate person who can't doubt others.`
`I'm sure she respected her parents as much as anyone else does.`
`......And then her parents started raging about, going 'Money money inheritance inheritance, my money!'`
` right in front of all of the other parents and the children. It's no surprise she received such a shock from hearing that...`
`"...Jessica-chan,`
` please don't start hating your mother and father.`
` ......I won't ask you to understand them, but at least don't hate them."`
`"I get it, just leave me alone for a bit...!!"`
`Six years ago, I would've kept taunting Jessica even after she got all dejected,`
` ......but I guess I really have grown over the last six years.`
`I realized it'd be better to leave Jessica alone right now...`
`Jessica suddenly looked away sulkily and left the parlor.`
`...She probably wanted to be alone for a while.`
`I could do nothing but wordlessly watch her back as she left...`
`"......Come to think of it, I wonder where Maria-chan went."`
`"She's probably pouting in front of the portrait."`
`Maria truly looked up to witches, and she'd expected that coming in direct contact with Beatrice and receiving the letter as proof...`
`would surprise everyone and make them happy.`
`However, the adults had doubted its authenticity, thoroughly bombarding Maria with questions and refusing to accept her story.`
`...Even for me, it wasn't hard to imagine how much that must've hurt Maria.`
`We couldn't speak to Maria or Jessica.`
`...In the end, George-aniki and I just abandoned ourselves to the sound of the falling rain in the dark night...`
`"I wonder what's happening with that typhoon.`
` ...Maybe there's something about it on the news."`
`George-aniki started walking over to the corner of the parlor where the television was.`
`He hadn't called me over, and I really couldn't have cared less where the typhoon was on the sea now.`
` So without going over to the television, I loitered around the window.`
`"......The wind hasn't picked up that much here, but I wonder if it's horrible over the sea.`
` I did hear about a severe storm warning on the weather report."`
`"Ah, Kyrie-san.`
` ...I take it those big talks between the adults are going smoothly, yeah?"`
`She seemed to catch the sarcasm.`
`Kyrie-san shrugged.`
`"...I wonder if that stomachache of a discussion will continue all night.`
` It's not going to be fun."`
`"Well then, please enjoy playing vultures to Grandfather's property as much as you'd like.`
` ...I feel sick."`
`"I'll agree with you on that.`
` If I could just slip away like you, I'd do it.`
` ...Unfortunately, I can't.`
` Even if I'm not allowed to speak.`
` We spouses have it pretty rough too."`
`Kyrie-san took a deep breath, smiling bitterly.`
`That's right.`
`They probably wouldn't let Kyrie-san speak, since she only married into the family.`
`Still, as Dad's partner, she's had no choice but to stay by his side and support him.`
`......She's probably had to bear the full brunt of this mental pressure much more than me.`
`I wasn't going to apologize, but realizing that I'd spoken too harshly, I cut the sarcasm for the time being...`
`"So how does it look?`
` Are they still stuck on the topic of the mysterious witch, Beatrice?"`
`"...More or less.`
` Those four siblings are always piling up secret agreements when they come together to discuss the division of Grandfather's inheritance.`
` ...They're saying that some unknown fifth person has appeared and is trying to make things even more complicated, and there's no way that'll make for a peaceful conversation.`
` Just when you think they're snarling at each other, they'll set up a common front.`
` ......Natsuhi nee-san's not the only one getting headaches."`
`On the one hand, they all want a larger portion than the other siblings, so they're all rivals,`
` but on the other hand, they don't want one yen to be snatched up by anyone other than the siblings, so they're also all allies.`
`I hadn't been told the details, but the siblings were apparently discussing how to protect their shares under various situations, `
`setting up ceasefire agreements and rules to prevent anyone from getting an unfair advantage, even preparing to resort to legal action if absolutely necessary.`
`......That they would go this far to preserve their shares...was so beyond disgusting that you just had to acknowledge their resilience...`
`"So, basically,`
` Beatrice is like an assassin sent by Grandfather.`
` ...He probably wanted to scare the hell out of his children for talking about the inheritance without him.`
` Ihihi!"`
`"Who is this Beatrice, I wonder?`
` If everything she claims is true, then she's a mystery figure that no one knew about until today, and she also knows about Grandfather's hidden gold.`
` On top of that, she was even entrusted with the Head's Ring.`
` ...She must truly have been trusted by him."`
`"Well, obviously I don't think she's a witch riding around on a broom,`
` ...but there's no doubt she's a mysterious person who's earned the right to be called a witch."`
`"If only Maria-chan would go into more detail about that.`
` ......Everyone's been smothering her, even though she's just a little girl.`
` They really scared her, and some things they might have asked now can't be asked.`
` I wonder if those people have ever even read 'The North Wind and the Sun'."`
`"What we do know is that Maria received a letter from a person who took the name Beatrice.`
` ......She sure is shy for a mystery person, entrusting Maria with a letter and hiding away even now, when she could've just appeared and talked to us directly.`
` Hahahahaha..."`
`"......Hey, Battler-kun.`
` Do you really think a person called Beatrice actually exists?"`
`"Who knows?`
` Doesn't it really seem like a false name?`
` Like she's Grandfather's representative, so she was given permission to take the name of the witch from his delusions?"`
`"No, that's not what I meant.`
` Right now, there's a total of 18 people here on Rokkenjima.`
` ......Do you think there's a 19th person?"`
`Are there really a full 18 people on this island right now?`
`Wondering about that, I began counting on my fingers, and it really did come out to that many.`
`"Do I think that a 19th person exists?`
` ......What exactly do you mean?"`
`"Just what I said.`
` ......The person who lent Maria that umbrella supposedly wasn't one of us 18.`
` So, isn't it natural to assume that a 19th person exists, and that this person lent Maria the umbrella?"`
`"............Well, ......yeah, it sure looks that way."`
`"Then, where exactly is this person now?`
` At the very least, she must've been on the island when it started raining.`
` And ever since that time, the weather has grown progressively worse, so taking a boat out would be pretty much impossible.`
` In that case, that person must still be on the island, hiding from the rain somewhere.`
` ......And without any of us spotting her."`
`".........True, we've all been randomly prowling around all over the mansion and the guesthouse, but no one has bumped into a 19th person.`
` ...But this island is huge.`
` There might be other places to take shelter from the rain, other than the mansion and the guesthouse."`
`At about this time, I began to realize what direction Kyrie-san's suspicions were taking us in.`
`Kyrie-san was denying that a 19th person existed.`
`......Beatrice was one of us 18.`
`...In other words, she thought someone we knew well was tricking us.`
`"If Beatrice is who she claims, she would surely be the most honored of guests.`
` The most honored of confidants, trusted by Grandfather.`
` ...There's no way Grandfather wouldn't give that kind of person a warm reception.`
` She would surely have been ushered into the mansion.`
` However, we haven't seen anyone like that."`
`"Wait a sec, isn't this line of reasoning a bit too hasty?`
` Sure, no one spotted this person, but that doesn't mean that you can deny the possibility that a 19th person exists, right?"`
`"Maybe, for some reason, they landed on the island stealthily and have been hiding ever since.`
` ......It's what they call a Devil's Proof.`
` It's easy to prove that something exists.`
` If this Beatrice appears in front of us all and says hi, then it's settled.`
` But it's impossible to prove that there's no 19th person."`
`"......Yes.`
` Battler-kun, your way of reasoning isn't bad.`
` In our current situation, there isn't enough information to either accept or deny that a 19th person exists.`
` ......But if you spin the chessboard around and think that way, we can deny the existence of a 19th person with near certainty."`
`'Spin the chessboard around' was one of Kyrie-san's favorite phrases.`
`...I've been influenced by those words and use them myself from time to time.`
`When you get stuck trying to find a move in chess or Shogi, then by spinning the board around and looking at everything from your opponent's standpoint, you can often see a strategy that'll give you the upper hand.`
`It means turning things around and putting yourself in your opponent's shoes.`
`"......You see?`
` Let's say that a 19th person called Beatrice actually exists.`
` That person must've managed, without being seen by anyone, to stealthily arrive on this island and remain hidden ever since.`
` Maybe they had some reason, okay?`
` In that case, why did they go to all of the trouble of appearing before Maria and handing her the letter?"`
`It really was a contradiction.`
`If they had some reason for hiding themselves,`
` then they should've stayed hidden the whole time.`
` But even so, they had appeared openly in front of Maria.`
`"Then...`
`...wait, Maria said it herself.`
` She said the witch made her a <Messenger>.`
` Maybe that's because Maria was the youngest and looked the most obedient..."`
`"Why would they need a messenger?`
` If they just wanted a letter delivered to the family conference, they could have mailed it.`
` If they mailed it to each of the four siblings, no one would be able to ignore it.`
` There was no need for this person to carry it themselves and secretly deliver it by hand."`
`'!s1`
`...that does sound pretty weird."`
`"In the first place, if Beatrice existed and wanted to make her presence known to everyone, then she could have just openly presented herself to all of us.`
` Despite that, she chose the vague method of appearing through a little girl called Maria-chan...and only gave us an vague impression of who she was.`
` Contradiction.`
` Let's go a little deeper, shall we?"`
`"......She appeared in front of Maria, trying to give us the impression that a 19th person existed, and yet,`
` she still hasn't appeared before us and is hiding somewhere at this very moment.`
` Think about those contradictions.`
` ......You've got to keep these things in mind when you spin the chessboard around."`
`"In short, if a person wants to leave us with the impression that Beatrice exists as the 19th person, what might their goal be?"`
`"......If this person wanted to hide, then they wouldn't have made their presence known.`
` And if they wanted to show themselves, they wouldn't have used the roundabout approach of entrusting someone with a letter.`
` ......Which means...?"`
`"It's simple.`
` Beatrice is one of the 18 people.`
` That's why they want to create the illusion that there are more than 18 people.`
` ...The 19th person was revealed so spectacularly.`
` If someone were to profit from this, it wouldn't be some 19th person in hiding.`
` It'd be one of the original 18 people.`
` ......Of course, this reasoning is full of holes.`
` If you turn over even a few of its premises, it'll simply fall apart.`
` But I'm almost completely certain it's correct."`
`...This is starting to feel pretty creepy.`
`Someone lent Maria the umbrella and handed her the letter.`
`Supposedly, none of the 18 did this.`
`And yet, Beatrice was hidden among those 18.`
`What was this person planning, hiding their true form and pretending to be Beatrice...?`
`"I suspected it might've been Maria-chan playacting, but the contents of the message were extremely complicated, and it's hard to imagine Maria-chan writing that herself.`
` ......However, I can't deny the possibility that Maria-chan is working together with someone."`
`"W-Wait a sec, ...Maria's a nine-year-old kid, right?!`
` What could she possibly be planning, and with whom?!`
` And what about her straightforward, overly-honest, obedient nature?!"`
`"Yes, I also understand what kind of a person Maria-chan is.`
` ......But that's exactly why I think it's possible.`
` That girl's a dreamer who can't help but look up to and blindly accept the existence of witches.`
` So if a person appeared in front of her and claimed to be the witch Beatrice, Maria-chan would happily swallow it up, I think."`
`".........So you're saying that if someone disguised themselves by wearing that fancy dress from the portrait, tricking Maria wouldn't be that hard?"`
`"Of course, with that reasoning, all of us women would become the primary suspects.`
` ...Anyway, who did Maria-chan encounter?`
` Learning the details of that question would be the best key to solving this riddle."`
`"...But this key has been firmly locked away inside Maria-chan's heart.`
` Everyone denied the existence of the witch without listening to her, barraging her too much with questions about who Beatrice actually was.`
` ...She probably won't open her heart to the adults now."`
`In the dim hall, in front of the portrait of Beatrice, ......Maria was sobbing.`
`"......Uu-...`
` Uu-.`
` ...No one believes I met Beatrice!`
` ......Uu-......`
` Uu-......`
` Even though I showed them the letter Beatrice gave, they still don't believe...!`
` .........Uu-......u,`
` ...u,`
` ......hic,`
` ...hic!"`
`"Anyway, Maria-chan's holding the key.`
` The key to whether Beatrice is one of the 18 people or a 19th person."`
`"...Maria's stubborn, right?`
` When that girl gets angry, it's pretty hard to make her feel better."`
`"Battler-kun, I think a kid like you would be better at cheering her up than an adult like me.`
` ...After she's feeling better, try asking.`
` ......I know you don't care about all this back and forth about the inheritance,`
` but don't you find this Western mansion mystery situation exciting?`
` Who in the world is this person who gave Maria-chan the letter?`
` ...It makes your intellectual curiosity ache."`
`"You're actually pretty tough, considering you're still excited after being dragged through that endless money talk...`
` Adults can be pretty amazing."`
`I shrugged exasperatedly.`
`...But I did notice something.`
`Kyrie noticed how dejected I was after overhearing our parents' turbulent discussion...`
`and was probably trying to clear the air.`
`...At the very least, I'd recovered enough to voice my complaints.`
`......She wasn't my real mother, so I've never felt like calling her Mom.`
`...But it did make me think 'she's a real adult'.`
`"Hey brats, so this is where you were.`
` Kyrie, you really took your time fixing your makeup, didn't you?`
` Think I'll make a habit of going out to touch up my makeup too."`
`"I'm sorry.`
` A woman's makeup takes a long time.`
` ......So?`
` How has the discussion been without me?"`
`"Hehehe, I'm sure everything was all peaceful and harmonious."`
`Kyrie-san poked the weak spot under my arm with her elbow.`
`"...We decided to take a break to cool our heads a little.`
` It looks like we'll be at it all night.`
` Makes me wanna cry."`
`His way of talking hadn't changed, but he couldn't completely hide his fatigue.`
`...I couldn't say I was sympathetic, but he looked pitiful compared to his normal, energetic self.`
`"Still, that rain's just awful.`
` I really don't wanna go back to the guesthouse.`
` It looks like Natsuhi nee-san set things up so we could spend the night here in the mansion.`
` What'll we do?"`
`"......We don't need to decide until you're done, right?`
` If you run so low on energy that you can't return to our room, then we can take them up on their offer."`
`"You're right.`
` We can think about it later.`
` ......What about you, Battler?"`
`"If I stayed, I'd just get in the way.`
` I'll be nice and go back over there."`
`".........I see.`
` Will you go back soon?"`
`"I dunno.`
` It'd be lonely to head back by myself.`
` I'll gather all the kids and we'll head out."`
`"Okay.`
` You go do that.`
` ............Also, Battler,`
` you won't be going to sleep that easily tonight, right?"`
`"Yeah, I'll probably be up talking with the cousins.`
` Sounds like we'll be up all night.`
` Is there a problem with that?"`
`"......I see.`
` If you're still awake when the adults' discussion is over, I want to have a little talk as a family."`
`"...A what?`
` That doesn't sound like you."`
`Apparently, Kyrie-san was thinking the same thing.`
`'What are you talking about?'`
` She asked him in a small voice.`
`...It looked like Kyrie-san didn't have a clue what Dad meant either.`
`"......I also want to talk to you about it, Kyrie.`
` ......I'll tell you later, so don't ask now.`
` Please."`
`"..................?"`
`I don't know anyone who neglects the concept of 'family' as much as this old bastard.`
`...And now he's saying we're gonna have a talk as a family.`
`......Both Kyrie-san and I couldn't help but get wide-eyed.`
`"Don't look so terrified.`
` I'm the one who should be terrified.`
` ............After all......"`
`At that point, he swallowed his words for an instant.`
`...Even though putting on airs of importance wasn't much like my dad.`
`"...You're freaking me out, Dad.`
` Everyone in our family's gathered here now, right?`
` Don't make a big deal out of it and spit it out."`
`'!s1`
`.........I will probably...`
`be killed."`
`There was a huge crash of thunder.`
`It must've been really close.`
`Dad's expression, brightly illuminated by the lightning, was burned into my eyes.`
`Dad's face, which always looked so sure of itself and which always wore a taunting expression,`
` ......was strangely frail in a way I couldn't really explain.`
`...It was so worn out that he looked like a different person.`
`"Wh-What...?!`
` ...What are you talking about?! That doesn't sound like you!"`
`"*giggle*`
` I agree.`
` What happened? You look so timid all of a sudden.`
` It's not like you."`
`".........I'm gonna go fix my makeup too.`
` Don't follow me."`
`Dad turned away, weakly.`
`After that, only Kyrie and I were left, still wide-eyed.`
`"What did he say......?`
` Tonight, he'll be killed?`
` You don't think that mysterious letter scared him, do you?`
` He's been watching too many serial murder movies."`
`"............Hmmmmmmmm."`
`Kyrie-san didn't answer my lighthearted words...and continued to stare at my dad's disappearing back...`
`"...Battler-kun, when you told Rudolf-san to spill the beans right away, he left without telling us anything.`
` Even though he said he had something to say to both of us, he didn't answer you.`
` Why?`
` ...Spin the chessboard around.`
` .........What do you see?"`
`"Well, when he said he wanted to talk but then couldn't, that's a contradiction.`
` ...What, can you see something by looking from Dad's perspective?"`
`"......*giggle*`
` Yes, I can see something.`
` He wants to talk about something.`
` However, he doesn't have the courage to bring it up.`
` So he actually means 'chase after me, talk to me, and ask me about it yourself.'`
` By saying 'Don't follow me', he actually means the opposite.`
` He actually means 'Follow me and force me to answer.'`
` ......Seriously, what a spoiled brat."`
`"Whaaaa-?!`
` Can you really call that reasoning?!`
` Th-That's ridiculous."`
`"Heheheh, can great private and police detectives deduce the emotions and feelings between men and women?`
` They can't, right?`
` Figuring out the feelings of the opposite sex is an even more advanced art than exposing the tricks in difficult crime cases.`
` If you ask me, romance novels have much deeper mysteries than masterpiece mystery novels."`
`"I-I see.`
` Is that how it is......"`
`"I'll stand alongside that spoiled brat.`
` ......He normally loves to bluff, but tonight, he's completely tired out from that heated discussion.`
` He probably wants someone to lean on at the moment.`
` And responding to that need is the role of his partner."`
`"Haah.`
` Sounds passionate.`
` Then I'll leave that old bastard in your hands."`
`"Yes, leave it to me."`
`I called out to Kyrie-san's departing back.`
`"......Huh?`
` What?"`
`"Um, I wanted to say thanks.`
` Thanks to you, my gloomy mood has cleared up a lot."`
`"That's good.`
` Communication is important."`
`After answering with a wink, Kyrie-san followed after Dad...`
`Natsuhi could be found in a dimly lit hallway.`
`Now and then, the thunder would crash, but this had no effect on Natsuhi's expression.`
`......She looked completely worn out.`
`The discussion that had just taken place between the relatives in the dining hall was repeating itself inside Natsuhi's mind...`
`Beatrice had proclaimed that in addition to the gold, all of the inheritance and property of the Ushiromiya family would be given to the person who could solve the riddle.`
`...In other words, she planned to undermine the absolute guarantee that Krauss, as the oldest brother, had to succeed the Family Head.`
`Originally, the other siblings had absolutely no chance to inherit the Headship.`
`To them, this 'proposal' by Beatrice was extremely desirable.`
`It was obvious that they would accept it.`
`...There was no need to play some clumsy detective game. Natsuhi knew that this so-called 19th person, Beatrice, couldn't exist.`
`Naturally, Beatrice was nothing more than a fictional character used to pass a message that Kinzo had written himself.`
`As proof, Kinzo had remained stubbornly neutral as to that letter's authenticity.`
`......He was completely ignoring these reckless claims that he shouldn't be able to ignore: that he had given up the Head's Ring.`
`............In short, Kinzo had wordlessly admitted that the letter held his own message.`
`Most likely, one of the servants had given Maria the letter.`
`Kinzo had probably worked out an elaborate plan where the dress from the portrait would be prepared,`
` ......and someone, probably Shannon, would be made to wear it and deliver the letter and the umbrella.`
`By doing that, he could make it seem like the witch from the portrait actually existed.`
`...No, if anything, that alone was proof that Kinzo was behind all this.`
`In that case, ......it was the same as Kinzo trying to butt in on the siblings' private discussion.`
`Then Kinzo, by announcing that he'd give everything to the person who solved the riddle, could weaken Krauss's overwhelming advantage.`
`.........Now it was certain.`
`Kinzo had eavesdropped on the siblings' discussion in the parlor earlier that day.`
`So he had known how Krauss had staved off the attack by the other three,`
` and to make the scales of the battle go back into balance, he had sent out this strange letter, which benefited Krauss's rivals.`
`He was trying to push this crazy theory so that Rosa, who had a weak position among the siblings because of her age, would join with Eva and Rudolf.`
` Then, with a three-to-one advantage, they'd be able overwhelm Krauss yet again and make their ridiculous theories get accepted by force.`
`...And by doing that, he gave them the power to resettle what had once been a nearly decided conflict.`
` They had now started repeatedly pressing Krauss to pay them a large amount of money...`
`Using the condition that all of the siblings would guarantee Krauss's position as the Successor, talk about advance payments was being brought up again despite having been rejected once.`
`Of course, even without the story about the hidden gold, the Ushiromiya family's store of wealth was vast.`
`That store of wealth alone was more than enough.`
`Even if the hidden gold was buried forever along with Kinzo's death, there would be more than enough to satisfy.`
`Therefore, even if they weren't that interested in the gold itself, `
`Kinzo had managed to instill the lifelong fear that, on the off-chance that someone found the gold, that person would be granted the Headship.`
`And this kind of Achilles' heel would definitely be taken advantage of by someone sooner or later.`
`The only person with this fatal weakness was the Successor, Krauss.`
`......The other siblings had found...`
`no, they had been told by Kinzo about something that only Krauss could lose, and they had thoroughly taken advantage of that.`
`...Natsuhi, as Krauss's only ally in his painful position and as his wife, wanted to fight alongside him.`
`She kept trying to explain to him that the existence of the gold itself was a farce and that there was no need for him to compromise.`
`Krauss had always told Natsuhi.`
`He had told all of the siblings.`
`He always, always said that the hidden gold was nothing more than an illusion created by Kinzo.`
`Therefore, Natsuhi had believed it as his wife, and had supported her husband on that foundation.`
`Even so, Natsuhi's words didn't reach Krauss.`
`...Even though Natsuhi had fought so hard and had lent all of her strength, he continued to fight by himself and was trying to compromise with the other three siblings...`
`Natsuhi sadly and weakly wondered why she could not be of use to him, then started getting angry.`
`It had happened when everyone decided to take a short break to cool their heads.`
`Natsuhi had flared up against Krauss.`
`Enraged, she had asked why she could not be useful to him.`
`......He had then told her that he wanted to talk about something...and invited her into a room that she was normally not allowed to enter.`
`That room had been sealed with a heavy-looking padlock, and just looking at it had given her an uncomfortable feeling...`
`"There's no need for you to worry about anything said by those three, or even this suspicious person who calls herself Beatrice!!`
` After all, the gold is just a ruse created by Father.`
` There's no way something like that could be found!!`
` Your position as the Successor is a solid fact.`
` What are you afraid of?!"`
`Krauss removed the padlock on the door.`
`He then motioned for Natsuhi to enter.`
`"Enter."`
`"...Wh-What is this?"`
`"There's something I want you to see.`
` ......I've never shown you this before."`
`Natsuhi timidly opened the door with a dubious expression on her face...`
`It was pitch black.`
`She searched for a switch to turn on the lights, but since this was her first time in the room, she didn't know where it was.`
`Krauss entered behind her, pushing her in, and when he closed the door before turning on the lights, the two were swallowed up by the darkness.`
`Only the sound of Krauss locking the door rang out through the dark.`
`"Wh-What are you doing...?`
` Th-The lights..."`
`"I am turning them on now.`
` Wait."`
`Just as he said, when Krauss pushed a switch on the wall, a flickering light turned on and lit up the room.`
`"...............Th-`
`That is......?"`
`Natsuhi had her breath taken away.`
`The room had no windows, and at a glance, it appeared to be empty.`
`In the middle of the room, a small, round table had been set, and the lights brightened only that table, as if it were the leading part in a play.`
`On top of the table, a red tablecloth of elaborate design had been set out, covered with dust,`
` ......and on top of that, 'something' about the size of a grown man's arm had been set down.`
`......That something took Natsuhi's breath away.`
`"It's a gold ingot of incredible purity.`
` Without this, no one would have believed in the Legend of the Gold."`
`It was an ingot of solid gold.`
`Even in the faint light, it sparkled with a noble and dignified glint...`
`"This is not a proper ingot.`
` I don't even know whether it was cast inside or outside the country."`
`It took a high level of skill to make the purest of solid gold ingots.`
`And in order to verify that purity, it was standard to have the original foundry and the name of the bank that guaranteed it imprinted on the gold.`
`...However, this ingot did not have that kind of seal.`
` .........This mysterious gold bar had come from an unknown foundry.`
`"Look here.`
` ............There's nothing to be afraid of.`
` It's just a bar of gold."`
`Natsuhi, following Krauss's words, timidly approached the ingot...`
`"Right there."`
`Krauss pointed at the surface of the ingot.`
`...Natsuhi concentrated on that section...`
`"...............!!"`
`Right there was the thin imprint of the One-Winged Eagle crest!`
` Natsuhi's breath was taken away once again.`
`"That's right.`
` This is the legendary ingot that Father said he received from the witch, that the president of Marusoo witnessed and was allowed to select at random to take back with him,`
` that gained the trust of the fixers in the business world.`
` I had to use all possible means to find it.`
` ......I found it before the other siblings could."`
`"...How could......`
` ...Then, `
`...the legend of Father's gold is......"`
`"It actually exists.`
` ...The gold that Ushiromiya Kinzo received from Beatrice actually exists."`
`"Impossible......!`
` ...S-So, it really does exist......"`
`Natsuhi was shocked...`
`Krauss had always said that Kinzo's gold was just a fabrication.`
`So she had believed it, as his wife.`
`However, the reality was different.`
`Since he held definite proof, he had been more certain than any of the other siblings that the Legend of the Gold was true.`
`Because of this, Krauss was deeply frightened at the possibility that someone other than himself would find the gold he'd failed to find, costing him everything.`
`......But to Natsuhi, this truth was more than enough to split open her heart.`
`She had thought that, as Krauss's wife, she should be his closest confidant, which was why she had selflessly supported him.`
`...And yet, he had hid this fact from her until today.`
` ......Why?`
`'!s1`
`Have I been...`
`so undeserving of your trust...?"`
`'!sd`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kla_1e340:`
`'!s1`
`Is that all a...`
`...a wife `
`means to you......?!"`
`"Calm down...`
` Becoming passionate easily is one of your bad habits."`
`"You're the one who's making me like that, aren't you?!!!`
` I've been supporting you as a wife ever since I married into this family...!`
` For your sake, I threw away the family I was born into, `
`and I've been offering up my heart and my body to serve you...!!`
` And in return, `
`...this is what I get......?!`
` How could...`
` ......How could you......?!!"`
`Krauss grimaced, looking annoyed...`
`His expression effectively communicated how much he disliked this part of Natsuhi, even if he didn't say it out loud...`
`"...It doesn't look like...`
`I will be of any use to you anymore......"`
`"Hmmm, that's fine.`
` ......I can resolve the troubles with the siblings by myself.`
` I don't need your help."`
`"That's wrong!!`
` This is the Ushiromiya family's problem!`
` It's true that I am not permitted to wear the family crest on my body!`
` But I am still your wife!!`
` Even so, ...are you saying I'm not capable of helping you...?!`
` Are you...?!!!"`
`"......I especially wouldn't want to risk getting you involved.`
` It would probably make your headaches even worse than they are now.`
` Take a rest for today.`
` The siblings will deal with the siblings' problems.`
` It has nothing to do with you.`
` That is all."`
`A dull headache tormented Natsuhi...`
`No matter what medicine she took, no matter what scents she burned, it wouldn't heal.`
`...In fact, simply wandering alone through the dark corridors and listening to the sound of the rain seemed to be a better cure...`
`......I may be Natsuhi, `
`...but I was never Ushiromiya Natsuhi.`
`I have been despised and treated as a borrowed womb...and insulted when I couldn't even fill that role...`
` Even so, I have tried to properly perform my duties as a wife, `
`...but now, even my husband has rejected me.`
`I've done my best raising my daughter, as if it were the last job left to me...`
`...However, I've had no release for my anger and sadness, and they've caused me to subconsciously strain that relationship too...`
`Because I've been excessively strict in Jessica's education, she dislikes me thoroughly.`
`She despises me for having no interest in anything but grades.`
`......There is no longer...`
`...anything I can do for the Ushiromiya family......`
`No, `
`...that's no good.`
`Despite it all, I must help my husband and beat back the schemes of the other greedy siblings.`
`The Family Head won't be around much longer.`
`Eventually, Krauss will succeed the Head.`
`And the next Successor will be Jessica.`
`......Strictly speaking, the man who enters the family by marrying Jessica will become the next Head, but it all comes to the same thing.`
`...I have to make Jessica an excellent Successor whom everyone will accept as worthy to take over the Ushiromiya family.`
`In the days to come, that greedy Ushiromiya Eva will probably be plotting to find some fault with the main family,`
` and if all goes as she plans, Jessica will be dragged down from the succession, with George set up in her place.`
`......It is regrettable, but George is a man, and even more, has matured as a person.`
`...Compared to Jessica, who is right in the middle of her rebellious period and whose grades are slightly below average, it can be seen at a glance who is more fit to succeed the Head.`
`So in order to secure Jessica's position, I need to turn her into an excellent person.`
`After doing that, ......I want to find her an excellent husband worthy of the excellent person she will have become.`
`......A wonderful man who will truly accept Jessica...and stay with her through all of life's joys and sorrows.`
`Was Natsuhi.........trying to entrust her daughter with fulfilling some desire of her own?`
`Natsuhi thought back to the days when she'd had no choice but to marry into the Ushiromiya family, because of that unavoidable fate...`
`She had tried to block that from her memory.`
`......She had consciously forgotten it...and had actively attended to the life she'd been given as Ushiromiya Natsuhi...`
`And in so doing, she had built up a new life.`
`......But...just now, `
`...it felt like all of that had been casually rejected.`
`"............`
`How should I think as I live my life?`
` ......I do not know."`
`Natsuhi helplessly rested her head against the glass of the window...`
`The glass, which was cool thanks to the raindrops beating against it, felt somehow refreshing. Even though it should have been emotionless, ...right then it seemed to be the only thing that could understand Natsuhi...`
`At that point, even if someone had appeared, Natsuhi didn't intend to pay any attention to them.`
`......But she did pay attention.`
`......Because it was her beloved daughter.`
`"......O-`
`Oh, it's you, Mom.`
` What the heck are you doing in a place like this?`
` Thought you were a ghost..."`
`Just like always, her words were rough and not at all like a girl's.`
`...Instinctively, words of rebuke rose to Natsuhi's throat.`
`......However, their strength gave out and they didn't escape her lips.`
`".........Jessica,`
` forgive me, but my headache is awful.`
` Please leave me be."`
`"......I see......"`
`Jessica was seeing her mother in a position of feebleness for the first time, so she was considerably disconcerted.`
`Until just now, she'd been filled with contempt for all of the parents, including her mother.`
`...But now, those feelings had been completely swept away.`
`......Her mother's utterly exhausted face had wiped them all out.`
`In its place, the words George had told her floated back up in her mind.`
`Our parents are doing their best in their own way.`
`...And because their families are counting on them, they can't afford to keep everything pleasant...and have a heavy responsibility to fight.`
`......Maybe her mother had been standing around in this dimly lit hallway...because no one had tried to understand that in her...`
`Jessica hated her mother.`
`...So, she had no intention of speaking kindly to Natsuhi just because she was looking a bit frail...`
`So when she attempted to speak kindly to her mother anyway, she had to clench her fists and gather up the words from deep in her heart.`
`"...I-It sounds like you've really got your hands full with that meeting thing..."`
`".........It has nothing to do with you.`
` Please go somewhere else."`
`"......Is your headache bad?`
` Sh-Should I go get some medicine...?"`
`"......You don't have to trouble yourself.`
` ...Please, leave me alone."`
`Natsuhi wasn't being cold.`
`...She just wanted her daughter to go far away so that she wouldn't have to bump against Natsuhi's own short temper.`
`......But there was no chance that Jessica would realize this.`
`"...............O-Okay."`
`Jessica hung her head, looking sad.`
`...Seeing that expression, Natsuhi recognized the kindness that Jessica was trying to muster.`
`She gave her head a small shake to drive away her own unkind feelings...`
`"Then I'll......leave.`
` ...I'll be with the other cousins, so I don't get in the way of the adults.`
` .........See you later..."`
`".........Wait there."`
`She called Jessica, who was trying to leave and looked lonely, to a stop.`
`"......What...?"`
`"......Thank you for being so considerate.`
` ......It isn't good of me to go to sleep and leave you alone."`
`"D-Don't talk like that, you'll bring bad luck..."`
`"...I've made you worried,`
` but I'm okay now.`
` ......I will go."`
`If I let my daughter see me this feeble any longer, I'll only make her feel more uneasy.`
`...With that thought in mind, Natsuhi left Jessica with words of gratitude and made to depart.`
`......This time, Jessica called out to her mother's back.`
`Natsuhi stopped and turned around, asking what business Jessica had with her.`
`But Jessica herself didn't know why she'd stopped her mother,`
` ...and for a while, she smiled wryly, muttering to herself as she hesitated over what to say.`
`She was poking around in her pocket when her hand touched something, and she took it out.`
`"U-Um, hey, Mom!`
` I, uh, was given a charm today.`
` What was it, a charm against magic?`
` Umm, err, ......I'm pretty sure that...you were supposed to hang it from your doorknob, I think.`
` Ahahaha, ...I forget...`
` There's no point in me having it, `
`...so I'll let you take it."`
`It was the scorpion charm that Maria had given her on the beach.`
`Although she'd heard of its various effects from Maria, Jessica's mind had gone blank, and she was just barely able to say even that much.`
`Jessica, thinking that her mother probably wouldn't accept it anyway, immediately drew back the hand she had stuck out, grasping the charm.`
`......So when Natsuhi came back to take it, she was extremely shocked...`
`"............What is this?`
` Some kind of prize toy...?"`
`"W-Well it's...I think it's something like that...`
` I guess you wouldn't really expect a charm that looks like a toy to do anything......"`
`But her mother took the charm from where she grasped it in her hand.`
`"Thank you.`
` I'll take good care of it.`
` ............Sometime soon, in exchange, why don't I give you a charm that was important to me when I was a child?"`
`"...I-It's not like that's why I gave it to you.`
` ......But, well, `
`......if you really say so..."`
`"Then I will rest for now.`
` My headache is awful.`
` .........Try not to stay up too late."`
`"Sure..."`
`Natsuhi put the charm in her pocket and turned away.`
`......She then disappeared into the dark hall...`
`"...It seems the weather will be like this all day tomorrow after all."`
`"Dang, this makes the good weather we had earlier feel like a lie."`
`George-aniki and I were killing time in front of the parlor television.`
`At that point, Jessica returned.`
`Her face was still blank, but it looked like she'd calmed down a little since we'd last seen her.`
`"......Is Maria still in front of the portrait?"`
`"Nope.`
` She just came back, and she's sleeping over there on the sofa.`
` It's getting pretty late for her, after all."`
`Looking at the clock, I saw it was a little past 10:00 PM.`
`...Even if we were planning to stay up all night, it was about time to head back to our room.`
`"Well, my Mom did have a room prepared for us in the mansion.`
` ...What'll we do?"`
`"I'd rather head back to the guesthouse.`
` ......Going by what we saw of our parents, I think it'd be better if we weren't in the mansion."`
`"I agree.`
` Feels like they're telling us kids to mind our own business and stay out of their way.`
` Let's be good little boys and girls and do that."`
`As we were talking about this, Aunt Rosa came into the parlor.`
`She was looking all over restlessly, probably trying to find Maria.`
`"Aunt Rosa, if you're looking for Maria, she's over there on the sofa."`
`"Thank you.`
` My, she's out cold.`
` ......We must move her to a bed."`
`"If you'd like, I'll carry her over to a bed."`
`"Thanks, that would be wonderful.`
` ......Are you all heading back to the guesthouse?`
` Or are you going to stay in the room Natsuhi nee-san had prepared here?"`
`"We were just talking about that.`
` We'd just decided to head over to the guesthouse."`
`"I see.`
` Then could I ask you to take Maria with you?`
` ...I'd feel much more reassured if she stays with all of you cousins."`
`Behind those words, she seemed to be concealing some regret that the adults, herself included, had deeply hurt Maria's feelings...`
`"Leave it to us, Aunt Rosa.`
` After all, we do have an expert at comforting Maria with us!"`
`"A-Are you talking about me?`
` I couldn't do it myself.`
` We'll need everyone together."`
`"That's right.`
` Battler, weren't you the one who hit it off with Maria when you were messing around earlier?"`
`As we said this, Aunt Rosa smiled, looking truly happy.`
`"Thank you, everyone.`
` ......It looks like our meeting will last until very late.`
` So while I'm sorry to burden you like this, I'll be counting on you all to take care of Maria."`
`"Hey, Maria, are you sound asleep...?`
` We're going back to the guesthouse."`
`Maria muttered something indistinct, rolled over, and fell back asleep.`
`......It looked like she was sleeping deeply.`
`"She's really out cold.`
` I'd hate to wake her."`
`"Right, I'll carry her."`
`Maria's body was much lighter than it looked.`
`I lifted her up and put her on George-aniki's back.`
`It was raining hard outside, and Aniki couldn't hold an umbrella and carry Maria at the same time.`
`It looked like Aunt Rosa would come with us as far as the guesthouse to help out.`
`However, when she heard Uncle Krauss's voice call out to her, she had no choice but to return.`
`"......Now that's a problem.`
` I have to go back now."`
`".........Is everyone returning to the guesthouse?"`
`After we left the hall on the way to the entrance, the door to the servant room opened and Shannon-chan stepped out.`
`"It has grown very dark, so allow me to guide you."`
`"That would be great, Shannon-chan.`
` George-kun is going to carry Maria there.`
` Could you hold an umbrella for him?"`
`"Yes, certainly."`
`Shannon-chan brought umbrellas for each of us and a flashlight to guide the way.`
`As we opened the front door, the downpour was quite terrific.`
`It looked like we wouldn't have any spare time to take a pleasant walk and enjoy the nighttime rose garden...`
`"Aniki, is she too heavy?`
` Want me to carry her?"`
`"It's okay.`
` I can at least carry Maria-chan."`
`"......I'm truly grateful.`
` Please take care of Maria."`
`"Sure, you got it.`
` Then I guess this is goodnight, Aunt Rosa."`
`"Then I will see them over there and return here."`
`"Yes, please..."`
`Aunt Rosa watched us leave.`
`"......Maria,`
` ......I'm sorry for everything..."`
`Rosa's mumbling voice didn't reach the person in question, nor any of the kids, but disappeared beneath the sound of the rain......`
`After cutting through the rainy rose garden, we arrived at the guesthouse.`
`"Ahh, if only I'd applied for the position of Maria-carrier!`
` Then I would've gotten a chance to have Shannon-chan's huge boobs rubbing all over my arm!"`
`"Th-Th-Th-That's not why I did it, it's a misunderstanding...!"`
`"I-I thought that if I didn't walk like this, George-sama would get all wet........."`
`"C'mon, quit babbling and go in!"`
`After being urged on by Jessica, we folded up our umbrellas and went into the guesthouse.`
`"Has anyone gotten their clothes wet?`
` I can bring some towels if you want..."`
`"You don't need to worry about us that much.`
` Thanks, Shannon-chan."`
`"Ah, that's right.`
` We were planning to play cards or something. Would you care to join us for a bit?"`
`"Huh?`
` Who had the night shift on today's schedule?"`
`"I believe we had a special schedule during the family conference.`
` Also, I think a few alterations have been made, so I will go and check......"`
`"Wait, if you have to go all the way back to the mansion to find out, don't force yourself."`
`"Oh, that's all right.`
` I can find out from the servant room in the guesthouse.`
` ...Please excuse me for a short while."`
`Shannon-chan gave a quick bow and went into the guesthouse servant room.`
`The rest of us headed for the cousins' room and decided to put Maria to bed for the time being.`
`Maria was sleeping very deeply, and there was absolutely no sign of her eyes opening...`
`For now, we'd get some soft drinks out of the room's refrigerator and drink those while playing cards or something...`
`"......Oh,`
` Kanon-kun?`
` And you're here too, Genji-sama.`
` ...What has happened with tonight's shift...?"`
`"............Krauss-sama has given an order.`
` He made some sizable changes to the shift schedule."`
`"......Indeed.`
` Gohda-san now has the night shift at the mansion.`
` Shannon and Kanon have the night shift in the guesthouse.`
` Kumasawa-san and I have been ordered to sleep in the guesthouse...`
` Just now, a phone call came, saying that once you arrived, you were also to remain here for the rest of the night."`
`"Huh...?`
` Th-That certainly is a sizable change...`
` The shifts at the guesthouse and the mansion have been completely reversed, haven't they...?"`
`Originally, Shannon and Kanon had been assigned the night shift in the mansion, while the night shift in the guesthouse, where all of the relatives were staying, had been assigned to Gohda, who had an abundance of experience in entertaining.`
`Kumasawa should have been sleeping at the guesthouse, while Genji should have been sleeping in the mansion.`
`However, it seemed that Krauss had suddenly ordered that the schedule be modified.`
`......The shifts at the guesthouse and the mansion had all been reversed, and Genji was spending the night in the guesthouse.`
`"............It's probably because of Beatrice-sama's letter."`
`"...Why probably?"`
`"...After such a mysterious letter appeared, it was only natural that Krauss-sama would suspect one of us.`
` .........We serve directly under the Master, so Krauss-sama tried as best he could to keep us far away from the family conference."`
`Genji, Shannon, and Kanon were all permitted to wear the Ushiromiya family crest, the 'One-Winged Eagle', as the servants who served directly under Kinzo.`
`Of course, since they were working for the Ushiromiya family, they had to obey anyone's orders, but their only boss was Kinzo.`
`Since only Kinzo held the right to employ them, even Krauss could not have them dismissed of his own accord.`
`Because of this, Krauss and the others often viewed these servants as Kinzo's underlings and shunned them.`
`And in fact, Kinzo seldom let anyone other than them enter his study.`
`This sudden shift change was probably a clear expression of the sense of mistrust that had caused.`
`Considering the time Kinzo had left to live, this would definitely be the last family conference before the problem of the inheritance came up.`
`On top of that, the mysterious letter that claimed to be from Beatrice had dropped in out of the blue.`
`Krauss definitely wanted to keep Kinzo's loyal subjects away from the table of such a delicate and important discussion...`

`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` Our guest tonight is `
`~ib~a special case~ib~`
`, after all."`
`'!sd`
`Genji nodded back, went behind a screen, took off his jacket, and slowly began to relax after a day's worth of tension...`
`".........The ones who just returned now, were they the children...?"`
`"Yes.`
` The other relatives are having a conference in the mansion.`
` It looked like it would drag on for quite some time..."`
`"......Then we've got it easy.`
` It's already this late, and there's this weather.`
` The rest of the relatives will probably spend the night in their rooms in the mansion."`
`"Yes, probably...`
` I'm only saying this because Genji-sama isn't around, `
`but I'm a little happy I was sent to the guesthouse......I guess..."`
`"Oh...?`
` Why's that?`
` Because you can stay away from Madam and Eva-sama, those bullies?`
` ...Or do you have another reason?"`
`"...I-It's not as though I have...`
`...a-another reason...!"`
`".........I see.`
` Then, let's do our best together with our night shift.`
` I'm counting on you, Nee-san."`
`"Ah, ......umm.........`
` Just now, I was asked to go to the children's room and play with them..."`
`Shannon hung her head apologetically, ...gazing at Kanon uncertainly.`
`Kanon didn't try to meet her eyes, and spoke curtly as he sighed.`
`It looked like he didn't plan on indulging his 'sister'.`
`"............You can't.`
` You were assigned to the night shift.`
` ...Besides which, it isn't necessary for furniture like us to respond to an invitation to play.`
` ...You understand, right?"`
`"Y-Yes, I do understand.`
` .........Nnnn."`
`Shannon's shoulders drooped slightly.`
`...She had already expected that Kanon, a stickler for rules, would say something like that, but she still seemed a little discouraged.`
`As Kanon flipped through a log book, he spoke without facing Shannon.`
`"............That means the children will be waiting for you.`
` You'll have to apologize and tell them you have the night shift and won't be able to stay with them.`
` ......Go and come back."`
`"Huh, .........ah, yes!`
` I'll go apologize and come back..."`
`Shannon hurriedly stood from her seat before her brother's mood could change and flew out of the servant room after giving a quick bow......`
`As he watched her go, Kanon took a single deep breath...`
`Genji's voice came from beyond the screen.`
`"......Kanon,`
` ......I will be here, so you can go too."`
`"Genji-sama, `
`......Shannon was the only one called.`
` It's not as though I was invited..."`
`"That is only because you were not there at the time.`
` If you had been, you would have been invited as well.`
` ......It is good to play as a child from time to time."`
`".........`
`...No, such a thing is not necessary for me.`
` ...Human children may have a need to play,`
` ...but we are...furniture."`
`"...............Is that so?"`
`"......Nee-san is also...`
`furniture.`
` ...Even if she pretends to be a person, `
`...it will only hurt her later.`
` ...I understand that, so I try not to get too close to people, that's all."`
`Genji did not say anything after that.`
`......After a while, he stood up and used a pot of hot water to make powdered cocoa, serving some to Kanon as well.`
`"Is that for real?!?!`
` I had no clue...!!"`
`"Dumbass, you're too loud!`
` You'll wake Maria up!"`
`Battler was so surprised that he yelled obnoxiously and scattered his cards everywhere.`
`His voice caused Maria to turn over once, but she soon fell back into a deep sleep...`
`Jessica gave him a jab, and he lowered his voice.`
`"Still, seriously, ...now that you mention it, they really did have that kind of atmosphere, didn't they...?`
` ......Haah, now I see, so George-aniki is..."`
`George couldn't be seen anywhere in the room.`
`A short while ago, when Shannon came into the room, George suddenly said that he'd forgotten something in the mansion and needed to go back and get it.`
`Shannon said she would guide him, just like she had on the way to the guesthouse, and the two of them departed together.`
`"......Well, there's actually been signs of it for a while now.`
` You know, questions about hobbies and favorite things.`
` I always thought it was a bit much for a passing interest, ...and look what's happened now!"`
`"Come to think of it, I get the feeling George-aniki's always been overly nice to Shannon-chan......`
` Now I get it..."`
`"According to the weather report, it looks like it'll be at its worst tonight.`
` It also seems it'll last all day tomorrow, though it should get a little better."`
`"...Really?`
` Then, maybe the boat won't arrive until the day after tomorrow......`
` ...I hope that doesn't interfere with your work on Monday..."`
`"Hahaha, I already knew the typhoon would be coming beforehand.`
` Just in case, I made sure I didn't have any plans for Monday, so it's okay.`
` ...I may not look it, but I really am the type who can plan ahead in his schedule."`
`George puffed out his chest, acting proud.`
`Compared to the calm appearance George always had as the oldest cousin, he now looked amusingly like a little kid.`
`Shannon chuckled at this abrupt contrast.`
`"It's no surprise you're so well prepared, as someone who'll bring prosperity to his company someday."`
`"...Well, making a company prosper really is a tough job.`
` Money isn't the only thing that's important.`
` I learned that well when studying under my father.`
` Making a company prosper is like owning a castle and leading your subordinates."`
`"My dad really loves reading about great leaders during the warring periods of Japan, a hobby that's probably influenced by the fact that he shares Toyotomi Hideyoshi's name.`
` Much of his philosophy on managing businesses comes from talking about them.`
` ...Did you know?`
` Takeda Shingen, who was feared as the leader of the strongest cavalry corps in the warring periods, started out with his troops in complete disarray...and didn't have the kind of strong leadership necessary to utilize them well."`
`"Is that true?`
` That's a little unexpected."`
`"In order to unite his troops, Shingen showed his excellent leadership in many ways.`
` For example, when a soldier succeeded well in battle, he would immediately honor them with a medal.`
` Normally, that kind of thing was put off until after the war, and they were all awarded at once."`
`"He continued this diligently while on the field of battle,`
` and immediately showing his appreciation for his troops' military exploits motivated them in an extremely significant fashion.`
` Also, whenever one of his troops was brought down by an illness, he would be the first to rush up to them and care for them, and so on.`
` ...Takeda Shingen wasn't just the man who led the strongest calvary corps in the warring period.`
` He was the person who cared the most for his troops throughout the warring period."`
`"......And because he was that kind of person, all of his troops went along with him."`
`The truth was, Shannon had already heard this story several years ago.`
`...But whenever a discussion of his father led to this sort of topic, George would always glow and look like he was having a great time.`
`So Shannon just smiled without interrupting, urging him to continue.`
`"Of course, in a capitalist world, money determines both your strength and the height of your fortifications.`
` But you can't build up a castle or succeed in war by yourself.`
` Such things can only be accomplished with the support of many subordinates, by borrowing their strength.`
` ......After understanding this, when I look at my father's back, I realize how immature I am.`
` I can clearly see how much competition he had to overcome before building up all he has now."`
`"George-sama, you truly look up to your father...`
` I'm jealous."`
`"A-Ah, sorry, ...that's not how I meant it."`
`"I-I'm sorry, ...that's not how I meant it either......"`
`The two of them awkwardly looked at their feet.`
`Shannon had no parents.`
`She had been brought up in an orphanage owned by Kinzo, called the Fukuin (福音) House.`
`Under the guidance of Kinzo, their honorary director, the orphanage offered members who excelled a chance for on-the-job serving experience.`
`If their efforts met with Kinzo's approval, they'd be able to leave the orphanage and work as servants for the Ushiromiya family.`
`...This was considered to be the highest honor for those who lived in the orphanage.`
`Servants from the Fukuin House all took names with the character 'on' (音) in them while they served.`
`So 'Shannon' (紗音) wasn't her real name.`
`The same went for 'Kanon' (嘉音).`
`All of the members of the Fukuin House were orphans.`
`At least, they were all people who had been separated from their parents under special circumstances.`
`......Because of this, the orphans had been taught to think of each other as their only family.`
`That's why it seemed so natural to both of them when Kanon called Shannon his sister.`
`And while both Shannon and Kanon were working in the mansion today, `
`there were several other servants possessing the '音' character in their names, such as Manon (眞音) and Lenon (恋音), who often worked in a rotation schedule.`
`...However, there were not many servants who stayed with the Ushiromiya family for long.`
`It was standard for them to quit after three years.`
`So you could probably say that Shannon, who had been working for ten years, was a notable exception to the rule.`
`Working as a servant for the Ushiromiya family was a heavy burden to bear, but the pay wasn't bad at all.`
`Working for a full three years would earn more than what was needed to enter mainstream society.`
`That was why, even though the orphans realized what a harsh task working for the Ushiromiya family was, they still hoped to be accepted.`
`Maybe the fact that Shannon managed to continue working for ten years...wasn't because she had more willpower than the other servants.`
`Maybe she'd gotten stuck working for ten years because she didn't have the courage to say she wanted to quit.`
`Kinzo couldn't even trust his own blood relatives, and those 'excellent' servants sent from the Fukuin House were the only ones he could rely on.`
`Because of that, Kinzo would sometimes allow them to wear the family crest, as servants under his direct control, and have them work close to him...`
`"......Err, ......um, you've been working here for almost ten years now, right?`
` You must've saved up a lot of money by now."`
`"I wonder...`
` It's not like there's anything in particular I'd like to buy...`
` After all, a few million yen isn't enough to live off for the rest of your life..."`
`"So, the reason you've been working all this time wasn't to hit some target sum?"`
`".........Y-Yes, that's right.`
` ......I have nowhere to go outside this mansion.`
` ......And I have been getting along well with Milady and the other young servants...`
` ...The Madam does scold me sometimes, ......but caring for the roses and cleaning the mansion is fun..."`
`"But that can't be your entire life, Shannon-chan...`
`no, Sayo(紗代)-chan."`
`"......Umm..."`
`Shannon cast her eyes downwards when she heard her real name...`
`She understood what George was trying to say and fell silent.`
`"There's something I've learned, as I continue to study even after becoming an adult and a full-fledged member of society.`
` ......A human's life is not as monotonous or short as we thought when we were kids."`
`All school-aged kids have certain fears they can't shake.`
`......They wonder whether they'll live the rest of their lives like sleepy classes after a monotonous and boring school day,`
` spending their time in a carefree laziness without anything interesting happening until it's all over...`
`However, life's only like that for underage students.`
`Compared to a human's life, the time they spend as students is nothing more than a blink of the eye, a period where they break through the shells of their immaturity.`
`The inside of the shell might be a hot, suffocating and boring world,`
` but the world beyond that shell is vast and filled with limitless possibilities.`
`"So far, your life has been trapped inside the shell called Shannon.`
` I think you're under the mistaken impression that your life will continue like this forever."`
`"That's......`
` ..............."`
`Shannon couldn't deny those words.`
`...She'd been unable to harbor any clear doubts about her lifestyle,`
` and since she never had any hope or goals for changing herself, she'd lazily continued living the way she always had.`
`...And if asked whether this life was satisfying,`
` ...she wouldn't have been able to nod......`
`She may have been intentionally averting her eyes from the truth.`
`...Without George's admonishments, she would have continued pretending not to notice as her real life slipped away bit by bit, neglected...`
`"......George-sama,`
` ............is it...`
`wrong for me to continue living...this way?"`
`"Yeah, it is.`
` Oh, and by the way, didn't you break one of our rules just now?"`
`George immediately gave a strict answer, then broke out into a mischievous smile.`
`Shannon already knew what she was being chided for, ...and she hung her head again, apparently embarrassed.`
`"Didn't you promise not to use 'sama' when the two of us are alone...?"`
`"......I-I couldn't obey that as a promise.`
` ...But, if it was an order, I would have to obey it...`
` Because I'm......furniture."`
`"Then it's an order."`
`'!s1`
`...............yes.`
` ...Certainly, `
`...George-san."`
`'!sd`
`"Yes, that's fine, Sayo-chan."`
`George smiled at Shannon...no, Sayo...to praise her small act of bravery.`
`This short exchange alone made it clear how far back their relationship must have stretched...`
`For a long while, the two talked as if the weather raging about them didn't even enter their thoughts.`
` They talked about the many memories they'd built during their relationship that no one else knew about.`
`Every once in a while, a flash of lightning would attempt to interrupt them, but this could sully neither the roses nor the time they spent blushing at each other...`
`"............Th-That's right.`
` ...I have something I wanted to show you."`
`"......Wh-What could it be?"`
`George, who had been speaking eloquently, suddenly started to stutter.`
`Watching him, Shannon seemed to guess something.`
`George timidly searched through his pocket.`
`Something got caught in the depths of his pocket, and just like the stuttering George, it took a little while to get it out.`
`It was a very small box.`
` A small box covered in a deep blue velvet.`
`...That peculiar shape was enough to tell anyone what was resting inside.`
`Shannon had prepared her heart somewhat, certain beforehand that this was what he'd been planning.`
`But even so, when she actually saw it, she couldn't avoid blushing once more...`
`George opened the small box, took something out, ...and held it out for Shannon to take.`
`"I want you to take this."`
`"...I-I, umm, couldn't accept something so valuable...!"`
`"...You can't take it...?"`
`'!s1`
`umm, `
`...I'm...`
`unworthy...`
`o-of such a thing......"`
`"Sayo,`
` this isn't a request.`
` ...It's an order.`
` Take this ring.`
` ...Okay?"`
`"Ah, ......u...`
` I-If it's an order, `
`......I cannot disobey..."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` ...Well done."`
`Shannon, not wanting to show her bright red face, timidly accepted the ring from George's hand while still staring at the ground...`
`That ring wasn't a simple accessory.`
`It was a noble object, meant since ancient times to be offered to a special woman under special circumstances.`
`...Therefore, while George could order her to take it, he could not order anything beyond that.`
`Anything beyond that would depend, not on an order, but on Shannon's...no, Sayo's own will.`
`"So, from here on, I'm not ordering you anymore.`
` .........Sayo,`
` I want you to give me your answer by tomorrow, without using words.`
` ............Do you understand?"`
`"...Err, .........h-how should I......"`
`"I won't order you any further, so this isn't an order, `
`......but a ring is something you put on your finger, after all.`
` ......If you like it, you can just put it on any finger you choose."`
`Shannon had only pretended not to know.`
`She already understood what he wanted her to do.`
`...But she was standing at a huge crossroads of her life...`
`"......Look how late it's gotten.`
` Let's call it a day."`
`George turned away from Shannon, acting just a bit bluntly.`
`"I could probably order you to wear it on your left hand.`
` You might be timid and dependent enough to actually obey that kind of an order.`
` ......But I want at least this last step...to be done by your own will, Sayo.`
` ...Understand?"`
`"......Y-`
`Yes."`
`"So, ...that's my order.`
` .........I want you to think about it well tonight and show me your answer tomorrow."`
`"..............."`
`Shannon nodded back.`
`...Today was the culmination of their many days spent together.`
`...This moment certainly hadn't come as a surprise to Shannon...`
`".........We should be getting back to the guesthouse soon.`
` If we take any longer, we'll make everyone worry about us."`
`'!s1`
`......umm...`
` ...I'm sorry, I...!`
` Um, I just remembered something I had to do in the mansion, so, `
`...uh, `
`......I have to go back to the mansion..."`
`'!sd`
`@:dwave_eng 0, geo_1e453:`
`George stared into Shannon's face as he laughed mischievously.`
`He definitely saw through Shannon's lie.`
`...However, when he saw how she felt, `
`he could sort of understand that she might be so embarrassed that she'd want to be alone.`
`So, because George realized the meaning behind Shannon's lie, he accepted it.`
`Shannon entered the entrance hall to the mansion with a tottering gait.`
`A mixture of exaltation and uncertainty gave her a feeling that she couldn't easily describe. It swelled up in her chest until it felt like she was about to burst.`
`After stopping for a second in front of the servant room to take a deep breath and calm her heart, she opened the door.`
`Inside, Gohda, who had been ordered to take the midnight shift at the mansion tonight, was absorbed in a worn-out crossword puzzle magazine.`
`He looked up for an instant to see if one of the family had come, but when he realized it was a fellow servant, he returned to his puzzle as if nothing had happened.`
`"......Umm,`
` ...Genji-sama told me to come and help you."`
`"Ah, is that so...? That's a relief.`
` I was just about to go check that the mansion was fully locked up, but I felt uneasy about leaving this room unmanned.`
` After all, Krauss-sama and the others' meeting looks as though it will continue for quite some time.`
` They might request some tea at any moment."`
`"That's true...`
` Then, what shall we do...? Should I watch over-"`
`"In that case, forgive me, Shannon-san, but I'll ask that you patrol the mansion.`
` I will stay here, awaiting the family's orders."`
`"...Y-Yes..."`
`...Shannon was slightly disgusted.`
`Even though she'd come here to help out as a favor, she was casually being forced to do the job of the person actually on duty.`
`Furthermore, after one-sidedly forcing that task on her, Gohda returned to his magazine once again and became immersed in his crossword puzzle.`
`Shannon bowed her head as a token sign of respect for her elder, then left the room to patrol the mansion.`
`Thanks to her being a bit ticked off, she managed to suppress that floaty feeling she'd been having until just now.`
`And anyway, she couldn't let Genji or Kanon see her looking like this.`
`She wanted a little time to herself until her heart calmed down, so maybe going on patrol wouldn't be so bad...`
`She began to hear the tumultuous voices of the family discussion coming from the dining hall.`
`Someone was speaking at great length, only to be interrupted by someone else.`
` This second person also began to speak in a very long, drawn-out fashion, until yet another person interrupted.`
`That kept on repeating.`
`It was as though their displeasure was seeping out through their voices.`
`She had been told to go to the guesthouse, so it would be bad if Krauss discovered her.`
`Thinking this, Shannon dashed past the dining hall.`
`Then, she went along a prearranged route through the dark mansion, checking that all the locks were secure.`
`She walked down the hall, checking each window.`
`There were no humans on Rokkenjima other than those connected to the family, so locking up didn't really serve much of a purpose.`
`No one had been in the habit of locking up at the Ushiromiya Head Family, at least not until Natsuhi had scolded them for being careless.`
`The metal fixtures on the windows were ice cold, and as she checked them one by one, the glow in her heart seemed to cool down.`
`"..................?"`
`At that time, she thought she saw something twinkling across the hall.`
`......Twinkling?`
`How could anything be twinkling through the darkness of the hall...?`
`She figured she must've been imagining it, but she still held her breath.`
` Grasping a curtain, she fearfully gazed down the hall......`
`However, other than the occasional crack of thunder brightening the hallway, she was unable to glimpse any flicker again.`
`...It must've been her imagination after all.`
`Maybe her heart was so agitated that she'd seen something that didn't even exist.`
`Shannon went back to checking the windows...`
`However, a certain unnerving memory was resurrected in the back of her mind.`
`...It was that ghost story...which had been passed down amongst the servants who served the Ushiromiya Head Family.`
`The mansion had two different Masters, one of the Day and one of the Night.`
` ...Beatrice, the Master of the night, would sometimes fly around the mansion in the form of sparkling butterflies.`
` That was the story.`
`...Come to think of it, didn't Kanon-kun once say he'd seen it with his own eyes......?`
`Though he got sulky when I said he must've imagined it and refused to believe him...`
`......Could it possibly...be true...?`
`The roar of the thunder gave no answer...`
`Genji tightened his bow tie and looked outside through a crack in the curtains.`
`Maybe the rain had died down a tiny bit since the previous night.`
`...But the thick rainclouds didn't seem like they'd be letting any trace of the morning sun get by.`
`The morning was dim and far from refreshing.`
`".........It seems it will last all day after all."`
`"Sorry for keeping you waiting, Genji-sama."`
`Kanon finished checking his appearance and exited the washroom.`
`On their normal schedule, it was rare for anyone to have to suffer going straight from a midnight shift to an early morning shift.`
`They were on a special schedule for the two days of the family conference.`
`However, unless the typhoon passed today, the relatives' stay on this island would last until tomorrow.`
`Kanon thought it best to be prepared for the special schedule to last an extra day.`
`The two of them left the guesthouse, opening their umbrellas.`
`The rose garden had been devastated by the wind and rain on the previous night.`
`Even though they'd spent several days making it beautiful to welcome the guests, one stormy night was enough to ruin it.`
`Kanon sighed.`
`The two headed for the mansion.`
`They were supposed to meet up with Gohda and prepare breakfast.`
`Gohda was such a perfectionist that he had probably already woken up, and was probably already preparing a breakfast as exquisite and elegant as glasswork.`
`They reached the overhang by the entrance to the mansion and folded up their umbrellas.`
`Genji took a bundle of several keys from his pocket and unlocked the front door.`
`The Ushiromiya family mansion was the only thing on Rokkenjima, so in the past, they hadn't been in the habit of locking up.`
`However, Natsuhi had ordered that the mansion be locked up from midnight to early morning.`
`Ever since then, unlocking the door in the early morning had become part of the servants' morning shift.`
`This task had been given to Genji and Kanon, so that Gohda could start preparing breakfast as soon as he woke up.`
`Silence had fallen in the mansion, giving the impression that the mansion itself was still asleep.`
`".........Well then, let us begin the morning chores."`
`"Yes, sir."`
`The two of them split up and began opening the curtains throughout the mansion.`
`...If the curtains stayed closed, the mansion would remain enveloped in faint darkness, as though it was still trapped in the previous night.`
`Following a well-rehearsed procedure, Kanon went around the mansion, opening the curtains for one window after another without having to retrace his steps once.`
`Even with this horrible weather, drawing the curtains made it feel just a little bit like morning.`
`While doing that, he passed in front of the kitchen.`
`...Even though he hadn't smelled anything yet, his stomach started aching for some of Gohda's prized cooking.`
`".........Good morning.`
` ...............?"`
`He tried to greet Gohda, who should have been getting breakfast ready, but Gohda was nowhere to be seen.`
`The kitchen was darkly lit, and not only were the curtains not open, but the fan wasn't even running.`
`It was still cold, without any trace of a fire being lit, so of course there were no signs of breakfast being made either.`
`...Though it would have been inexcusable, perhaps Gohda had overslept.`
`Even servants are only human.`
`They sometimes sleep in and show up late.`
`...In the rare case that such a thing happens, it's part of a servant's code to hide the unsightly scene before anyone notices, smoothly cover it up, `
`and make sure the family never even realizes that anything has gone wrong.`
`Kanon took the receiver of the phone that had been fitted to the wall and dialed the number for the extension line in the servant sleeping room.`
`"..................?"`
`......He couldn't hear that characteristic sound of a dial tone.`
`Kanon tried picking up the receiver again, but even so, he couldn't hear the usual dial tone.`
`He tried dialing again, but it had no apparent effect.`
`......Could the lightning last night have damaged some machine, breaking the extension line?`
`The equipment in this mansion was all worn out.`
`Kanon fully understood that even the smallest thing could have caused it to break down.`
`He gave up trying to wake Gohda with the phone and dashed over to the servant sleeping room.`
`...How long has it been since I stopped sleeping and started lazily staring up at the ceiling?`
`......That vague sense of awakening was part of Natsuhi's usual morning experience.`
`She always slept lightly, and she couldn't sleep at all without medicine.`
`...To Natsuhi, sleep was definitely not a happy thing.`
`When she looked outside, she saw that it was still pouring.`
`If she hadn't sensed a tiny amount of light, she might have mistakenly thought that it was still the previous night.`
`...She herself was one of the hosts, so she mustn't wake up later than her guests.`
`Urging herself on, she raised up her body, which still hadn't completely recovered from yesterday's weariness.`
`No one would torment her as long as she remained inside this room.`
`And her headache wouldn't get any worse here.`
`......This room was the only place she could find peace.`
`So when she left, it meant returning to the world where her husband's siblings kept trying to stab each other in the back.`
`...In that case, wouldn't it be better to just stay locked up in this room forever...?`
`That ridiculous notion brought a bitter smile to Natsuhi's face.`
`...She was starting to sound like Kinzo.`
`...Though she often complained about Kinzo staying locked up in his own room and refusing to attend to everyone else, the truth was that she longed to do the same.`
`......Natsuhi gave her head a small shake, and her fantasy was replaced by the reawakening of her usual headache.`
`When she reached for the doorknob, trying to leave the room, her hand touched the scorpion charm that she had hung from it before going to sleep the previous night.`
`...It was Maria's charm, which Natsuhi had received from Jessica.`
`Didn't Jessica say something about it having the power to repel magic, telling her to hang it from her doorknob?`
`...Maybe it was thanks to the charm that at least this room had been protected from the malice of her husband's siblings.`
`......As she thought this, her mood began to get a little more cheerful.`
`"............I wonder if I have Jessica to thank...for the little bit of peaceful sleep I managed to receive..."`
`Then Natsuhi remembered.`
`That's right, last night, I promised Jessica that I'd give her a charm of my own in exchange for this one, didn't I?`
`Natsuhi opened a drawer on her dresser and took out an antique accessory case that she had treasured when she was a child.`
`Inside, there were many small objects that Natsuhi had thought were valuable at the time.`
`From amidst those, she pulled out a red pouch.`
`...Inside was a small, round mirror about 10cm across.`
`It looked quite old, but the design on the back of the mirror was very ornate, and it felt like something with historical value.`
`At the very least, it seemed much more authentic than the other charm, which looked like a plastic scorpion keychain.`
`She had heard that this was a spiritual mirror for warding off evil spirits, and she had been given it specially by her Grandmother when her Grandfather's mementos had been distributed.`
`It had been believed since long ago that a strange power resided in this mirror.`
`Perhaps people thought it could reflect calamity and malice in the same way it reflected light.`
`Natsuhi returned the mirror to its pouch.`
`...It would probably be a fitting object to hand over to Jessica.`
`Just as she was placing it in her pocket, the sound of someone knocking on the door suddenly echoed throughout the room.`
`".........Yes?"`
`"Good morning, Madam, it is Genji.`
` My apologies for waking you so early."`
`"...I'm coming now.`
` What is it?"`
`No servant had ever come to her this early in the morning, nor had they come to wake her in person.`
`...Perhaps something bad had happened.`
`Maybe some fatal oversight had been made while preparing breakfast, something that would shame the household in front of their guests.`
`...Natsuhi took a deep breath in anticipation for whatever troubles she was about to hear of...`
`When she opened the door, Genji once again gave a morning greeting while bowing deeply.`
`Natsuhi tentatively responded.`
`".........Good morning.`
` Did something happen?"`
`"My apologies.`
` .........It would seem that the telephones have broken down due to the lightning last night.`
` ...The extension telephone isn't working, so please forgive my coming to see you directly."`
`"The extension telephone isn't working?`
` That will be troublesome.`
` Will it be possible to fix it?"`
`"......I am afraid we don't know the location of the damage.`
` Later on, I would like to call in an expert and have him repair it."`
`"Does that mean we'll be unable to have it repaired until after the typhoon passes?`
` ...Then it will remain broken down for the duration of our guests' stay.`
` ...Will that hamper our efforts to care for our guests?"`
`"............We will do all we can to ensure there are no problems."`
`"Very well.`
` ...I'm counting on you to make sure we have no blunders."`
`Natsuhi let out a small sigh of relief.`
`She had been prepared for the worst,`
` but damage to the telephones wasn't the kind of trouble she was worried about.`
`...Then again, even this would probably be enough to spark sarcasm from Eva.`
`Natsuhi gave her head a light shake.`
`"Are the preparations for breakfast proceeding well?"`
`"......As to that, ...we haven't been able to find Gohda.`
` The arrangements for breakfast have yet to be carried out..."`
`"What did you say?"`
`Natsuhi was indignant.`
`To her, this was a much bigger problem than the phones not working.`
`And despite that, this piece of information was the part that had been postponed.`
`Why did everything go well most of the time, and then come to something like this when the relatives were visiting...?`
`Natsuhi put her hand to her forehead and shook her head.`
`"Well, I suppose he slept in.`
` At any rate, just see to it that someone hurries up and prepares breakfast; I don't care who.`
` ...............Wha-"`
`Natsuhi exited into the hall and turned around for a second to close the door to her room.`
`The creepy 'thing' she saw there silenced her completely.`
`...It was an unpleasant sight, as though someone had dipped their fingers in a reddish-black liquid and scratched at the door around the doorknob.`
`It was probably some sort of awful prank...`
`arranged by some person who wanted to make it look as though they'd tried to force the door with bloody hands.`
`'!s1`
`What sort of prank is this......?`
` How awful...!"`
`'!sd`
`@:dwave_eng 0, gen_1e101:`
`"...P-Perhaps...`
`this is a vulgar joke by one of the guests.`
` ...Disgusting, truly disgusting...!"`
`Who in the world would pull such a childish and disgusting prank?!`
`Natsuhi had a pretty good idea, but of course there was no proof,`
` so even if she pushed the issue, it would just seem as though she was making a fuss about nothing.`
`In fact, it would surely be better to act as though she hadn't even realized that such a prank had been played on her.`
`Natsuhi gave the order to have it cleaned and headed off to the parlor with a squeak of her heels.`
`When Natsuhi and Genji arrived in the parlor, Eva and Hideyoshi were already there.`
`".........Good morning, everyone."`
`"Mornin', Natsuhi-san.`
` I heard Gohda-san would be makin' us breakfast too.`
` My stomach's been gettin' all excited since I woke up.`
` Wahahaha."`
`"After all, it seems food is all you can look forward to at the Head Family Household.`
` *giggle*giggle*."`
`".........I'm pleased to see that you too are in high spirits so early in the morning, Eva-san."`
`With a weary expression, Natsuhi returned Eva's gaze, which was fiercely competitive despite the early hour.`
`Then Kanon jogged in.`
`After bowing in apology to the relatives for running inside the mansion, he noticed Genji and told him something in a small voice.`
`"......Kanon, `
`have you still not found Gohda?"`
`".........My apologies, Madam.`
` I went all over the inside of the mansion and the guesthouse, `
`...but I still haven't found him..."`
`"Where in the world has he gone?`
` ......At any rate, breakfast is a higher priority than finding Gohda right now.`
` See to it immediately."`
`".........Yes."`
`Kanon glanced at Genji.`
`...It seemed he had something else to report, but was uncertain whether or not the words should come from him.`
`...Genji nodded and decided to give the report himself.`
`"............Madam,`
` it is not only Gohda.`
` ...Your husband is also nowhere to be found."`
`"My husband?"`
`"Yes.`
` Even before visiting you, I went to his room to tell him that breakfast wasn't being prepared, but I did not find him there.`
` Furthermore, he is not the only one missing.`
` ......Rudolf-sama, his wife, and Rosa-sama are nowhere to be found."`
`"Not in the guesthouse?`
` Nor the mansion?"`
`".........Yes.`
` They were not in their rooms in the guesthouse either."`
`When she'd heard that Gohda alone was missing, she'd assumed he had slept in or was loafing around somewhere.`
` However, now that she'd learned that several of the relatives were also nowhere to be seen, she began to take a slightly more optimistic view.`
`Could last night's family conference have continued all night, up until the present moment?`
`If so, they might have wanted to cool their heads after being shut in a stuffy room,`
` going out for walks on their own through the rain.`
`...The part about 'cooling their heads' really sounded like something Krauss would say.`
`Gohda had probably been summoned to accompany them and aid them in some way.`
`Gohda was not a man who lost track of time.`
`He had to understand that preparations for breakfast would be hindered if he did not return.`
`However, maybe the family conference had continued until this very moment...`
`with an atmosphere that would make it hard for anyone to slip out.`
`...Yes, that theory would be quite convincing for Natsuhi.`
`She remembered the illusion she'd felt that morning, as though the previous night had never ended.`
` ...When she learned that the feeling wasn't just an illusion, she once again took a deep, weary breath.`
`After all, that banquet of filthy vultures circling Kinzo's property was still going on.`
`"......Perhaps they are still discussing the inheritance somewhere in the garden, or maybe the beach.`
` ...At any rate, if we don't call Gohda back, we'll never be able to begin preparations for breakfast."`
`"So what're you sayin'?`
` ...Are Nii-san and the rest still continuin' their discussion...?!"`
`She had planned to say it in a small voice, but Hideyoshi overheard Natsuhi and managed to grasp the situation.`
`"Nii-san and Rudolf sure are tough.`
` Maybe it's just youth in Rosa's case?`
` ......Just a bit after midnight, the two of us were so tired that we headed back to bed,`
` though I do remember that Nii-san and the rest were still having a heated discussion at that point.`
` ......Men certainly are unpleasant when they get all fired up."`
`Natsuhi snorted, her face still blank.`
`"Kanon, search outside.`
` If you find Gohda, tell him to return immediately and begin preparing breakfast."`
`"......Certainly."`
`"Natsuhi nee-san, we don't know for sure that they're outside, do we?`
` Couldn't they also be inside Father's study?"`
`"...I see, that's certainly possible.`
` I don't know what path their conversation took,`
` but there's certainly a chance they moved to Father's study and let him in on the discussion."`
`"......I can't imagine that Father would willingly let them bring such a detestable topic into his study."`
`"You really think so?`
` Well then, there's nothing we can do.`
` I'm sorry, Genji-san and Kanon-kun, but could you search outside?`
` It wouldn't be that strange for Nii-san to suggest they go outside for a walk to cool their heads.`
` Even in this weather.`
` I'll go to Father's study.`
` Who knows, they might actually be there after all."`
`"............Eva-san, I couldn't ask a guest like you to exert herself so.`
` I will go.`
` I can also wish him a good morning while I'm at it."`
`"Oh, then I'll leave it in your hands.`
` Though I somehow doubt he'll return your greeting.`
` Natsuhi nee-san, have you always been on such good terms with Father?"`
`".........I don't know whether you could call it that, `
`but I am sure that I have gained his trust as the wife of the Successor to the Ushiromiya family."`
`"Then I'm sure he'll at least answer you, right?`
` I'd like to at least have breakfast with Father.`
` Do you think you could convince him to come down and join us?`
` ......It seems that he thoroughly despises the rest of us, but I'm sure he'll listen to you, if he trusts you that much."`
`"...After speaking so boldly, if you're unable to convince Father and come down alone, `
`then I doubt you'll ever be able to claim that you've earned his trust again.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"............I am not confident, but I will try."`
`Natsuhi responded, looking discouraged.`
`However, knowing Kinzo's temperament, she had absolutely no confidence in her ability to bring him out.`
`...Eva was clearly mocking her, confident that Natsuhi wouldn't be able to get Kinzo to come down.`
`But even so, Natsuhi would lose face if she gave up, saying it was impossible and letting Eva go instead...`
`Eva's mean-spirited and unreasonable demand made Natsuhi clench her fists slightly.`
`...When Genji realized this, he softly spoke to her over her shoulder.`
`"......Madam,`
` please take this, if you would."`
`"And this is...?"`
`Genji handed Natsuhi a sparkling gold key of ornate design.`
`It was the key to Kinzo's study.`
`The study had an autolock and couldn't be unlocked as long as Kinzo forbade entrance.`
`However, since Genji was especially trusted by Kinzo, he was allowed to carry a key to that door...`
`"But if this key is used, won't you also receive the blame...?"`
`"......When the Master is sleeping deeply, simply knocking on the door will not suffice.`
` ...And it would be more difficult to persuade the Master to leave his room if you must talk through the door.`
` Please use this..."`
`"......Genji..."`
`Until now, Natsuhi had thought of Genji as a cold servant who wouldn't do anything for her, since he worked directly under Kinzo.`
`But it looked like she would have to alter her understanding of him...`
`She wanted to communicate her gratitude, but by then, Genji had already turned his back on her and was walking down the corridor with Kanon.`
`...But as Natsuhi watched them go, the words directed at her from behind were sneering.`
`"Well then, you must bring Father with you, okay?`
` After all, it's his son's precious wife who's asking. I'm sure he'll listen to you.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*`
` We're guests, so we'll just relax here at our leisure."`
`"Quit it, Eva, you're takin' this too far.`
` Sorry, Natsuhi nee-san, but we're countin' on you to deal with Father..."`
`Without answering, Natsuhi forcefully spun around on her heels and quickly left that place.`
`After all that excitement the previous night, there was no way anyone was going to wake up early.`
`George-aniki, Jessica and I were snoring loudly on the beds in the cousins' room.`
`But Maria, who had gone straight to bed without joining in, was completely awake.`
`"....................."`
`As she rubbed her sleepy eyes and looked around, she was met with the loud snoring of the other three cousins.`
`...For a while, Maria had to think about what had happened.`
`After that, she realized that her mother wasn't with her, and she quickly got lonely.`
`Maria left the cousins' room, trying to head to the room that had been arranged for her and her mother.`
`Paying no heed to the three who were sleeping soundly, she slammed the door shut.`
`In response, Battler mumbled and rolled over in his sleep, but it wasn't enough to wake him up.`
`After a while, Maria returned, once again opening the door with a lively bang.`
`"..................Uu-."`
`When she had left the room, her face had been sleepy, but now that she was back, she looked irritated.`
`After that, she climbed up on Battler's bed, which happened to be the closest, and started yelling and jumping on it like it was a trampoline.`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Wa-ke u-p!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Waaa, what, what?!`
` Is it an enemy raid?!`
` Surround theeem!!"`
`After making sure I was awake, Maria moved over to George-aniki's bed and started jumping on that too.`
`...In that manner, the three of us were all greeted with an extremely pleasant awakening.`
`"Thanks for waking us up, Maria-chan.`
` You stopped us from sleeping in after that late night...`
` ...If only you could've been a bit more gentle about it..."`
`"...George nii-san, you really are an adult. I respect that..."`
`"It'll be 7:00 soon...`
` Well, it's not really a bad time to wake up.`
` *yaaawn*."`
`"Uu-!`
` Mama's not here!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!"`
`"Aunt Rosa?`
` She wasn't in her room?`
` I wonder if she's already woken up and gone to the mansion."`
`"Not here!!`
` Uu-uu-!`
` Uu-!`
` Mama!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`Maria kept groaning 'uu-uu-' and looking unhappy.`
`She didn't exactly seem lonely because her mother wasn't around.`
` It was more like she was irritated and thrown off balance because her mother wasn't where she'd expected.`
`If we could just tell her where her mother was, that alone would probably calm her down.`
` But, unfortunately, we had no way of knowing where Aunt Rosa was, except that she wasn't here.`
`"Anyway, it's time for breakfast, so let's head over to the mansion."`
`"That's right.`
` Maria, let's go to the mansion together, okay?`
` I'm sure Aunt Rosa will be there too."`
`"Uu-?`
` Mama's in the mansion?`
` Then I'll go there.`
` Uu-."`
`"Yeah, guess we should go to the mansion.`
` Our parents have probably already gone there."`
`Maria regained her usual composure so completely, her earlier tantrum now seemed like a lie.`
`We got dressed, left the room, and headed for the mansion.`
`Once more, there was a knocking sound on the study door.`
` But there was no answer.`
`'...He seemed to be sleeping still, and I could not wake him.'`
` ...If she went back downstairs and said something like that, Eva would probably be amused and triumphant.`
`And even putting Eva aside, it was problematic that Kinzo had stayed shut away during this entire once-a-year conference, not even coming down to greet anyone.`
`Even the Family Head...no, especially the Family Head...couldn't fail to make an appearance.`
`...I wonder if I can convince him myself?`
`Natsuhi readied herself and used the key that she'd borrowed from Genji to open the door...`
`Even though she was prepared for the sweet stench, which seemed to eat into one's brain as it poured out the small crack in the door, she couldn't help but grimace.`
`Thinking that he might still be sleeping, Natsuhi entered the room quietly...`
`When she did, Kinzo was already awake and looking down out of the window.`
`"...S-So you're awake...`
` Good morning..."`
`"...............How did you get in?"`
`Kinzo spoke with his back still facing her.`
`His voice was not harsh, but calm, and Natsuhi was slightly reassured.`
`...However, though he was awake, he wouldn't have ignored all that knocking if he was in a good mood.`
`Natsuhi wasn't able to relax.`
`"......My sincere apologies.`
` I asked Genji-san, and he allowed me to borrow the key to the study..."`
`"Hoh...`
` Genji did?`
` .........If my friend thought it was that important, then I have no choice but to listen.`
` So, ...what business do you have with me?"`
`"W-Well,`
` .........breakfast will be ready soon, and I would greatly appreciate it if you would join us..."`
`"I will eat here.`
` Have it brought here like always."`
`"But Father,`
` this family conference happens only once a year.`
` Please, at least let them see your face."`
`"......Go back downstairs.`
` Are you asking me to join in as they discuss how to chew up my inheritance after I die?`
` How foolish.`
` ......Let them speak of such matters as much as they please without me.`
` And if that's what you call a family conference, it's hardly worth leaving my room for it.`
` I am busy.`
` Do not bother me."`
`His last words carried the threat that any further questions would be not be appreciated.`
`...Natsuhi realized that adding any further pleas would finally bring his wrath down upon her.`
`She didn't look forward to facing Eva's sarcasm, but there was nothing more Natsuhi could do...`
`"...Is that so...?`
` ...Understood...`
` I am sure everyone will be sorry to hear it, but I will tell them."`
`Natsuhi decided to give up.`
`Bowing silently, she tried to leave the room before Kinzo's spasmodic temper could flare up.`
`As she did, Kinzo spoke to her.`
`......His voice was so calm and gentle, it felt like it came from an entirely different person.`
`"......Natsuhi,`
` ...it has been quite some time since you married into the Ushiromiya family."`
`"...Y-Yes.`
` ...It has been many years since I was first permitted to bear the name Ushiromiya."`
`"......Do you sometimes long for your previous family?"`
`"...............No.`
` ...Marriage means abandoning your birth family.`
` I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi.`
` The Ushiromiya family is the only family I can come home to, the only one I am fond of."`
`She truly wasn't exaggerating.`
`Such was the resolve she felt whenever she applied the Ushiromiya family name to herself.`
`...And that's precisely why she was so saddened when her husband didn't treat her like an Ushiromiya, leaving her to race about in vain.`
`".........If Krauss were a woman...`
`and you his husband...`
` ...No, ...I won't say that."`
`"...Wh-What do you mean by that, `
`...Father?"`
`Natsuhi was shocked.`
`...If Kinzo's words just now were what they seemed...`
`...It would've been more than enough to make up for all she'd suffered up to that point.`
`"......Forget it.`
` It's just the nonsense of an old man."`
`Kinzo once again faced away from her.`
`...He'd told her to forget it, but Natsuhi couldn't help feeling a warmth in her heart...`
`"...Father,`
` ......even though I, Natsuhi, am not connected to you by blood, I am still your daughter.`
` ......I will most assuredly see to it...`
`that your honor and glory, and everything you have left behind...`
`are protected...!"`
`".........You do not have the right to wear the One-Winged Eagle.`
` ...However, the One-Winged Eagle is surely engraved in your heart.`
` ......That is irrefutable proof that you are my blood relative, one who will inherit the glory of the Ushiromiya family.`
` ......Some will sneer that there is no eagle on your clothes,`
` but such words are not worth lending an ear to.`
` ...Only those who hold the eagle in their hearts are my true blood relatives.`
` .........I now consider it an honor that you were welcomed into the Ushiromiya family..."`
`Without saying anything more, Kinzo remained with his back to Natsuhi.`
`However, Natsuhi couldn't help but feel something warm well up inside her that she hadn't felt since long ago, when she had been just a child...`
`Natsuhi bowed silently to his back and left the room...`
`"...Ah, good timing.`
` How is Father?`
` You were taking so long, so I came to check."`
`When Natsuhi left the study, she saw Eva climbing the stairs, and their eyes met.`
`Eva was smirking unpleasantly, thinking that Natsuhi would leave drudgingly after failing to convince Kinzo.`
`However, the way Natsuhi was now, such a frivolous laugh would not disturb her.`
`......She was not permitted to wear the family crest on her clothing.`
`.........But she was permitted to wear it in her heart.`
`So she spoke calmly, clearly, and confidently...with the dignity of the one who would protect the Ushiromiya family's glory.`
`"Father said he would not join in on the family conference.`
` He says he has no interest in discussing such obscene matters."`
`"...I figured you'd say something like that.`
` If you failed to persuade Father, just say so."`
`"......How pitiful.`
` I'm beginning to see why Father lamented so."`
`"...Wh-What do you mean by that...?"`
`Natsuhi did not answer.`
`Just as Kinzo had done earlier, she showed Eva her back as she headed down the stairs.`
`Eva finally realized that she was being made fun of, that something had happened to quickly bolster Natsuhi's confidence.`
`Even so, she apparently didn't have the courage to risk Kinzo's wrath.`
`Unable to even knock on the door, she could only click her tongue, make a motion as though scratching at it, and follow after Natsuhi.`
`"S-So, were Nii-san and the rest there?`
` Did you ask Father about them?"`
`"......I didn't get the chance to ask, but they were not inside the study.`
` ...Father would never let them into his room to discuss such a lowly topic, so it is unlikely he knows where they went.`
` Let us go downstairs and wait for the servants to return from their search.`
` ...Breakfast may be late, but how would you like some tea, Eva-san?"`
`"......Th-That would be fine."`
`Eva couldn't hide her confusion at the complete difference in Natsuhi's attitude.`
`...She was acting so boldly, and while Eva hated to admit it, she even had a sense of dignity about her.`
`Unable to find fault with anything, Eva could only follow Natsuhi back to the parlor.`
`When the two of them returned to the parlor, Hideyoshi had been joined by the four children and Nanjo.`
`Genji, who had been talking with Hideyoshi, reported the current situation when he noticed that Natsuhi had returned.`
`"You still have not found my husband and the rest?"`
`"......Yes, my apologies.`
` ......Also, Kumasawa has started preparing breakfast.`
` She said that she will need just a little longer."`
`The clock read a little past 8:00.`
`8:00 should have been the time to start breakfast.`
`Normally, going over that time limit would be a disgrace to the host.`
`"......Kanon is now searching outside.`
` ...Also, no one has seen Shannon either."`
`"Even Shannon's missing?`
` ......Truly, just how many people did my husband bring with him on his little walk?"`
`Just how many people had gone missing by now?`
`Now that the number was this large, it was starting to feel truly unpleasant, as though the people here were the only ones being left out of something interesting.`
`At least, that seemed to reflect the feelings of the children...and Maria in particular.`
`She was indignant, her stomach grumbling, almost as though her mother and the others had left her alone to go off and eat something delicious without her.`
`The other children were flipping through the channels on the television, trying to find a program that might interest Maria and cheer her up again.`
`Nanjo was sitting on the sofa, gazing blissfully at the children while reading a book.`
`It must have been a book about chess.`
`The sound of footsteps came rushing towards them with a pitter-patter.`
`There was only one set, so they realized before seeing who it belonged to that it was probably Kanon, not Krauss and the rest.`
`"............Madam, excuse me."`
`"Judging by your appearance, you still haven't been able to find them."`
`"...My apologies.`
` I still haven't..."`
`"That will be enough.`
` You've worked hard."`
`She didn't know where they were, but they had to be somewhere on this island.`
`They hadn't had a thing to eat since the previous night, so their stomachs must be growling about now.`
`They'd probably come plodding back of their own accord before long.`
`...By now, Natsuhi was thoroughly exasperated and started to feel that there was no reason for them to go out of their way and search.`
`"I will go to the kitchen to prepare some tea for all of the guests.`
` Thanks to both of you for all of your hard work so early in the morning."`
`Natsuhi left the parlor, acting as though the release in tension had caused a new surge in her headache.`
`...Kanon tried to call to her back, but Natsuhi left swiftly.`
`"............What is it?`
` Was there something else?"`
`".........Yes.`
` ...I was unable to find her husband or anyone else, but, `
`...well..."`
`Kanon sounded evasive.`
`It looked as though he didn't know where they were, but had spotted something that might be connected to their disappearance.`
`Eva and Hideyoshi noticed this exchange of words and came over.`
`They'd probably picked up on something strange in Kanon's behavior.`
`"What's goin' on, Kanon-kun?`
` Did you find Krauss nii-san and everyone else?"`
`"......Actually,`
` the rose garden storehouse looked strange."`
`"............What do you mean...`
`it looked strange?"`
`"......It was, um, `
`.........how should I explain it..."`
`Kanon hesitated once more.`
`...His tone wasn't at all what you'd expect from this usually fearless boy.`
`Seeing this, Eva and Hideyoshi looked at each other dubiously...`
`"What do you mean?`
` Are you saying Nii-san and the others were inside the storehouse?"`
`"No, ...I am going to inspect the inside now.`
` I just now came back to get the key, but...`
`......umm..."`
`"I don't really get it, but it sounds like we've just gotta look around inside it.`
` Where's the key to that storehouse?"`
`".........It is in the servant room.`
` Let us check inside the storehouse at once."`
`Kanon dashed off to the servant room and returned with the key.`
`Genji left the parlor, saying that he would go check, but then Eva and Hideyoshi followed after him.`
`...What was this 'something strange about the storehouse' that had caused the usually fearless Kanon to hesitate?`
`It was still pouring outside, but perhaps their curiosity over this 'something' that Kanon couldn't talk about won out.`
`While the children made a big fuss watching television, Kanon and the rest dashed over to the entrance...`
`The rose garden storehouse was a place that housed various tools used to manage the garden.`
`It was definitely not a pretty building.`
`Because of its appearance, it had been built so that it was hidden in a corner of the rose garden.`
`Kanon, Genji, Eva, and Hideyoshi came cutting across the rose garden holding umbrellas.`
`They entered a small path just off the rose garden, which was normally off limits for those appreciating the garden and only used by those maintaining it.`
`As they dashed down that, the storehouse came into view in front of them.`
`It was quite an old shed, and compared to the flawlessly perfect beauty of the rose garden, it was pretty seedy-looking.`
` It was easy to understand why it had been built in a hard-to-see place.`
`Eva and Hideyoshi arrived at the storehouse long after Kanon and Genji.`
`"Ha, `
`...ha...`
` You two sure are fast...!`
` I thought my heart was gonna explode..."`
`"I never knew they had a storehouse way over here.`
`'!s1`
`...wh-`
`what is that...?"`
`'!sd`
`Noticing this, Hideyoshi also followed Kanon's finger and was likewise too shocked to speak.`
`The entrance to the storehouse was a kind of shutter.`
` ......And there.........`
`......Everyone suddenly realized why Kanon had been unable to find words to describe what they now saw.`
`On the shutter, which was completely filthy from being exposed to wind and rain for so long, `
`...stuck right on it...`
`......There was something that looked like a strange dark-red...liquid?`
` Mucus?`
` Or maybe it was some sticky paint...`
` ...An indescribably eerie shape was drawn on the shutter with some kind of ghastly substance.`
`The rain had caused it to drip down like fresh blood leaking from an open wound...`
`No more beating around the bush.`
`Some kind of mark was drawn there...`
`with a ghastly substance that looked like blood...`
`in a shape that seemed to suggest something ominous.`
`...Two circles were drawn there, and inside them was a design that looked like a cross.`
`The four ends of the cross were widely exaggerated, and it looked like some kind of crest from somewhere around Europe.`
`And in the cracks between these shapes, written closely packed together, `
`...were some unfamiliar characters, or possibly symbols......`
`".........What a vulgar bit of grafitti...`
` ......Could this be...one of those?`
` One of those magic circles used in demonic ceremonies?!"`
`It wasn't surprising that Hideyoshi would say that about such a ghastly shape, drawn with a deep-red, dripping substance.`
`"When was this made...?!"`
`"......Last night, I came here before it started raining, and there was nothing drawn here at that time."`
`".........We must do something before anyone else sees this.`
` If they laid eyes upon it, it would cause them great discomfort......"`
`"That's right...`
` Even though it's just a shed, I wouldn't want to leave such an unpleasant piece of graffiti alone for even a second longer than I had to."`
`"There is some paint inside the storehouse.`
` Let us paint over it temporarily as an emergency measure, `
`then repaint it again someday when the weather is good.`
` .................."`
`Genji remembered that he had just recently seen another scribble, and that it too had been made with a strange, dark-red substance of the same color as this...`
`'!s0`
` ......That's right, he had seen it on the door to Natsuhi's room...`
`"Kanon-kun,`
` let's remove this scribble quickly and go back, okay?`
` Even though it's just a storehouse, it's really irritating to have graffiti around the home I was brought up in."`
`"......Yes Ma'am.`
` I will take care of it immediately..."`
`Kanon squatted in front of the shutter and unlocked it.`
`He then lifted it up with all of his strength.`
`A boisterous noise resounded, and the eerie shape drawn on the shutter began to get sucked in through the top as the shutter was raised.`
`...At least for the time being, that ominous drawing disappeared from their direct gaze, and they all breathed a sigh of relief...`
`Thanks to a kids' program they came across, Maria was feeling much better.`
`Battler and Jessica were poking fun at the kids' show at every turn, cackling together.`
`George was enjoying the program with Maria from her perspective.`
`Nanjo sat on a sofa by himself, passing the time by reading quietly.`
`They heard hurried footsteps coming from the hallway.`
`They were the footsteps of a single person.`
`...Did that mean it wasn't the group of four that had just left?`
`It was Genji.`
`It was very rare for Genji, who considered being out of breath a violation of a servant's virtues,`
` to be gasping for air.`
`He had probably come dashing back from outside the mansion.`
`His shoulders were soaking wet, and he didn't have his usual trim appearance.`
`When Genji noticed Nanjo looking at him, he gave a small, silent bow and quickly approached him.`
`".........Doctor Nanjo, my apologies.`
` Please, come with me, quickly."`
`"......Wh-`
`What is the matter?"`
`As Genji whispered something into Nanjo's ear, Nanjo went pale.`
`He rose from the sofa, trying not to be noticed by the children who were still engrossed by the TV,`
` and the two of them rapidly left the parlor, muffling their footsteps.`
`Just as they were about to exit the parlor, `
`they came across Natsuhi, who was pushing a serving cart loaded with a tea set.`
`Genji whispered something into Natsuhi's ear, and Natsuhi went pale too in apparent shock.`
`...Then, leaving the serving cart where it was, the three of them dashed towards the entrance...`
`George noticed them running down the rose garden through the window.`
`"......What's that?`
` Isn't that Genji-san and Doctor Nanjo and...`
`and that's Aunt Natsuhi, isn't it?"`
`"What's up, Aniki?"`
`".........Maybe something happened.`
` They looked terribly flustered."`
`When Jessica and Maria saw that Eva, Hideyoshi and Nanjo were no longer in their seats and that the serving cart had been abandoned in the entrance to the parlor, they also realized that something was the matter.`
`"Could there have been some kind of accident...?"`
`"...Let's go check it out.`
` It's no fun if we're the only ones left out, right?`
` Ihihi!"`
`For some reason, what Battler said sounded extremely indiscreet.`
`...But they couldn't deny that they were a little insecure and concerned after seeing the adults run off into the rain without regards to their appearance.`
`"......Let's check it out, okay?`
` I'm worried something might've happened..."`
`Jessica's uneasy words spoke for all of them.`
`"Hey Maria, are you coming too?`
` Or will you watch TV?"`
`"Uu-!`
` Wanna watch TV!`
` Uuu--."`
`"Let's go on without her.`
` Maria-chan, we'll be back soon.`
` You keep watching TV, okay?"`
`"Uu-!"`
`By the time the kids made it outside, the adults were no longer in sight.`
`But Jessica seemed to have a pretty good idea where they'd gone, judging by the direction they'd been running.`
`Following Jessica, we ran through the rain-soaked rose garden...`
`The wind seemed to suddenly get stronger.`
`...The malicious sound of thunder began to ring out like it had the previous night.`
`It felt like an eerie something had surrounded the island...and was trying to stop us from moving forward.`
`"Jessica, is there something over this way?!"`
`"I'm pretty sure there's a storehouse for gardening tools or something."`
`"What in the world could be going on in a place like that...?"`
`Just as Jessica had said, they began to see a storehouse in front of them.`
`They could also see the adults there.`
`The shutter to the storehouse was open, and several adults looked as though they were searching for something.`
`For some reason, only Natsuhi was outside the storehouse. Without even holding an umbrella, she looked like she was hanging her head, and her back was facing them...`
`There was Genji, Nanjo, and Natsuhi, who had just left the mansion.`
`The ones who'd left earlier, Kanon, Eva, and Hideyoshi, were also there, making for a small crowd of people, `
`but there was absolutely no bustle of activity...`
`When Natsuhi realized that the children were approaching, a terrible expression rose to her face, and she ran at them with her arms spread wide.`
`"You mustn't come any closer!!!`
` Go back to the mansion!!!"`
`'!s0`
`no, `
`because of that, `
`the kids saw the scene Natsuhi was trying to keep them away from.`
`Inside the storehouse with its shutter wide open, a faint fluorescent light shone down.`
` And right there was......`
`"KyaaaaaAAAAAAaaaaaAAaa!!!"`
`Jessica's piercing shriek rang out.`
`...But that was just because Jessica's scream was the loudest.`
` ...The same thing spilled out of Battler and George's mouths as well...`
`Eva spread her arms just like Natsuhi, roaring at the kids with a bone-chilling expression on her face.`
`"George, take everyone and return to the mansion!!!`
` Quickly!!`
` Right now!!"`
`When Natsuhi spread her arms, I thought she was trying to prevent us from advancing any further.`
`...But that wasn't why Eva was spreading her arms right now.`
`...She was trying to stop us kids from seeing that terrible scene.`
`It was her mother's heart, trying to protect the eyes and hearts of us children by blocking our view of that terrible scene by at least the width of one of her arms!`
`"......Is this some kind of joke? Is it...?!"`
`...I'd seen this kind of cheap scene all too often.`
`In manga, TV, anime, and movies, I'd seen it over and over again...`
`This was just...just seeing something appear in real life that I'd seen plenty of times before in some of those more sensational movies, right?!!`
` That alone shouldn't...`
`...aaaaah, `
`but that...that suit, `
`...it's that old bastard's, isn't it...?`
` ...I get it, then that's Uncle Krauss...`
` And Kyrie-san, and Aunt Rosa, nnggyaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!`
`"Dad, DAD!!!"`
`"You mustn't, Jessica!!`
` You mustn't go in!!`
` You mustn't look!!!"`
`"Dad, Dad!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaagggghhhh!!!"`
`".........Rigor mortis has set in across almost the entire body...`
` ...Most likely, `
`six hours or more have passed since death...`
` As far as I can tell by looking at the damaged area, there is a high probability that they were damaged after their deaths...`
` ......No, I must watch what I say...!`
` I'm a general practitioner! Examining corpses is outside my area of expertise...!"`
`"......So what does that mean?`
` Just killin' them wasn't enough, ...so they went on to do somethin' like this?!!`
` The devil, this here's the work of the devil!!"`
`Aunt Natsuhi caught Jessica in her arms and Aunt Eva caught George-aniki,`
` ......so I was the only one who could approach the entrance to the storehouse.`
`............Aah, `
`...if only there had been someone there to catch me too, `
`I wouldn't have needed to have this horrible, evil scene burned into my eyes...`
`......No, that's not it.`
`...It isn't that there's no one here to catch me...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~The people who should catch me, they're right there, aren't they?!!~ib~`
`...Just as Jessica said, it did look like a storehouse for gardening tools.`
`A lawn mower with extra blades,`
` a grass sickle and a hammer, `
`some carpentry tools such as a saw...`
`Piled up potted plants and bags of fertilizer.`
`And treated just the same, the corpses of several people had been laid to rest there.`
` No, had been tossed in there!`
`I could tell them by their clothes.`
`......That old bastard and Kyrie-san.`
` ...Uncle Krauss and Aunt Rosa.`
` ......Beyond that, ...Gohda-san and...`
`are there still more of them?`
` How many people died...?`
` ......You're fucking kidding me!`
` I can't even count them on one hand! Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!`
`I didn't know whether it had been one of these gardening tools, which if used for something other than their intended purpose could definitely be wielded with a naked brutality,`
` or whether some horrible tool had been brought in here specifically for this.`
`......Anyway, `
`.........each one of the bodies jammed in here...had been given an atrocious makeup.`
`...It wasn't makeup, ...it was more like...`
`~ib~their faces had been plowed~ib~...!`
`Their faces were smashed, forced into expressions that normal people couldn't make even after death.`
` ...I couldn't tell where the eyes or the noses were, but I could find their mouths...because they were gaping wide, their gums exposed!`
` But their front teeth were missing, and even the cheeks that should have covered all this were all torn up and laid bare!`
` That trendy makeup you always spent so much time on even though you're a man isn't doing a thing now...!!`
`"...Nnggaaaaaaaaagggghhh!!!`
` Daaaaaaaaaaad!!`
` I always thought you were going to hell!`
` But still, not like this, right?`
` You weren't such a son of bitch that you should have to suffer so brutally!!`
` And Kyrie-san, `
`......didn't I tell you to stop going out with this guy...?`
` ...There's absolutely...`
`no reason for you to end up like this too......"`
`"...They've got no faces, ...no faces...`
` Damn it damn it damn it damn it, aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!"`
`"......Battler-san, you mustn't look any more...`
` There's no way your mother and father would want you to see them like this...!`
` For your mother and your father's sakes, ...you mustn't look any more!!"`
`"Dead people are supposed to have faces that look like they're sleeping peacefully, right?!`
` They've got no faces, my dad and Kyrie-san have no faces!!`
` I don't even know what kind of faces they were wearing when they died!!`
` What's wrong with me?!!`
` Will I have to see these smashed, monster-like faces every time I remember them?!`
` That's just great, `
`I didn't want to remember that old bastard's smug face anyway!`
` Just great, just great!!"`
`"But why even Kyrie-san's face...?`
` Kyrie-san wasn't a crook...`
` ...Sure, she ticked me off a bit now and then, `
`...but she was like a cool big sister to me...`
` ......This is wrong, `
`...this is all wrong......!!`
` At least Uncle Krauss has it better, doesn't he?!!`
` It's not his whole face, just the side!!`
` At least he's got half his face left, right?!!`
` That's still better, that's still better!!"`
`"NooooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooOOOOOooooo!!!"`
`Jessica filled her ears with the sound of her own screaming, trying to shut out my reckless words.`
`"...Stop it, Battler-kun...!`
` Just stop it, ...just stop it...!"`
`"Aniki, Aniki!!`
` Aaaaaaaaagggghhhhhhh!!!"`
`Disregarding age and appearance,`
` ......I fell to my knees, clinging to Aniki's waist and sobbing.`
`It was as if I was crying on behalf of everyone there...`
`Representing the feelings of everyone there, I screamed over and over......`
`"......Father, `
`'!s1`
`...lying over there are `
`Uncle Krauss, Uncle Rudolf, Aunt Kyrie,`
` and Aunt Rosa and Gohda-san.`
` ......Just those five, right...?"`
`'!sd`
`@:dwave_eng 0, hid_1e232:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, hid_1e233:`
`one more person over here..."`
`The body Hideyoshi was looking down on now...happened to be hidden among the shadows in that mountain range of objects,`
` in a blind spot to George, who stood by the entrance.`
`...So, George couldn't tell...whose body it was......`
`...So, ......George cursed himself.`
`He cursed the fact that his worst guesses always turned out to be right...!`
`'!s1`
`...the one lying at your feet is...`
`...Sh-`
`Shannon, isn't it......?"`
`".........Yes.`
` ......It's Shannon-chan."`
`"....................."`
`George fell completely silent.`
`...He shook slightly, his lower lip trembling...`
`Normally, ...he would've wanted to run to his beloved's body, screaming and crying.`
`...However, ...before rashly rushing forward, `
`...he worked to keep his composure...and asked his father.`
`"......Is Shannon...`
`...the same as...`
`...Uncle Krauss and the others?"`
`"........................"`
`Hideyoshi deeply understood the meaning of those words.`
`...So he couldn't give George an immediate answer.`
`...Or rather, ......he felt that silence was the only sincere and loving response he could give George right now.`
`When George asked if Shannon was the same, `
`...he meant to ask whether her corpse was in the same condition as the others or not.`
`...Since Hideyoshi hadn't denied it, `
`......it meant her corpse was in the same brutal state.`
`"......Can I...`
`look at Shannon...?"`
`"......No, `
`......you can't."`
`"...Why not...?`
` After all, ...I won't be able to see Shannon's face again, right...?`
` So, ...why won't you let me see...`
`what her face looked like at the end...?"`
`"......The last time you met Shannon-chan was yesterday, right?"`
`".........Yes."`
`"I see...`
` ......When you left her, `
`what kind of face was she showin' you...?"`
`'!s1`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`It was a wonderful smile."`
`After he handed her the ring,`
` ...she hesitated, even though she must've already made up her mind...`
` Then she looked bashful...`
`and ran away because she was embarrassed to let him see her face looking like that.`
` ...That's the expression that was revived in George's mind...`
`"......I see.`
` ...Then I'm sure...Shannon-chan would want to leave you with that smile in your memory."`
`...Hideyoshi looked down upon Shannon's body lying at his feet.`
`.........Just like the other bodies, it was in such a horrible state that it'd make anyone want to cover their eyes.`
`......Her head had been smashed in from the side, and no more than half of her expression remained.`
`......If the remaining, blood-soaked half of her expression had been wiped clean,`
` would that graceful smile of hers have peeked out?`
` ......But only half of it...`
`Without thinking, Hideyoshi slapped his hands over his eyes.`
`...How brutal...`
`If her face was going to be crushed anyway, then if only all of it had been crushed, `
`he might have been able to temporarily distract George from his pain by making the pathetic suggestion that it was someone else wearing Shannon's clothes.`
`But half of her face had been left untouched...!`
`It caused the body so much humiliation, ......while still proving beyond doubt that the body was Shannon's and no one else's!`
` How inhuman, how brutish...`
`And there, trying his best to burn the image of the remaining half of Shannon's expression into his eyes as she lay at Hideyoshi's feet,`
` ...was Kanon.`
`...Kanon was not crying.`
`...Tears had risen to his eyes, but they did not drip down.`
`But that didn't mean he wasn't feeling as much sadness as everyone else.`
`...Losing Shannon, who had lived with him in the same orphanage, whom he had loved as a sister,`
` ...must've been just the same as losing a blood relative...`
`".........George,`
` ...I'm sure Shannon-chan...`
`is saying thank you...`
` She must be glad you didn't end up seein' her in such a pitiful state.`
` ......I'm sure...`
`...she's thankin' you for holdin' strong and showin' restraint..."`
`"...I understand.`
` ......I understand, Father... ...I understand..."`
`George leaned against the outside wall of the storehouse, ...crouching down limply.`
`"......Father,`
` ...I have a request."`
`"What is it...?"`
`"...I want you to look for me.`
` ......Is there...`
`a ring on Shannon's finger...?"`
`"...A ring...?`
` ...Let me see..."`
`Hideyoshi crouched down.`
`...As he did, Kanon silently pointed to one of Shannon's hands.`
`".........Yeah, `
`...there is.`
` It's a diamond ring.`
` With a valuable diamond.`
` ...Must've been pretty expensive..."`
`"And,`
` .........which hand...`
`and which finger is it on?"`
`"......Hmm, `
`the ring finger of her left hand.`
` ...I see, `
`...so Shannon-chan...`
`...was engaged...?"`
`"............George,`
` ...don't tell me you-"`
`"Eva!!`
` That doesn't matter now!!`
` A man made a lifelong promise to Shannon-chan...!`
` A man promised her happiness for life...`
` Who that man was isn't the issue here!"`
`'!s1`
`is a woman's dream, isn't it...?`
` ...I don't know when she received this ring.`
` I also don't know who gave it to her!`
` However, `
`......even so, Shannon-chan took this ring.`
` Then, ...she accepted it...and put it on her left ring finger.`
` ...I'm sure the man who gave it to her...`
`...was also happy."`
`'!sd`
`.........However, `
`someone who knew of George and Shannon's true relationship...`
`would understand the full meaning of those words.`
`"......I see.`
` ...Thank you, `
`......Father."`
`George stood up.`
`The traces of tears still streaked his face, but his expression had returned to its usual calm one...`
`"......Let's go,`
` Battler-kun, Jessica-chan.`
` ...If we stay here any longer, we'll get in the way of the adults."`
`"......Sniff.`
` ......You're right..."`
`Jessica sniffled once, showing her face to her mother, who had been holding her the whole time, to let her know she was okay now.`
`...When she faced George again, she once again had on her usual expression.`
`......Although she still couldn't smile.`
`"...Battler, `
`hang in there......"`
`Battler kept on crouching in front of his parents' bodies......`
`".........I'm sorry.`
` ...Crying like hell calmed me down...`
` You bastard, Dad, ...I bet you're laughing at me...`
` After all that shit I talked about you, here I am crying like a baby just 'cause you died.`
` ...Well, so what, `
`...I guess I just got the gene that makes you cry when your parents kick the bucket...!"`
`Battler's face was still bright red from the tears,`
` but he had at least recovered enough to fake a smile, if only a bitter one.`
`"......Kanon,`
` ...you mustn't remain here any longer either.`
` Take the children and return to the mansion."`
`Natsuhi had been standing under the rain this whole time, unable to take a step into the storehouse.`
` ...Maybe she had her own way of grieving, different from Battler's.`
`Realizing that she had to take on a role of responsibility now that her husband was dead,`
` ...she gave Kanon those orders.`
`".........Yes, `
`Madam."`
`Kanon rose silently and turned to face me.`
`His face was pure white, almost as though his own heart had died along with Shannon,`
` ...and there was no life in his expression.`
`On an ordinary day, if he had been told to guide the children through the beautiful rose garden,`
` Kanon might have led the way.`
`......But now, there was no distinction between Kanon and the children.`
`...They were now just kids of about the same age, ...suffering the pain of losing those close to them.`
`After making sure that the children were leaving, Natsuhi started giving orders to Genji.`
`".........Genji,`
` ...contact the police immediately.`
` They probably won't be able to come until the typhoon passes, but they should be able to tell us what to do next."`
`"...Understood.`
` There is an emergency radio, so I will use that to contact them."`
`When she heard that, Natsuhi remembered.`
`That's right, the phones were out today, weren't they...?`
`However, they also had a radio, since they couldn't necessarily rely on phones all the time while living on an isolated island.`
`...At any rate, they should start by contacting the police and receiving their instructions.`
` ...Everything else could wait.`
`"......Doctor Nanjo,`
` ......is there anything more you can do here?"`
`"Unfortunately, `
`......there is nothing I can do......"`
`"......Understood.`
` ...Genji, could you at least cover their faces with something?`
` Exposing them like this is humiliating to them as well..."`
`".........Yes Ma'am."`
`Genji picked up several dried up towels from inside the storehouse...`
`when Eva stopped him with a shrill voice.`
`"Wait a second!`
` Stop.`
` This is the scene of the crime, isn't it?`
` Then we mustn't disturb it.`
` We all panicked and walked in here with our shoes on, but even that will surely get in the way of the police's investigation, right?"`
`"....................."`
`Natsuhi glared at Eva, offended.`
`......Objectively speaking, Eva was right.`
`Even so, she glared at Eva as though accusing her of refusing to do those tragic corpses, which had been humiliated even after death, `
`the simple kindness of covering their faces.`
`......However, Eva had spoken both calmly and correctly.`
`This horrible situation definitely wasn't an accident.`
`It was a crime.`
` ...Someone had killed them.`
` It was a murder case.`
`So, they needed to be careful to avoid disturbing the site any further...`
`"......I agree with Eva-san.`
` ...Until the police come, we should leave everything be..."`
`"...What do you say, Madam?"`
`".........You're right.`
` ...Very well.`
` Close it up.`
` ...And, just in case, we should put a different lock on it."`
`"...A different lock?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...When we came here, the shutter was locked.`
` ...That means the culprit used the key to the shutter to lock it."`
`"...Th-That makes sense.`
` So, does that mean the key that opens this shutter will have the culprit's fingerprints on it?!"`
`"......I'm sure it'll be worth submitting it to the police as evidence,`
` but Kanon-kun usually has it, and he used it to unlock the shed just now.`
` It'll probably have Kanon's fingerprints on it.`
` Also, that key was handed to Genji-san just now, and he took it with his bare hands.`
` ...It doesn't look like it'll be very useful as evidence."`
`"......That was careless of me.`
` ...My apologies..."`
`"Genji-san,`
` are there any other keys to this storehouse?"`
`"......No.`
` Only this one."`
`"So the culprit walked out of the servant room with that key,`
` and then was nice enough to return the key to where they found it...?"`
`Hideyoshi's theory sounded plausible, but was actually very strange if you thought about it.`
`Why would they go to all the trouble of returning a key they stole?`
`...No, if you think about it even more deeply, there are some points that are even more bizarre.`
`When a criminal hides a body, they're usually trying to delay the point at which it'll be found, so they can use that time to escape.`
`The six weren't necessarily killed here, but it was reasonable to assume that they were killed somewhere on this island, carried to this storehouse, and hidden to delay the discovery of the crime.`
`......And yet, the eerie magic circle scribbled on the storehouse shutter...`
`had eloquently indicated the location of the hidden corpses.`
`......Sure, it didn't explicitly mention the corpses, but six people had gone missing.`
` In that situation, someone had made such an obvious piece of graffiti and even returned the key to the shutter,`
` almost as though they wanted the corpses here to be discovered.`
`"......Anyway, we can't put all our faith in a lock that the culprit has opened once before.`
` If we want to protect this place from the culprit's hand, I think we should put a new lock on it."`
`"I think that is a good plan...`
` I agree."`
`Genji fished around inside the storehouse and unsealed a brand-new padlock that had been inside a small box.`
`"What should I do with the key...?"`
`"...I will take it.`
` I will take responsibility and hand it over to the police."`
`Natsuhi took the key to the padlock from Genji's hand.`
`After that, they all exited and lowered the shutter.`
`......And so, the corpses were once again sealed behind that shutter, which was still covered with that creepy magic circle.`
`Genji crouched down in front of the shutter to fasten the new padlock.`
`...Shutters often have a place in front where you can attach your own lock, in addition to the main lock of the shutter.`
` This was one of those types.`
`In the midst of the roar of thunder and the pouring rain, the storehouse stood there, ominously...`
`With its closed shutter still covered in a blood-like, creepy substance, it swallowed up the bodies of the six.`
`......To Natsuhi, putting the new lock on wasn't mainly to preserve the scene for the police.`
` ...She might have felt like she wanted to shut that mouth for all eternity,`
` to prevent that eerie beast from swallowing up any more victims...`
`"......Come on, let's go, everyone.`
` ...Doctor Nanjo, thank you very much for your work.`
` ...Genji, hurry and contact the police."`
`"I will do so as soon as I return..."`
`The adults left the storehouse.`
`...The ghastly magic circle drawn on the shutter kept the six bodies in its throat, `
`looming eerily as the lightning occasionally lit it up......`
`All that could be heard was the sound of the rain, the voices from the kids' TV program Maria was watching, `
`and the engrossed Maria's cackling voice.`
`In other words,`
` what greeted them as they returned dumbfounded from that horrible, bizarre scene...`
`was the voice of Maria as she rolled around laughing at the TV...`
`Those who returned to the room didn't know how to explain to Maria that her mother was dead...and were trapped by a suffocating silence.`
`At first, Maria returned their stares with a dubious look, `
`but when she realized they weren't trying to blame her for anything, she ignored them and again immersed herself in the TV program...`
`The children wordlessly sat down heavily on the sofa...`
`Their minds were probably blank from their state of shock.`
`Everyone had already cried and mourned so much, ...but now they just vaguely sat there, their faces seeming to have lost all emotion...`
`Only Kanon had returned to his usual calm expression.`
`...However, that probably didn't mean he'd been able to wipe out the shock.`
`...Nothing was reflected in his eyes as he stared into empty space...`
`Hideyoshi kept on fidgeting, and every time he remembered that horrible scene,`
` he started muttering about how he couldn't believe it, how it couldn't have been something from this world, how it must have been the work of demons.`
`Every now and then, his mutterings produced a question directed at Nanjo,`
` but the latter kept repeating in a calm, doctor-like manner that nothing could be understood by only glancing at the scene, `
`and that until the police arrived, they wouldn't learn anything.`
`However, Nanjo only appeared calm next to Hideyoshi, who simply couldn't suppress his agitation and fear.`
`In fact, Nanjo had also received a huge shock, and his face was a deathly pale.`
`Maybe that atmosphere was why she tried to rise to the challenge and take charge.`
`Natsuhi appeared to be unchanged from her normal attitude.`
`And she briskly gave directions.`
`"......I will go see Father.`
` Genji, quickly contact the police."`
`"Certainly..."`
`"I wonder if you would allow me to tag along, Natsuhi nee-san?`
` ......Since Krauss nii-san is now gone, the task of aiding Father has been left to me.`
` It would be improper of me to relax here while relying entirely on you."`
`Natsuhi was struck speechless by Eva's aggressive move in a situation like this.`
`She seemed to be claiming that, with Krauss dead, the one to take responsibility shouldn't be his wife,`
` but herself, the next highly ranked in the family.`
`...Or maybe she hadn't been at all happy when Natsuhi took command without reference to her in such an extreme situation.`
`However, even Eva's mind had been blank from shock until a moment ago.`
`...She only came to her senses after Natsuhi started giving orders.`
`"............`
`...Just do as you like."`
`Natsuhi started walking without saying a word more.`
`Eva followed behind her.`
`...As they did, Kumasawa ran into the parlor.`
`She usually wasn't the kind of person to run around, so under normal conditions, most people would have taken her entrance as sign that something was the matter,`
` ...but because everyone was still stricken with shock, they hardly even noticed her.`
`'!s1`
`...Madam, `
`...Madam......!"`
`"If you're lookin' for Natsuhi nee-san, she went to see Father.`
` She'll probably be back soon.`
` ...What happened, Kumasawa-san?"`
`'!s1`
`!d500`
`!d400`
`!d600`
`'!sd`
`Everyone thought the same thing.`
`'I hope I misheard that.'`
`...Any container can only hold so much,`
` ...and no one here would be capable of handling yet another tragedy.`
`So they all thought it.`
` 'I hope I misheard that'......`
`"...Wh-What happened...`
`...in the dining hall...?"`
`"When I went to the dining hall...`
`to set up for breakfast...`
` ......Awawawawawa... wawa..."`
`The first one to start running was George.`
`His harsh footsteps jogged Hideyoshi and Nanjo to their senses, and they chased after him.`
` Battler and the others followed.`
`They flew into the dining hall one after another, but they didn't find any change that might have caused Kumasawa to go pale.`
`...To those who had viewed that gruesome scene in the storehouse, it was a bit of an anticlimax.`
`However, Kumasawa, who had followed them, pointed it out.`
`......There really were some traces of blood remaining on the floor.`
`...Compared to that terrible scene, it wasn't very impressive.`
`...However, if you calmly thought about it, this definitely indicated the loss of a lot of blood.`
`"......There's another puddle of blood over here.`
` ......What in the world..."`
`"......It appears that a great deal of time has passed...`
` ......It's probably safe to say that they were killed here last night..."`
`"I-It definitely looks that way...`
` ...We were talkin' together in the dinin' hall until late into the night...`
` After that, someone must've forced their way in..."`
`"Dad, when did you and Mom slip out of the meeting and go to sleep...?"`
`"...Hmm...`
` It was a little past midnight...`
` ...So, `
`...we should probably assume...`
`...it happened after that..."`
`"......Are you kidding me...?`
` ......Gimme a break......"`
`"Milady, ...please, stay strong..."`
`"...Heheheheh...`
` ...After seeing that hell on earth in the storehouse, this is nothing..."`
`"......Really? Good for you...`
` I feel like my head's gonna explode...`
` ...This is the dining hall, right?`
` Every day, this is where I'd eat, complain about school, complain about homework, `
`...talk to my Dad about my grades...`
` ...That's what this place is to me..."`
`"......Milady,`
` it wouldn't be good to remain here any longer.`
` ...Let's return to the parlor."`
`"I agree...`
` ......Uncle Hideyoshi!`
` I think this room'll be really important to the police.`
` Don't you think it'd be bad if we trampled all over it?"`
`Battler proposed this in a slightly firm voice as, along with Kanon, he grabbed the pale and shaking Jessica's shoulders.`
`"......Everything is just as Battler-san has said.`
` There is nothing more to be gained from remaining in this room."`
`Nanjo spoke while looking at everyone's pale faces.`
`......Even though that horrible scene in the storehouse felt like something not of this world,`
` at least then we'd been able to leave, to cut ourselves off from that place and run away.`
` Everyone had shared in that feeling.`
`......However, this dining hall was different.`
`It was in the mansion, the main building on this estate,`
` ...and as Jessica had said, it should have been one of the most calming places even inside the mansion.`
` It was where all of the relatives had eaten lunch and dinner yesterday.`
`......The shock of seeing this place smeared with blood reminded us of that horrible spectacle in the storehouse...`
`and forced us to accept that we hadn't really been able to run away from the scene of that tragedy......`
`"...Hmm.`
` I agree too...`
` The culprit might've left traces in this room!`
` Amateurs like us shouldn't stir the place up.`
` ...Let's leave quickly.`
` Quickly, quickly!"`
`Hideyoshi also understood the meaning of what Battler had said...and pushed everyone to hurry out of the dining hall.`
`...The way we were then, looking at that blood any longer would've been too harsh.`
`Nobody went against his words.`
`Everyone raced each other out of the dining hall.`
`......It was almost as though the last person in the room would be trapped in there, all alone.`
`Once in the hallway, we lent a hand to Kumasawa, who was still trembling and leaning against the wall, and we all headed back to the parlor together.`
`...Then, Genji returned.`
`"......Oh, Genji-san.`
` Were you able to contact the police?"`
`"............As to that, I'm afraid I must apologize.`
` ...I don't know if it was a failure of the radio or something else that caused it, but..."`
`"What the... So you couldn't contact the police...?!!`
` Both the phone and the radio failed?!"`
`"...My apologies.`
` A boat will be arriving on Monday morning, and I believe we will be able to borrow their communications equipment."`
`"Isn't there a boat on this island?!`
` Can't we just take a little trip out to the Niijima Police Department?!"`
`"...Hideyoshi-san, that would be impossible with this weather...`
` At the very least, we can't do anything until the typhoon passes us by."`
`"Krauss-sama's boat is being repaired and is not on the island...`
` Therefore, we must wait for the boat coming on Monday......"`
`"H-How could this happen...?!`
` Six people are dead!!`
` The phones and radio aren't working, and there's no boat!`
` So, until the typhoon passes and the boat comes...in other words, until tomorrow mornin', we're gonna be stuck here on this island, unable to contact the police, aren't we?!"`
`"......Which means that...`
`not just us, `
`...but the criminal who killed everyone is also confined to this island..."`
`"...That certainly follows.`
` ...The culprit who killed everyone is still here on the island."`
`"...S-So the bastard who killed Dad and the others must still be hiding somewhere, unable to escape...`
` ...Damn it, dammitdammitdammit!!!`
` I'll catch that bastard, no way I'll hand him over to the police!!`
` I'll slice him to bits myself...!!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!!"`
`"....................."`
`Maria had finally realized that something odd was happening in the parlor.`
`...Rather than noticing something odd, `
`it was probably better to say she felt unhappy and neglected, since everyone was getting so excited about something only she didn't know about.`
`".........Uu-.`
` ...Jessica onee-chan,`
` did someone die?"`
`The way she spoke was completely calm.`
`...Just as though she was talking about someone who had appeared on a television drama, as though it was someone else's problem.`
`...Jessica probably didn't like that.`
`...As though trying to say 'Can't you tell just by looking at me, overwhelmed with grief?!', she flared up at Maria.`
`"They all died, everyone, everyone!!`
` My dad and Battler's parents!!`
` Gohda-san and Shannon!!`
` And even your mother, too!!"`
`"Stop it, Jessica-chan...!!`
` You aren't the only one who's sad...!"`
`"...Maria-san,`
` ...I know this will come as a shock, but please listen.`
` ...Your mother...`
`...has died."`
`"......Mama died?`
` ...Uu-...?"`
`"...Yeah, someone killed her.`
` ...I know it's sad, but stay strong..."`
`".........How many people...`
`died?"`
`"Six people!!`
` Six people!`
` ...Dammitdammitdammit!`
` How could anyone do something that cruel?!!`
` There's a limit to how cruel you can be, if you're human...!`
` I don't know who it is, but the culprit isn't human!!`
` There's no way their blood is red!!"`
`"............Uu-.`
` The culprit isn't human.`
` ...It's just the **** chosen by the ****."`
`"Huh?`
` ......Hey, Maria, `
`did you say something just now?"`
`Maria had just said something,`
` but since the words were so remotely separated from the flow and context of the conversation, I couldn't understand them for a second.`
`When I tried to ask her to repeat it again,`
` I was shocked by the sudden sound of Aunt Natsuhi's loud voice coming from the entrance to the parlor.`
`It looked like Aunt Natsuhi and Aunt Eva had returned from their trip to see Grandfather.`
`"You can't contact them, even with the radio?!`
` ......If we can't use it at a time like this, why do we even have an emergency radio?!"`
`"......My apologies.`
` It was supposed to have a maintenance inspection every year..."`
`"Wait, don't you have one of those boat signaling devices that makes a flashing light?`
` Couldn't you use that to contact the next island?"`
`"...We do not have such equipment...`
` ...My sincere apologies..."`
`Just then, Kumasawa arrived, pushing a serving cart loaded with breakfast.`
`......Since there was no way we'd be able to eat in the dining hall, Hideyoshi had ordered her to take it to the parlor.`
`"Why are we eating breakfast here?"`
`"...Aaaahhh, Natsuhi-san, ...I'll tell you later.`
` More importantly, Eva, how was Father?"`
`"Judging by the fact that he is not with you, `
`......it seems he will not leave his room, not even for a situation like this..."`
`"He wasn't there.`
` ...The room was empty."`
`"What the...`
` Where could he have gone at a time like this...?!"`
`"......Do you mean to say the Master has left his study...?"`
`"...That is correct. I was surprised myself...`
` I wonder when he left his room...`
` Do any of you have an idea?"`
`Natsuhi looked at Genji and Kanon as she said this.`
`Maybe she was trying to ask whether the servants who served directly under the One-Winged Eagle knew of a place he might go.`
`.........However, it was probably the other way around.`
`Their faces made it clear that those who knew Kinzo best...realized even more than the rest how impossible it was for him to leave his room.`
`".........Even we have no idea."`
`"...As you all know, within that study, the Master had everything from a place to sleep to a bathroom.`
` I couldn't imagine him leaving that room except for a significant reason."`
`"............In that case, what?`
` Isn't it natural to assume that one of those 'significant reasons' came up...?!"`
`"We still cannot be certain that's the case!`
` Anyway, he is a fickle person, so it's possible he went for a walk by himself, unaware of the current situation.`
` ......If that is the case, then we must act in all haste to tell him what has happened and ask for instructions."`
`"...That's right.`
` ......Although I don't want to think about it, ...it's possible something has happened to him, isn't it...?"`
`"I'd rather not even consider such a sinister possibility...!"`
`No one had seen Kinzo since the discovery of those six terrible corpses.`
`On top of that, the phones were broken, the radio wouldn't reach anyone, and there was no way to contact the police.`
`...Apparently, the typhoon would leave tomorrow and a boat would come,`
` ...but until then, no one could rely on anyone outside the island, nor could they escape the island.`
`The tragedy had hit everyone so abruptly that they'd lost all their composure.`
`...Everyone felt a heavy silence. Everyone was impatient.`
`...Even though they needed to do something, they couldn't think of anything,`
` so some of them held their heads in their arms while others got irritated.`
`.........Right now, no one could explain what was occurring on this island, Rokkenjima...`
`After that, we ate the breakfast Kumasawa-san had made, which felt dry and tasteless.`
`Of course, this was right after something like that had happened.`
`No one felt particularly hungry.`
`However, we understood logically that not eating would weaken our bodies.`
`...It would also be rude to Kumasawa-san, who had made the breakfast.`
`Kumasawa-san had taken some unusual Western vegetables, ones that Gohda-san had probably ordered for his ultra-elaborate meals, and cooked them in a Japanese style,`
` which made them turn an unpleasant color.`
`As to what Gohda-san had been planning to cook with those ingredients, `
`...right then I couldn't even imagine it.`
`If I did think about it, I'd be reminded of the way Gohda-san died, and a sour taste would fill the inside of my mouth...`
`Everyone pretended to eat for the time being, but of course, no one made much progress.`
`Then, we began pooling our knowledge of our current situation.`
`First off, ...six people, which included Uncle Krauss,`
` my dad,`
` Kyrie-san,`
` Aunt Rosa,`
` Gohda-san and Shannon-chan...`
`had been found in the rose garden storehouse as brutally mutilated corpses.`
`And yet, we still couldn't contact the police, since both the phones and the radio were unusable.`
`...So, until the typhoon passed, there was nothing we could do.`
`Furthermore, Grandfather, who we might've hoped would be able to show a little leadership in this kind of a situation, had disappeared some time ago.`
`......Gohda-san hadn't made breakfast, so Grandfather's stomach must have been empty,`
` and if he had just been taking a casual walk, we should've been able to hear him whining about how hungry he was by now.`
`And despite that, `
`he hadn't appeared.`
`......There was more than a small chance that he'd gotten caught up in this crime.`
`According to my aunts, on their way back from Kinzo's study, they'd searched for him, calling out on every floor, but were unable to find him.`
`...Considering the timing of it all, it's only reasonable to assume that this disappearance had something to do with the crime.`
`We figured Dad and the rest were probably killed in the dining hall and then painstakingly moved to the storehouse.`
` So maybe, Grandfather has already been killed...`
`and dragged to some strange place, which we simply haven't discovered yet...`
` No one actually said it out loud, but this theory seemed extremely convincing...`
`"We will go check that all of the windows and doors are locked.`
` We must also conduct a thorough search for Father.`
` The children must remain in this room...`
` Eva-san and Hideyoshi-san, I'm sorry, but please stay here with the children.`
` I'd like to ask you the same, Doctor Nanjo."`
`"...I understand.`
` I will wait here......"`
`Aunt Natsuhi followed the servants, Genji-san, Kumasawa-san, and Kanon-kun, out of the parlor.`
`All that was left was Aunt Eva, Uncle Hideyoshi,`
` Doctor Nanjo, and the four of us children, a total of seven people.`
`"Let's all stick together and maybe watch some television while we wait.`
` Though I doubt we'll find anythin' good in the middle of the day on a Sunday."`
`Uncle Hideyoshi started acting cheerfully, trying to brighten up this gloomy atmosphere.`
`"Uu-.`
` Good show, watch it, watch it.`
` Uu-uu-!"`
`"Oh, really?`
` You wanna watch TV, Maria-chan?`
` Then come and watch it with your uncle."`
`Maria was the only one who joined in.`
`...Even though Maria had been told of her mother's death, she didn't show the slightest flicker in her emotions.`
`...Was it really normal for a nine-year-old girl like Maria to act so much like a very young child...?`
`Everyone else's mood failed to improve, and they each sank absentmindedly into their sofas...`
`"......Aniki,`
` can I ask you something?"`
`"...What is it?"`
`"...Just now, in the storehouse...`
` You said something about Shannon-chan and a ring.`
` ...Did you give that to her?"`
`George-aniki didn't answer, but he hung his head and closed both of his eyes.`
` ...There could be no clearer response.`
`"Quit it, Battler.`
` ...Figure it out yourself."`
`"...You're right.`
` I shouldn't have asked."`
`".........That's right.`
` It was me.`
` ......Last night, `
`I proposed to her.`
` ...That was when I gave her the ring.`
` ...I told her that tomorrow, `
`she should put it on whatever finger she wanted...`
`as her answer.`
` ...Haha, guess it was a pretty pretentious thing to say."`
`...And that ring had been...`
`...on the ring finger of Shannon-chan's left hand.`
`".........Well, `
`...several years ago, Shannon came to me asking for advice.`
` ...About you, George nii-san."`
`"...I wonder what she could have said."`
`".........Shannon was always really bad at lying.`
` It was obvious pretty quickly that you were the one she was talking about.`
` ......She...asked whether it'd be okay for her to get close to someone, `
`...even though she was only a servant.`
` ...She asked about what kinds of things boys like, `
`what kind of clothes she should wear to make them happy, `
`lots of stuff like that.`
` .........Hmm, well, I guess you could say I felt envious, hearing her say that."`
`"......So then she was given an engagement ring, `
`...and it all ended right there?"`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, jes_1e489:`
`well, it can be the high point of your life.`
` So I'm sure...`
` Last night, I'm sure Shannon was happy...`
`from the bottom of her heart, `
`...happier than she's ever been since the day of her birth..."`
`'!sd`
`...George-aniki sighed deeply, without raising his head...`
`...Or maybe tears had risen to his eyes.`
`"......It seems Shannon was on duty in the guesthouse last night.`
` ...But...because she was too embarrassed to go back to the guesthouse with me, `
`...she went over to the mansion."`
`"...Think about how Shannon must've felt.`
` ...When you receive an engagement ring, then no matter how much warning you've been given beforehand, it's perfectly normal to get so excited that your mind goes blank.`
` ......She must've been incredibly embarrassed."`
`'!s1`
`went to the mansion, even though she hadn't been assigned there,`
` helped Gohda-san with his work, `
`and got caught up in this crime...`
` If only I hadn't...`
`given her that ring...`
`on that day...`
`in that place, `
`...Shannon wouldn't have...`
`...Sayo wouldn't have...`
`...been caught up in that crime...!`
` ...Nnngaaaaaaahh!!"`
`"Aniki,`
` that's the one place where you're wrong.`
` It's definitely wrong.`
` ...So don't cry anymore."`
`"......Aaaaaaaaaahh..."`
`"Battler-kun, `
`let's leave him be."`
`After Aunt Eva said that, I stopped talking to him.`
`...Misplaced words of comfort might actually do more harm than good.`
`Jessica sat down next to Aniki and put an arm around him.`
`Maybe only Jessica, who had known about Aniki and Shannon's love since the beginning, `
`and who had even discussed that relationship with Shannon, ...could comfort Aniki now.`
`I went over to Aunt Eva and sat down in the opposite sofa...`
`"Battler-kun, you really are strong...`
` It looks like you've kept a good hold on yourself."`
`"...Umm, well, look, the depth of the love becomes the depth of the wound, right?`
` After all, it's not like how that old bastard died has anything to do with me.`
` ...I feel bad about Kyrie-san, but...well, she wasn't actually my parent."`
`"My, my.`
` If that's so, you certainly were crying a lot back then."`
`"Well, I did think at least that much crying was due as gratitude to the parent who raised me...`
` Heheheh..."`
`".........The speed of that changeover and that dry tone must've come from Rudolf.`
` ...That kid would always get violently happy, sad, and angry,`
` but he'd always regain his cool immediately afterwards."`
`"...It's nothing like that.`
` I haven't really been able to get over the shock yet.`
` ...I think the only difference between me and everyone else...is the kinds of emotions it's stirred in me."`
`"What do you mean?"`
`I've been acting much calmer than George-aniki and Jessica.`
`That wasn't because my sadness was any less intense, or because I'd already recovered.`
`My sadness was simply getting replaced gradually with a different emotion.`
`"......Rather than sad, `
`......I'd say I'm more pissed off.`
` What bastard did this and where?`
` ...It's kinda been eating at me that I didn't get a chance to smack him upside the face."`
`That was what I really wanted to do.`
`I couldn't forgive myself if I just sat there, overwhelmed with sadness and hugging my knees.`
`"...Since the time Dad and the others were killed, this island has been covered by the typhoon.`
` ...Which means the bastard responsible for all this is still somewhere on this island."`
`"Yes, that would seem to be the case.`
` ......I wonder if they're hiding somewhere in that dark forest even now?"`
`......I felt like I'd had...`
`a very similar conversation with Kyrie-san the night before.`
`That's right.`
` After the letter from the person claiming to be Beatrice appeared at the dinner table last night, `
`...we talked about whether or not a 19th person actually exists.`
`"Aunt Eva,`
` ......do you think this murder...`
`has anything to do with the letter from Beatrice last night?"`
`"...Aah, that one?`
` ......Well, I wonder.`
` All of the siblings agreed that the mysterious letter was sent to further complicate the problem of Father's inheritance.`
` ......As to whether that and the case this morning are related, it's impossible to tell at this stage..."`
`"Was that letter really given to Maria by some witch called Beatrice?"`
`"How could it be?`
` All of it was a farce devised by Father, wasn't it?`
` He made Shannon-chan or someone wear the dress from the portrait and trick Maria-chan, right?`
` Isn't that just the kind of overly intricate prank Father would pull?"`
`"......Last night, I talked with Kyrie-san about whether Beatrice actually exists, `
`and Kyrie-san also said that Beatrice was probably one of the 18 of us."`
`"Isn't that obvious?`
` There's no one else on this island besides us, right?`
` Then there must be someone amongst us who's pretending to be Beatrice."`
`"There's no one else but us on this island, `
`you think...?"`
`"Obviously, right?`
` Are you saying there could be someone else here other than us?`
` No one is on this island except us.`
` There are only 18 people.`
` So the one pretending to be Beatrice has to be one of those 18."`
`Kyrie-san denied the existence of a 19th person by 'spinning the chessboard around'.`
`Even though Aunt Eva hadn't constructed an argument that complicated, her opinion at least was the same.`
`...Except, if that's the case, our situation starts to look very ugly...`
`At the time of Beatrice's letter, the whole thing could be passed off as a prank set up by someone or another.`
`...However, if we're assuming there's no 19th person, we can't ignore this anymore.`
`......In other words...`
`"If there is no 19th person, `
`...then the culprit who killed Dad and the others is also one of the 18, right?`
` ......So, in other words, the person who killed them is one of the people inside this very mansion right now...!"`
`".................."`
`Aunt Eva smiled meaningfully.`
`...It looked like she thought this conclusion should've been obvious from the very beginning.`
`"The culprit carried the bodies of those six into the storehouse.`
` But even that was an impressive feat, don't you think?`
` That shutter is always closed and locked, right?`
` In other words, in order to carry them into the storehouse, the culprit would need to unlock the shutter.`
` ...Understand?"`
`"...Is it possible the shutter was left open by mistake that day?"`
`"The servants said it's always kept locked.`
` In other words, unless the culprit took the keys from the servant room, there's no way they could've opened the storehouse."`
`"I wonder if the key in the servant room was the only one..."`
`"Genji-san said that was the case.`
` Which means the culprit knew where that single key was kept and took it.`
` Just now, I watched when Kanon-kun returned the key to the servant room.`
` The wall was packed with keys, and I don't think a novice would know where or what those keys went to.`
` The culprit was miraculously able to find the storehouse key among all of those."`
`"Furthermore, even though the key didn't have a tag or anything sticking to it, they knew it was the key to the storehouse behind the rose garden.`
` ...And that means they also knew where the storehouse was.`
` ......I'll say it even clearer.`
` The culprit knew the inside of the servant room well."`
`Her argument was extremely plain and clear.`
`...If the bodies had been found thrown somewhere in the bushes of the rose garden, there wouldn't have been much to go on.`
`However, if there was only one key to the storehouse in the servant room,`
` and it was stored with such a large group of keys, a novice would not be able to tell them apart.`
`This meant the culprit was someone who went into the servant room a lot and was familiar with the locations of the keys.`
`...The family members didn't normally go into the servant room.`
`...Which meant that.........`
`'!s1`
`...one of the servants is...`
`...the culprit......"`
`'!sd`
`@:dwave_eng 0, eva_1e419:`
`"...What's that?"`
`"It's reasonable to think that the culprit...no, culprits...are multiple in number and fairly well armed.`
` They'd have to be, wouldn't they?`
` They had to assault the four in the dining hall and kill them, drag a total of six bodies all the way to the storehouse beyond the rose garden, and arrange for that disgusting makeup and the graffiti on the shutter.`
` ......There's no way that a single culprit could carry out all of that on their own, right?"`
`It made sense.`
` It probably would've been possible for a single person with enough time, but it would take so incredibly long.`
`It was probably safe to assume that a significant number of people were involved.`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, but_1e833:`
`...`
`is that maybe all of the servants were in cahoots."`
`"Please keep it quiet, okay?`
` It wouldn't be right to voice mere speculation like this.`
` ...And if it really is true, what would you do next?`
` They might not let us leave here alive.`
` This is an opponent who had no trouble killing Nii-san and the three others.`
` Right now, the only ones I can count on to fight with me are the three in my family and maybe you, which comes to a total of four people, right?`
` We're no better off than they were last night.`
` ...In short, it'd be easy for the culprits to massacre the rest of us."`
`I'd been playing detective with Aunt Eva, trying to expose the person who had killed Dad and the rest before the police did.`
`...If only I could cleverly penetrate the culprit's identity and stick the proof in their face.`
`......I'd been so sure that, just like in one of those detective movies, the culprit would then give up and surrender.`
`However, the culprit would only surrender if there was no way for them to fight back.`
`The culprits behind the crime on this island were far from helpless...`
`and might even be able to massacre all of the remaining people here.`
`...And on top of that, this island was like a giant closed room, cut off from the outside world by the typhoon,`
` so they had a full day, until tomorrow, to kill, scheme and camouflage themselves...`
`In short, it wasn't a safe atmosphere where we could get very far by playing detective...`
`To the contrary, we were at a stage where we had to be scared stiff, since playing detective might displease the culprits...`
`and cause them to commit another mass murder...`
`"...Well, it is just a possibility, right?`
` ...But I can't bring myself to trust the servants yet.`
` And that doesn't mean I only suspect them.`
` Don't you think there might be some mastermind behind all this?"`
`"A mastermind?`
` Hmm, ...why do you say that?"`
`"It's just a feeling.`
` ...Think about what the word servant literally means.`
` It means someone who serves as someone else's arms and legs, right?`
` It was a bunch of Ushiromiya family members who got killed.`
` So naturally, there must be someone involved who stands to gain from that result."`
`This was also plain and clear...`
`The Ushiromiya family had been right in the middle of discussions about how to distribute the inheritance when Grandfather died.`
`If this case followed the standard form of any classic mystery novel,`
` the crime was definitely caused by someone with ties to the Ushiromiya family and who was involved in the inheritance problem...`
`Aunt Eva had probably read a few books in that genre herself.`
`...Her argument may have had a few blind assumptions in it, but it was a standard conclusion that anyone might've reached.`
`I think most people would end up suspecting the servants, even if they used different reasoning to get there.`
`Especially the story about the key to the shutter.`
` That made it very easy to suspect that one of the servants was involved...`
`"`
`............And that's why...`
`I don't like it."`
`"What do you mean, you don't like it?"`
`"Nah, just talking to myself.`
` Ihihi!"`
`I tried to dodge her question by joking, but I couldn't erase the sense of unease welling up inside me.`
`...After all, her conclusion was such an easy one to reach.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~A conclusion that anyone could reach~ib~`
`.`
`...And I just couldn't be satisfied with that.`
`...If I tried 'spinning the chessboard around' like I'd learned from Kyrie-san,`
` ...this was exactly why a servant couldn't possibly be the culprit.`
`If the servants really were the culprits, they wouldn't hide the bodies in a place connected to themselves.`
`Why on Earth would they use the rose garden shed if they were the ones in charge of the key that could unlock it?`
`The police would probably immediately pursue whoever had been in control of the key.`
`It was even possible that some other facts might come to light as a result.`
`...The more we think of the servants as the culprits, the less reason they had to carry the bodies into the storehouse.`
`...But what if they knew we'd think that, and put the corpses in the storehouse for that very reason?`
`No, that's completely impossible.`
`When the police come and inspect the scene of the crime, they'll probably be able to uncover many things.`
`No matter how carefully the culprits carried out that murder, some traces will definitely be found.`
`In other words, they had everything to lose and nothing to gain.`
`If you think about it this way and look at this murder game from the culprit's side,`
` it's hard to imagine why they'd want to call attention to the corpses.`
`Once the corpses were found, it could result in someone sending a report to the police, or it might make the remaining people more cautious, or it might make the survivors start to search for the culprit.`
` None of these things would make life any easier for the culprit.`
`...It's just like the words of the main character's mother in a novel I read recently, called 'Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni'.`
`Every story needs to have a beginning, a middle, and an end.`
` Eliminating that 'beginning' is essential for the perfect crime.`
`...Right now, we don't know where Grandfather is.`
`We don't know if he's already become a victim or if he's one of the culprits, `
`......but this state of confusion must be beneficial to the killer.`
`The culprit has absolutely nothing to gain by showing us the bodies in such a obvious way and making us all realize there's been a murder.`
`In fact, this is the perfect place to 'spin the chessboard around'.`
`In other words, showing us the corpses in such a flashy way must be the culprit's goal in and of itself.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`...So, at the very least, to the culprit, `
`~ib~the appearance of six corpses there meant ~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~more than the deaths themselves~ib~`
`.`
`In other words, the culprit wanted this murder on display.`
`To whom?`
`...To us.`
`This is a message.`
`The culprit's trying to shove something in our faces.`
`...I don't know what it is.`
`At this point in time, this vulgar mass murder isn't making me feel anything except a malice directed towards all of us.`
`'!s0`
`all of us, `
`...is it?`
`Each one of the survivors has some kind of connection to one of the six victims.`
`Uncle Krauss's death brought Jessica the grief of losing a family member.`
`The deaths of Dad and Kyrie-san brought me sorrow, `
`while Aunt Rosa's death brought Maria sorrow.`
`......Gohda-san's death probably shocked his fellow servants,`
` and Shannon-chan's death brought grief both to George-aniki, who had proposed to her, and Kanon-kun, who had loved her like an older sister.`
`......Everyone now on this island has received an equal amount of sadness.`
`Aunt Eva was sure that the servants were in cahoots,`
` ...but then, how could you explain the deaths of Gohda-san and Shannon-chan?`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`...At any rate, by this argument, `
`~ib~the grief caused by the six deaths hit ~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~everyone but Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi~ib~`
`.`
`Even Aunt Eva, who had directed suspicion at the servants and acted as though she herself was beyond suspicion,`
` could not be ruled out as a suspect.`
`...In the first place, she was able to argue that the servants were suspicious by focusing on the shutter's key,`
` ...but if you look at it from a perspective of motive and who would gain, `
`......Aunt Eva's name rises to the top of the list.`
`"...I know what you're thinking, Battler-kun."`
`"Huh?`
` Ihihi, oh no, `
`please don't tell anybody...`
`about how my head's so full of obscene stuff."`
`"I'm the one who's going to gain the most from these murders.`
` ...Since I'm going to be suspected anyway, I might as well get it out in the open."`
`I tried to dodge the issue by joking around, but apparently it didn't work.`
`"The inheritance will be divided into as many parts as there are siblings.`
` But right now, I'm the only one of the four left.`
` All of the assets of the Ushiromiya family will become mine.`
` ...Heheheheheh."`
`"If Uncle Hideyoshi heard you, he'd say 'Could you give it a rest, it's not funny'..."`
`"I'm sorry.`
` I was just fooling around, since I'm going to be suspected anyway no matter how much I try to smooth it over.`
` ...That's why, from my point of view, this murder might've been designed to cast suspicion on me.`
` ...Unfortunately, my alibi for last night is weak."`
`"Could you tell me a bit more `
`about last night?"`
`"As you know, the discussion between the siblings of how to slice up and eat the inheritance continued until late in the night.`
` But I don't know how late it lasted.`
` My husband and I had woken up early that morning.`
` We were so sleepy, and a little past midnight, they let us go.`
` We then returned to the guesthouse and rested there."`
`"...Can anyone other than Uncle Hideyoshi prove that?`
` No, wait, it's not like I suspect you or anything, okay?`
` Hihihi!"`
`"Oh, are you sure about that?`
` *giggle*`
` I don't know if it counts as proof, but when we returned to the guesthouse, we were greeted by Genji-san, who asked if we needed a towel.`
` I think that should be enough to prove we returned to the guesthouse a little after midnight.`
` ...Though, if my theory was correct, the servants would all be in cahoots, and that wouldn't actually make for much of an alibi."`
`"Hey, you've got a point there.`
` Guess that means I'm playing detective with the real culprit right now, huh?`
` Ihihi!"`
`"However, let me say this for my honor's sake: if I was after the inheritance, I'd never commit such a bizarre set of murders.`
` After all, if I just wanted to make them forfeit their rights to the inheritance, it wouldn't matter to me how they died.`
` It'd be much smarter of me to try and make their deaths look like accidents.`
` Especially if you're assuming I laid out some careful plan that involved even the servants."`
`"You've got a point there...`
` If you're killing someone for personal gain, you definitely shouldn't make it look like a murder."`
`"Exactly.`
` That's why I'm in such a blue mood.`
` ...The police will probably treat me like the mastermind and investigate all kinds of things.`
` Not fun at all..."`
`Aunt Eva shrugged with a bitter smile.`
`It was just as easy to suspect Aunt Eva as it was to suspect the servants.`
`So if we 'spin the chessboard around',`
` ...does that make it impossible for the culprit to be her, suspicious as she is...?`
`However, if that sort of argument always works, then motive can never help us in any way.`
`No, that can't be right...`
`Knowing the motive must give us powerful clues towards knowing the culprit.`
`...That's why murderers from all time periods disguise crimes in complicated ways, cleverly preventing their motives from being discovered...`
`......I don't get it.`
` ...I just don't get it...`
`Every time I spin the chessboard around, it keeps flipping from front to back and back to front...`
`...Are my thoughts bringing me closer to the truth?`
`...Or are they......`
`Aunt Eva didn't want to talk any more than that, so I folded my arms and headed to the window to cool my head a little.`
`As I looked over the parlor, I saw George-aniki and the others gathered, talking.`
`...It looked like they were talking about the magic circle that had been painted onto the shutter.`
`As Uncle Hideyoshi thought back to that time, he started drawing the shape in the margins of Maria's notebook.`
`...I see, since Maria was second only to Grandfather in knowledge of the occult, she might understand what it meant.`
`"Hmmm, I think it was probably somethin' like that!`
` There was a mark that looked like a variation of a cross.`
` And then, surroundin' the circle all around the perimeter were these closely packed strange letters on all four sides of the cross, and in the four corners, there was somethin' written.`
` It didn't look like the alphabet or somethin' like that.`
` It was what they call ancient characters."`
`"...And, around the top of the circumference, there was a small mark.`
` ...Five small circles arranged in a + sign, and straight lines connecting them..."`
`"Ah, yeah, there definitely was somethin' like that drawn there...!`
` Yep, there's no mistakin' the shape.`
` I don't understand the thin characters, but the arrangement was nearly the same."`
`Everyone was staring down at the shape, so I stared down at it too.`
`...From what I'd heard, this had been painted on the shutter to the storehouse with some material that looked like blood.`
`...I see, this sure is unsettling.`
`"...Grandfather's probably the only one who'd wanna draw something this weird.`
` ...Seriously, where did he go?!`
` I wanna grab him and ask what the hell this is supposed to mean!!"`
`Jessica's voice contained impatience and anger.`
`She hadn't gone so far as to say Grandfather was the culprit, `
`but she seemed sure that Grandfather knew something about the culprit's background.`
`......Of course, if you were searching for a link connecting the Ushiromiya family to the occult, ten out of ten people would think of Grandfather.`
`......Also, to a person who knew nothing of the occult, this strange mark would have no meaning.`
`Which meant that, ......`
`this might have been...something addressed to Grandfather...`
`That's right, and the reason the crime was shown to the survivors was so they'd find this.`
`...In that case, where had Grandfather, the essential recipient of this message, disappeared off to...?`
`"Does this shape ring any bells...?"`
`"..................`
`...Uu-."`
`Maria looked at the shape with a serious face.`
`...Maybe she was enthusiastic because this was her area of expertise.`
`...However, her appearance was that of someone separated from the events at hand, `
`...as though this thing hadn't been drawn on the shutter closed around her mother's corpse...`
`"...My first impression was that the design resembled a German Cross..."`
`"Aah...`
` It certainly does have that kind of design.`
` Does that mean it has somethin' to do with Germany?"`
`"The German Cross was originally a crest from a religious order of knights and was supposed to protect pilgrims traveling to sacred places..."`
`"...So in other words, this magic circle might have some religious meaning...?`
` This is starting to sound like gibberish..."`
`When I looked over at all of them, preparing to jump into the discussion, ...something shocked me.`
`Maria was smiling, ...an eerie and incomprehensible expression on her face.`
`...It was almost as if she was making fun of everyone's ignorance.`
` ...It was an expression I wouldn't have dreamed to find on Maria's face...`
`And, `
`...she laughed.`
`That eerie, jarring laugh...`
`was something I didn't want to believe was possible, even though I was looking at it right in front of my eyes.`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` You people aren't even close.`
` Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi...`
` Can't you tell just by looking?`
` Kihhihihihihihihihihi."`
`While everyone was busy being scared out of their wits, Maria kept on cackling happily by herself...`
`After a while, that laugh was suddenly and abruptly cut off.`
`But her expression still looked like it belonged to someone completely different from Maria.`
`"This is the seventh magic circle of the sun.`
` ...The characters are written in Hebrew.`
` Give it here."`
`"Ah, ...sure."`
`Maria stole the writing materials from the stunned Hideyoshi's hand.`
`She then started drawing another magic circle with a rustle, right next to the one Hideyoshi had drawn...`
`"...See?`
` It looked sort of like this, right?"`
`"Y-Yes...`
` It was..."`
`"...M-Maria, incredible...`
` You really do know a lot..."`
`Jessica tried to smooth things over by praising Maria.`
`Maybe she wanted to confirm that this was still the Maria we all knew so well.`
`...But Maria didn't answer her in any way in particular.`
`Maria began swiftly writing unfamiliar characters in the corners of the shape.`
`...When Uncle Hideyoshi and Doctor Nanjo saw them, their eyes immediately began to open wide...`
`"Written on the top and bottom and left and right are the names of the angels who preside over wind, fire, earth and water.`
` Chasan, Arel, Phorlakh, and Taliahad.`
` And in the four corners are the names of the four great kings.`
` Ariel, Seraph, Tharshis, and Cherub.`
` ...Is that what you saw?"`
`Even if they hadn't been able to correctly write what they'd seen, `
`...when they were once again shown something identical, it wasn't difficult for them to realize the two were the same.`
`When Maria asked them whether it matched, Uncle Hideyoshi and Doctor Nanjo nodded over and over again.`
`"There's no mistake, that's it. I'm sure there were characters that looked like that...!`
` How were you able to write somethin' like that...?"`
`"Th-There were also characters written around the circumference..."`
`"I know.`
` .........Like this, right?"`
`Maria quickly began to surround the circumference with more Hebrew writing...`
`"It's from Psalms of the Old Testament, the 16th and 17th verses of the 116th Psalm.`
` ...You must've at least read the Bible, right?`
` Kihihihihihihihi..."`
`Acting as though knowing this was only common sense, Maria laughed.`
`For a while, everyone, including me, was at a loss for words.`
`...A little later, George-aniki returned to his senses and slowly managed to speak.`
`"...That's incredible. I'm surprised...`
` ...So, what meaning does this magic circle have?"`
`"It's a magic circle to borrow the power of the sun.`
` ......He who wears it as a talisman drawn in gold shall be able to break free from the bonds of any prison and receive the power to gain freedom."`
`"...To break free from bonds...`
`...and gain freedom...?`
` It sounds deep..."`
`"The word 'bonds' is not limited in its interpretation to some kind of physical object.`
` ...Therefore, it does not only hold meaning for people locked up in an actual jail.`
` It can also refer to the release from mental bonds such as ties of obligation and inescapable fate."`
`"...Ties of obligation and...`
`inescapable fate, ...you say?`
` ...That's also pretty deep."`
`"But I really don't understand...`
` What does this have to do with those six bodies?`
` ...Far from bein' released, they were killed and stuffed in a storehouse, weren't they?!"`
`"It's not like the magic circle was drawn for their sakes.`
` The six of them were there for the sake of the magic circle.`
` It is truly pitiable.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi."`
`"What do you mean...?`
` What in the world do you mean when you say the six of them were there for the sake of the magic circle?"`
`Maria lifted up her pointer finger and waggled it as if she were making fun of us.`
`"That's written around the circumference.`
` Can't you read it?`
` Psalms, chapter 116, verses 16 and 17.`
` ...I'll read it for you.`
` 'The Lord has freed me from my chains.`
` I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call on the name of the Lord.'`
` ......See?"`
`"See, you say...`
` ......I've got no idea what you're talking about."`
`'!s1`
`they're human sacrifices?"`
`If what Maria had just read aloud was a vital part of the magic circle, `
`...then it was saying that sacrifices had to be offered in order for this magic circle to be effective.`
`...So, human sacrifices had been offered inside the storehouse, where the magic circle had been drawn......`
`A heartbeat later, everyone else seemed to reach the same conclusion.`
`...Some people were shocked, and others spat out that this was insane as they punched their knees...`
`...This was starting to get incredibly disturbing.`
`...And we couldn't accept it or understand it.`
`...I don't care what kind of magic circles or curses other people believe in, I won't pick a fight with them.`
`...But did they really kill Dad and the rest as sacrifices for crap like that...?!`
`I just couldn't stand that feeling.`
`...Compared to this, I preferred it when we were still disgusted by that theory about the fight over the inheritance...!`
`As I started getting pissed off with a feeling between anger and sadness, I broke from the circle everyone was in and returned once again to the window.`
`......Something had gone insane since yesterday.`
`There was that letter from the witch, Beatrice, that Maria had read aloud at last night's dinner.`
`...Ever since that point, it feels like we've...`
`no, like this whole mansion and this whole island have been getting more and more firmly locked inside some kind of bizarre world...`
`That's right.`
` When I think back on it, that letter was an invitation from the witch.`
`The ruler of the nighttime island had invited us inhabitants of the day into another world.`
`The phone and the radio had been interrupted and the island was shut off by the typhoon, so you really could call this place another world cut off from the real one by now.`
`...Yeah, as this island is now, it's perfectly normal for a witch to send us letters and for human sacrifices to be offered up for the sake of magic circles.`
`......So what will happen next?`
`Will some weird people wearing goat masks start doing the Bon Festival dance or something...?!`
`...Aah, it's hopeless, it's hopeless, I don't get it...`
`The inside of my head's all screwed up, and I don't even know what to think...`
`Anger, sadness.`
` The opposing emotions all swirled up together, and they started to suck me in.`
`Unable to resist, ...I could do nothing but cover my eyes with my hands and trust to my mind and body as I started getting sucked in......`
`......As I started losing heart, I began to recall a memory from when I was small.`
`It was from when I was very young.`
`I had unfortunately seen a scary occult movie on TV, and for a while, I hadn't even been able to go to the bathroom by myself.`
`...That old bastard gave an exaggerated laugh and said this:`
`......Hey, Battler.`
`Why do you think they go to all the trouble to make movies like this about demons and the occult and such?`
`It's because they don't exist.`
` ...Something that ridiculous can't be found anywhere on the planet.`
`Because they don't exist, people want to see them and go to a lot of effort making them.`
`That's why those occult movies just make me laugh.`
`If I were forced to choose, I'd say, rather than demons and monsters, `
`this year's earnings call and angry wives are 100 million times scarier.`
`I'll go further, okay?`
` From my point of view...`
`Getting scared is a recreational emotion, something for people who've got room to relax both in their hearts and their lifestyles.`
`They had so much free time, they didn't know what to do with it, so in order to entertain their mind with unusual emotions,`
` people started creating a culture with demons and the occult and stuff.`
`.....................`
`...Seriously, why have I been acting so damn thickheaded?`
`I was totally taken in.`
`......Don't try to mess with me, this is the human world.`
`I don't give a damn about witches, demons, magic circles and sacrifices.`
`The human who killed Dad and everyone else is still on this island.`
`That's all there is to it, right...?!`
`The next person who started speaking to my heart was Kyrie-san.`
`You see, in both chess and Shogi...`
`When you reach the very, very last stage of the game and get closer and closer to cornering your opponent, the number of optimal moves you could possibly make gets smaller and smaller.`
`...Therefore, if you're backing someone against the wall, `
`or if someone's doing the same to you, `
`both players' moves become infinitely easier to read.`
`In other words, when you're completely cornered and you think you have no moves left, that is the moment when it's easiest to read your opponent.`
`...However, when a person is forced into a defensive position, they can't help but lose their ability to think clearly, so they aren't able to get their minds around their opponent's moves.`
`......That's when you `
`'spin the chessboard around'.`
`With all my strength, I slapped my face with both hands.`
`......Now, my eyes were truly open.`
`When you don't understand anything, and you're completely cornered just like I am now, isn't that the perfect time to 'spin the chessboard around'...?!`
`While on the defensive, we can't even guess at the culprit's scheme.`
`...If we spin it around and look at it that way, just what might we see?`
`...First off, at the time the culprit committed the murders, they knew the island was being cut off by the typhoon.`
`Therefore, they should've understood that even if they carried out the murders, they wouldn't be able to get away early the next morning.`
`In short, the culprit had begun without securing a way to escape.`
`Furthermore, that bastard tossed the corpses in the storehouse, `
`then was even kind enough to say 'Here they are!' with that weird bit of graffiti.`
`In other words, since we'd probably find the corpses sooner or later, they 'wanted to show them to us'.`
`......If we'd all been dim...`
`and hadn't noticed the storage shed, the culprit's goal 'would not have been achieved', would it?`
`Hehe, if you think about it this way, that bastard of a culprit...`
`Since this morning, they must've been watching our every move with bated breath.`
`After all, if we hadn't been so kind as to discover what was on the storehouse,`
` all of that hard work and preparation they did last night would've just gone 'poof'.`
`What did the culprit want to make us feel by showing us the corpses in the storehouse?`
`All six of the bodies had their faces noticeably destroyed.`
`...Was it a grudge?`
` A warning?`
`The defacement of the bodies had occurred after death.`
`So it hadn't been the means by which the culprit had killed.`
` It didn't mean anything to those who had been killed.`
`...It 'did have meaning to those who found the bodies'.`
`The culprit wanted to make it appear that they had been killed so brutally.`
`Ha!`
` After thinking this way, I really wanna tell that bastard to stop taking me so lightly.`
`Who'd just dance to that tune? If you're told 'Please be scared', you can't just say 'Really? Sure thing!'`
`...When someone tells the great Ushiromiya Battler 'the entrance is right here', I'm the kind of guy who'll start wanting to sneak in through the window!`
`The next thing that had me concerned was that so-called magic circle on the shutter.`
`...As Maria, who had shown that her knowledge of the occult rivaled Grandfather's, had recognized, that magic circle was genuine.`
`They must have drawn that thing in pitch-black darkness, taking a lot of time and holding an umbrella in one hand.`
` Isn't that amount of hard work and perfectionism impressive?`
`What purpose would've been worth all of that effort?`
`...If we were looking for a fan of the occult in this mansion, most likely, all of us would naturally suspect Grandfather.`
`Did they want to 'make us think Grandfather was involved'?`
`But if that's all they wanted, they could've just drawn any old scribble that looked like a magic circle.`
`It wasn't like any of us amateurs would be able to tell the difference between genuine and fake.`
`...However, this magic circle was genuine, and furthermore, it had even been written in Hebrew.`
`......So this magic circle had a message...`
`'that could only be understood by someone with knowledge of the occult'.`
`A message is a form of communication.`
`......By sending it, they were hoping for a reaction.`
`...A reaction?`
`......For some reason, we couldn't find Grandfather now.`
`I don't know how Grandfather might've spotted the magic circle on the shutter,`
` but did he choose to hide himself in reaction to that...?`
`No, was it a trap to make us suspect that Grandfather had participated?`
`...You could read it either way, damn that's annoying.`
`...What kind of reaction was the culprit hoping to get out of us by putting on this occult show...?`
`Somehow, that felt like the culprit's weak point...`
`The letter from Beatrice that Maria had read aloud during last night's dinner sprang back into my mind.`
`...This was a freak who'd asked us to enjoy a battle of wits.`
`Isn't that interesting?`
`This is a battle of wits between us and the witch.`
`Will we be sucked up by her occult game first?`
`Or will we pull off her fake skin first?`
`...There's a whole day until the typhoon passes.`
`Why not enjoy ourselves...?!`
`I finally noticed that the inside of the parlor had gone quiet again.`
`Everyone had sunk into their favorite sofas, some deep in thought,`
` some irritated, some acting depressed.`
`Maria was once again enjoying the TV as if she'd never left it.`
`It looked like she found the commercials more fun than the boring program, and she happily yelled 'uu-uu-' and giggled.`
`I stared at each person's appearance in turn.`
`If there isn't a 19th person, `
`......the culprit must be in this room.`
`...Right now, Aunt Natsuhi's searching the mansion with the servants, right?`
`......Then we shouldn't say 'in this room.'`
`......'In this mansion'...is where the culprit has to be.`
`'!s0`
`...and we still can't deny that one of the servants might be the killer.`
`......Anyone could be guilty.`
`Still, Aunt Natsuhi and the rest sure are taking their time...`
`Of course, it's not a small mansion, but isn't this taking a little too long just to walk around, checking the windows and doors...?`
`Just as I was thinking this, Aunt Natsuhi and the rest returned.`
`Not one of them was missing.`
`...But our relief was short-lived.`
`Everyone looked at Aunt Natsuhi in shock...`
`...The talk I'd had with Aunt Eva started to creep back into my mind.`
`The possibility that the culprits had enough in numbers or weapons to kill all of those six at once...`
`"...Forgive me if I've startled you.`
` I brought this to be prepared for the worst."`
`After all, that thing in Aunt Natsuhi's hand was a rifle.`
`At a glance, its silhouette looked a lot like a hunting gun, `
`but it was unusually short and kinda looked like a kid-sized weapon.`
`However, it had a weightiness to it that made it clear it was no kid's toy.`
`"...That gun is Kinzo-san's, isn't it...?"`
`"Did you know about it?`
` That's right.`
` I remembered it was in Father's old collection, and I managed to find it."`
`"Whoa!`
` Awesome...`
` Natsuhi-san, is that thing real?"`
`"Yes, it's real.`
` It can fire live ammunition.`
` Long ago, Father used it to scare away wild birds."`
`"......Ah, that takes me back.`
` Where did you find that thing...?`
` No matter how much I asked him to let me touch it, he never let me lay even one finger on it."`
`"Oh...`
` Grandfather had one of these...?`
` I didn't know that."`
`"Long ago, Grandfather was really addicted to cowboy films.`
` That generation really liked this kind of rifle."`
`"Is that a Winchester?`
` But I've never seen one that short before."`
`"Ah!`
` I remember, it's that gun!`
` That really takes me back. That's the one Steam McQueen fired off in Wanted: Alive or Dead!!`
` Father sure has good taste...!"`
`"......It is an item the Master ordered specially from America, long ago.`
` ...As you can see, it is a working gun, so please don't tell anyone about this..."`
`"He was quite fond of it right after he managed to acquire it.`
` It seems the workings that ejected the cartridges were more interesting to him than shooting it, and he played around with it back in the forest all the time.`
` Hohohohoh..."`
`"...Still, it's rather disturbing.`
` Are you sure you should be dragging this out?"`
`"This is to prepare for the worst.`
` ...There was probably more than one offender involved.`
` Furthermore, those horrible people killed six of us, including my husband.`
` ...I have a responsibility to protect everyone until tomorrow, in my husband's place."`
`As Natsuhi-san said this, she slumped down into one of the sofas and took a deep breath.`
`She had been trying to find Grandfather, ...as well as check the doors and windows.`
`Since Grandfather wasn't with her, she probably still didn't know where he was.`
`"...I carefully checked all of the doors and windows throughout the mansion.`
` However, we must be prepared for anything.`
` Everyone, I think it would be best if we all remained here."`
`"Oh, good point.`
` If everyone's gathered here, then we can all feel more secure by keeping an eye on each other."`
`"......What do you mean by that, Eva-san?"`
`"Nothing really.`
` I'm just agreeing with your opinion, aren't I?"`
`There was a stormy atmosphere between the two of them...`
`If you think about who was the most suspicious from the inheritance problem standpoint, Aunt Eva was the obvious answer.`
`...However, there was no proof that Aunt Natsuhi was innocent.`
`......No, if you view Beatrice's letter as one of Grandfather's complicated pranks and think of this crime as just an extension of that,`
` there's more than enough reason to suspect even Grandfather.`
`Also, Aunt Natsuhi thought the criminal was on the outside.`
`...But Aunt Eva thought the criminal was on the inside.`
`In short, it was the question of whether or not a 19th person exists.`
`......That same question has been repeated endlessly since last night's dinner, with the letter from the witch who called herself Beatrice.`
`'!s0`
`or not?`
`And did the witch Beatrice exist, `
`or not?`
`If you assume that something as stupid as a witch can't exist,`
` you're basically saying that one of these relatives here, who share a common bloodline, is the culprit.`
`If that was too unpleasant, it'd be much more comfortable to simply accept the fairy tale-like character of the witch.`
`.........A witch?`
`A witch drawing a bizarre magic circle and offering human sacrifices?`
`If I could accept that rubbish, ...I'd be able to trust all the people in this room.`
`However, damn common sense got in the way.`
`...It kept repeating that witches don't exist.`
`...In that case, `
`......the culprit must be among us...`
`In the middle of the seemingly endless rain, none of us could break the silence...`
`Lunch ended, and the servants removed the tableware and went to the kitchen.`
`The wind and rain neither weakened nor strengthened, and the island remained cut off from the outside world.`
`At first, it seemed as though Natsuhi planned to stop anyone from taking a step outside the room,`
` but when it came time to prepare lunch, she finally realized this would be impossible.`
`However, in order to avoid having anyone alone in the kitchen, she told the three servants to go together.`
`Because of that, the servants were the first ones given the right to leave the stuffy parlor, which had been packed with eleven people.`
`...Since breakfast had immediately followed that terrible incident, preventing most of us from eating much,`
` everyone tore into their lunches in silence.`
`"I will wash the dishes, so you can rest a while, Kanon-kun, Genji-san.`
` ...Do you want something to drink?"`
`"......I don't need anything.`
` ...Kanon?"`
`"...I don't need anything either."`
`"You two must have been so busy, and so early in the morning...`
` It's no wonder you're worn out..."`
`The only noise was that of Kumasawa washing the dishes, which resounded throughout the kitchen.`
`Genji and Kanon sat in some chairs a short distance away, their eyes lightly closed.`
`Just as Kumasawa had said, those two had probably built up a great deal of fatigue.`
`But that didn't mean they could let it show in front of the relatives.`
`...Avoiding that was one of their virtues.`
`After the silence had continued for some time,`
` ......Kanon opened his mouth and muttered.`
`".........Shannon...`
` ......Why...did she have to die in such a horrible way...?"`
`"...Forget about the manner of her death.`
` ......It was...nothing more than bad luck."`
`"......You're right.`
` ...It was nothing more than bad luck..."`
`They both fell silent once again.`
` ...Kanon's expression was filled with grief.`
`"To think that Shannon-chan's actually dead...`
` I still can't believe it.`
` ...Poor thing...`
` ...Not being able to see her again feels like a lie...`
` I just wanted to see her smiling face one more time..."`
`Kumasawa spoke with her back facing them.`
`...After all, Kumasawa hadn't seen Shannon's corpse,`
` so she had no trouble mentioning Shannon's face.`
`...When Kanon heard those words, it reminded him again of how only half of Shannon's face had been left, and his grieving expression twisted even further...`
`"......Why did Beatrice-sama do that to Shannon...?`
` ...If she wanted a sacrifice, there were plenty of others to choose from...`
` ...Why, ...why...?!"`
`"......It was nothing more than bad luck.`
` ...If we were less lucky, you or I might have been lying out there instead of Shannon.`
` Or it could have been someone else entirely.`
` ...Everything is left to fate."`
`"Genji-sama,`
` ......you said the door to Madam's room was stained with traces of something like blood, right...?`
` The same substance that was painted on the shutter?"`
`"...Indeed.`
` ...It was an unsettling mark.`
` Almost as though someone with blood-stained fingers had been trying to pull out the doorknob...`
`no, scratch through the door...`
` ...That sort of unpleasant mark."`
`"So does this mean... Beatrice-sama came to visit Madam's room...`
`and tried to open the door,`
` but couldn't...?"`
`Genji thought back to the time he had seen those traces of blood on the door to Natsuhi's room...`
`With the substance sticking to the door around the doorknob, and the marks of something scratching against the door, `
`...it had definitely appeared as though`
` someone had tried to open the door, but couldn't...`
`'!s1`
`did the Madam avoid being chosen as a sacrifice...?`
` If only she'd been chosen, `
`...Shannon wouldn't...`
`Shannon wouldn't have had to die..."`
`Just then, a loud, sharp noise came in from the hall.`
` Both of them turned around, surprised.`
`".........That's a pretty interesting chat you're having there.`
` Let me join in too."`
`Before any of the servants realized it, Battler was standing in the doorway to the kitchen.`
`"...Battler-sama,`
` how rude of us..."`
`Genji-san and Kanon-kun stood up, surprised, and hastily bowed.`
`...But I didn't care about stuff like that.`
`I was more concerned with continuing their discussion.`
`"I told them I was going to the bathroom, so they let me go.`
` I thought I'd suffocate if I was locked up in that room any longer.`
` ...I was about to come ask you guys for some water, but then I overheard something pretty interesting.`
` ...You don't need to bow your heads or anything.`
` Please, let me hear the rest."`
`"......That just now...wasn't really..."`
`"I've been listening to you for a while.`
` Don't try to hide it now.`
` ......So I'll ask directly.`
` ...Who is this Beatrice?`
` She's supposed to be a witch from a kid's story, but it doesn't look that way now."`
`"....................."`
`Kanon-kun averted his gaze.`
`...It was obvious that he didn't want to talk about this,`
` ...which only made me want to ask even more.`
`While making an effort to smile, I grabbed the collar of his shirt.`
`"...Last night, this would've been none of my business.`
` But after this morning, everything's changed.`
` Now that Dad and the rest have been killed, this is totally my business.`
` ......I have the right to listen to this suspicious story, don't I...?"`
`I glared into Kanon's eyes as he continued to avert his gaze in apparent pain.`
`Since there was a big difference in our heights, Kanon had to stand on his toes and it looked like it hurt a bit.`
`"......Battler-san, `
`...please let go of him...`
` Kanon-san isn't really hiding anything..."`
`"Then you won't have any problem talking about it, right?`
` It's lonely being out of the loop, you know?"`
`When I tried to further twist up his collar, Genji-san cut between us and spoke.`
`...In his expression were faint traces that he'd made up his mind to do something.`
`...Apparently, he had no intention of hiding it.`
`"......I can tell you about it.`
` ...Kanon only hesitated because you might have taken it badly, Battler-sama..."`
`"Hesitating, huh? Not very manly of you.`
` Whatever it is you're talking about, it's even more unpleasant having it kept a secret.`
` ...Tell me about it.`
` It's not like we have anything better to do before tomorrow comes.`
` A slightly spooky story might be the best way to avoid getting bored."`
`Genji-san and Kanon-kun looked at each other, then nodded as though they'd decided to talk...`
`"...Understood.`
` Please ask us anything.`
` ......We will talk."`
`"Right.`
` Then I'll ask.`
` ...Who in the world is Beatrice?`
` ...All I know is that she's a witch who lives in the forest of Rokkenjima.`
` ...I've heard it's a story Grandmother or someone invented to keep people out of the dangerous forest.`
` ...Is that wrong?"`
`"......No, ...it isn't wrong.`
` It's as you say.`
` Beatrice is a witch who dwells in the forest of Rokkenjima."`
`"...Battler-sama,`
` ......I don't expect you to believe this all of a sudden,`
` ...but Beatrice-sama exists.`
` ...She is a real person, the one who gave the Master a vast amount of gold and who worked by his side for many years."`
`"Huh...?`
` Ah, come on...`
` Is Grandfather paying you to repeat everything he says...?"`
`I laughed like it was a joke,`
` but neither Genji-san nor Kanon-kun laughed, `
`...not even Kumasawa baa-chan, who was avoiding my eyes, flustered, as she started washing the dishes.`
`So, unfortunately, I was the only one laughing.`
` ...Painfully, bitterly.`
`"...I see, that's why Genji-san refused to mention it.`
` ...If you really mean it, of course I'd take it badly.`
` .........So, you're saying that a person named Beatrice actually exists?"`
`"...Yes.`
` She has been working for the Master since before the mansion was built on this island.`
` ...She has most likely been working for him even longer than I have."`
`"What do you know, Kyrie-san's theory was off...`
` ...Grandfather really did have a confidante called Beatrice.`
` ...Is that person on the island now...?"`
`"............Yes.`
` I believe that she is here."`
`"...That's a vague way to say it.`
` I guess that means you haven't seen her face today or yesterday."`
`"...That is correct.`
` .........It is extremely difficult to say, but...`
`umm..."`
`Kanon-kun once again dropped his gaze, avoiding my eyes.`
`"...Come on, don't just stop there.`
` That's like freezing an inch before the blow, right?"`
`I urged him on jokingly again.`
`...However, it looked like Kanon was still confused as to whether he should speak or not.`
`......Then, Kumasawa baa-chan whispered.`
`"...Hohohoh...`
` You cannot see her face, `
`......because Beatrice-sama has no form..."`
`"......She has no...`
`...what did you say?"`
`"Beatrice-sama has no body.`
` ...Therefore, unless Beatrice-sama wishes it, common people like us are not able to see her form."`
`"I have heard that the portrait shows what Beatrice-sama looked like back when she had a human form...`
` ...It seems he yearned for that figure so much, he would often stand in front of that portrait...`
` ...Hohohoh..."`
`"Beatrice-sama sometimes shows herself by changing her form into glittering butterflies.`
` ...On the rare occasion that you spot them somewhere in the mansion, there is a rule that you absolutely mustn't chase after them.`
` It is whispered that you will meet with disaster if you do.`
` ...In fact, there was a servant who broke that rule and quit because of a great injury."`
`"......Wait a sec, are you kidding me?`
` Are you all serious about this...?"`
`"...Battler-sama, Beatrice-sama has already arrived.`
` Such language may be unwise."`
`"Beatrice-sama does not like it when she is profaned.`
` ...If you doubt her existence, you will surely meet with disaster."`
`"Battler-san, ...you probably find this topic unpleasant.`
` But you know what?`
` Beatrice-sama does 'exist'."`
`"......She 'exists'.`
` Beatrice-sama hates people who doubt that."`
`".........Can't you tell, Battler-sama?`
` ...Beatrice-sama has already arrived here..."`
`"...Come on, quit it.`
` I'm weak against that stuff...`
` Enough with the cheap threats..."`
`However, there was no trace of a joke in the eyes of the three servants.`
`On the surface, I laughed and tried to look unconcerned, but I was quickly starting to sober up.`
`...Their eyes were also sobering up fast.`
`"...Battler-san, ...I beg that you stop profaning Beatrice-sama.`
` Please trust me..."`
`Kumasawa baa-chan, who was usually cheerful and would always tease people,`
` ......now spoke with a totally serious face.`
`"......W-Well,`
` ...even if you say she exists,`
` ...I don't see anything...`
` Are you trying to say she's standing right next to me or something?`
` Quit joking around..."`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`Just then, that unnerving laugh suddenly filled the kitchen...`
`...When I turned around, Maria was standing there by the entrance.`
`...But her expression and the feeling about her, her presence...felt exactly the same as the servants.`
`"...Whether your wavelength matches or not is determined at birth.`
` Battler, you were born with a mismatched wavelength.`
` That's why you can't see her.`
` That's why you can't meet with her,`
` and that's why you can't talk to her.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` You're the type Beatrice hates the most."`
`Maria laughed like it was funny, ...but it sounded extremely eerie.`
`...It was almost like she was laughing at me because I alone didn't understand.`
`"Do you want to know about Beatrice?`
` ......Beatrice is a thousand-year-old witch.`
` ...With all of the demons at her command, she can harness the power of alchemy to create the philosopher's stone and a vast quantity of gold.`
` Grandfather built up all the vast wealth of the Ushiromiya family by making a contract with her."`
`"...Yesterday, I read Beatrice's letter, didn't I?`
` That was real.`
` ...Well, I guess it's pointless for me to try and force you to believe.`
` ...After all, it looks like you were born without a trace of the sixth sense.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi...!"`
`"......What are you talking about?`
` Witches, demons?`
` Who told you about that...?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihi.`
` I heard it from Beatrice herself.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihi!"`
`Maria kept doing that unpleasant laugh.`
`...However, the servants who watched over this didn't even blink.`
`She heard it from...that witch in the portrait adorning the entrance hall.`
`Maria kept on laughing in a weird voice, as though this was nothing more or less than the truth...`
`"...Maria, it might be rude to ask, but I'll ask one more time, okay...?`
` Who gave you that letter yesterday?"`
`"I got it from Beatrice. How many times must I tell you before you understand?`
` ...You don't get it, do you?`
` You can't see it.`
` You can't believe it, can you?`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi."`
`Just then, Maria's laughter suddenly stopped.`
`"......Battler,`
` you still don't understand?`
` Beatrice-sama 'exists'."`
`"She 'exists', you say, ...but where?"`
`"Like I said, Beatrice-sama 'exists' here."`
`...That's right.`
`Now that I think about it, I've been feeling for a while now...that the servants' eyes haven't been pointed in quite the right direction.`
`...I'd figured they were just staring absentmindedly, but......that wasn't the case.`
`The four here: Genji-san, `
`Kanon-kun, `
`Kumasawa-san, `
`and Maria...`
` ...Everyone except me...`
`...was looking at a spot right behind me......`
`Holding my breath tightly, I slowly looked over my shoulder.`
`...Of course, there wasn't anyone there.`
`I've known that the whole time!`
`......However, everyone in the room except me was focusing on that point as if there was someone there.`
`"Beatrice is the mighty Golden Witch, who has lived for one thousand years.`
` ......But since she can't show her form to humans of the wrong wavelength, she can't talk to them.`
` ...And you know what?`
` That's really sad.`
` ...It means she truly despises it when people like you, who were born without a fragment of the ability needed to sense magic, deny that she exists...!"`
`"......You're lucky, Battler.`
` Good thing I gave you that charm yesterday, right?`
` Don't you realize what kind of curse Beatrice would have put on you by now if you hadn't been carrying it around?`
` ...You really are lucky, Battler.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi...!"`
`"......Oh, that scorpion keychain.`
` I thought that was just some cheap gift or something, but are you saying it really had some power?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihi.`
` If it weren't for that, you'd be lying in that storehouse as a sacrifice with your face crushed by now.`
` Kihihihihihihihihi, you're so lucky, Battler...!`
` Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!"`
`"...I see.`
` So if it weren't for that, I'd have been killed by now..."`
`"Battler, why don't you believe in Beatrice...?`
` Even though she 'exists'.`
` Right now, over there, look.`
` Kihihihihihihihi!`
` Hey, I'll bet you want to believe it now.`
` Believe it.`
` And thank me for giving you that charm...!`
` If it weren't for that, you'd be in the storehouse right now.`
` But then, maybe you would've saved someone else in exchange, right?`
` Kihhihihihihihihihihihi!"`
`Pfft.`
`......Right then, I burst into laughter.`
`Playing witches had been pretty fun up until a second ago, but unfortunately, that last one seemed to be too much for me to gloss over.`
`"Hahahahahahah.`
` ...Then it's all useless, isn't it, Maria?`
` If that's true, then I'm sorry, but it's all useless."`
`When Maria saw me suddenly start laughing, she stopped.`
`Even though she didn't understand what I was laughing at, she realized it wouldn't be pleasant for her.`
`".................."`
`"I thought it might hurt you, so I didn't say it earlier, but...`
` ...Well, I thought I'd put that charm you gave me in my pocket, `
`but I must've dropped it somewhere."`
`"...So the charm can't be the only reason I'm alive now, and even though I should've been cursed by the witch, I'm perfectly fine.`
` ...Sorry, but I don't believe in things I don't see with my own eyes."`
`"Sixth senses?`
` Wavelengths?`
` Magic sensitivity?`
` Sorry, but I don't believe in fake stuff like that.`
` When I hear the girls in class start talking about how good or bad their ability to sense the supernatural is, it pisses me off!`
` ...I don't know how much Grandfather is paying you, but if you're trying to talk me into joining some cult,`
` believe me, you won't be able to do it that easily."`
`".........Battler-sama..."`
`"...You guys are free to believe whatever you want.`
`'!s1`
`the one `
`who decides `
`is always me!`
`!sd@`
`I spoke forcefully and sharply...`
`Then, Maria started cackling again.`
`"Kihhihihihihihihihihihihi...!`
` Well that's just fine, isn't it...?`
` Eventually, even people like you with totally mismatched wavelengths will be able to see Beatrice."`
`"......Very soon, she will revive.`
` Beatrice will revive.`
` ...Once that happens, she's promised to talk with me and play with me a lot.`
` ...There'll be absolutely no need for you to doubt or for us to force you to believe.`
` ...She will appear, very soon.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihi...!"`
`After a meal, some people tend to head to the bathroom, while others prefer to relax for a bit.`
`It seemed that several people had left the parlor, just like I did when I went to the kitchen to drink some water.`
`In the end, Aunt Natsuhi reluctantly retracted her order that everyone remain packed into the parlor,`
` on the condition that no one headed out on their own or strayed too far.`
`In any case, if eleven people are shut up in the same room starting early in the morning, the air will start to stagnate.`
`...Also, quite some time had passed, so everyone was starting to recover from the shock of that morning, and their sense of danger might've been weakening too.`
`...However, it was a certain fact that six people had been killed inside this mansion,`
` so no one was completely negligent.`
`So whenever they went out into the hallway for a breath of fresh air, trying to act tough,`
` ......they would quickly get scared of standing there, isolated, and would eventually return to the parlor.`
`...I guess it's like 'The North Wind and the Sun'.`
`If you force someone to stay shut in, they'll resist, but if you tell them to do whatever they want, they'll come back obediently.`
`People really do like not doing what they're told.`
`...When the servants finished cleaning up from the meal, `
`they returned obediently to the parlor, just as Aunt Natsuhi had told them to, and sat on a sofa near the entrance, patiently awaiting orders.`
`Maria, almost as though she had suddenly finished playing witches,`
` had returned to the pure Maria I knew well, saying 'uu-uu-'.`
`...What in the world happened back there?`
`.........I hadn't felt even an atom of the 'presence' of this person called Beatrice, who was supposedly standing behind me, invisible.`
`...However, it felt like I'd glimpsed a little of that presence inside Maria...`
`"You're right.`
` When Maria starts talking about witches, her personality changes.`
` ...Battler-kun, you also saw it down by the beach yesterday, right?"`
`"You mean that scorpion keychain?`
` ...No, I don't mean like when her feelings were hurt,`
` I'm talking about her having a dual personality or something."`
`"Yeah, that happens sometimes too.`
` ......That thing Maria did when she was talking about the magic circle does happen every now and then.`
` It's freaky though."`
`Apparently, Jessica had spotted that 'Kihihihihihi' Maria a few times.`
`I just happened to catch it at a bad moment...and was pretty freaked out seeing it for the first time...`
`"So what is that?`
` Does Maria have a dual personality or something?`
` Or are you saying that her spiritual sense really is that strong, and she's being possessed by a spirit or whatever?"`
`"...No, I don't think it's that.`
` Haven't you ever experienced it?`
` When you were small, didn't you ever want to be someone other than yourself?"`
`When humans are born, no one has any individuality.`
`However, when they reach their growth period, their sense of self starts to be born.`
`They want to be different than other people.`
`...But since everyone else in their class is learning the same things at the same rate and being forced into the same lifestyle,`
` of course they aren't going to find anything that makes them different from everyone else around them.`
`Once they realize that, the first thing they do is to start breaking the rules, in what's called their rebellious stage.`
`Since everyone else follows the rules, they want to show off their individuality by breaking them.`
`...So even those who try to act tough, mocking everyone around them and calling them childish...`
`can actually be viewed as cute kids searching for themselves, if you look at it this way.`
`...Well, I'm lecturing about all this like I'm so smart, but I actually got it secondhand from George-aniki.`
`I myself was one of those embarrassing guys who thought it was cool to act like a little bastard...`
`Well, that was when I was at the age where you try to show off for the opposite sex.`
`"The main feature of the growing period lies in an impulse to break away from your life as a kid, like a chick trying to crack open the shell of their egg.`
` Do you know what makes children and adults different?"`
`"Age?`
` Or do you mean size?"`
`"No, it's experience.`
` Adults can look down on children because children have very little life experience.`
` The reason they snort at everything children say...is because they think kids know nothing about the real world."`
`"Yeah, I understand that.`
` When you're a kid, you talk like you've got life all figured out somehow, trying to act like an adult.`
` ...No matter what kids say, adults just snort at them and say they're too naive, or that they'll 'understand when they get older' or something.`
` ...Well, it's probably true, but to a kid, it's just annoying, like they're being looked down upon."`
`"...I get it.`
` It's a question of knowledge and experience.`
` ...Well, I guess you're right that there's no reason to respect a person for their age if they've just wasted their lives."`
`"Therefore, during the period when they try to separate themselves from other children, they also try to take on personality traits different from those around them.`
` And if knowledge and experience is what separates kids and adults..."`
`"......I get it, if they know something no one else knows, it becomes part of their identity."`
`"You know, when I was in elementary school, I'd learn things no one else knew,`
` get things no one else had, wear things no one else wore, and became a bit of a hero for it.`
` I'll bet you've done the same thing, Battler."`
`"Yeah, yeah.`
` There was definitely an age when I wanted to excel in some skill or other.`
` ...I see, so that's because I was trying to separate myself from being a child, ...or going through my growing period, in other words."`
`"If you put a positive spin on it, the growing period forces you to separate yourself from others, thereby pushing you to gain skills and knowledge no one else has.`
` ...This is also interesting from a sociological standpoint.`
` Because people hate being like everyone else, they try to learn skills other people don't know.`
` In this way, society can acquire the broad range of skills it needs to survive.`
` ...The quality of the gods' programming is truly surprising."`
`"Well, unique personality traits can also be negative, right?`
` Like if, say, everyone in the class was studying hard, but I was the only one slacking off, trying to stand out."`
`...Okay, that last bit really was true about me.`
`It's only recently that I've been able to thank the middle school teacher who slapped me after school.`
`"But, well, I'd try to jump over things no one else could,`
` sprint as fast as I could, trying to lap those guys with good grades when we did a marathon. I just felt like doing it.`
` ...It was in my nature that, if I couldn't study well, then at least I could get back at them by exercising.`
` ...I see, so I really did go through a proper growing period."`
`"I guess boys really do tend to focus more on physical stuff.`
` But you know? Girls of the same age tend to focus more on mental, spiritual things.`
` ...I'll bet there were groups of girls in your classes that got really interested in fortune telling and their spiritual senses."`
`"Yeah, yeah! There were, there were!`
` They'd come over, asking me for my sign and my blood type! And then they'd laugh 'Aah, I thought so, *giggle*giggle*!'`
` It really got on my nerves.`
` No matter which class you go to, girls like fortune telling.`
` Deciding whether your spirit sense is strong or weak, what your sensitivity is, whether you can see the unseeable. That kind of thing definitely happened to me."`
`"That's because fortune telling and spiritual senses are things that aren't taught in school.`
` To girls, who tend to be more introverted, `
`it's a genre that's easy to build an identity upon, and one that holds a lot of interest for them."`
`"Just like how, when boys enter their growing period, they start acting tough and rebel against adults,`
` when girls enter their growing period, they start getting interested in that kind of thing.`
` ...Well, I didn't though!"`
`"...So, Maria having so much interest in the occult isn't that rare among girls her age?"`
`...Even if we accept that, ...I wonder if it explains that creepy dual personality thing...`
`.........Actually, I think I probably could accept that explanation, more or less.`
`"As you just said, becoming an adult means gaining knowledge and experience.`
` So, to gain that, it's necessary for children to learn all sorts of things and break free from childhood.`
` ...However, there are certain 'convenient' delusions that you see often in the world of children, both now and in the past.`
` Do you know what I mean?"`
`"You see it all the time in manga and anime, right?`
` It's kinda like that.`
` Like you've got memories from a previous life that start to resurface.`
` Like you're being possessed by the soul of the great something, or whatever."`
`"Ah, or it could be that a sleeping gene gets awakened,`
` or maybe a sealed power or memory returns. There's all kinds.`
` For some reason, stuff like that's really popular at that age.`
` ...Why's that?"`
`"All of those examples you've just mentioned are illusions that let children immediately add to their sum of knowledge and experience.`
` If a nine-year-old girl says she has a thousand-year-old witch possessing her,`
` then she gains a 1009-year-old identity."`
`"So, basically, studying is annoying.`
` But these delusions are 'convenient' for people who wanna brag about having a skill no one else has, amazing the people around them."`
`So you could brag about something without having to work hard or study.`
`...I see, isn't that a kid's greatest dream?`
`"Furthermore, in their desire to separate themselves from being kids, they always project an image of their ideal self,`
` and it's not rare for that desired self to become an alternate personality.`
` Even you, Battler-kun, probably had a slightly different personality at home and at school, right?`
` It'd probably be embarrassing if your friends at school saw how you were at home.`
` At school, you try to project yourself as you want to be, but home is where you're your true self."`
`"......So, in other words, I'm changing my personality depending on the situation.`
` ...Are you trying to say having multiple personalities is actually really common?"`
`"A girl who's a fan of the occult might say she's being possessed or 'awakened'.`
` Honestly, there are some kids who change their personalities so much it's creepy.`
` ...And some boys do it too, right?`
` Guys who say they've blown their top and suddenly turn into some overplayed violent character.`
` I'll bet they think it's pretty cool, but it's painful to watch."`
`"Let's sum this all up.`
` ...So you're saying...that even if a girl about Maria's age shows a creepy second personality like she did a minute ago,`
` it isn't such a rare or unusual thing...?"`
`"Simply put, that's right.`
` ...Identity is an important factor when building up one's sense of self.`
` If you make fun of it, it could actually cause children to go back into their shells.`
` So it's important to go along with them to some degree.`
` ...Although the broad-mindedness of the parent determines whether they play along in full or not."`
`"...Aniki, I can't believe you're single...`
` You sound like you've already raised kids through middle school.`
` ......So, I wonder if Aunt Rosa also knew much about Maria's dual personality."`
`"She knew about it.`
` ......Just between us, Aunt Rosa really hated it.`
` She said it was unpleasant and that Maria was becoming increasingly isolated from the rest of the class.`
` So any time Maria started talking about the occult or laughing like a witch, she'd slap her.`
` ...And it looks like Maria stopped talking that way in front of her."`
`......Maybe that thing back there...`
`was just a little game from a girl facing her growing period.`
`Just a girl trying to show that she was different and independent by holding interest in witches and the occult.`
`...And since she wanted to be different from herself, young as she was, she was switching between her normal personality and the personality of her ideal, a witch.`
`......At first, I'd found that very disturbing,`
` but after being lectured by George-aniki, it felt like this was a path everyone walked down at one time or another.`
`......I haven't told anyone, but when I was in kindergarten,`
` I joined up with a little gang of kids trying to form an Earth Defense Force, saying we'd help protect peace on earth.`
`My face turns red when I remember how, during what we called battle practice, we would chant 'EDF! EDF!'...`
`Just like usual, Maria was relaxing,`
` immersed in the TV, 'uu-uu-'ing and laughing just like any girl her age.`
`...But on the inside, another personality, that of the ideal witch she respected and blindly accepted, was sleeping.`
`But that wasn't anything extraordinary. It was perfectly natural for a girl of her age...`
`......I've calmed down a little.`
`The shock from my bizarre experience in the kitchen just now is fading away.`
`...If I hadn't talked to Aniki and Jessica, I might still be frightened by the idea that an invisible witch is standing right behind me.`
`...However, ...can I really accept that as an explanation for what happened back there?`
`If it had just been Maria, I could've explained it as the fickle delusions of a growing girl.`
`But Genji-san, Kanon-kun, and Kumawasa baa-chan had also been there.`
`None of them had denied what Maria said.`
`......They silently accepted that Beatrice 'exists'.`
`I was starting to feel a little uneasy...`
`Aunt Eva's position was that no 19th person existed, `
`that the crime was an inside job tied to the family quarrels.`
`On the other hand, Aunt Natsuhi's position was that the culprit was hiding somewhere outside the mansion.`
`So she rejected the possibility of an inside job and supported the idea that a 19th person existed.`
`And in the kitchen, Maria and the servants had also supported the idea of a 19th person.`
`But according to them, this 19th person isn't human.`
`......They said it was an invisible witch, carrying out some mysterious plan.`
`Is there a 19th person...or not?`
`And is the culprit human...or a witch?`
`For some reason, I couldn't just laugh off any of those possibilities.`
`...Not even the most ridiculous story about the witch.`
`"......Jessica, `
`@:dwave_eng 0, but_1e989:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, but_1e990:`
`".........Hmmm...`
` I feel the same way you do, okay?`
` I think it was just a stupid ghost story that parents made up so their kids would listen to them.`
` ...But I can't deny that the atmosphere inside the mansion makes it a little hard to say it out loud..."`
`"...After all, Grandfather has proclaimed that Beatrice exists.`
` And because of their position, the servants can't doubt that.`
` Even Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi don't want to get into a fight with him, so on the surface, they go along with it.`
` ...So, it's probably fair to say that doubting the existence of Beatrice is taboo to those who live and work in this mansion.`
` Unlike the rest of us, who only come here once a year.`
` ...Is that right?"`
`Jessica took a deep breath in admiration...`
`It looked like Aniki had guessed right.`
`"...It's just like you say.`
` No one really believes it on the inside.`
` ...But on the outside, they accept that she exists.`
` See, it's just like the way some people are about God.`
` Even if they know God doesn't exist, they feel like it'd be uncouth if they actually said it out loud..."`
`"......How do you think the servants feel about it?`
` Are they just going along with it because Grandfather, their employer, says that she 'exists'...?"`
`"Well...`
` I don't really know the details, `
`...but between the servants, the story about Beatrice has been treated like a sort of ghost story.`
` ...Remember yesterday? When Shannon was talking to us down by the beach?`
` That story about how one night, when she was doing the rounds in the mansion, she saw something unsettling?"`
`She did say something like that, didn't she...`
`Back then, I thought she was just being really nice to help improve Maria's mood,`
` ...but it felt like she was serious when she said it.`
`...That's right, she definitely said it.`
`...She definitely said the same kind of thing that Genji and the rest had all unanimously declared back in the kitchen...`
`"In addition, some servants have also seen will-o'-the-wisps and glittering butterflies dancing around.`
` ...Kanon-kun also saw something like that when he went patrolling one night.`
` And recently, you often hear servants talking about strange footsteps heard inside the mansion near midnight.`
` We've whispered together that the Beatrice-sama in the portrait sometimes makes herself invisible and walks through the mansion.`
` ...It happened a while ago, but even I have heard footsteps while patrolling at night that resemble these stories."`
`...That's right, she definitely said that.`
`Exactly the same thing that I had been told just now.`
`"Ah, ...but there's nothing to be afraid of.`
` Beatrice-sama is another ruler of this mansion, separate from the Master.`
` So, there's no need to be unnaturally afraid. If you respect her, I hear she won't do anything bad."`
`"However, she can be quite terrifying if you don't respect her, right?"`
`"...Correct.`
` I've heard that, just before I began working here, `
`someone who spoke badly about Beatrice-sama fell down the stairs and quit after receiving a large injury to their back.`
` Because of that, there was a rumor between the servants that Beatrice-sama's anger had been brought down upon this person..."`
`"...If you don't respect her, you'll suffer her wrath and get hurt.`
` ...So, to the servants, `
`@:dwave_eng 0, but_1e995:`
`Of course, even though everyone accepts that curses and the like don't exist in the modern era,`
` ...people are still afraid and still have a little respect for them.`
`You often see it when, in a residential area, someone is building a house, and they call a Shinto priest for a ceremony to honor the god of that plot of land.`
`...You might think that was just a big waste of time and money,`
` but it is said that if the workers don't do that, a big accident will occur, so they never neglect to do it.`
`You also hear about how, if an Inari shrine is carelessly removed during a town re-planning,`
` there'd be a curse by Kitsune-sama.`
`I think I might've read somewhere that when the occupying forces were trying to expand an airport, they tried to remove an Inari-san that was in the way, `
`and the workers kept getting struck down by mysterious fevers.`
`Even in modern cities like Tokyo, it wasn't rare to see modern buildings packed all around an old Inari shrine, leaving the shrine itself untouched.`
`And this wasn't limited to Japan.`
`It's probably similar to how foreigners baptize babies.`
`If I remember right, by Christian doctrine,`
` if unbaptized souls have even the slightest amount of sin, they will still go to hell.`
`Putting water on a child's forehead doesn't do anything but make them cry.`
`But if by doing just that, parents can prevent their children from going to hell, they will happily go through with that ceremony.`
`......In short, even in this modern society of reason,`
` we were still unable to throw away every trace of belief and fear.`
`...You could even say that we accept certain sorts of supernatural things, though in a passive way.`
`Maybe the only difference on this island is that Beatrice is the object of that worship...`
`"...So, in other words,`
` if anything happens that doesn't seem explainable in human terms, it's called the work of Beatrice.`
` ......I think Shannon-chan said it herself.`
` Windows and doors and locks that were tightly shut would be open the next time you went to check them.`
` Lights that should've been on went out, and lights that should've been out were turned on."`
`"...And if I remember, even Jessica was joking about it, saying it was also the work of Beatrice when she couldn't find her bag in the morning."`
`"Your memory's pretty good.`
` ...Normally, you'd say some little imps took them, but on this island, it's Beatrice.`
` Well, it's all pretty stupid though."`
`"This mansion has been standing for about 30 years by now, hasn't it?`
` It's natural for things that old to get their fair share of ghost and occult stories.`
` Like the seven mysteries at a school."`
`"...But that's where I'll...`
`'spin the chessboard around'..."`
`"Huh?"`
`"......Simply put, on this island, there's a rule that Beatrice gets blamed for anything that couldn't have been done by humans.`
` Things that humans can't do.`
` ...How many humans are here?`
` 18.`
` ......In other words, the culprit is using the rules of this island to make it look like a witch committed this crime.`
` Which proves that they desperately want us to think a 19th person did it.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` .........`
`~ib~I don't like it~ib~`
`.`
` I don't like it one bit."`
`"What do you mean, you don't like it...?"`
`"......Let's assume some invisible 19th person exists and wants people to know they exist.`
` ...If it were me, I'd do it with even more perfect timing."`
`"......What do you mean by perfect timing?"`
`"...Well,`
` the crime took place sometime between the middle of the night and dawn, right?`
` We had some people who were talking together until the middle of the night, some people on night shifts, and some people who'd returned to their rooms and were sleeping.`
` ...Everyone's alibi is really vague, so there's plenty of room to suspect that the crime was an inside job.`
` George-aniki, Aunt Eva probably told you too, right?`
` That there's a good chance this crime was an inside job?"`
`"...Nng, ......yes.`
` ...I guess."`
`"...In other words, if this invisible 19th person really exists and wants to let us know it, this first crime was a complete failure.`
` ...No, in the first place, they chose the wrong time of day to do it.`
` If this invisible 19th person really wanted to show themselves,`
` they had to make sure that the crime took place`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~under conditions which proved that the remaining twelve people were all innocent~ib~`
`."`
`"As long as there's a single human we can suspect, this 19th person's attempt to highlight their presence fails.`
` That's why near midnight, when everyone's alibis are at their vaguest,`
` the 19th person's existence is also at its vaguest.`
` And yet, the culprit chose to commit the crime at that time."`
`"...By committing the crime then, one of the 18 would obviously be suspected.`
` ...And yet, someone handed Maria the letter and called themselves a witch, even though everyone denies they did it."`
`"In other words, ...you're trying to say that one of the 18 is trying to make it look like a 19th person called Beatrice exists...?`
` That's a pretty crazy idea...`
` ...I think Mom's theory about someone hiding outside the mansion is a bit more credible...`
` ...Battler, don't tell me you actually think someone in this room is the culprit..."`
`"I do.`
` ...Someone's trying to force us to accept that Beatrice exists.`
` ...That's right, this whole thing started as far back as the letter last night.`
` ...I don't have any basis or proof, `
`...but with the chessboard turned around, this is my best guess."`
`"...Seriously, that's too crazy...`
` You sure you haven't been reading too many weird detective novels...?"`
`"However, it's an angle we can't ignore.`
` ...Whether there's a 19th person or not, `
`the culprit's definitely planning something involving that rule about this island.`
` ...Just now, listening to Battler-kun talk, I remembered something that's a little disturbing."`
`"Something disturbing...?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...Do you remember?`
` Beatrice's letter.`
` ...It said that Beatrice was going to collect interest.`
` And by interest, it mentioned 'everything of the Ushiromiya family'."`
`Jessica and I thought back on what Maria had read aloud the previous night...`
`"...Yeah, it said that.`
` It definitely said that.`
` That the collection of the interest was gonna take place shortly, but if the riddle of the gold could be solved, she'd lose that right."`
`"...Grandfather received the gold and rebuilt the Ushiromiya family.`
` In other words, according to Beatrice, everything created using the gold as capital counts as part of the interest.`
` ...Which means..."`
`"......That's pretty scary for a joke, Aniki...`
` ...You don't mean...everything of the Ushiromiya family,`
` ...in other words, everything that Grandfather gave birth to,`
` ...in other words, everyone with Grandfather's blood flowing through their veins...?!"`
`"If you interpret the letter that way,`
` ...these murders are just Beatrice legitimately collecting interest.`
` ...If that's the case, these crimes will continue.`
` ...Because the collection of interest is still only halfway completed."`
`George turned around, looking over the parlor.`
`...There were still many people who held the name Ushiromiya.`
`And because Gohda-san and Shannon-chan had been killed,`
` we knew that not even the servants were safe, despite lacking the Ushiromiya name...`
`"S-So are they planning...`
`...to kill us all...?`
` ...But that's weird, George nii-san!`
` In that case, why only six people?`
` They should've been able to kill a lot more.`
` At worst, it should've been possible for them to assault everyone while they were sleeping and kill them in a single night.`
` Why didn't they do that?!"`
`"......The special clause.`
` ...If someone manages to solve the riddle of the gold, their right to the interest will be lost.`
` ...And remember how the letter ended.`
` ...It challenged us all to solve the riddle of Grandfather's gold."`
`"Jesus...!`
` ...It looks like we're finally understanding the culprit's message...`
` In other words, the culprit's telling us to try and solve the riddle on that epitaph Grandfather had made.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~......On top of that, they're saying that if we just sit around, they'll keep collecting the interest~ib~..."`
`I realize this is all based on several guesses that are 'way out there'.`
`...But not everything that happens in this world fits together in a perfect line.`
`...Most of the events we don't understand are only individual points.`
`...By fitting them into a straight line, we're beginning to understand.`
`When the points at either end of the line are really close, the line itself is more logical and easier to understand.`
`...And when those points are really far away, the opposite is true.`
`It's the distance between these points that makes us say our guesses are way out there.`
`...However, if the distances we span are too narrow, that means our thinking will be narrow too.`
`Is there a difference between making guesses and reasoning?`
`Am I just using easily-made guesses to try and force this crime into a pattern I can understand?`
`No, that's not it.`
`When you're lost in the dark and searching around with your hands, what you're doing is relying on your imagination and making guesses.`
`Only imagination can find the points that need to be tied together.`
`...Reasoning is nothing more than the act of drawing lines between them.`
`If you can't imagine, you can't reason.`
`...What I'm doing now might be way out there, ...but I'm sure it isn't a mistake either.`
`Only the power of imagination can pull clues out from the darkness.`
`...And then I can use the power of reasoning to tie those clues together.`
`...It was a lot like the process of searching out an enemy's weak spot and striking.`
`It's okay if I'm way out there.`
`Find a weak point first.`
`Then we can think about how to strike!`
`Right now is the time to find points we can tie together later...!`
`For the time being, I put aside whether a 19th person existed...`
`and announced our theory that the goal of the culprit might've been to make us solve the riddle of the epitaph.`
`Uncle Hideyoshi seemed to be extremely interested, but Aunt Natsuhi said it was ridiculous and dismissed it.`
`"Of course.`
` If you think about it that way, even that letter from yesterday makes sense.`
` That motive seems to fit pretty well with the facts...!`
` Settin' aside whoever it was that gave Maria-chan the letter."`
`"Uu-!`
` Beatrice exists!!`
` Uu-."`
`Even though she was puffing up her cheeks in that cute way she'd been doing since yesterday, ...I couldn't think of it as cute.`
`...If I poked fun at her, it might suddenly transform into a creepy laugh...`
`"...There is no hidden gold.`
` However, if the culprit is blindly sure of its existence,`
` and if they're trying to make us solve the riddle before snatching the gold away for themselves, then I will agree it makes sense."`
`"However, if that were the case, why would they start by killing those most highly ranked in the Ushiromiya family?"`
`"......I see your point.`
` If they wanted to make us solve the riddle, killing those closest to Kinzo-san doesn't sound like a good plan to me."`
`"That's true enough...`
` And if we're going with that argument, wouldn't it have been quicker to threaten Father in the first place?`
` You'd think it'd be faster to just ask the person who wrote it, rather than try to force us to solve it."`
`"You've got a point there.`
` ...Still, I think it'd take more than your average threat to make Father spill the beans."`
`"Anyone who knows Kinzo-san well would probably realize that he won't bow to ordinary threats..."`
`"...He's the man who bears responsibility for the Ushiromiya family and all its vast wealth.`
` He's been exposed to many threats and attacks in the past.`
` The family only prospers today because he was able to overcome all of them."`
`"That's freakin' right.`
` I can't even imagine our Grandfather obeying someone 'cause of a threat!"`
`"...Jessica, watch your language."`
`"......Nnng, `
`...yes, Mom."`
`"In that case, ......what about this idea?`
` ...No wait, is this one...also way out there...?"`
`...I couldn't hesitate.`
`Out-there ideas are like bows and arrows.`
`...It might be hard to hit with, but it's a great weapon, because you can hit enemies far away.`
`...They say most people who've died in battles were killed by arrow wounds.`
`...In a battle, you can't just shoot off one arrow.`
`You shoot a whole bunch of arrows at once, pushing forwards towards the enemy troops with a wall of them.`
` ...So keep shooting, over and over!`
`'Create a wall as you push forwards towards the truth...!'`
`"If the culprit is after the hidden gold, forcing us to solve the riddle wouldn't be very efficient for them.`
` It'd be much quicker and easier to ask the person who made it in the first place.`
` ......In that case, the question is,`
` ...is this all a message directed at Grandfather?"`
`In other words, these murders were a threat made against Grandfather.`
`...If he didn't tell the culprit where the gold was, his family members would be killed off one by one.`
`What if we weren't the only ones being forced to solve this riddle...?`
` ...What if Grandfather was too?!`
`If you think about it that way, it explains Grandfather's mysterious disappearance.`
`If the culprit has already attacked Grandfather, then judging by the state the six corpses were left in,`
` he should've been left on display somewhere with that horrible makeup added.`
`But despite that, we still haven't found him.`
`...So does that mean Grandfather has been kidnapped and is being held somewhere?!`
`"......How could...?`
` ......You aren't saying, how could...?!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*`
` That sounds interesting.`
` ...So Grandfather's being confined somewhere,`
` and the culprit's saying we'll be killed off one by one if he doesn't tell them where the gold is?"`
`"It pains me to imagine how you find that interesting...!"`
`Aunt Natsuhi glared at her, but Aunt Eva just smiled calmly.`
`"......Since we still haven't seen him after all this time, I think it's almost certain that Grandfather's gotten caught up in the crime.`
` If you think about it, you can't just ignore Battler-kun's theory, right...?"`
`"Be quiet, George.`
` ...In the first place, when did Father actually disappear?"`
`"...Who was the last person to see Father?"`
`"......It was probably me.`
` This morning, when we didn't know where my husband and the rest were, we discussed the possibility of them being in Father's study,`
` and I went to check his room and greeted him there.`
` ......Come to think of it, I've been holding the key to his study this whole time, haven't I?`
` Genji, let me return this to you."`
`Aunt Natsuhi pulled out the gold key and handed it to Genji...`
`Looking at the key, Aunt Eva giggled...`
`"...Hey, Genji-san,`
` I'm sure the police will inspect Father's room thoroughly.`
` ...If there's anything hidden there, it'll just be exposed anyway.`
` ......So maybe it'd be better if you just told us about it right here, right now."`
`"......What are you talking about?"`
`"It's simple.`
` ......Father's study is a closed room, with no way in or out except for that key, right?`
` I want to verify whether that's true.`
` There is one entrance to Father's study.`
` What about the window?`
` Any other entrances or exits?"`
`"......There are none.`
` There is no way to get in except the entrance."`
`"You're sure about that?`
` There isn't some secret hidden door or anything?`
` ...Since Father isn't here, I am the highest-ranked member of the Ushiromiya family.`
` I am asking you as a representative of the Ushiromiya Family Head.`
` Remember that when you answer me.`
` Are there any ways in or out of that room other than the main entrance?`
` ...As Father's closest aide, I'm sure you would know."`
`Aunt Natsuhi looked a little offended at the part about the 'highest-ranked family member',`
` but she kept her mouth closed for the time being and waited for Genji's answer.`
`...I couldn't help but feel a little uncomfortable.`
`Why was she going on and on about hidden doors...??`
`"You, too, Kanon-kun, Kumasawa-san. If you know, won't you tell me?`
` If there is one, it'd be better if you said so.`
` ...Otherwise, a certain person might be driven into a corner in a second.`
` ...If we assume that there is a hidden door, then my argument comes to nothing."`
`Aunt Eva didn't specify which person was about to be driven into a corner,`
` ...but following the flow of the conversation, I had to feel that she was referring to Aunt Natsuhi.`
`"......Mother, what are you talking about?"`
`"George, stay quiet for a bit.`
` ......What do you say?`
` Genji-san?`
` Kanon-kun?`
` Or Kumasawa-san?`
` Is there a hidden door?`
` Or not?`
` Genji-san, when you remodeled Father's study, you must have overseen the construction.`
` I won't let you say you don't know."`
`"......There is nothing like that in the Master's study."`
`"You're sure?`
` What about Kanon-kun, one who's allowed to wear the One-Winged Eagle?"`
`"...That's right.`
` I'm sure.`
` ...There is no such hidden door in the Master's study."`
`"Kumasawa-san?"`
`"...N-No, I haven't heard of such a thing..."`
`"What about Doctor Nanjo? You've had a close relationship with Father."`
`"...I-I have never heard of something like that..."`
`"Very well then!`
` So, are you ready?`
` Let me begin.`
` It's very simple."`
`Everyone tilted their head doubtfully, wondering what Aunt Eva was starting to talk about so proudly.`
`...Aunt Eva laughed triumphantly, as though she were about to reveal a secret only she knew.`
`"Natsuhi nee-san was the last person to spot Father, right?`
` ...I forget the exact time, but I think it was a little before 9:00 in the morning.`
` ...Nee-san, do you remember?`
` I ran into you just as you were coming out of Father's study, right?"`
`"...Yes, I remember.`
` What does that have to do with anything?"`
`"And when was the next time you went to visit Father's study?`
` That was after we found the bodies of Nii-san and the rest, right?`
` Together with me, you went up to the study to report that, and we discovered that he wasn't there.`
` ......By the way, Nee-san.`
` At that time, when you went to enter Father's study, did you notice anything?"`
`"......Notice anything?`
` ...What are you talking about?"`
`"Come on.`
` You picked up some trash, right?`
` A folded receipt."`
`"...I do seem to remember picking up some trash.`
` How is that relevant...?"`
`"I got that receipt when I bought some candy at a store before arriving at the airport."`
`Aunt Eva pulled a small bag of candy out of her handbag.`
`"...Aah, the receipt from that candy you bought back there?`
` ...But Mother, what does that receipt have to do with anything...?"`
`"George, stay quiet and listen for just a bit longer..."`
`Uncle Hideyoshi's expression was a little strict.`
`...Apparently, he understood what Aunt Eva was getting at.`
`"It really was just a whim.`
` I definitely didn't foresee anything...`
`or try to set up a trap for Natsuhi nee-san or anything like that.`
` ...Actually, about that receipt...`
` Nee-san, you remember bumping into me right after the last time you saw Father, right?`
` At that time, I wedged this into the door to the study."`
`"...So, what does that mean?`
` Are you saying no one opened the door until Aunt Natsuhi picked up that receipt...?"`
`"W-Wait a second, Aunt Eva...!`
` Wedging a receipt in would be obvious!`
` It's possible that when Grandfather opened the door, he noticed it, found it amusing, and stuck it back in the door..."`
`Jessica hurriedly argued back.`
`...She still didn't really know what this all meant,`
` but she realized that, whatever it was, it would raise suspicions about her own mother.`
`"Of course, I folded the receipt up very small so that no one would notice it.`
` But even if you assume that he saw it fall, he would have no way of knowing how high up the door it had been stuck, right?`
` I checked it while Natsuhi nee-san was taking the key out.`
` The receipt was still stuck not one millimeter away from where I put it...!"`
`"...I-I can't understand why you would pull such a childish prank!`
` I-I'll bet you were the one who did that prank on the door to my room, too!"`
`"...The door to your room?"`
`"...It was unpleasant to talk about, so I never mentioned it,`
` but when I woke up this morning, there were the signs of some prank on the outside of my door, with what was probably the same red paint that was scribbled across the shutter.`
` There were some unpleasant marks, as though someone had been tearing at the door..."`
`"Wait, what's this?!`
` Why'd you keep quiet about this 'til now...?!!"`
`"My apologies.`
` Since so many horrible things have occurred since then, I had completely forgotten about it until this moment."`
`"I don't know anything about that.`
` I'm not talking about your door, but the door to Father's room, right?`
` Between the time you confirmed that he was in his room and the time we confirmed that he wasn't, that door wasn't opened even once.`
` How did Father get out if he didn't use the door?"`
`"......I-I don't know that...!`
` That's what I want to know!!!"`
`"Natsuhi nee-san, other than you, who else checked to see whether Father was in his room?"`
`"Last night, the last time I met Kinzo-san was when we were playing chess, `
`...so I was with him until just before dinner......"`
`"Who saw him after that?"`
`".........I did.`
` I gave him his dinner last night."`
`"...Yes.`
` Shannon and I were with him."`
`"So at that time, Father was still definitely in his room.`
` ...However, Natsuhi nee-san,`
` when you found out he wasn't there, it looks like all ways in or out of the study were closed, right?`
` ...But even so, you said you met with him this morning."`
`"......I-I don't understand why everyone has become so gloomy.`
` Could someone please explain it to me...?"`
`"...F-Father and Mother, `
`......are you saying that what Natsuhi says about meeting Grandfather this morning...`
`was a lie?"`
`"L-Like hell she'd lie about that. Mom's guiltless!!`
` Why would she lie?!!"`
`"Jessica!`
` I keep telling you to watch your language!"`
`All at once, the whole room was in an uproar...`
`Aunt Eva and Aunt Natsuhi confronted each other across the parlor table,`
` with George confronting Jessica...`
` ...What the heck's going on...?!!`
`"Many people spotted him last night, right?`
` But since this morning, the only one who claims to have seen Father is Natsuhi nee-san.`
` ...And then there's that strange fact we learned from my receipt.`
` ...So, how can we connect these points together...?"`
`Aunt Eva urged everyone to imagine it...`
`...Sure, that receipt could become an important point.`
`...But I didn't know which other points to tie it to, or how...!`
`If we try searching for the answer Aunt Eva probably wants,`
` ...we'll find that Aunt Natsuhi lied and acted as though Grandfather was in the room this morning.`
`Has that fact been exposed by a whim of Aunt Eva's...??`
`"I don't get it at all!!`
` Why would Mom have to lie?!!`
` She had no reason to, right?!!"`
`"......That's what I want to know.`
` But Jessica-chan,`
` you can't be sure she had no reason to lie and say that Grandfather was in the room.`
` After all, you see it in mystery novels every now and then.`
` That trick where people fake the time of death to create an alibi for themselves."`
`"Wh-What are you talking about?!`
` I've never heard of that!!"`
`"...We still haven't found Father yet, but it's pretty natural to assume he's already been killed.`
` If that's true, there's no doubt we'll find his corpse soon.`
` ...If, at that point, the time of death could be cleverly faked, Natsuhi nee-san would be able to create an alibi.`
` ...Do you understand?`
` Everyone?"`
`...This morning, when Aunt Natsuhi confirmed that Grandfather was there, she lied,`
` ...and he was already dead at that time?`
`...And then, she moved the body to some other location...and tampered with it so that, when we find it, we'll think he was killed just a second ago.`
`...That'd make it possible for her to create an alibi, even just by staying with the rest of us.`
`...Then, she could say 'I heard someone screaming',`
` dash over there, and become the first to find the body along with everyone else...`
` ...Is that what Aunt Eva's saying...?`
`"Ridiculous.`
` After all, detective novels are merely books for the purpose of entertainment!`
` You can only think of such an indiscreet idea because you read them all the time!"`
`"That's right!!`
` Even if she did try to fake the time of death a little, all that would be blown away in an instant once the police did their autopsy!!`
` That might've worked in the past, but do you really think that kind of trick would work in modern Japan?!`
` It doesn't make sense!"`
`"...You think so?`
` This morning, when Doctor Nanjo looked at the corpses, he was only able to give a vague estimate of the time of death, right?`
` Autopsy results are very easily affected by the environment and individual differences.`
` It's a very relative estimate with an uncertainty of several hours.`
` And, unfortunately, the police's scientific investigation will have to wait until tomorrow.`
` It wouldn't be easy to measure the correct time of death so accurately, even in modern Japan.`
` Isn't that right, Doctor Nanjo...?"`
`"......Examining a corpse is an extremely difficult task that requires both experience and instinct...`
` I have heard that there is a very high chance of a mistaken diagnosis...`
` I imagine it is very possible for a misreading of just a few hours to occur..."`
`"...However, for an alibi, that's more than enough!`
` It's an old trick!`
` It's a trick that works well enough!`
` ...Natsuhi nee-san,`
` it's not like we want to suspect you, okay?`
` We just want you to prove your innocence so we don't have to suspect you."`
`"What is this innocence you want me to prove?!!`
` This morning, I definitely met with Father!!`
` And he told me to keep the One-Winged Eagle engraved in my heart...`
` ...Are you denying that he said that, too?!!`
` I will certainly not permit that!!`
` I won't let you deny that Father said those words!!"`
`"...Or, maybe Father's body won't appear anywhere.`
` Normally, a person has to be missing for seven years before they're officially dead.`
` Wouldn't that be a clever way to extend Father's nearly finished life another seven years and keep all of his wealth for yourself?!"`
`"I-I can't let you get away with saying that!!`
` I can't let you get away with saying any more!!`
` I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi!!`
` Although I do not have the right to wear the One-Winged Eagle on my body, it is certainly engraved on my heart!!`
` What do you think you're saying to the wife of Krauss, Successor to the Head, and the one who will act as such in his place?!!!"`
`"What's this?`
` Are you going to shoot me with that gun?`
` Go ahead.`
` If only you'd just shoot!`
` You're just desperate because you can't think of a way out, right?!`
` Do it, just try to obscure the truth with violence...!!"`
`"...Y-You!!!!"`
`It wasn't like Aunt Natsuhi had been actually holding that gun at the ready and threatening anyone.`
`But, as she was egged on by Aunt Eva, she did hold it at the ready!`
`...Unsurprisingly, once things got to this stage, Jessica and Genji-san tried to stop her.`
`"...Madam, please, calm yourself...!"`
`"Mom, you aren't lying!`
` So there's no reason for you to listen to this!!"`
`"...Calm down, Natsuhi-san.`
` All you've gotta do is swear that Father definitely was in that room.`
` Why are you gettin' so worked up...?"`
`"...Th-That is correct.`
` Natsuhi-san isn't lying.`
` Shouldn't that be the end of it...?"`
`"Then I want you to explain.`
` How did Father manage to disappear from the room?`
` ...The window was closed tight from the inside.`
` The same was true for the door, right?`
` ...This morning, if you really met with Father,`
` ...then you must explain how Father disappeared from this 'unopenable door' closed room scenario.`
` If you don't, that'd mean you're lying after all, right?"`
`"How far do you plan to mock me...?!!!"`
`"If you want to argue back, go ahead!!`
` That's right, try explaining it right here, right now.`
` If you do, I'll apologize for suspecting you.`
` How did Father manage to get out from that closed room?!!"`
`"I cannot explain, and there's no need for me to do so!!"`
`"Really?`
` Then let me explain it.`
` Let's take the best parts from my perspective and yours and come up with a more friendly explanation!`
` ...I'll believe what you said about Father still being in his room this morning.`
` However, the next time the door was opened, Father wasn't there.`
` You don't have any objections so far, right?"`
`"I have no desire to hear anything more you have to say!!`
` Shut your frivolous mouth!!"`
`"My reasoning goes like this, okay?`
` I can confirm that on both occasions, you were the only one to go through that door.`
` And the receipt proves it!`
` So, what's the answer to the puzzle of how Father left the room?`
` The window!`
` He was sent out the window.`
` ...Natsuhi nee-san, you threw Father out of the third story window of the study into the courtyard!!!"`
`"Y----YOUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!"`
`"Madam, please, endure it...!!"`
`"Eva-sama, ...please stop this...!!"`
`"After that, when you left and said you were going to check the doors and windows,`
` you took Father's corpse, which had fallen in the courtyard, and hid it!`
` That was probably when you took some measures to fake the time of death, right?!"`
`"...This ties in with the case regardin' Krauss nii-san and the rest, and also the case regardin' Beatrice last night!`
` There's a really good chance we've got reason to suspect Natsuhi-san in all those cases...`
` Normally, I wouldn't want to say this.`
` ...But now that it's out in the open, there's nothin' else I can do...!`
` Please, Natsuhi nee-san!`
` Please explain how you can be innocent!!`
` Otherwise, I can't help but suspect you...!!"`
`"Why me?!!`
` Why must I, Ushiromiya Natsuhi, be insulted like thiiiiiiiiiiis?!!!"`
`......Hmmmm.`
` ...Looks like we've got everyone's views on record now.`
`"Ihihihi.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ...It's useless. ~ib~It's all useless,~ib~`
` Aunt Eva."`
`"...Wh-What do you mean, 'useless'...?"`
`Jessica looked up at me, hanging onto my every word.`
`Aunt Eva's expression was confident as ever.`
`"...Useless, you say? What is?`
` Battler-kun,`
` tell me."`
`"You're only convinced it was Aunt Natsuhi...because you're only looking at the case from a single angle.`
` ...It's not like I'm defending her, but that bluff of a checkmate isn't gonna fly."`
`"I think your reasoning regarding that receipt was passable.`
` It's not a bad thread of logic.`
` But I'd only give it a grade of 65 at best.`
` If this were an exam, that'd be bad enough to get you extra lessons in detention, right?`
` Ihihi!"`
`"...Oh my. Well, how do you think anyone could break through the door sealed by my receipt and make Father disappear? Other than by my theory?!"`
`"It's true that your theory's an interesting one.`
` And if you could say for sure that there was no way to make Grandfather disappear,`
` then you probably would be able to prove that the last person to see him, Aunt Natsuhi, was guilty."`
`"However, since there still is a possibility she's innocent and these accusations are false, we can't be sure about that!!"`
`"......Hmm. Then, Battler-kun, are you saying someone other than Natsuhi nee-san made Grandfather disappear?`
` It'd be impossible for anyone else to do it.`
` My receipt proved that, right?`
` After the first time she visited that study,`
` and until the second time when we visited it together, the study was a perfect closed room, and when the seal was broken on the closed room, he was already missing!`
` If that doesn't prove she's the culprit, what kind of trick could they have used?!"`
`"Like I said, Aunt Eva, only 65 points.`
` So, let's try 'spinning the chessboard around', shall we?`
` The question isn't how someone managed to make Grandfather disappear from the outside.`
` We should think about how Grandfather disappeared from the inside."`
`"The door had the receipt stuck in it, so it couldn't have been used.`
` He also couldn't have gone through the window, because you can't lock it from the outside, and when Aunt Eva visited the study, she checked to make sure it was locked.`
` So the window also wasn't used.`
` At that point, the study really was a closed room.`
` We have to accept this!`
` However, the study didn't remain a closed room forever.`
` Once the seal created by the receipt was removed, it'd be possible for someone to escape by the door."`
`"...In other words, the question isn't how Aunt Natsuhi made Grandfather disappear.`
` ...We need to think about how he was able to escape!!"`
`"Grandfather's study isn't an ordinary study, right?`
` According to Genji-san, there's a toilet and a kitchen and even a bedroom, almost like a little house.`
` ...For example, what if he was hiding under the bed and the two of you only thought he was missing?"`
`"Aunt Eva, even you didn't check that far, right?`
` And then the two of you went back down the stairs, thinking he wasn't there."`
`"At that time, the receipt was already gone!`
` In other words, if Grandfather was hiding in his room the whole time it was a closed room...`
`and escaped after letting the two of you go past him, we can crack this closed room right open!!"`
`"Wh-What are you talking about?!`
` Why would Father need to escape the room in such a bizarre fashion?!`
` Don't be so absurd!"`
`"Yeah, it might be absurd.`
` However, it still shows that there's a possibility Aunt Natsuhi is being falsely accused.`
` Your receipt wasn't perfect.`
` In chess, we might call that check,`
` but it isn't checkmate!!"`
`"But the thing that really pisses me off...`
`is how you're pressuring Aunt Natsuhi to explain it, then claiming that she must be guilty if she doesn't!`
` If you wanna go down that road, then why don't you let me,`
` Ushiromiya Battler, spin the chessboard around one more time?!!"`
`"Aunt Eva, according to your own argument,`
` ...you must explain to us why you and Uncle Hideyoshi couldn't have killed those six last night and then casually returned to the guesthouse...!"`
`"You've been trying to force Aunt Natsuhi to explain.`
` So I'm sure you can prove your own innocence, right?!`
` Especially now that all of Grandfather's wealth has suddenly plopped down right into your hands!!"`
`"Th-That's right, you're suspicious enough yourself, aren't you?!!`
` If you say Mom's suspicious because she was the last person to see him,`
` then what about you, Aunt Eva, the last person to see Dad and the rest?!!`
` Just like Battler said, prove that you two weren't the ones who killed them!!"`
`"......Mother, I also think your reasoning was a little overeager.`
` ...I'm sure the receipt was an important hint.`
` But, like Battler-kun said, that's not enough to prove that Aunt Natsuhi was responsible for some plot.`
` ...We're all equally suspicious.`
` It's not right for only Aunt Natsuhi to be persecuted."`
`"O-Our proud Father, crawling under his bed?`
` You call nonsense like that an explanation?!"`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, jes_1e607:`
` ......*cough*, `
`*cough*cough*cough*, `
`*cough*, `
`*cough*!!!`
` Uu-, *cough*cough*!!`
` *cough*cough*!!`
` *cough*cough*!!!"`
`"Milady, ...Milady...!!"`
`Jessica suddenly started coughing.`
`At first, I thought she was just choking after yelling too loud, but before long, I realized how painful it looked...`
`Jessica kept coughing and choking, down on her hands and knees...`
`"Jessica, ...hang in there...!!`
` Doctor Nanjo...!"`
`"...Jessica-san, your inhaler, quickly.`
` ...No wait, I have one with me."`
`Doctor Nanjo pulled a bronchodilator inhaler from his own bag, which was lying on the sofa, and handed it to Jessica.`
`...Come to think of it, six years ago, didn't Jessica sometimes break into violent coughing fits and have to use that...?`
`However, six years ago, I never saw Jessica look like she was in this much pain.`
`"...Aniki, was Jessica's asthma always this bad...?"`
`"It's gotten a lot worse these last few years...`
` It's no problem when she's normal, `
`...but when an attack comes suddenly, she can't stop coughing anymore."`
`"*cough*cough*!!`
` Uu-, *cough*cough* *coughcough*!!`
` *cough*cough*, *cough*cough*!!"`
`"...Milady, your medicine.`
` ......Here..."`
`".........Nnng, `
`...`
`...*cough*cough*!!"`
`Taking the inhaler from Kanon-kun, Jessica used it with a practiced hand.`
`...It looked like her throat would still itch for a while, but she had it under control...`
`"Are you okay, Jessica...?`
` You scared me..."`
`"...It's no big deal.`
` ...Don't worry about it..."`
`Beads of sweat covered Jessica's whole body and she couldn't hide her rough breathing, but it looked like her sudden attack had calmed down for now...`
`This disturbance had made the dangerous atmosphere up until now seem slightly unfocused.`
`But that's fine.`
`...That kind of battle of mutual suspicion is completely unnecessary.`
`When you think about it, finding alibis for each other and looking for the culprit is probably meaningless.`
`After all, we're just powerless, ordinary people,`
` and when the police come tomorrow, they'll definitely employ cutting-edge techniques and investigate the case thoroughly,`
` solving all of the riddles and arresting the culprit...`
`"......Perhaps Battler-kun is right after all.`
` ...Just as Natsuhi nee-san is suspicious, I can't ignore the fact that I'm suspicious too.`
` Arguing about that now will surely be unproductive.`
` ...Everything will be fine if we just leave it to the police tomorrow."`
`"......But don't you want to know too, Battler-kun?`
` Who the culprit is?`
` ...Don't you want to let them know the pain you feel from losing someone precious to you, as soon as possible?"`
`"......I won't deny that.`
` Even one day would be too long to let the wonderful bastard who's behind this go."`
`"...But that doesn't mean that I want to suspect one of the 18.`
` Even though I said what I said earlier, I don't even want to suspect you, Aunt Eva.`
` ...To me, you're an awesome aunt who's always fun and playful."`
`"...I don't want to trade insults with an aunt like that.`
` I wouldn't want to do that with anyone here.`
` ......Right?`
` Everyone?"`
`".........I feel the same way as Battler-kun.`
` ...It's pointless to trade insults.`
` ...It's probably just the stress built up because so many people have been crammed in one place since morning."`
`"......Probably.`
` It is only natural...`
` It may not be my place to say it, but I think we should all relax as much as possible..."`
`"......Eva,`
` I think we'd better cool our heads too.`
` ...The receipt's definitely a big clue for figurin' out how Father disappeared.`
` We should tell the police about it when they come..."`
`"...That's right.`
` ...Right.`
` I just felt a little triumphant when I figured out that part with the receipt.`
` ...Of course it isn't fair to only suspect Natsuhi nee-san, right?`
` We're just as suspicious."`
`"...But still, Battler-kun?`
` At least the part about the receipt is real, okay?`
` ...Don't forget it.`
` And try thinking deeply about what it means one more time, okay...?"`
`"............"`
`"....................."`
`Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi stood up.`
`It looked like they planned on leaving the parlor.`
`"In the end, it's pointless for us to keep playing detectives.`
` After all, the police will reveal everything anyway."`
`......That's right.`
`Even if we don't play this detective game, the typhoon will pass,`
` ...and when those lively seagulls return to the harbor, everything will settle itself.`
`That's right.`
` If you think about it, this kind of crime is completely trivial.`
`It will definitely be resolved...`
`Even if we do nothing...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~When the seagulls cry~ib~`
`...`
`"...Natsuhi nee-san, I take it you don't want to see my face anymore?`
` I feel the same.`
` ...If I remember correctly, yesterday, you had some rooms prepared for us in the mansion so that we wouldn't need to go back to the guesthouse, right?`
` Those should each have a bath and a toilet, as well as a lock and a chain to secure the door.`
` There's even a bed to lie on, and my husband will be able to watch TV without having to fight with Maria-chan over which channel to watch, right?"`
`"..................`
`...Do whatever you want.`
` ...But make sure to be cautious."`
`"Thank you, Nee-san.`
` ...And mind your own business.`
` I'll be counting on you to keep an eye on everyone, okay?`
` Because the culprit is definitely here.`
` ...And Nee-san, make sure you don't forget to keep an eye on yourself, too."`
`"...Have you finished taking your parting shots?"`
`"...Yes, I'm finished.`
` ...See you, Natsuhi nee-san.`
` ...Genji-san, let us know when it's time for dinner.`
` Until then, we'll lock ourselves in with the chain."`
`"..............."`
`"...Genji, Kanon.`
` Escort them to the guest room."`
`"We'll be fine.`
` I hate shady escorts.`
` In fact, I'd be more comfortable if nobody leaves this room until we reach ours.`
` ......Let's go, George."`
`"......I'll stay here with everyone."`
`"George...!`
` The culprit is in this room.`
` Do you plan on staying in a place like that...?!"`
`"...Leaving this room would be the same as suspecting one of my relatives.`
` ...I...can't believe anyone in our family is capable of something that horrible."`
`"George...!`
` ...Darling, you tell him too...!"`
`"......George is already an adult man.`
` ...If his code tells him not to leave this room, then it's up to him.`
` Let him do what he wants..."`
`"...Father..."`
`Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi left.`
`The only voice that called after them was the sound of the rain.`
`The parlor was being buried beneath the savage atmosphere...`
`When I looked at the clock, I was surprised to find that it was already evening.`
`......Had we really spent that much time worrying about needless things, talking with each other, fighting with each other...?`
`Feeling bored, I started scratching at my head when`
`...Maria and I made eye contact.`
`I was a little surprised, since I'd thought she was completely immersed in the TV.`
`"......I believe it now."`
`"Uu-...?"`
`"The letter, the murders, everything. It was all Beatrice.`
` ...In fact, I almost feel like begging her to come out and take credit for it all.`
` ...I want it to be the work of a 19th person.`
` Otherwise, the 18 of us will have to keep on suspecting each other...`
` ...I think believing in a 19th person is better than that..."`
`"..............."`
`"...Bringing Grandfather outside without opening the doors or windows must be a piece of cake for Beatrice, right...?"`
`Maria, after taking a single, short breath, hung her head, ...and then raised her face again.`
`"......That's right.`
` Kihihihihihihihi, locking a door is useless against a witch.`
` ...Beatrice is familiar with all 72 demons.`
` The 33rd ranked, Gaap, gives the power to instantly carry the desired person to any location.`
` ...To her, taking a person out of any closed room isn't hard at all, you see?`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`"Witches sure are incredible.`
` ...Tell her, if she feels like committing another crime, to do it in a way that no human could, `
`...and make me believe that a 19th person...`
`no, a witch, exists."`
`".........Kihihi.`
` ...Okay.`
` If I meet her, I'll tell her."`
`Crap...`
` Nothing's made sense to me for a while now...`
`Just when I want to believe in a 19th person, I deny it, and just when I want to believe there are only 18 people, I deny that too.`
`Even though I want there to be more than just the 18 people here, I can't accept the existence of that 19th person.`
`...In short, even though there are more than 18 people, there are less than 19 people.`
`...The number of people in this mansion is 19>X>18.`
`So the number of people can't be represented by an integer.`
`......However, it's impossible for there to be anything after the decimal point.`
`You shouldn't be able to show the number of people with anything but an integer.`
`...And yet, 19>X>18.`
`How do you explain the fraction less than 1...?!`
`It's no wonder.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`...That 19th person was `
`~ib~something that couldn't be 'seen'~ib~`
`.`
`That's why, since you can only write the number of people as an integer, `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~you couldn't 'see' that person~ib~`
`.`
`That witch cannot be 'seen'.`
`Because Beatrice has no body.`
`Therefore, she is invisible.`
`Is there a 19th person...or not?`
`Does the witch exist...or not?`
`19>X>18.`
`...The witch exists somewhere in that X...!`
`The uncomfortable atmosphere continued even after those two left.`
`It was thick with the idea that simply thinking about the culprit's identity...would be the same as deciding whom to suspect.`
` ...It had begun to feel like discussion of the case was itself taboo.`
`So no one mentioned the case, at least out loud.`
`......However, those thoughts were what filled our minds.`
`All that we couldn't say aloud made our heads feel like they were going to explode...`
`So, at least on the outside, the parlor had once again regained its calm mood.`
`Everything was left unsettled.`
`"......It feels like the rain's gotten a little lighter."`
`"Uu-...?`
` Still pouring down.`
` Uu-..."`
`"Even if it did stop, there's no boat on this island.`
` ...But it'd be nice if the boat came quickly tomorrow.`
` I've had enough of this Western mansion vacation, ihihi."`
`"Mom, when will the boat come tomorrow?"`
`"Normally, the boat to take them back would arrive at 3:00 today.`
` They probably sent us a phone call to say that they would come after the typhoon passed, but unfortunately, the phones aren't working...`
` ...But they aren't children over there.`
` They were told to both drop off and collect our guests, `
`so they will most likely arrive first thing tomorrow morning, `
`...probably about 9:00, I believe."`
`It was completely black outside.`
`When I looked at the clock, I realized that it was just past 7:00.`
` I was starting to get hungry...`
`In the kitchen, Kumasawa was cooking enthusiastically.`
`She had laid out a variety of dishes, and while they didn't match the level of Gohda's artful cooking, they were still quite gorgeous.`
`It was an act of kindness from Kumasawa, who was trying to enliven everyone's low spirits with some food.`
`Kumasawa wasn't nearly as talented as a professional cook like Gohda, but she was far from unskilled.`
`...On the contrary, since she had been brought up in a fishing village, the simple food she created was sometimes highly praised.`
`Kanon arranged the food Kumasawa had finished creating on plates, under her direction.`
`Kanon also helped in the kitchen sometimes, but since he was rarely placed in that role, he was slightly awkward, even though he tried his best...`
`Self-conscious about the fact that he couldn't cleverly arrange the food, Kanon's expression darkened slightly.`
`But Kumasawa smiled as though everything was fine.`
`"Hohohoh, it's arranged beautifully.`
` Kanon-kun, aren't you skilled."`
`"......If it had been Shannon nee-san, `
`...it would look even more beautiful..."`
`Kanon stopped arranging the food for a bit and hung his head...`
`Shannon was the one who always assisted Kumasawa in her cooking.`
`...Tonight, Kanon was doing it instead.`
`...And as he remembered Shannon's face and her brutal end, he grimaced...`
`"......Forget that for now..."`
`Genji spoke kindly to Kanon as he advanced a pawn.`
`...Nanjo had escaped from the parlor once the mood had grown sour, and Genji had become his opponent in a game of chess upon Nanjo's request.`
`"......Yes.`
` ...I will forget it for now."`
`"...Indeed.`
` That is probably for the best."`
`Genji purposefully refrained from facing Kanon as he spoke.`
`...He did so because he understood that it might make things tougher on Kanon if he noticed that someone was looking at his eyes.`
`Nanjo also understood that and held back any thoughtless words.`
`"...I wonder where Kinzo-san has gone...`
` ...I hope that he is safe, but..."`
`"......I do not know.`
` ...However, I believe everything has proceeded as the Master has hoped and arranged for.`
` ...To distrust that would exceed my role as furniture in service to the Master."`
`"...Aren't you scared, Genji-san...?`
` I am frightened that something bad will occur again tonight..."`
`"......I have nothing to be afraid of.`
` ...I serve the Ushiromiya family, and that is all."`
`Nanjo sighed through his nose and made a carefully considered move.`
`...Nanjo was very slightly dubious.`
`...Could Genji possibly be thinking that he'd be left out of this?`
`He couldn't even imagine what was happening inside this mansion.`
`...But he definitely couldn't deny the possibility that Kinzo had devised something.`
`...If you liken this island to chess, Kinzo had opened the game, and as a result, six pieces had been defeated.`
`......Could it be that Genji was calm because he believed he alone was on the outside of the chessboard, and therefore safe?`
`Nanjo thought about it.`
`......Isn't everyone just a piece on this chessboard, lined up equally, without any exceptions?`
`......Wasn't even Genji, who had gained more of Kinzo's trust than anyone...`
`no, who was confident of his position as Kinzo's only close friend, `
`...just another one of the pieces laid out on the chessboard?`
`"......Genji-san,`
` ...I am truly frightened about tonight.`
` ...I hope with all my heart that we will still be safe when tomorrow morning comes..."`
`The guest room Eva and Hideyoshi moved into had originally been built to house guests before the guesthouse's construction.`
`So until a few years ago, they had stayed in these rooms every family conference and were very familiar with them.`
`This room was just like a room at a hotel, with a bedroom and a bathroom,`
` so even though they were still shut in, it was far more comfortable than the parlor.`
`"Guess it's true you can relax more when you're alone with your family.`
` ...Maybe it'd be better if everyone else also shut themselves in guest rooms and locked the doors."`
`"Natsuhi nee-san said that no one could leave the parlor, throwing her weight around.`
` I'm sure no one will be able to talk back.`
` She's always been treated so coldly, so now that Nii-san's dead, she's getting excited about finally having so much power.`
` ...Seriously, how shameless can she be."`
`"...Come now, don't say that.`
` Natsuhi-san's doin' pretty well.`
` No need to jump on her like that.`
` ......And about that receipt earlier, you went too far."`
`"...Come on.`
` If I hadn't said it there, there wouldn't be another good time to say it..."`
`Eva, sulking cutely and looking at the television, sat alongside Hideyoshi, who was lying on the bed.`
`"Still, ......we haven't been alone like this for quite some time."`
`"You're right.`
` Come to think of it, both you and I have gotten pretty old.`
` Since George was born, everything's gone by in the blink of an eye."`
`"...It really has.`
` ...I wonder if we were too hasty in having a child."`
`Eva's eyes looked like they were staring off into the distance.`
`...Yes, she had thought of it as a once-in-a-lifetime chance.`
`...Her older brother Krauss had been unable to father a child for quite some time.`
`Six years passed after his marriage to Natsuhi without any signs of pregnancy, which didn't please Kinzo at all.`
`Eva herself had thought that, `
`since her name would be moved outside the Ushiromiya register when she got married anyway, it didn't matter whether a Successor to the Headship was born or not.`
`And then, one day,`
` ...she had a heavenly revelation.`
`...Or maybe it was the whisperings of the devil that she had listened to in her greed.`
`If she could give birth to a successor first, wouldn't she be able to remain in the Ushiromiya register?`
`...If things went well, might she have a chance to inherit the Ushiromiya family herself...?`
`When she proposed this to Hideyoshi, he had approved of it instantly.`
`...This wasn't because Hideyoshi also had greedy thoughts.`
`...For Hideyoshi, who had no close relatives,`
` it was a chance for him to feel once more the long forgotten thing called family.`
`So when they got married, he hadn't fussed over which last name they were to keep...and had quickly agreed to have his name entered into the Ushiromiya family register.`
`It hadn't been easy to persuade Kinzo, but as his daughter, Eva knew Kinzo's personality well.`
`...So, by choosing the time when Kinzo was most dissatisfied with Natsuhi,`
` she was magnificently able to make him accept Hideyoshi as an adopted son-in-law.`
`...Looking at Hideyoshi, who had achieved success after starting from nothing, Kinzo might have seen a little bit of himself.`
`He quickly grew to like Hideyoshi and approved his transfer into the Ushiromiya register...`
`George would eventually become the Successor to the Ushiromiya family.`
`They had raised him strictly with that purpose in mind.`
`He had been worth their while and had grown into a fabulous young man, who wouldn't disappoint no matter where he went.`
`...That was why he had not been permitted to fall in love with a servant like Shannon.`
`...So when she'd learned that Shannon was dead and the engagement was now invalid, `
`...though part of her had still been shocked by the gruesome crime,`
` part of her had also been relieved that her dear George wouldn't be stolen by some servant girl...`
`".........`
`......I...`
`...have hated Krauss nii-san since long ago.`
` He was so full of himself, always swaggering around.`
` So proud that he would one day become the Head.`
` ...So I wanted to get back at him.`
` ...Was that just a childish emotion...?`
` But in the end, that emotion guided my entire life.`
` If that had been all, then it would have been fine!`
` ...But because of that emotion, I got you and George involved. I used you."`
`"......Eva, don't blame yourself for that."`
`Hideyoshi got up and held Eva's shoulder.`
` ...She could feel a warm understanding from him.`
`"...Well, I reached the halfway point in my life long ago.`
` ...But you know, I have absolutely no regrets about how I've lived my life.`
` Not one."`
`"......I think that since I've been with you, Eva, I've been able to relish an enjoyable life that other men never will.`
` ...After I lost my relatives in the war, you reminded me what the warmth of family is.`
` So I'm grateful to the Ushiromiya family and think of it as my only one."`
`"......In this life I've led with you, not a single thing's been wasted.`
` It's really been a fun life up 'til today."`
`"...Thank you, `
`......darling."`
`Eva hung her head, burying her face in Hideyoshi's chest...`
`...Probably, no one in the parlor could even imagine that this side of Eva existed.`
`"I'm the one who should be thankin' you.`
` Until today, there hasn't been a single day I've regretted bein' with you!"`
`".........Me too.`
` I'm so glad...to have you by my side."`
`"George is already a fine adult.`
` Even if I don't look out for him, he's a man who could do his job well on his own.`
` ...I wonder.`
` Around New Year's, do you want to go spend some time in the Maldives?`
` Just us, no one else."`
`"...No waaay.`
` Aren't you always saying that you're so busy responding to New Year's cards that you don't even sleep...?"`
`"None of that this New Year's!`
` I won't read New Year's cards.`
` I'll just stay quiet and check to see if I've won the New Year's lottery.`
` It'd sure be nice if we won a color TV this year!"`
`"No waaay...`
` I don't want to waste time checking the lottery while in the Maldives..."`
`"Then none of that either!`
` ...How does it sound? Just the two of us, taking it easy like when we were newlyweds, just before George was born."`
`"......Yes.`
` ...In that case, fine..."`
`"I hear the Maldives are wonderful.`
` An island with nothin' on it, surrounded by beaut'ful coral reefs and cottages lined up over the water..."`
`"......Like when we were newlyweds, you say? Starting when...?"`
`"As soon as I've finished up some business.`
` I won't know 'til I ask the travel agency, but probably before New Year's Eve-"`
`"No way.`
` ......Right now, `
`...I want to go right now."`
`Eva nagged at his lips in a peevish, yet flirtatious manner...`
`The only sounds that filled the room were the distant voice of the announcer on the news, which Hideyoshi had left on, and the obnoxious pounding of the rain against the window...`
`There was a knock on the door, and Genji-san entered.`
`".........Madam,`
` dinner has been prepared.`
` Will you eat in here again...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` Have it brought here.`
` Is Doctor Nanjo still in the kitchen?"`
`".........Yes.`
` He has said he wishes to carefully deliberate over his next move.`
` ...Do not worry, he is with the other servants."`
`"Genji-san's good enough at chess to be Grandfather's opponent.`
` I hear he's even better than Doctor Nanjo, right?"`
`"...That's right.`
` Long ago, he played against me, but he must've let me win."`
`"Maria, sounds like it'll be time to eat soon.`
` But look at you, you've been watching TV all day long and you still haven't gotten bored!"`
`"Uu-.`
` I'm always watching TV so I'm fine.`
` Uu-."`
`"Heh, Maria-chan sure is a TV kid."`
`"Food's coming, so we have to clean up the table."`
`Earlier, we had torn several pages out of Maria's notebook, and there was now a mess where everyone had been drawing together.`
`Jessica began cleaning that up quickly.`
`...Still, everyone here really can draw.`
` I'd never guessed.`
`"...Genji,`
` ask Eva-san and Hideyoshi-san whether they'd at least like to have dinner with us.`
` ...Although they will probably turn us down."`
`"...Certainly."`
`"First Father, and now Eva-san...`
` It's quite hard to gather everyone to the Ushiromiya dinner table."`
`Natsuhi felt her headache start throbbing again and lightly held her temples...`
`The distance from the kitchen to the parlor wasn't that great, so Genji had gone and come back by himself, but the guest room was a little farther away.`
`Natsuhi had warned him to avoid being alone whenever possible,`
` and just now, Nanjo had also admonished him, saying it would be better if he held a little more concern for his safety.`
`...Kanon accompanied Genji, and the two of them went to visit Eva and Hideyoshi in their guest room.`
`Genji knocked on the door.`
`"...Eva-sama, Hideyoshi-sama.`
` Dinner has been prepared."`
`He waited a short while for them to come out, but there was no response.`
`"......Genji-sama, ...look at this."`
`Kanon pointed under the door.`
`Normally, when something was inserted this way, it'd be interpreted as a message from someone outside to someone in the room.`
`...So, since this might be a private note meant for Eva and Hideyoshi, it was not something that Kanon and Genji were supposed to take interest in.`
`...But this Western envelope...`
`was one of Kinzo's, the same kind as the one Maria had taken out last night and surprised everyone with.`
`".........`
`...There can be no mistake.`
` It is one of the Master's envelopes."`
`"...Or could it be...`
`......"`
`Even though this was one of Kinzo's envelopes, ...the letter Maria read aloud the previous night hadn't come from Kinzo...`
`Genji continued knocking a little harder and called out in a loud voice.`
`"Eva-sama.`
` Eva-sama...!`
` It is Genji.`
` Are you there?!`
` Please answer, Eva-sama...!!"`
`But there was no response from inside.`
`Sometimes, when the servants went to call some guests for a meal, the guests would be sleeping so deeply that they wouldn't wake up.`
`...In times like that, the servants would stick a letter in the door to show that it was time to come out, and leave the guest be.`
`...But despite that, Genji beat even harder on the door and called out Eva's name.`
`However, there was no answer.`
`Kanon stuck his ear up to the door, held his breath, and listened for any sounds coming from inside...`
`"......I hear something that sounds like the television.`
` ...But I don't sense anyone.`
` ...The room might be empty..."`
`Genji took out a handkerchief, and, careful not to touch it with his bare hands,`
` gently pulled out the envelope that had been stuck under the door...`
`It was sealed with deep red sealing wax.`
`...Without a doubt, the mark on that sealing wax had come from the Ushiromiya Family Head's Ring...`
`"Eva-sama!`
` Eva-sama!!`
` Please, answer!!`
` Are you still in your room?!"`
`But there was still no answer...`
`There was a chance that those two were aimlessly walking around the mansion.`
`...This was the home Eva had grown up in.`
`There was plenty of reason to think that she had gone out on a casual stroll...`
`Genji groped around in his pocket and pulled out the bundle of keys, which contained the key that would open the guest room.`
`"...Genji-sama...?!"`
`Kanon also understood what this meant.`
`...They would sometimes unlock the door so they could go in and do things like make the beds, but only after they made sure the guests were out.`
`To unlock the door for any other reason, and especially to do so when there was a chance the guests hadn't given permission and might still be in there, was an action unbecoming of a servant.`
`...But Genji had decided.`
`.........If the only problem had been that his knock hadn't received a reply, he wouldn't have gone this far.`
`But the envelope under the door was doubtlessly one of Kinzo's.`
`......Or rather, one of the Western envelopes of the Ushiromiya Family Head.`
`...After last night, the sender of this envelope could be someone other than Kinzo.`
`...If this letter had been sent by someone else......`
`"Eva-sama...!`
` My apologies.`
` Allow me to enter your room..."`
`After giving that final notice, Genji stuck one of the keys from the bundle into the keyhole.`
`There was the sound of the door unlocking.`
`......And, after slowly turning the knob, he slowly started opening the door.`
`Light seeped through the crack of the door.`
`......Were they in the room?`
` Or had they...forgotten to turn out the lights...?`
`*clank*.`
`...It was the sound of the door chain being pulled tight.`
`The chain had been secured.`
`The chain couldn't be secured from the outside.`
` So it also proved that they were in the room.`
`The sound of voices on the TV seeped out of the room.`
`...The lights, the chain, and the TV.`
`All of these things made it clear they were in the room,`
` ......but there was no sign of them.`
`Genji called to Eva once again through the crack of the door.`
`But there was no answer.`
`".........Genji-sama,`
` ......what should we do...?"`
`As part of their job, the servants were able to unlock almost any lock in the mansion.`
`But they had no way to open a door with a chain.`
`......The only way to get by the chain was to cut it.`
`...That was certainly not permitted as part of a servant's usual work.`
`...A creepy chill had already rushed up their backs...`
`Kanon held his breath again and tried to sense someone through the door, but even so, he was not able to sense anyone.`
`"......I will call Madam and return.`
` ...Kanon, cut the chain."`
`"...Y-Yes...!"`
`As Kanon hurried away to get a cutting tool, Genji called him to a stop.`
`"Wait, Kanon...!`
` ......Return to the kitchen and take Kumasawa with you.`
` You must not act alone."`
`"...Yes...`
` Certainly..."`
`It looked like Kanon was wondering why he had to do something so troublesome in the middle of this urgent situation.`
`...But Genji had said it out of wariness.`
`...He didn't care what happened to himself.`
`...But in the worst-case scenario, he didn't want anything to happen to Kanon.`
`In the kitchen, Kumasawa was piling food on the serving cart, `
`and Nanjo was waiting for Genji, apparently wanting to show him a move he'd finally thought up that might turn the tables on him.`
`...But Genji's appearance immediately told him that something was wrong.`
`"...Oh, ...what has happened, Genji-san...?"`
`"......Doctor Nanjo, my apologies, but please allow this match to be suspended for the time being.`
` ......Kanon, take care of the chain.`
` Kumasawa, stop setting up dinner for now and accompany Kanon.`
` I will go over to Madam.`
` If you would come with me, Doctor Nanjo."`
`"H-Has something happened...?"`
`Genji took Nanjo, who still didn't know what was going on, and quickly left the kitchen.`
`"...Kumasawa-san,`
` my apologies, but please come with me."`
`"Wh-What has happened, Kanon-san...?"`
`Kumasawa said almost exactly the same thing as Nanjo, unable to take in the situation, and chased after Kanon, who had flown out into the hallway...`
`Taking Kumasawa with him, Kanon went to a storage room and looked through the tools packed in toolboxes and hanging all over the walls,`
` trying to find something that could be used to cut the chain.`
`"What are you looking for...?`
` ...Let me help too..."`
`"...We're cutting a door chain.`
` ...Where was that large wire cutter..."`
`"A door chain...?`
` Wh-Why would you do something like that...?"`
`"......The chain to Eva-sama and Hideyoshi-sama's room.`
` ...Even though they should be inside, they didn't answer when we called them."`
`It took Kumasawa some time to figure out how cutting the chain and Eva and Hideyoshi not answering were connected, but she did realize that this was an urgent situation.`
`"That one will probably do the trick..."`
`Kanon took down a very large wire cutter that had been hanging on the wall.`
`It was called a cutter, but maybe it'd be easier to understand if we said it was shaped like a large pair of pliers.`
`...Kanon remembered once being warned that this dangerous tool could easily cut through one of your fingers...`
`Kanon took that and rushed up the stairs.`
`......He already knew instinctively.`
`...He should fight for every minute, every second to open it quickly.`
`......Or perhaps...`
`it was already......`
`"Please wait, Kanon-san...!`
` Haah, ...haah...!"`
`"...Hurry!"`
`Kumasawa eventually caught up with him, gasping for breath with both hands on her knees.`
`When Kanon changed his grip on the wire cutters and looked up at the door, he let out an 'ah', struck speechless...`
`"......Wh-`
`What is...this......`
` ......Eeeeeeeep..."`
`Kumasawa screamed weakly, her face pallid...`
`That was no surprise...`
` Because, right there, ......on the door, ...just like the magic circle that had been drawn on the shutter of the rose garden storehouse,`
` there was another eerie shape drawn with a blood-like paint.`
`However, it would be odd to call this one a 'magic circle'.`
`...Because, unlike what most people would expect, it wasn't a circle with shapes drawn inside it,`
` but a slightly more complicated geometrical shape.`
`......However, those strange characters filling in the gaps, which weren't from the alphabet, `
`were the same kind as the ones on that magic circle on the shutter...`
`But the thing that had Kanon struck speechless wasn't how eerie the magic circle was.`
`...It was that something like this hadn't been here a short while ago...!!`
`First, he had taken a trip back to the kitchen.`
`After that, he'd gone to the storage room to grab a tool and headed right back.`
`Put those together and it couldn't have been more than five minutes.`
`...How could someone add something this creepy during that period of time...?!`
`And as though it had just been drawn,`
` almost like the door itself was bleeding,`
` several unsettling vertical red lines slowly dripped down, getting longer and longer...`
`"...Eeeeeep, ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeek...!"`
`Kumasawa's knees gave way, and she sank down on the spot.`
`...If Kumasawa hadn't done this first, then Kanon surely would have wanted to.`
`"...Be...atrice...sama........."`
`"Eeeeeeeeeek...!`
` It's the work of Beatrice-sama, how horrid, how horrid...!!"`
`"..................!"`
`Kanon gulped, then readied the wire cutter and approached the door.`
`...He didn't want to get close to this disturbing magic circle, and he really didn't want to touch the steadily dripping substance that looked like blood.`
`...But if he didn't get close, he wouldn't be able to cut the chain.`
`Fighting this cold feeling, he gulped again, and after gathering his courage, he went even closer, putting the wire cutter up against the chain.`
`...He then pressed with all of his strength, managing to cut through the chain far more easily than he'd anticipated.`
`The cut chain fell into two separate parts, which continued to clang as they swayed back and forth...`
`"......Kanon-san, `
`.........there's an envelope by your feet, `
`...and isn't that...the Master's..."`
`It looked like Kumasawa had also noticed the Western envelope at the bottom of the door.`
`And that the sealing wax had been sealed with the Head's Ring.`
`Kanon hesitated for just a second over whether he should open the letter first or check inside the room, `
`but he eventually decided on fulfilling his original purpose.`
`...Kanon pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket.`
`This was so he wouldn't leave fingerprints on the door.`
`...If his worst fears were realized, ......the police would want to investigate this room too...!!`
`He slowly pushed the door open...`
`He was able to more clearly hear the sound of the television, which had been seeping out faintly this whole time.`
`"...............Eva-sama...?"`
`Eva was lying face up on the bed,`
` ...on the bed with her shoes still on...?`
`Kumasawa, who had fearfully entered after Kanon and who was hiding behind his back, screamed a short 'eeek!' again when she saw Eva like that.`
`Eva's shoes had been the first part of her that Kanon had seen, so the oddness of wearing shoes in bed was the first thing to strike him, `
`...but when Eva's head shifted into his line of sight,`
` ...Kanon couldn't help but let out a short scream like Kumasawa...`
`Right in the middle of Eva's forehead...something had been...`
`......placed?`
`Something was growing there...?`
`No.`
` ...Right in the center of her forehead...`
` Was it an old-fashioned knife?`
` That or some weapon like it was sticking out!!!`
`At the base of where it was stuck in, blood dripped down, staining the sheets on the other side bright red...`
`Kumasawa's knees gave way once more, and she sank down on the floor.`
`...Her mouth kept flapping open and closed, but she couldn't even scream.`
`...Eva was dead, with some kind of weapon sticking out of her forehead.`
`Both eyes were open wide, and the image of the person who killed her must have been burned into them,`
` ...but the only mouth capable of naming that person had been shut for all eternity.`
`Even though her forehead was the last place they wanted to look, they couldn't tear their eyes from it...`
`Right there, the weapon was stuck into Eva's forehead, standing almost perfectly upright.`
`And on the handle was a complicated design that you wouldn't expect to see on an ordinary weapon.`
`...That thing...could be summed up with the word 'occult'.`
`...It was a vulgar object, with a design that might've been of some demon.`
`"...What about Hideyoshi-sama...?`
` ...Hideyoshi-sama...!"`
`Eva was on top of her bed, but the other bed was empty.`
`...Where was Hideyoshi?!`
`After taking a backwards glance at Kumasawa, still on her knees and stupefied, he checked the bathroom just in case.`
`At the moment he opened the door, he was greeted by steam and the sound of the shower.`
`The bathroom was of the same familiar style as most hotel bathrooms.`
`When taking a shower, a waterproof curtain was used to keep water from flying out.`
`That waterproof curtain was half open...`
`...and lying tumbled down in the bathtub was Hideyoshi, completely naked, with both eyes open...`
`and pointing right at Kanon.`
`Just like Eva, a weapon with a demon-like design was stuck into his forehead.`
`Since his head had been under the shower's hot water this whole time, his face wasn't half covered and filthy with blood like Eva's had been,`
` ...but the sight of him dead while still taking a shower was tragic enough......`
`Just then, they heard Natsuhi's voice coming from the hall.`
`She was probably coming with Genji.`
`"...A-Again with this grafitti...`
` ...What about this letter...?`
` What does it say inside?"`
`"I don't know, ...I haven't read it yet."`
`"......We shouldn't touch it carelessly...`
` The culprit's fingerprints might be left on it...`
` We should hand it over to the police..."`
`"......They went out of their way to leave it here.`
` I'm sure they wouldn't have left fingerprints."`
`As Natsuhi said that, she picked up the envelope.`
`...And before checking its contents, she entered the room herself, ...where she found Eva, dead.`
`"...E-Eva-san...!!!!"`
`"...Madam, ...Hideyoshi-sama is here too......"`
`"...Th-This is...`
`truly atrocious..."`
`"...Kanon, turn off the shower...`
` Don't let this be any more pitiful than it needs to be...!"`
`"...Y-Yes Ma'am."`
`Kanon gripped his handkerchief and twisted the valve, turning off the shower.`
`In the bathtub, a small jar of body soap had fallen with its cap off.`
`...It really looked like he'd been attacked while taking a shower.`
`...There was still a small splash of blood clinging to the white bathtub, and the combination of red and white made a horrible contrast.`
`"......Doctor Nanjo..."`
`"...I-I understand...`
` ...No signs of postmortem lividity...`
` Rigor mortis hasn't begun either.`
` It would seem that an hour or so has passed since they were killed...`
` But even so, ...how a weapon with such a short handle could do that to the skull,`
` ...I cannot imagine..."`
`Nanjo checked their pulse and their pupils, making certain of their deaths once more.`
`...As Kanon watched this businesslike treatment, he thought.`
`...Couldn't you tell at a glance that they're dead without doing all that?`
`Nanjo thought about removing the weapon, `
`but then decided it'd be better to preserve the scene and hand it over to the police, so he left it alone.`
`But a close inspection of the base showed that it didn't have a blade.`
`In fact, it was more conical than blade-shaped.`
`...He noticed that, rather than a knife, it was more like a short handled spear, something with a shape better suited for thrusting than slicing.`
`Rather than a short spear, you might call it a thick icepick.`
`At any rate, after looking at this scene, `
`no further words were needed to describe what sort of terrible purpose such eerily designed weapons were originally made for,`
` nor was it necessary to explain how they carried out their function.`
`Natsuhi, hoping to escape the repulsive steam filling the bathroom as soon as she could,`
` covered her mouth with a handkerchief and dashed from the room...`
`Just viewing their gruesome bodies for an instant had been enough to burn the image into her eyes.`
` If she looked any longer, that image would surely remain in her vision for all eternity...`
`The rising urge to vomit was exactly the same feeling she'd had that morning at the gardening storehouse...`
`For a while, Natsuhi couldn't help but stand with her back facing the guest room, fighting that sickness in her stomach...`
`"......A-At any rate, we can't let the children...`
`we can't let George-kun see this room.`
` Seal this room with all haste...!"`
`"......Y-Yes, we mustn't let them see...`
` If George-san saw his parents in this brutal state..."`
`But they could tell that those fiercely racing footsteps in the hallway belonged to George, even before he came dashing into the room.`
`George and the other children had been waiting in the parlor.`
`However, when they saw Genji speak to Natsuhi, when they saw her turn pale and fly out of the parlor, they'd felt a sense of foreboding.`
`And when they saw a large group of people gathered around the guest room, they were sure of it...`
`"Father!!!`
` Mother!!!"`
`"......Aaahh, `
`wh-what is this...?`
` Another...magic circle?!"`
`"..............."`
`"Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi are safe, right?!`
` Hey, Kanon-kun!`
` What's this all about?!"`
`"...Battler-sama...`
`..............."`
`Kanon didn't have to say anything.`
` George's scream after he ran into the room told them everything they needed to know.`
`"......Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggggh!!`
` Who...`
`who did this?!!`
` I'll kill you, I'll kill you!!!"`
`"...George-kun, `
`......hang in there..."`
`Natsuhi touched George's shoulder with her hand, but he violently shook her off.`
`...George fell over beside Eva and buried his face in the bed in front of his mother's face, wailing.`
`Then he pounded on the bed with his fist, over and over again...`
`'!s1`
`George nii-san, `
`...h-hang in there...`
` ......Huh, `
`...Battler?"`
`"......Battler-sama..."`
`Battler......had his back against the wall of the hallway...`
`and was covering his eyes with his right hand and weeping without restraint...`
`"Horrible...`
` .........That's horrible...`
` ...He proposed to the girl he loved and lost her the next day.`
` ......And on the same day, even his Mom and Dad were killed...`
` ......I-Isn't that too harsh...?"`
`...Of course, it's sad whenever anyone dies, no matter who it is.`
`But to Battler, ...those left alone by the deaths of others were far more worthy of pity.`
`Everyone here now had lost someone close to them.`
`George wasn't the only one to be pitied.`
`...However, ...George's pain was far greater than everyone else's.`
`".........Battler......"`
`"I know...everyone dies sooner or later...`
` If you're human, you'll eventually reach a time when you've gotta fight the sorrow of losing someone close to you.`
` ...But still, shouldn't that day be far in the future for Aniki,`
` ...and shouldn't those deaths visit him one at a time...?!!`
` ...Horrible, `
`it's too horrible...`
` ...That bastard...`
` That bastard......!`
` Doesn't he have...even a speck of human sympathy in him...?!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!"`
`"......Uu-...`
` Battler, ...don't cry, don't cry..."`
`Maria tried to comfort Battler in a mechanical-sounding voice...`
` Battler violently wiped his tears.`
`"Yeah...`
` Damn it, ...I won't cry anymore...`
` Tears of regret, tears of sadness, I won't shed them again...`
` ...Aah, it's all useless.`
` The witch's got me backed into a corner.`
` I'm always on the defensive...!`
` And that's useless, it's all useless!`
` I'll spin the chessboard around...!!`
` That bastard probably thinks we'll be running scared like sheep until tomorrow before we try anything.`
` ...But guess what, I'll spin it around!!`
` That bastard can't escape this island until tomorrow either...!`
` We won't be hiding away, pissing ourselves, that bastard will!`
` I'll expose you, you'll see.`
` By tomorrow,`
` ...no, screw tomorrow. Tonight."`
`"Before tonight's over I'll be gripping you by the collar...!!"`
`"...At any rate, we'll lock this room and leave everything as it is until the police come.`
` ...No objections, I take it?"`
`Natsuhi announced it as though she didn't care whether they agreed or not.`
`...If anyone had a right to object, it would've been George, ...but he looked as though he'd shed enough tears.`
`George nodded slightly, still facing away from the others, `
`and when he stood up, everyone else agreed too.`
`Natsuhi still hadn't opened that Western envelope of the Family Head that she'd picked up.`
`...But now that they'd decided to leave this room, she decided to unseal it in the parlor, where everyone could watch.`
`As soon as they walked out into the hallway to head back to the parlor,`
` ......some of them immediately felt something out of place, ...or maybe sensed something strange.`
`"......Uu-.`
` ...Stinks?"`
`"Ah, ...did you notice it too, Maria?`
` ...Seriously, what's that smell? ...It's awful..."`
`When everyone sniffed the air,`
` ...they did notice a horrible burnt smell drifting through the hallway, one that none of them had smelled until then.`
`"...I will go quickly to check the kitchen...`
` I'm sure I turned the flame off..."`
`After noticing a burnt smell, it was natural that Kumasawa, who had just been using the burner in the kitchen, suspected that her own slip-up had caused it.`
` Kumasawa hastily dashed away.`
`"...Kanon, go with Kumasawa.`
` Do not let her be alone."`
`"Y-Yes...!"`
`After nodding at Genji's order, Kanon followed after her.`
`...He wasn't running, but as he followed her, he tried to search for the cause of the smell in other directions as well.`
`"...Uu-.`
` Stinks.`
` ...Uuu--."`
`"It truly is...a stench that makes the nose wrinkle.`
` ...However, that doesn't mean we can just open a window for ventilation..."`
`Natsuhi was reluctant to open the windows in a situation where self-defense was so important.`
`"......Let us run the fan.`
` I do not believe there will be any need to open the windows."`
`"...George-aniki,`
` ...is it okay if I talk to you?"`
`"...If it's about finding the culprit, then I have no problems."`
`It seemed that George had managed to climb out of the abyss of sorrow.`
`...All that filled his chest now was the quiet flame of hatred towards the culprit who had stolen the lives of the one he loved and his beloved parents.`
`"...The chain for this room was set.`
` ...From what I could tell by looking at it, I'm positive that it couldn't be opened from the outside.`
` ...In other words, this was a perfect closed room."`
`"......That does seem to be the case.`
` In the case of the rose garden storehouse, they might've sneaked the shutter's key out of the servant room,`
` or maybe they had a duplicate key. ...I can imagine many ways they could've done it.`
` ......But this chain is different.`
` Among generally used locking techniques, a chain is the simplest one to create a closed room with."`
`"Only a chain will block everyone coming from the outside as long as it isn't physically broken.`
` So, does this mean the culprit couldn't have gone in or out through the door...?"`
`"...That's interesting.`
` Just a few hours ago, I seem to remember everyone making a fuss over how to enter a room without using the door."`
`Back then, we were all losing our cool, wondering how Grandfather had disappeared from his room.`
`...The receipt Aunt Eva stuck in the door on a whim proved that the door had remained sealed,`
` and since Aunt Natsuhi was the only person to enter or exit during that time, she was under suspicion.`
`Aunt Eva proposed a theory about how Aunt Natsuhi might've thrown Grandfather out the window...`
`and left by the door herself.`
`But this door is much simpler.`
`It was sealed from the inside by the door chain.`
`The window had also been locked from the inside, and the bodies had been inside the room.`
`...This time it really had been, without exaggeration, a true closed room.`
`...That's right.`
` If you include Grandfather's disappearance, three cases have occurred, and all three times, the door has been the point of interest.`
`The first was the shutter.`
`There was a key in the servant room, and if we assume someone knew about that, this can't really be called a closed room.`
`The next was the door sealed by the receipt.`
`However, Aunt Natsuhi entered that room,`
` so if Grandfather had left through the window or been thrown out, she would've been able to lock the window before escaping.`
`Or, like my theory, Grandfather could've hidden until the receipt was gone and left the room later.`
` ...Basically, this door can be defeated with a handful of desperate tricks.`
`In that sense, you really can't call this one a closed room either.`
`And now, we have the door sealed with the door chain.`
`...Finally, we have to give up.`
`The window, the door, ...everything had been locked.`
` It was a perfect closed room.`
`The first hadn't been a closed room because everyone could be suspected.`
`...The second hadn't been a closed room because Aunt Natsuhi could be suspected.`
`...But this time, no one can be suspected!`
`This was a perfect closed room, because the door chain formed a seal that blocked everyone equally well...!`
`"...In that case, did the culprit carry out the crime without entering the room...?`
` With some method from outside the room...?"`
`"Good point...`
` Even though the chain makes it impossible to open it wide enough for a person to fit through, you can open it a small crack.`
` Did the culprit knock on the door to make them peer out...before attacking them...?`
` Wait, ...am I missing something...?"`
`"Yeah, you are.`
` ......If Aunt Eva's body had been lying right next to the door, then it might've been possible.`
` But she was on the bed at the back of the room!`
` And Uncle Hideyoshi was even in the bathroom.`
` Looking from the crack in the door, you couldn't even see them, and you couldn't reach them with your hands either.`
` ...Damn it, it's all useless. I don't have a clue!!"`
`...Something was tugging softly at my sleeve.`
` ...It was Maria.`
`".........Uu-.`
` Satisfied?"`
`"What do you mean, satisfied?"`
`"......Kihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` ...Battler, since you didn't want to suspect any of your relatives, you made a wish, saying you wanted the culprit to be Beatrice, right?"`
`"Well, Beatrice granted that wish.`
` ...Just as you asked, she 'did something that was completely impossible for a human to make you believe in the witch'.`
` .........And now you're complaining? How selfish.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
`'!s0`
`I tapped Maria, who was laughing unpleasantly, on the head with my fist.`
`"Sure, thanks for granting that wish.`
` That just now was to thank you, and also to teach you to stop laughing when it's inappropriate.`
` More importantly, tell me.`
` There was another mysterious scribble on the door to Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi's room.`
` Was that another magic circle?!"`
`"...Kihihihihihihihi.`
` That one had a really memorable and characteristic design, so I'd hoped you'd at least know what it was.`
`'!s0`
`"I don't know, which is why I'm letting you take the credit.`
` Quit whining and explain."`
`"......You sure are violent, Battler.`
` I won't tell you if you're too mean, get it...?`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, mar_1e692:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, mar_1e693:`
`"What does it mean?`
` What is this magic circle's effect?!`
` What does the Hebrew writing mean?!"`
`"The words are from the Old Testament, Psalms 107 verse 16.`
` ...'For he has broken gates of brass and cuts through bars of iron'.`
` ...This magic circle has two effects.`
` First, it can open a door regardless of which method has been used to lock it."`
`"That sure is convenient.`
` ...So you're saying they're trying to make it look like they're a witch, because this closed room has a door that can't be opened without relying on magic...?!`
` And the other effect?!"`
`"When you're blocked by unopenable doors in all directions, it opens a door.`
` ...By using it in a difficult situation, it gives you a solution you hadn't even thought of until then.`
` Generally speaking, you receive the powers of observation and discernment, inspiration and intuition.`
` .........Kihihihihihihihihihi.`
` Beatrice is trying to provoke you, since there's no way lowly humans like Battler could figure out how this door was opened.`
` Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihi, `
`o-uch."`
`"Okay, good work, so shut up.`
` ...Sounds great, I'll accept this challenge from the witch!"`
`"...Maria-chan,`
` ...things like witches and demons don't exist in this world.`
` ...Someone killed Father and Mother!`
` I don't know whether that was someone I know or not.`
` But either way, it was definitely a human...!!"`
`"......Yeah, but...how?`
` How did they reach those two through that crack in the door? It couldn't have been more than ten centimeters wide...!"`
`"At any rate, I can hardly stand this stench.`
` ...What in the world could it be...?!"`
`Kanon and Kumasawa, who had gone on ahead, realized the smell wasn't coming from the kitchen even before they arrived there.`
`That was because they noticed an even thicker wave of stench rising up from the stairs leading to the basement, which they passed on their way to the kitchen.`
`"......The boiler room..."`
`"...I wonder if there's something wrong with the boiler again..."`
`Those stairs led to the underground boiler room.`
`The mansion's boiler was old and in poor condition.`
`Both of them had witnessed problems with the boiler on several occasions, but they had never smelled the boiler belching out a stench like this before.`
`*slam*.`
`"Wh-What was that sound...?!"`
`The thing they heard from the basement was definitely the sound of a door closing.`
`...Kumasawa had phrased it as a question, but she already knew it couldn't be anything else.`
`Kumasawa was so surprised at that sound that her knees gave way yet again and she cowered...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`...After all, ~ib~at that very moment, no one could have been in the boiler room~ib~.`
`Just a few seconds ago, everyone had been crowded together around Eva and Hideyoshi's room!`
` So who caused the sound of a door closing just now?!`
`".....................!"`
`"Kanon-san...!!"`
`After taking a second to sort out the situation, Kanon ran down towards the basement...!`
`Since they'd heard the sound of a door closing just now, and there was no sign of anyone coming up the stairs,`
` the person who'd closed the door had to be inside the boiler room now.`
`If the boiler room had been a dead end, Kanon wouldn't have rushed in so hastily.`
`...But Kanon was a servant, so he knew.`
`There were two entrances to the boiler room, one that opened to the mansion and one that opened to the courtyard.`
`If he didn't chase them now, they might slip away...!`
`Kumasawa reached the same conclusion long after Kanon did.`
`...But she couldn't let him go alone...!`
`If the thing in the boiler room was the culprit,`
` ...an opponent who had easily killed six adults in the first murder,`
` then no matter how Kanon confronted them, he wouldn't be a match.`
`...Of course, with this argument, even if Kumasawa joined him, it wouldn't change anything...`
`At any rate, after a delay, Kumasawa decided that she mustn't let Kanon go alone, and she rushed down the stairs...!!`
`At that time, Kanon was already in the boiler room.`
`The boiler room's characteristic damp heat tormented him.`
`...It had always been an unpleasantly smelly and hot place.`
`And on top of that, the room was full of that horrible stench, ...which made Kanon feel like he was going to be sick.`
`......There was no doubt that this room was the source.`
`In that case, Kanon should have been searching for where the smell was coming from.`
`However, Kanon kept gazing straight forward as he grabbed a hatchet from a tool shelf just off to the side of the door.`
`...He hadn't stretched out his hand because he'd wanted a hatchet.`
`...He had wanted to grab a weapon, any weapon.`
` ...Why?`
`"........................"`
`Kanon gazed into the darkness where the naked light bulb couldn't pierce.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`...Then, he `
`~ib~answered~ib~`
`.`
`"............In roulette, you bet on a number or the colors red or black, vying for a payoff.`
` ...However, low-risk bets like black and red only offer a similarly low payoff."`
`The words coming from Kanon's mouth...were swallowed up by the darkness.`
`That darkness suddenly started to swirl, glittering...`
`It was...such a fantastical scene...`
`Golden sparkling butterflies that hid in the shadows all over the boiler room...`
`flapped their wings, twinkling beautifully, ...and gathered in the darkness, disappearing...`
`Kanon continued speaking, directing his words at the darkness as it swallowed the butterflies up.`
`...But as the butterflies gathered in the darkness, they......perhaps...probably...no, they would certainly...laugh.`
`...But Kanon continued to speak without faltering in the slightest.`
`"...However, if you bet on something with a lower probability, your payoff increases proportional to the risk.`
` ......The Master called succeeding despite an astronomical risk a 'miracle',`
` and called the astronomical payoff gained as a result 'magic'."`
`"......I have no interest in what kind of 'magic' you and the Master were seeking when you spun that roulette...`
` But you forgot something.`
` ...You forgot that in roulette, there's a pocket that's neither black nor red."`
`Roulette has a special pocket called '0', which means that the house takes everything in certain variants of the game.`
` This means that all of the coins bet on the table will be swept up, just as though everyone has forfeit...`
`"......I set my heart on just one thing.`
` ...I decided that if...`
`...Shannon were to be killed, and I was left alive,`
` ......I'd sacrifice this life of mine and bring this roulette of yours to ruin...!"`
`".........This isn't one of the Master's rules, ...and it certainly isn't one of yours.`
` ......I made this rule myself.`
` ......I'm not furniture anymore.`
` ......I'm the zero on your roulette...!"`
`...Kanon's face...twisted with humiliation.`
`......It was clear that his defiance against his own weaknesses was being ridiculed somehow.`
`Kanon's brow creased even further, ...and a fierce expression that he'd never shown to anyone appeared on his face.`
`...The hand grasping the hatchet was shaking.`
` ...His sweat became drops, which slid downward...`
`It was clear that the emotion causing Kanon's hand to shake wasn't just anger.`
`...However, Kanon suppressed that emotion...`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kan_1e261:`
` ...W-`
`Wait another thousand years in hell for your next summoner, `
`Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiice!!!"`
`When Kanon raised the hatchet and tried to dive into the darkness, the darkness definitely sneered.`
`It sneered at that courage as if it were vulgar, lazy, futile, and meaningless.`
`......Kanon, his hatchet still held aloft,`
` ......couldn't take another step after that...`
`With a *clang*,`
` the hatchet that he'd been grasping fell and rolled on the floor...`
`And following that, with a pair of thuds,`
` Kanon's knees hit, ...left, then right...`
`That hand, which looked like it was trying to catch the sky now that the hatchet had been dropped, gradually lowered,`
` ...landing on his chest.`
` Then, the other hand did the same.`
`...Right there, a handle with a demon-shaped design was buried into his chest.`
`The same type of weapon that had been stabbed into Eva and Hideyoshi's foreheads...was in Kanon's chest...`
`'!s1`
`............ghh, `
`......"`
`Kanon was curled up in anguish, fresh blood dribbling from the corner of his mouth...`
`...It was...makeup too extreme for Kanon's white skin...`
`Around this scene, the glittering gold butterflies danced through the darkness, mesmerizing...`
`It was a beautiful, beautiful dance...a funeral march of tribute, ridicule, and contempt for a single boy's self-sacrifice.`
`...Kanon had already been prepared for his own death,`
` ...but although he could do nothing but accept the death he had received, he attempted one last measure of resistance.`
`...He grasped the handle of the weapon sticking into his chest with both hands,`
` ......and gritting his teeth with an acute, unearthly pain, .........`
`............he pulled it out.`
`For only a moment, a bright-red spray gushed out.`
`...It made an unpleasant *bloop* sound.`
`It probably resembled the sound of Kanon's soul as it was sucked into the swamp of the dead...`
`"......Kanon-san?!`
` Eeeeeeeeeeeeek!!!`
` S-Someoooooooone!!`
` Eeeeeeeeekkk!"`
`Kumasawa screamed at the incomprehensible sight in front of her.`
`Kanon was lying in a pool of blood...`
`...Kumasawa's heart was a complete mess.`
`Aah, what a horrible fate!`
`He wouldn't have been killed if I had been with him!`
`Aah, what incredible luck!`
`If I had been with him, I might have been killed too!!`
`As she screamed, her expression was filled with complete confusion, and all of the muscles of her face were pulled up, almost as though she was smiling while crying...`
` But no one could have made fun of an expression like this...!!`
`"What is it, Kumasawa?!!`
` Answer me, Kumasawa!!!"`
`The first one to dash in was Natsuhi, holding the rifle.`
`Battler and Genji dashed in after her.`
`Normally, they probably would've started discussing the origin of that violent stench filling the boiler room.`
`...But after they saw Kanon, who was lying on the ground as if he were drowning in an ocean of his own blood, the stench wasn't important anymore.`
`"Kanon!`
` Answer me!!`
` ...Genji, bring Doctor Nanjo here!!"`
`Natsuhi realized that even though Kanon was on the verge of death, he was still conscious, so she sent Genji to get the doctor.`
`...Natsuhi, holding the rifle aloft, faced the darkness in the center of the boiler room and shouted!`
`"...Who is hiding over there?!!!`
` Come out quietly!!`
` If you don't come out from there, I'll shoot without mercy!!"`
`"We need light!`
` Aunt Natsuhi, let's light them up!!"`
`Battler, thinking quickly, took a large flashlight from the tool shelf alongside the door and used its light to cut through the darkness Natsuhi was glaring into.`
`But the light only shone on mechanical-looking piping and a door.`
`The door had been left open a small crack, and it was obvious that someone had left through there in a hurry.`
`"...Aunt Natsuhi, where does that door go?!"`
`"G-Genji...!`
` Where does that door lead to?!"`
`"...Th-The courtyard...!"`
`"L-Like hell I'd let you get away, you damn bastaaaaaaaard!!!"`
`Battler let out a war cry as he slammed into the door.`
`Cool air from outside suddenly rushed in.`
`...There were some thin, rough stairs leading up.`
`...Battler ran up them, shouting!`
`"Wait, Battler-kun!!`
` It's dangerous to be on your own right now!!"`
`Natsuhi was also rushing up the stairs, chasing after Battler.`
`They were in the courtyard.`
`...The courtyard of the mansion had been built strictly for lighting purposes, so it wasn't a very elegant place.`
`Because it was surrounded on all sides, the air was calm and completely undisturbed, even though they could hear the sound of strong winds.`
`There was only the gentle, sorrowful rain...`
`As he ran through the cold and scattered raindrops, dashing up the stairs into the courtyard, Battler looked in every direction.`
`......Of course, the odds of him finding a suspicious silhouette just standing around nonchalantly were pretty much zero...`
`Battler spun, looking all around.`
` He turned again and again.`
` He kept spinning until he almost lost his sense of direction.`
` He prayed that he would see the culprit somewhere in this scenery...!`
`But there was no chance.`
`All he saw as he spun was more and more of the mansion's heartless walls and windows...!`
`Furthermore, there were two entrances into the mansion from the courtyard, and neither of them were locked.`
`Because the courtyard couldn't be entered from outside the mansion, the doors had been built without locks.`
`......He didn't know which one they had left through!`
` He had to give up.`
`Battler pounded the wall with his fist, swearing...`
`"...Battler-kun!!`
` You mustn't run ahead by yourself!!`
` .........`
`...Battler-kun...?"`
`Battler pressed his forehead against the wall, which he scratched at with his fingernails as he cried......`
`"......Damn it, ...damn it, damn it!!`
` Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi!`
` And now Kanon-kun!!!`
` You killed a full six people!!`
` And that wasn't enough, so you had to kill three more!!`
` Are you kidding me, are you fucking kidding meeeeeeeeeeeee?!!`
` Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi were always kind and fun...!!`
` I just met Kanon yesterday, but I'm sure I'd have gotten along fine with him!`
` Why did you kill them?!!`
` Why, why...?!!!`
` You know, when people die, they don't come back to life again, right?!`
` They aren't gonna quickly sprout up again like bamboo shoots!"`
`"......Why'd you kill them?!`
` Why, `
`...why...?!!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!"`
`...Battler was a boy who could understand the feelings of pain and regret in a person's heart.`
` ...So he cried.`
` With all his strength.`
`Natsuhi, who had always thought of Battler as a frank person, was a little surprised to find he had this delicate side,`
` ...and at the same time, she understood how easily hurt the heart of a young person could be, so she held him.`
`".........It's all right.`
` ...I will definitely protect you, George-kun, Maria-chan, and Jessica.`
` ......As a mother, ...and as the representative of the Ushiromiya family...!"`
`"......Gyaaaaaaaahhh!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaggghhhh!!"`
`Battler, after sobbing into Natsuhi's chest for a while, `
`wiped his tears with a bitter smile, as though he had been like that the whole time, and tried to appear as though he'd cried more than enough already...`
`"Anyway, let's go back down for now.`
` ...Protecting ourselves is a higher priority than finding the culprit.`
` Tomorrow, the boat will arrive.`
` After that happens, the police will come, and everything should be brought to light.`
` ......There's no way the culprit can escape this island, no matter how much they struggle...!!"`
`"...That's right.`
` ...When the police come..."`
`When the seagulls cry, ...the crime will be solved.`
`But, ...for some reason, Battler felt a slight sense of uneasiness, ...as if the seagulls would never cry again.`
`...That couldn't be true.`
`When the typhoon passes, surely the lively seagulls will return to the harbor again...`
`I returned to the boiler room along with Aunt Natsuhi and told everyone weakly that we hadn't found anything.`
`We heard that Doctor Nanjo and George-aniki had carried Kanon-kun to the servant room.`
`The servant room had a first aid kit and a sink, and could apparently function as a nurse's office.`
`Kumasawa-san and Jessica had accompanied them.`
`...Stains from Kanon-kun's blood remained on the floor.`
`Judging by the large amount of blood lost and the ruthless shape of the weapon that had fallen carelessly to the ground, `
`...I figured that Doctor Nanjo's treatment would probably end in vain...`
`That weapon was doubtlessly the same type that had been stuck in Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi's foreheads.`
`......But wait, isn't the demonic design on the handle a little different...?`
`There seemed to be some small differences in that part.`
`Still, as far as their overall shape was concerned, the weapons were all of the same type.`
`Though it had seemed brutal, we'd left the weapons stuck into Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi to preserve the crime scene.`
`...So this was the first time we were able to have a perfect view of the entire weapon.`
`As we had expected, the weapon was not bladed like a knife, but shaped like an icepick,`
` ...or rather, a thin stake.`
`And, ...it had a spiral-shaped pattern, sort of like a drill.`
`...It looked like something that might be driven into the hearts of human sacrifices in some demonic ritual...`
`Including the handle, it was 25 centimeters long.`
` Half of that was the stake-shaped part, which was stained with deep red blood.`
`......The length of the blood-stained part made it clear just how deeply it must have penetrated into Kanon-kun's chest...`
`But Aunt Natsuhi and the rest didn't even look at the weapon, and instead stood in front of the incinerator, where the horrible stench was emanating from.`
`They must have dragged it out.`
` Dragged out 'that thing' which had been burning in the furnace.`
`...'It' was still smoldering and kept sending out dense waves of that awfully unpleasant smell...`
`Genji-san and Maria stared down at it.`
`Aunt Natsuhi probably couldn't stand to look directly at it.`
` ...She kept shaking her head, her back to it.`
`"............Uu-...!"`
`...I thought nothing could surprise me after everything that's happened, `
`...but this is...`
`...gghh...!`
`I stood there for a while, moaning, with a rising urge to vomit...`
`......The true source of that unearthly stench...`
`was a scorched corpse that had been cooking inside the incinerator...`
`The clothes, the surface of the body, and the hair were all hideously burned.`
` That grotesque corpse was in a state where not the face, nor the age, nor even the gender could be guessed at...`
`But when I thought about it calmly, I realized that a corpse appearing at this time could only be one person.`
`......It was Grandfather, who had disappeared that morning, and whose whereabouts had been unknown.`
`"......I believe...it is most likely the Master."`
`"......I...agree.`
` ......That he would pass away in such a state......`
` ......It's heartrending..."`
`"...But...is there any proof that this corpse really is Grandfather...?`
` It's burnt so black, you can't even tell what sex it is..."`
`"Battler-kun, ...look at the feet."`
`Aunt Natsuhi, with her handkerchief over her mouth and her eyes averted, pointed and told me to look at the burnt corpse's feet.`
`............?`
`"...Notice how there are six toes on each foot."`
`"Huh?`
` .........Ah, `
`...you're right......"`
`Just as Genji-san had said, there were six toes on each foot.`
`Each individual toe had looked so normal in its line that I hadn't noticed...`
`"...The Master was born with six toes on both of his feet.`
` ...Consequently, the Master was entrusted with the revival of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"I have heard that since long ago, cases of polydactyly were common in the Ushiromiya family.`
` ...It's probably hereditary."`
`Polydactyly literally means 'many fingers'.`
`Because of a little mistake by God when the person is born, one of their toes or fingers splits into two, and the total number increases.`
`But a big deal isn't usually made of polydactyly in the world at large.`
`That's because it isn't a disease, just something people are born with.`
`So while they are still babies, at about the time they turn one year old, they can be taken to the hospital and given surgery to make them normal.`
`Even a child with polydactyly can be treated before they become aware, so they might not even remember it themselves.`
`By the way, it seems that there's a possibility for this to occur in one out of every two thousand babies,`
` so even though it's not usually seen, it isn't that rare at all.`
`Speaking of which, I think Uncle Hideyoshi mentioned something to me long ago.`
` ...Something about how even Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the man who unified Japan at the end of the Sengoku period, had six fingers on one hand...`
`According to Aunt Natsuhi, among the many Ushiromiya Family Heads, the ones most praised for their wisdom all had polydactyly.`
`...Because of that, when Grandfather was born, his relatives were all excited at the thought that he might become another wise leader.`
` And, when the leading relatives all died in the Great Kanto Earthquake, it was apparently argued that Grandfather should be the one to restore the family, because of the auspicious sign of his birth.`
`If Grandfather hadn't disliked his position as the Head so much, this sixth toe probably would've been pretty lucky for him.`
`...Come to think of it, I've heard about some country where it's believed people with polydactyly should be treated as gods and revered...`
`This is beside the point, but it's fairly common in mystery novels for a corpse to be burned to hide its identity.`
`...But I guess that in Grandfather's case, just toasting him wouldn't be enough...`
`And, ...Grandfather's body was not simply burnt.`
`...It was just like Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi...and the thing that had been stabbed into Kanon-kun's chest.`
` One of those 'demon's icepicks'...was stuck into his forehead...!`
`"......The Head's Ring is not on his finger."`
`"...So the letter last night was telling the truth.`
` .........Father...`
`would probably be horribly disappointed..."`
`Natsuhi-san let her head droop and closed her eyes tightly...`
`...This room had also become a vital crime scene for us to hand over to the police.`
`...It was decided that we would leave Grandfather's corpse here and lock the room, sealing it.`
`It isn't clear when Grandfather's corpse started burning in the incinerator.`
`Since, according to Genji, the strength of the flames hadn't been that strong, the body must have started burning a long time ago,`
` so that stench could slowly creep out of the furnace and fill the room bit by bit, eventually pouring out and climbing up the staircase.`
`...Putting aside whether he was rare or well-done,`
` Grandfather had been brought out, killed, and burned...even though he had started out locked away in the closed room created by his auto-lock.`
` ...There's probably no doubting this...`
`However, according to Genji-san, the boiler room is usually locked.`
`......The possibility that someone outside our group had snuck in and committed the crime was overwhelmingly high,`
` and there was also a good chance that this person was walking around with something like a master key.`
`...After all, the doors and windows throughout the mansion had been checked.`
`But despite that, the culprit was able to strut around the mansion freely.`
`Does this crime confirm that a 19th person exists?`
`There's still that contradiction, since they're trying to tout their existence without ever showing themselves once.`
`Along with Kyrie-san's chessboard theory, I've been using this contradiction to deny the existence of a 19th person.`
`...By spinning the chessboard around once more,`
` the very fact that this crime makes it perfectly obvious that a 19th person exists...`
`means that the existence of the 19th person is even less plausible.`
` As long as that 19th person doesn't show themselves in front of us...!`
`...If the culprit could get Grandfather out through the door sealed by the receipt, `
`if they could kill Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi from the other side of a door sealed by a chain, `
`...then could they possibly go so far as to create a fictional 19th person through strange tricks and devices...?!?!`
`If we still want to believe that the culprit is among the 18, `
`...then the list of suspects has grown very short.`
`The four of us kids, Aunt Natsuhi,`
` Genji-san, `
`Kumasawa baa-chan, `
`and Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...One of these people has to be the culprit!`
`Wait, we can't be sure of that.`
`......Just a second ago, we started doubting whether the corpse here was actually Grandfather's, right?`
`Maybe we can think of the other bodies in the same way.`
`For example, the first six all had their faces horribly smashed.`
`...Some of the bodies had kept enough of their faces for us to confirm who they were, but that old bastard, for example...`
`had lost his entire face, as though the whole thing had been neatly peeled off...`
`We only figured out which body was which by their clothes and surroundings...`
`Did the culprit prepare a fake body beforehand and alter it to make it look like they'd died, ...even though they were actually hiding somewhere after committing the crime...?`
`...It may sound ridiculous, but it wouldn't be an impossible trick to pull off.`
`...It's too early to give in to this 19th person...`
`no, this witch...!`
`"Maria-chan, you mustn't stare so fixedly anymore.`
` Come on, Battler-kun too.`
` I'm worried about Kanon's condition, and we mustn't remain in a place like this any longer than necessary.`
` Let us return."`
`"......Uu-."`
`Maria didn't go out with everyone else, but remained in the boiler room.`
`The thing she was staring so fixedly at probably wasn't Grandfather's body,`
` but the 'demon's icepick' sticking out of his forehead.`
`...It was probably the sort of item that an enthusiast couldn't bear to ignore.`
`I tapped her on the head.`
`"Hey, Maria.`
` ...What's Beatrice after?`
` Is it all of our lives...?"`
`"...Kihihihihihihihi.`
` Beatrice will revive very soon.`
` ...At that time, none shall be left alive.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihi."`
`"How can you laugh at something like that?`
` Do you think you're the only one who's safe?`
` Why don't you feel like you're in danger?`
` Why aren't you scared?!"`
`"...Beatrice made a promise.`
` ...She said she's gonna take me to the Golden Land.`
` ......It's a wonderful place where you have no obligations, everyone's always together, and everyone is always nice to everyone else."`
`"......I'm looking forward to it.`
` That time will come, very soon now.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`...Just what kind of person is Maria...?`
`.........I only know what Maria was like six years ago, when she was three.`
` She was once pure and obedient, ...a good kid.`
`This new Maria six years later and the Maria I knew...didn't seem to fit together.`
`...Just who is she, ...this 'witch' who calls herself Maria...?`
`To Maria, who obstinately believes in the witch,`
` ......this series of unsolvable crimes is proof that the witch actually exists.`
`Every time something occurs that would be difficult for a human, it becomes a little harder for the rest of us to not believe in Beatrice.`
`It must be an 'intense pleasure' for Maria to see her relatives, who once firmly denied the witch's existence,`
` start acknowledging that witch's existence one by one...`
`......Is that why she's in high spirits...?`
`".........Maria, `
`@:dwave_eng 0, but_1e1229:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, but_1e1230:`
`"Uu-...?"`
`"...Yesterday, you were given a letter in the rose garden.`
` ......Who gave it to you...?!"`
`"Uu-.`
` ...Like I said, Beatrice.`
` Battler still doesn't believe.`
` Uu-."`
`Maria only repeated what she had already said.`
`...Maria met with the 19th person, the witch.`
`Was that really a 19th person, or did one of the 18 just get her to say that?`
`All that's certain...is that Maria has been with the rest of us constantly, has always had an alibi, and hasn't done anything suspicious.`
`...She's simply overjoyed at being made Beatrice's messenger...and certainly isn't the 19th person...`
`.........Supposedly.`
`That's right,`
` I wonder what's written in the letter we picked up in Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi's room...`
` Aunt Natsuhi should still have it with her...`
`......In the end, Kanon-kun did not regain consciousness.`
`Even though Doctor Nanjo and the rest did all they could to heal him...`
`...Of course, there was very little that could be done on an island like this without medicine or proper facilities...`
`However, Kanon was the only human ever to confront the culprit.`
`If only he could give us some kind of clue...`
`However, at the time they carried Kanon away, it was already...`
`...too late.`
`"......My sincere apologies.`
` Without proper facilities, there was nothing I could do about such a serious wound..."`
`"...No, that's perfectly understandable.`
` Thank you so much for giving it your very best."`
`Doctor Nanjo's shirt had been sprayed by a violent spurt of blood, so it was easy to imagine the devotion with which he had tried to save Kanon's life...up until the last second.`
`Jessica was crouched in the corridor, crying softly.`
`...She had probably been taking care of Kanon-kun until the moment of his death.`
`George-aniki tried to approach her with words of comfort, but when Jessica pushed him away,`
` he stopped trying to force her to talk and left her alone.`
`"......If only I hadn't let Kanon-san go alone, ......ooohhhh..."`
`"...Do not let that bother you.`
` ...If you had been with him, you would probably have been attacked as well.`
` ...He foolishly rushed on ahead and paid for his mistake."`
`"How can you say it like that?!`
` Kanon-kun spotted the culprit and bravely stood up to them!!`
` If only Kumasawa-san had gone with him, the culprit might've hesitated and chosen to run away!!"`
`Emotion-filled words that I never thought I'd hear coming from Jessica's mouth tumbled out.`
`...Kumasawa, looking truly sorry, could do nothing but hang her head...`
`"Jessica..."`
`"......You shouldn't talk to her now.`
` ...It's the same for me...and probably you as well, right, Battler-kun?`
` We don't know what's going on, and it feels like our hearts are going to split open..."`
`There were tears in George-aniki's eyes again.`
`...Seeing Jessica break down crying probably brought back the pain of losing his parents.`
`......I'd done my crying all at once.`
`...So I didn't feel like crying anymore.`
`...However, I understood how great the pain in their hearts was.`
`"......It's okay, Jessica.`
` ......You'll be able to meet Kanon again soon."`
`"...Stop it!`
` I don't need you trying to console me like that...!"`
`"Beatrice will resurrect the dead and even love that has been lost.`
` ...So you'll definitely be able to meet him soon.`
` Then, everyone will be able to live in peace."`
`"So the one who killed Kanon-kun...is this Beatrice who supposedly gave you that letter yesterday?!`
` Where is she?!`
` Where's she hiding?!`
` I'll find her and tear her apart!!!`
` Tell me!! You know who the culprit really is, don't you?!!`
` What do you know and what are you hiding?!!`
` Tell me, damn iiiiiiiiit!!!"`
`"...M-Milady, please stop...!"`
`"Uu-!`
` Uu-!`
` Beatrice exists!`
` 'Exists'!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Damn it, let go of me, Genji-san!!`
` Maria knows who the culprit is!!`
` And she's hiding their identity even though she knows!`
` She must be telling them what we're doing, guiding them as they kill us!!"`
`"Jessica, be silent!!"`
`Jessica grabbed at Maria...`
`Genji tried to stop her, but Jessica could not be calmed.`
` ...The next thing I heard was the sound of Aunt Natsuhi slapping Jessica's face.`
`After that, only Jessica's sorrowful sobbing voice resounded throughout the hall...`
`"...Maria-chan,`
` ...I know there's no way you're the culprit.`
` ...You've been with us since the beginning, and there was no time for you to communicate with any culprit.`
` ......So, I want you to tell me something.`
` ...This 'Beatrice' who handed you the letter yesterday, ...who was she?"`
`...Although those words seemed kind, ...they clearly showed that George still had some remaining doubts about Maria.`
`...He didn't actually grab at her.`
`However, he felt exactly the same way Jessica did.`
`"...Aniki,`
` I already asked her the same thing a second ago.`
` ...Her answer was the same as before."`
`"I want to hear it from Maria's mouth.`
` ...Who is Beatrice?"`
`"...............`
`Even if I told you, you wouldn't...believe anyway."`
`"What do you mean by that?!`
` ...Could it be the culprit's someone we know well...`
`and you're keeping silent because you're covering for them for some reason?!`
` Who gave you that letter?!"`
`"......I got it from Beatrice.`
` I'll say it no matter how many times you ask.`
` I got the letter from Beatrice.`
` ......Kihihihihihihihihi.`
` George onii-chan, do you refuse to believe in Beatrice because she's not an opponent you can hit?"`
`"You want to turn your feelings of helplessness into violence and beat someone up.`
` So you won't be satisfied unless your opponent is a Human you can hit.`
` ......So even if I tell you the truth, you won't accept it.`
` So it's pointless for me to tell you.`
` You won't believe."`
`"......But I'll keep on saying it.`
` Because it's true.`
` ...Beatrice 'exists'!`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi...!`
` The door to the Golden Land will soon be opened.`
` I'll go there.`
` Beatrice promised!"`
`"In that world, Mama is nice, Papa is with us and is also nice.`
` I wanna go there right away.`
` ...Everyone is afraid of Beatrice.`
` But that's only natural.`
` ...So calm yourselves.`
` ...Beatrice said so herself.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~By the time the typhoon has passed, I'll have ended everything, she said~ib~`
`.`
`'!s0`
`"...Maria, I don't mind you being talkative, but let's leave it at that for now.`
` ...I'll bet this is all a pretty happy situation for you, since you're always going on about how witches exist, but keep that to yourself for now.`
` Don't try to force that on other people."`
`"Uu-."`
`"I-I know I've been creeped out by this girl for a while now, `
`...but there really is something wrong with her!!`
` Don't you think so too, Battler, Genji-san?!`
` Kumasawa-san?!`
` What about you, Mom?!!`
` Maria knows who the culprit is and she's hiding it!`
` Okay, maybe she hasn't done anything directly!`
` But she's definitely working with the criminal!!`
` That's right, she's a spy!`
` We can't let her stay with us any longer!!"`
`".........Kihihihi."`
`"......Maria-chan,`
` ...you must realize there are times when indiscreet discussion is best avoided.`
` If you keep adding oil to the fire, even I will get very angry."`
`"............"`
`Aunt Natsuhi glared at Maria with frightening eyes.`
`...Maria was used to Aunt Rosa's loud style of scolding, but she apparently hadn't built up a resistance to Aunt Natsuhi's quiet sort of scolding.`
` ...She shrugged and kept her mouth shut.`
`A desolate feeling filled the room...`
`It felt as though things would just get more complicated if anyone spoke.`
`...How many people have already died?`
`Six people in Dad's group.`
`After that, both Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi, Kanon-kun, Grandfather...`
`......There were a whole 18 people on this island, supposedly, ...and 10 of those people have been killed.`
`That's more than half of us.`
`...And right now, there's absolutely no proof that the remaining eight people will be safe...`
`"...At any rate, this is no time to quarrel.`
` ...Now that we are certain the culprit can enter and leave the mansion at will and strike out of nowhere,`
` we must give our undivided attention to surviving until tomorrow."`
`"...I agree strongly with Aunt Natsuhi.`
` ...We can figure out who the culprit is at our leisure tonight.`
` For now though, we're better off finding a place to barricade ourselves in."`
`As I said this, I pointed out the clock to everyone.`
`It was already 8:00 at night.`
`...We had been receiving shocks over and over again since the early morning, and our bodies and minds were both completely tired out.`
`...There's still a long, long time until tomorrow.`
`We needed to find some place to barricade ourselves in so we could rest our bodies and get even the smallest amount of relief...`
`"......I agree...`
` Everyone is already pushing their mental and physical limits, myself included.`
` I believe it would be wise to take that into account as we move forward..."`
`"That's right.`
` ......There's a high probability that the enemy's got the equivalent of a master key."`
`"...Were Shannon, Kanon-kun and Gohda-san holding master keys?"`
`"......Yes.`
` They were supposed to have them on their person during work."`
`"...We didn't want to disturb the scene, so we didn't investigate that closely. We can't eliminate the possibility that someone stole a key from them."`
`"......In the first place, we know the culprit may have visited the servant room at some point to unlock the garden shed shutter.`
` It's conceivable that they obtained a master key from there earlier on."`
`There were many servants serving the Ushiromiya family.`
`Because of that, there were several master keys.`
`Furthermore, every time one employee started or finished working, the keys were passed between servants,`
` and we had to acknowledge that this had probably gotten a bit sloppy at times in the past.`
`"Even if they borrowed a bundle of keys from the pockets of one of the murdered servants,`
` is there any safe place that even those keys couldn't open...?"`
`"......Because of the nature of our job, we have been entrusted with keys to all of the rooms...`
` All of them in the mansion and in the guesthouse..."`
`"So in other words, ...no matter where we hole up and lock ourselves in, it'd just be pointless.`
` ...Fine, who cares about locking up?! If you're gonna come, bring it on, dammit!`
` I'll beat you at your own game!!"`
`"...The enemy won't approach us from the front.`
` I don't know about the first six, but if we look at what happened to my parents and Kanon-kun,`
` ...and even Grandfather, the enemy has only gone after isolated people.`
` They don't have the power to assault all of us openly in a secure room."`
`"That's right.`
` It's just like Aniki says.`
` ...And maybe Aunt Natsuhi's rifle can serve as a deterrent to stop them from attacking."`
`"......I hope that is so, but..."`
`"..............."`
`"Maria, I know you want to say something, but keep it to yourself and stay quiet for a while."`
`"...Uu-."`
`Maria probably wanted to say something about how witches weren't afraid of things like guns.`
`But if she were to say it out loud, the atmosphere around here would start to get pretty edgy.`
` I had noticed and decided to put a stop to it...`
`"......If I may,`
` I do know of just one place that cannot be entered, even with the servant key rings."`
`"Where is that?"`
`"...That would be `
`the Master's study."`
`"I-I'm against this!!`
` I don't even wanna think about going in Grandfather's creepy room!"`
`"How many keys can gain access to that room?"`
`"...There are two.`
` I always have one on my person.`
` The other was held by the Master himself, but just now, I found this on the corpse in the boiler room..."`
`Genji-san took a handkerchief out of his pocket and opened it, showing us the burnt and filthy study key.`
`Then, he showed it alongside his own key, which he had once lent to Natsuhi.`
`"...Normally, it would have been proper to leave the Master's key for the police, `
`...but because of the Master's orders to protect the safety of the study, I borrowed it for the time being."`
`"......I see...`
` Which means that Kinzo-san's study is the only place where we can be safe..."`
`"...It would appear that way.`
` ...I don't even want to think about being shut up in that strange room all night,`
` but it appears we must acknowledge that his room is safer than anywhere else right now."`
`"......Even though Grandfather locked himself up in that 'safe' room, the culprit brought him out and killed him.`
` ...We can't be certain that it's truly safe."`
`"According to your theory, Grandfather cleverly found a way around that receipt trick and left the room of his own free will.`
` ...If so, the room might be a good place to barricade ourselves in after all..."`
`"...You're too optimistic, Aniki."`
`However, ...at the same time, I thought he brought up a pretty interesting point.`
`After all, this gives us a chance to question the enemy, the witch herself, about how the sealed door had been opened.`
`If we assume the culprit used some technique to kidnap Grandfather from his study...`
`They'd have to show us the same trick again if they wanted to assault us in the study.`
`...And, that'd give us a chance to make the culprit prove how they did it right before our eyes.`
`If she's really a witch, we'll be forcing her to use her little magic trick to open the door right in front of us.`
` ...But that's probably impossible.`
`If you spin the chessboard around, it's obvious the culprit is acting in a way that'll make us think they're a witch.`
`...If she really is a witch, all she's gotta do is appear in front of us and wow us with a colorful display of magic.`
`...Since she's avoided doing that, everything must be the work of a fake witch who wants us to think she's real.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`...Therefore, ~ib~a culprit who used a technique other than magic to defeat the closed room couldn't open the door before our eyes~ib~.`
`"...Is Grandfather's room big enough to stuff eight people in?"`
`"......Yes.`
` There is a bed, a sofa and blankets, so while it is not luxurious, it will be more than suitable for spending the night.`
` There is also a sink, a bathroom, a refrigerator and a liquor cabinet."`
`"Whoa.`
` That's incredible.`
` ...But isn't that weird?`
` You're saying he built another house inside his house?`
` That's pretty cramped for the last house of someone like our Grandfather, who bought a whole island and realized all of his dreams."`
`".........`
`That's right.`
` ...After some point in time, Father probably couldn't feel at peace in any other place, even inside the mansion."`
`"......We always sneered about how he shut himself up in there, and this time, we're the ones who are gonna shut ourselves up.`
` ...Ha!"`
`Jessica spat the words out.`
`"Jessica-chan, ...it sounds like you'd rather go search for the culprit than stay shut up somewhere."`
`"...Of course, I don't think we'll be able to find them if we just start searching on our own.`
` ...In the end, we can't do anything but wait.`
` Th`
`en it doesn't matter where we wait, does it?!`
` I'm not gonna run away or hide.`
` Why don't we just take it easy in the parlor, watching TV or something while we wait for this Beatrice-sama to appear?!"`
`"...It's perfectly fine if she doesn't appear.`
` There's no need for us to be the ones who expose the culprit."`
`"Well said...`
` We shouldn't take needless risks before the police arrive."`
`"Thank you, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ......I think we should move to Father's study.`
` ...True, we have no proof that it's safe, since Father was taken out of there.`
` ...However, I can't deny the possibility that...`
`as Battler-kun reasoned, Grandfather left the study of his own accord and was attacked outside."`
`...A while back, I proposed that strange theory as a stopgap measure.`
`But just as Aunt Eva said, even though that trick would be possible,`
` I couldn't explain what motive could've made Grandfather sneak out of his own study in such a troublesome way.`
`Plus, Grandfather couldn't even have used that trick unless he 'knew that the receipt was wedged in the door'.`
`Aunt Eva hadn't pointed out that last part, `
`...but it's clear how absurd the theory was.`
`So, does that mean the sealed door formed a closed room, just as Aunt Eva claimed?`
`Is it an undeniable fact that Aunt Natsuhi was the culprit...?`
`......If Aunt Eva were here now, she'd probably make that claim openly and blow my strange theory away.`
`...But anyway.`
`I had to admit that a room with both a bed and a toilet, that all eight people could be shut up in, `
`...and with only two keys, both of which were gathered here, ...had to be the safest place in the mansion right now...`
`At the very least, I figured this would be better than just staying shut up in the parlor and hoping nothing would go wrong.`
`But wait, ...have we been safe only because we've been shut up in the parlor?`
`What if leaving that room and moving to an unexplored location is actually more dangerous...?`
`...Aah, it's useless, it's useless, it's all useless...`
`......My flimsy head is about to break out in a fever.`
`...If I keep spinning the chessboard around, right and wrong will keep switching places over and over, and I won't be able to believe anything...`
`When it seems like the culprit is one of the 18, I want to believe in Beatrice,`
` and once I start believing in Beatrice, I start wanting to find the culprit amid the 18.`
`...If that keeps spinning around forever, in the end, my thoughts won't have taken one step from where they started...`
`...How far back in the past was it that Kyrie-san taught me about chessboard thinking...?`
`That concept of examining the situation by spinning it around and thinking from the enemy's side...`
` I seem to remember being so interested by it back then, I used it to guide all my thinking.`
`...By the way, Kyrie-san was Dad's coworker back then.`
`...I never dreamed that she'd someday be added to our family...`
`...Didn't Kyrie-san...`
`tell me something once?`
`I get the feeling she once said that, while this chessboard thinking was one way to look at things, it certainly wasn't all powerful,`
` and it wouldn't be good to rely on it too much...`
`"Chessboard thinking...`
`is my own interpretation of something called game theory, which I read about in a book long ago.`
` It's a very interesting subject, so you should tackle it yourself when you get into college, Battler-kun."`
`"I really wanna try it!`
` If I could study and perfect my chessboard thinking, it'd be fun to be able to read into any opponent's moves, wouldn't it?"`
`"But you can't believe in it blindly.`
` Game theory is a very deep and complicated subject.`
` Chessboard thinking is just my interpretation that skims the surface of game theory.`
` ...In order to thoroughly read your opponent's moves like you're imagining, you need to study your opponent.`
` Additionally, while chessboard theory is convenient and practical, it isn't perfect.`
` It has many weak points despite its convenience."`
`"...Weak points?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...Chessboard thinking is founded upon game theory.`
` When you thoroughly investigate game theory, it boils down to math.`
` Do you know what the weak point of math is?`
` ......It's noise."`
`In math, when you write 1+1=2,`
` that process will always result in 1+1=2 no matter how many billions of years pass, ...nothing more, nothing less.`
`That's because there's absolutely no noise mixed in.`
`But, for example,`
` ...unlike math, the Japanese language has noise mixed in.`
`Kanji are a good example.`
`Old kanji and new kanji are slightly different,`
` which represents an introduction of noise created by the changes between time periods.`
`Isn't history the same?`
`...There are dozens of policies that seem foolish in the modern era, but were meaningful at some point in the past.`
`Because the rules of chess are fixed, when a pair of experts are discussing one particular layout,`
` it's possible they could reach the same conclusions whether they're from one hundred years in the past or one hundred years in the future.`
`...However, if the rules of chess had gone through massive changes over time,`
` it's possible that a discussion about the same layout would have changed as well.`
`"That's right.`
` Events in the world of humans are normally full of noise.`
` Aren't human emotions that way?`
` Even if the exact same thing occurs more than once, there's no guarantee that humans will always act in a predictable fashion.`
` ...The moment we try to use a math-based theory to predict someone's actions,`
` we must be aware that our theory has built-in weaknesses and limits.`
` ...Simply put, chessboard thinking is extremely weak against noise and fickleness, as well as mistakes or incorrect knowledge."`
`...That's right.`
`...Kyrie-san definitely said that...`
`Chess has always been a game where both sides play by the same rules and fight with the same conditions for victory.`
` That's why it's possible for both sides to predict the other's moves.`
`......It's possible to read your opponent because you can always suppose they'll make the best moves they can find.`
`...But what if your opponent is fickle or a bit tired...`
`and makes a move that can hardly be called 'the best'?`
`Or, ...what if this game actually has a special rule,`
` some unknown thing that only the enemy knows about and can use?`
`In fact, what if the opponent actually has some goal other than victory?`
`Think from your enemy's perspective.`
`That's the basis of chessboard thinking.`
`...Which means, if you misread your enemy, `
`...the answer you draw from this process will be complete rubbish, useless...`
`So far, I've used chessboard theory to guess several vague bits of information about the culprit hiding behind this case, or so I think.`
`However, I don't know anything about the culprit.`
`...Am I just playing around in a labyrinth of thought?`
`......If Kyrie-san were here at a time like this, `
`...she'd probably be able to notice something with her much, much sharper thinking ability...`
`...Until the very last moment, Jessica resisted moving into Grandfather's study.`
`But in the end, Aunt Natsuhi persisted, and we decided to move there.`
`Everyone was completely wrapped in paranoia by now.`
`...Kumasawa-san had prepared dinner at one point, but during the time we were discovering the deaths of George-aniki's parents, both the kitchen and the parlor had been left empty.`
`Someone suggested that the food might've been poisoned while we were gone.`
`...Because of that, we were unable to even touch the food that Kumasawa-san had taken the trouble to make for us.`
`......The manner in which the first six were killed was still unknown, but it certainly could've been poison.`
`...Certainly, that would allow even a single person to carry out the murder of six large adults.`
`...Furthermore, this idea made it easy to imagine there being only a single culprit, one who'd be afraid of Aunt Natsuhi's rifle, `
`and this was very good for our emotional stability.`
`But the fatigue and hunger were even harsher than we'd imagined.`
`...Then, Kumasawa-san made a proposal, and we all went together to the kitchen.`
` There, we gathered some canned food and other things that'd be hard to poison to take in with us.`
`All of Kumasawa-san's efforts to reward us with just a little dinner on this savage day regrettably came to nothing...`
`The food piled up on the serving cart looked just a little sad.`
`We all started climbing the stairs.`
`Aunt Natsuhi, who was in the lead, warily stared into the darkness with both eyes and the barrel of the gun.`
`Once we'd dragged ourselves up to the third floor, just as Aunt Natsuhi had warned us of beforehand, `
`...there was a mixture of a chemical smell and a sickly-sweet aroma, a stench hanging in the air that felt like it was eating into our heads.`
`"...I see, this kind of stench probably would give you a headache if you were shut in with it for a whole night.`
` ...I know it's a little late, but I'm with Jessica. I vote against going into Grandfather's study."`
`It felt like the stench was floating out from this magnificent door.`
`...It was the door to the forbidden study, which should defend against any who would enter...`
`While Genji-san unlocked the door, Maria stared at the door and the doorknob with great interest.`
`"......Uu-.`
` ...Incredible door."`
`"It looks old and strict and like it'd stop any jokes cold. A perfect door for Grandfather's study."`
`"...The power to ward off spiritual menaces is strong here.`
` ......Beatrice probably couldn't open this door."`
`"Oh...?`
` What does that mean?"`
`Maria pointed at the doorknob.`
`...A scorpion crest...`
`no, a design like a magic circle arranged around a scorpion, was inscribed there.`
`...That design... That's right.`
`Isn't it just like those keychain charms Maria gave Jessica and me yesterday...?`
`"......The fifth magic circle of Mars is a strong ward against magic.`
` Additionally, this magic circle was very diligently constructed, and is full of power.`
` ......Such a magic circle can be quite troublesome to beings of magic like Beatrice."`
`"Isn't that comforting.`
` Are you saying we can escape even Beatrice's clutches in this room?`
` Our little witch here sure is reliable."`
`"...Then how did Beatrice get Grandfather out...?"`
`"......Just as Battler reasoned.`
` ...Beatrice can't go inside.`
` However, she has both magic and familiars.`
` Using them, she might've been able to get Grandfather to leave the study of his own accord."`
`"Ah, I've read about that in manga.`
` I've seen a bunch of scenes where vampires were frightened of crosses, so they couldn't get close,`
` but their familiars were just fine, so they made their familiars attack."`
`"Those scorpion keychain charms I gave you yesterday also had the fifth magic circle of Mars on them.`
` The power dwelling within them was weak, but they should be enough to protect you until we leave the island.`
` .........Although it sounds like you've lost yours, right?`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`"......Scorpion keychain charms?"`
`"Y-Yeah, ummm...`
` The charm I gave you yesterday was something I got from Maria.`
` I heard it would repel magic if you put it on your doorknob, ...and at the time, I thought maybe it'd be better if you had it..."`
`"...Is that so?`
` ...I thought it was an odd thing for you to be carrying around."`
`"......Aunt Natsuhi put that...`
`on her doorknob?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...Last night, after hearing about it from Jessica, I hung it from the doorknob on the inside of my door."`
`"Then Aunt Natsuhi, you're really fortunate.`
` ......If you did that, Beatrice probably couldn't even lay a finger on you yesterday.`
` ...I think Beatrice must've been really annoyed.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`...Beatrice, annoyed...?`
`Couldn't lay one finger...?`
`Natsuhi thought back on that eerie scribble she'd seen that morning, as though someone had been tearing at the outside of her door with blood-soaked hands, ...and gasped in surprise.`
`Could it be...`
`...that this witch who called herself Beatrice...`
`...tried to enter through the door to Natsuhi's own room...?`
`But the magic-repelling charm had been hanging from the inside.`
`...So she couldn't break through the door.`
` So she was annoyed.`
` ...So, she scratched at it...?`
`"Quit it, don't talk about that...`
` Witches don't exist.`
` The culprit does.`
` And they're a human just like us.`
` ...If you need proof, why don't we dice her up and see if her blood's red?`
` ...Damn it, ......damn it...`
` ...How could you...do that to Kanon-kun......"`
`*click*`
` Genji unlocked the door.`
`Eight people entered Kinzo's study...`
`Grandfather's study.`
` ...I'd heard rumors about it beforehand, so I wasn't that shocked.`
`He had done nothing more than fortify it thoroughly with his occult hobbies.`
`...If Grandfather's hobby had been chasing after pop idols, these walls might be buried beneath idol posters.`
`Even if I didn't understand it, I did realize that this room was a bundle of all his pastimes.`
`Even so, I couldn't help but remain dumbfounded by the smell of his creepy medicine and the sweet stench that seemed to melt my head...`
`When the door was closed, it automatically made a *clunk*.`
`...I see, this is the auto-lock that's activated whenever the door is closed...`
`And there were only two keys that could open this door from the outside, both of which were in this room.`
` ...In other words, it had become a 'closed room'.`
`......The shutter, the receipt, the chain.`
` ...And now, the auto-lock.`
`...This fourth door had the most magnificent lock yet, and this was doubtlessly a closed room.`
`Just to make absolutely sure that the room was secure, we checked all over for ways in or out.`
`The window was tightly locked.`
`That should've been enough, but just in case, we tried knocking all over the walls.`
`...After all, we had talked about there being a hidden door in this room.`
`...But we couldn't find anything suspicious.`
`Grandfather's study was very large.`
` Even though we called it a study, it wasn't really a single room.`
`It could be divided up into four basic sections: a study section, a bedroom section, a toilet/bathroom section and a section for cooking that had a sink.`
`I see, this study really does have enough in it to live in.`
`...Now I see how Grandfather could live his whole life in this room without ever leaving.`
`It seemed Grandfather wasn't in the habit of watching TV, because there was no television or even a radio in this room.`
`...We can't do anything except pass the time listening to the sound of the rain...until tomorrow morning.`
`Doctor Nanjo looked closely at the chessboard that sat on the table in front of the sofa and muttered...`
`It was apparently the partly finished chess match he'd been playing with Grandfather until yesterday.`
`...The black had the white pretty well cornered, and it looked like checkmate would be reached within a few moves. The last part of the endgame.`
`Even though checkmate had almost been reached,`
` ...the endgame had been rushed, `
`...and in the end, was never completed.`
`"...Kinzo-san,`
` ...it seems...`
`...we weren't able to see this match through after all..."`
`"......Doctor Nanjo..."`
`"...I was Kinzo-san's friend for a long time, ...but I never knew about more than half of him.`
` ...I believe two Kinzos existed, a wise one...and one trapped by some madness...`
` ......I never understood anything about him..."`
`"...Especially when it came to Beatrice-sama, it would seem like his personality changed..."`
`In the direction of Kumasawa-san's upward gaze, a portrait of Beatrice could be seen.`
`It wasn't massive like the one hanging in the entrance hall, but small, made for this room.`
`Grandfather probably spent every day in this room, and so much of his time, `
`...talking to the witch in that portrait.`
`...Who was Beatrice to Grandfather in the first place?`
`...Right now, you couldn't just explain it away by saying it was a story made by the parents to frighten children away from wandering into the forest...`
`While eating the canned food we'd brought from the kitchen, we talked together about who Beatrice was.`
`......Whether the culprit was Beatrice herself or someone pretending to be her,`
` whether they were a witch or a human, that was besides the point.`
` The woman in this portrait was strongly related to the roots and background of this case.`
`......You couldn't talk about this case without talking about her.`
`"...That's right.`
` ...Mom, you picked up the culprit's letter in Aunt Eva's room, right?"`
`"Yes...`
` I still haven't opened it...`
` ...Let's give it a try."`
`...Aunt Natsuhi took out that Western envelope.`
`Genji-san pulled a paper knife out of a drawer in the study desk and handed it to her.`
`While watching her open it, George-aniki grimaced slightly.`
`...After all, it was a letter left at the site where his parents had been murdered.`
`...There was a good chance its contents would say something unbearable to Aniki...`
`Aunt Natsuhi also seemed to realize that.`
`...So she glanced over the contents first without reading it aloud.`
`We were a little frightened that she might grimace after reading something shocking, but she just frowned unhappily.`
`"...What does...it say...?"`
`"...There is one unpleasant sentence.`
` ...It must be trying to provoke us."`
`Natsuhi, after deciding that the contents could be shown to the children, set it openly on the table.`
` Everyone stared at it at the same time.`
`"'Praise my name'.`
` ......What the hell?`
` ...That's annoying."`
`"......It's probably Beatrice declaring herself the victor.`
` ......Damn it..."`
`"..............."`
`"I'll bet you were hoping another weird magic circle would show up."`
`"......It wasn't a magic circle,`
` ...but my expectations haven't been betrayed.`
` ...Kihihi."`
`"What could it mean...?`
` I wonder if she wants to tout her own existence..."`
`"That seems reasonable.`
` .........With this letter, we now know that the author of last night's letter is the culprit.`
` ...I think the identical envelope is more significant than what is written here."`
`"......Without a doubt, this is the type of envelope and sealing wax that the Master used."`
`"...Ooooohh...`
` I don't know what's going on anymore...`
` This is the first time I've seen anything like this since I started working for the Ushiromiya family..."`
`"Going by last night's letter, ...Beatrice is claiming to be Grandfather's oldest confidante.`
` ...Grandfather often said the same thing in the past, right?"`
`I spoke to Genji-san and Kumasawa-san, who nodded together.`
`"...Guess that means you two know more about her than anyone except Grandfather.`
` ......Could you tell us?"`
`"......For a long time, I've purposefully avoided this topic.`
` But now that it has come to this, I can no longer do so.`
` ...Genji, tell us everything you know."`
`"..............."`
`Genji-san didn't answer.`
`...Did he remain silent despite his knowledge, or did he know nothing at all?`
`...Still, I had a good guess.`
`...The ghost story of the witch Beatrice had long been deified among the servants.`
`...He had probably been very close to Grandfather and his occult hobbies.`
`So there was a good chance that he'd been indoctrinated with even weirder things, and had increasingly come to deify the witch.`
`As Grandfather's most trusted servant, who had sworn loyalty to him,`
` he might be the most influenced by the illusion of the witch that Grandfather had created...`
`So there was only one reason for Genji-san to remain silent.`
`...He could speak, but it would definitely cause a backlash, so it was better if he kept his mouth shut, ...and it wasn't like we'd believe him anyway.`
` Something along those lines.`
`...A short while ago, Maria had been more than willing to speak bluntly and unrestrainedly, and that had earned her a scuffle with Jessica.`
`It was natural for Genji-san to keep his silence...`
`'!s1`
`father's...`
`concubine?"`
`His concubine...`
` ...That could be possible.`
`For ordinary poor people, polygamy isn't only viewed negatively from a moral perspective.`
`It's also an unmaintainable financial situation.`
`...But that isn't the case for the very rich.`
`It's possible for them to have another lover in addition to their real wife.`
`...We can't deny the possibility that Grandfather had another woman in his life besides Grandmother.`
`"Maybe...`
` When Grandmother was alive, I hear she was pretty sure of it.`
` She thought he was cheating on her.`
` ...I always thought she meant Grandfather's imaginary witch..."`
`"...Now this is getting really interesting.`
` ...You told me, didn't you Genji-san?`
` You said Beatrice has been working for Grandfather since before the mansion was finished."`
`"I heard that the construction of the mansion was completed in Showa 27 (1952)."`
`"That'd mean this person called Beatrice was in a relationship with Grandfather since at least 30 years ago..."`
`"Could that concubine of 30 years ago...or maybe a relative or hidden child with that person...hold some kind of grudge and be planning revenge?`
` ...Ihihi, I see, this is starting to sound just like your standard Western mansion mystery."`
`"......It's a filthy topic, but the easiest line of reasoning to accept.`
` ...What do you think, Genji?"`
`"...............`
`......The Master surely had feelings of deep love for her.`
` There can be no mistake that he cared for her more than his late wife."`
`"...Who is this person called Beatrice?!`
` And what's she doing now?!"`
`"............`
`...I have heard that she passed away before the mansion was completed."`
`"She's already dead...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` ...The Master was deeply stricken by grief at her loss,`
` ......and he devoted himself to the art of black magic as a means to revive her.`
` ...The Master loved Beatrice-sama from the bottom of his heart.`
` ...It was that madness which drove him to do all that you see here."`
`As Genji-san said this, he spread his arms, as though asking us to look at this room, filled with the signs of Grandfather's madness.`
`...We were all at a loss for words.`
`Normally, black magic seems like it'd just be creepy, and it's really hard to imagine why someone might be so enraptured by it.`
`...Since Kinzo was just an 'eccentric' who had restored the Ushiromiya family amidst his madness, nobody had tried to understand him...`
`The only thing on Grandfather's mind had been the loss of a beloved woman...`
`...and his inescapable sorrow.`
`...Earlier, this room had seemed creepy,`
` ...but in an instant, it had changed into something we could understand completely.`
`'!s0`
`the magic circles, `
`the medicine, `
`...all of it.`
`...It all existed simply because he wanted to revive the face of a single woman who had left this world over 30 years ago...`
`"......The Master only told me about Beatrice-sama's story once, when he was very drunk.`
` ......Although I have forgotten the details.`
` ......It was...`
`a deep, deep love, enough to make a woman like me jealous."`
`"......When Kinzo-san succeeded the Headship of the Ushiromiya family,`
` ...his marriage to his late wife had already been decided by the few surviving family elders."`
`"...So, `
`...he was forced into a marriage with some woman who would benefit the Ushiromiya family?"`
`"...That is correct.`
` ...Kinzo-san was installed as the Head who would revive the family, and had to bear the entirety of that heavy responsibility.`
` ......I do not pretend to know the details of when or where Kinzo-san first met her."`
`"......Guess it'd be rude to say any more than that."`
`That was when Grandfather truly fell in love for the first time...`
`Just how deep was his affection for her?`
` ...That was easy to see just by looking around us.`
`...This room was covered with piles upon piles of things having to do with black magic.`
`And Grandfather spent every day shut in here, immersed in his research and isolated from the outside world, never regretting one minute of it.`
`...You couldn't help but recognize the depths of Grandfather's love for Beatrice...`
`".........`
`...I...had it all wrong, Genji-san."`
`"......What...do you mean by that?"`
`"...I-I've always thought that...maybe you servants believed blindly in the witch because you were influenced by Grandfather's creepy black magic hobby.`
` ...But that's not how it was, right...?"`
`By acting as though Beatrice's soul at least had been restored...`
`and existed inside this mansion, `
`...they might have hoped to soothe Grandfather's heart...`
`With closed eyes and the expression of one remembering something from the distant past, `
`...Genji had broken his long silence.`
`......In making that confession, he probably felt like he was betraying his one and only Master in the most serious way, even though that person was already dead.`
`...Beatrice has revived as a witch, and she is in the mansion even now.`
`'!s0`
`had believed it, `
`...had made people believe it, `
`'!sd@`
`This might have been the last service he could offer up to his Master.`
`The legend of the witch, the mysterious tale of Rokkenjima that was still whispered of amongst the servants...`
`...Its true nature was...`
`a sad lie.`
` ...No, it was an act of kindness towards Grandfather, who had lost the person he loved above all else.`
`".........`
`...I remember denying the witch's existence in front of Father on multiple occasions.`
` ......Now I finally understand how much that must have wounded him..."`
`"...Right now, I can understand very well.`
` ......If I thought I could revive Shannon using black magic,`
` ...I'd immediately become the next owner of this room and start researching..."`
`"............Aniki."`
`Another strand of tears dripped from George's eyes.`
`...Maybe his tears were infectious.`
` Tears rose to Jessica's eyes too, and she sniffled...`
`"......Beatrice has said it.`
` ......Very soon, she will be able to revive people.`
` You'll be able to meet them, she said."`
`--Very soon, the door to the Golden Land will be opened.`
`In the promised land that glitters gold, the souls of all the dead will be resurrected, along with the love that has been lost.`
`...Then I will sleep in a world of peacefulness for all time.`
`"...Did she say that?`
` The Beatrice who gave you the letter?"`
`".........You don't believe, do you?`
` ......Kihihihi."`
`"...If only Grandfather were here,`
` I'm sure he'd be happy.`
` I'm sure he'd be jumping for joy now that Beatrice is about to be revived...`
` ...In that case, I believe.`
` ...If Grandfather gave up half of his life for this research, trying to resurrect the soul of the woman he loved and spending the rest of his life believing, ...I'll believe too."`
`"......Battler........."`
`"...When you love a single woman for so long, `
`...the people around you catch on to it, and it becomes the truth.`
` ......Maybe you could say they're just being polite for the sake of your feelings.`
` ......But right here, now, ...I'd like to call that magic."`
`"......It isn't just being polite.`
` ......It really is...magic.`
` ...She's a witch.`
` ...Kihihihihihi.`
` It looks like nobody can see Beatrice after all..."`
`Some time passed.`
` As we listened to the sound of the rain,`
` ...we considered what kind of love and madness must have possessed the owner of this room as he spent half of his life here...`
`"......If you ask me as a woman, then while I'd like to be understanding of Father's feelings of true love,`
` ...it did leave Mother in an awkward position."`
`"Haha, I agree.`
` Cheating is cheating.`
` No way to make it pretty..."`
`"...Yeah, that's right.`
` Gotta feel sorry for Grandmother."`
`"So, ...have there been any rumors about a child between Beatrice and Grandfather...?"`
`The keyword 'Beatrice' has been hidden in every corner of this case.`
`So it's natural to suspect some relative of hers.`
`"No.`
` ......I have not heard of anything like that."`
`"...If there was one, a memento of his most beloved person, he surely would have given them all of his affection.`
` ...Since he ended up immersing himself in black magic instead, maybe we should assume that there was no such child."`
`"......Come to think of it, that reminds me of a rumor I heard.`
` ...You know it, right?`
` That story about how Grandfather heavily supported an orphanage called the Fukuin House?"`
`"...Enough of that.`
` That is nothing more than slander which would desecrate Father."`
`"Tell us, Aunt Natsuhi.`
` ...I think even you'd agree that this is no time to hide things from each other."`
`"......It's a worthless story.`
` Father made massive donations to an orphanage and had the orphans employed as servants at the Head Family, to give them some on-the-job experience.`
` The story in question is simply some drivel spread by fools...who claim that Father was using those orphans for some filthy hobby."`
`"For a while, some guys even said he was collecting human sacrifices for his black magic...`
` And he really is doing weird experiments and ceremonies in this room all the time, so I half believed it myself..."`
`"...And these servants who came from the Fukuin House are?"`
`"......There are several of them, but Shannon and Kanon were the two scheduled during the family conference shift."`
`To resurrect Beatrice, ...he brought in servants from an orphanage as human sacrifices...?`
`"After all, everyone Grandfather selected as a servant was young, about the same age as Shannon or Kanon-kun.`
` ...I was sure it was because Grandfather had some bizarre hobby."`
`"Jessica!`
` Mind your words."`
`When Aunt Natsuhi scolded her, the atmosphere instantly went sour and everyone fell quiet.`
`...However, something was tugging at the back of my mind.`
`Sacrifices...`
` Sacrifices...`
`......Human sacrifices brought over from an orphanage...`
`...What is it?`
`Freaky words like 'sacrifices' don't pop up often.`
`...And yet, I've seen or heard that word recently.`
` ......Some part of my memory is tugging at me.`
`...Hey, Beatrice.`
`What do you know...?`
`I had arrived in front of the portrait of Beatrice.`
`It wasn't as massive as the one in the entrance hall,`
` but that portrait, which must have been drawn by some famous painter, was still just as intimidating in this smaller size.`
`...Below it, just like in the entrance hall, was the epitaph that supposedly hinted at the location of the hidden gold...`
`'!s1`
`.........!`
` Sacrifices, `
`...here."`
`"Wh-What the hell, Battler?`
` You're creeping me out..."`
`'!s1`
`sacrifices.`
` ......Ah, `
`......aaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!!"`
`'!sd`
`...Everything's been predicted right there from the very beginning...!`
`Everyone crowded around.`
`And the same expression of shock rose to all of our faces...!`
`That's right.`
` It's right there in the epitaph.`
`'On the first twilight, offer the six chosen by the key as sacrifices.'`
`"Ah, ...aaahh, there's no doubt.`
` Six people died in the beginning!`
` And even on the shutter where the magic circle was drawn...no, where the Hebrew was written, it mentioned the offering of sacrifices...!!"`
`"...Uu-.`
` ...I've been saying that from the beginning."`
`That's right, Maria said it right at the start!`
`Right after we found the six bodies, when Maria was in the parlor watching TV, she said it!`
`'......Uu-.`
` The culprit isn't human.'`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`'~ib~It's just the sacrifices chosen by the key.~ib~`
`'`
`"This has nothing to do with the location of the hidden gold!!`
` It's the instructions for a resurrection ceremony using black magic or something!`
` After all, this epitaph requires a large number of 'deaths'!"`
`"...I-It sure does.`
` Even reading through it quickly, there'd be 6+2+5,`
` ...13 people who must die...!"`
`"...How many people are normally on this island?!"`
`"...I-It changes depending on the shifts for the servants, but there's Father, my husband, Jessica, and me.`
` And two or three servants.`
` ...Today and yesterday, there were five of them, but there aren't normally that many."`
`"Which means that normally,`
` ...there wouldn't be enough sacrifices to carry out this 'ceremony'.`
` ...No, wait.`
` ...There's that rumor that Grandfather was collecting servants from an orphanage to be used as sacrifices in some creepy ceremony..."`
`"So what does this mean?!`
` He increased the number of servants to increase the number of sacrifices...and waited for the annual family conference when even more people would gather...?`
` ...Isn't now the only time of the year this ceremony could be held?!"`
`When Jessica screamed this, Maria broke out in that creepy laugh, looking truly pleased.`
`"......Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` ...Haven't you ever heard of people making bets to test their fate?"`
`Like throwing a sandal and saying that if it lands right side up, tomorrow will be sunny.`
`...Or saying that tomorrow will be a good day if a coin lands heads up.`
`...There are many little superstitions like that.`
`Sometimes, when your luck is down and you get bored, and you roll the dice and get three sixes, you want to believe it's a portent of some miracle.`
`...When flipping a sandal, you have at worst a 50% chance.`
`Even if you get it right side up, it's not worth much.`
`...But if you carelessly roll three dice and they all come up six, you might think that's a small miracle.`
`"......Magic works the same way.`
` ...You must pray earnestly for an extremely unlikely result.`
` ...Then, the feelings from all those stored up prayers gain magical power and become incarnate.`
` ......The magic that Grandfather was trying to perform was probably like that.`
` The key randomly selected sacrifices in a lottery.`
` So, to reduce the chance that he himself was selected, he chose the day with the greatest number of people on the island to carry out the ceremony..."`
`"Ridiculous!!`
` Are you saying that this entire situation was caused by a mere ceremony for some bizarre magic?!"`
`Natsuhi yelled.`
`...She couldn't quell the fear that a scorpion charm might be the only reason she was still safe.`
`......If I hadn't received that charm from Jessica and hung it from my doorknob,`
` ...would I have been killed, mixed in along with those six?!`
`And the strangest part is...even though I hung the charm from the inside of my door, they couldn't get through that door.`
`...The culprit noticed the charm from outside the door and gave up trying to open it.`
`...A human couldn't have perceived that.`
`A charm meant to stop something that was not human...had done exactly that...!!`
` Impossible, impossible, impossible!!!`
`"But Natsuhi-san,`
` the epitaph certainly does continue to fit even after that..."`
`"O-On the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close...`
` ...Could this be talking about Eva-sama and Hideyoshi-sama...?"`
`"......P-Painful as it may be, ...we must reach that conclusion.`
` ...And after the culprit killed them, they left the words from 'the third twilight' in a letter there."`
`"Th-That's right...`
` After carrying out the second twilight, they left the third twilight in that place.`
` ...The third twilight was...just like Aunt Natsuhi just read...!!"`
`'On the third twilight, those who remain shall praise my noble name.'`
`Aaaaaaaaaahhh, ...if you read it this way, it just keeps going on, doesn't it?`
`'On the fourth twilight, gouge the head and kill.'`
`Gouge the head and kill.`
`...George-aniki's parents were killed with those 'demon's icepicks' gouged into their heads.`
`...But if they were the second twilight, `
`...someone else must've been gouged in the head...`
`"...That's Grandfather...`
` He was burned in the incinerator, and our eyes were so drawn to that part that we didn't notice,`
` ...but his forehead...`
`no, his head had been gouged."`
`"Grandfather was...the victim of the fourth twilight?`
` Th-Then, Kanon-kun was...!"`
`"...'On the fifth twilight, gouge the chest and kill'.`
` ...We thought Kanon-kun's case was an unexpected encounter with the culprit, ......but that's wrong.`
` From the very beginning, they planned to lure someone out alone and drive something through their chest..."`
`"......If the culprit has followed the epitaph this far, `
`...does that mean three people still have to die...?!"`
`'On the sixth twilight, gouge the stomach and kill.'`
`'On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill.'`
`'On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill.'`
`"......Y-Yes, `
`...you could read it that way...`
`...eeeeepp..."`
`"Well, I wonder about that...`
` ......After those three die, it reaches the ninth twilight.`
` Take a look..."`
`'On the ninth twilight, the witch shall revive, and none shall be left alive.'`
`"We're...all gonna be killed by Beatrice..."`
`"......I don't get it.`
` Wouldn't that mean everyone dies no matter how many people there are?`
` ...What was Grandfather after?`
` Doesn't this mean the ceremony would kill him too, no matter what...?!"`
`"......It's okay if no one's left alive.`
` ...On the tenth twilight, we finally arrive at the Golden Land."`
`'On the tenth twilight, at journey's end, you shall attain to the power of the Golden Land's treasures, once and for the last time.'`
`'The witch shall praise the wise and bestow four treasures.'`
`"...Grandfather wasn't afraid of dying.`
` ......Look at the second and third of the four treasures."`
`"......'One shall be the resurrection of all the dead souls. `
` One shall be the resurrection of the love that was lost'.`
` ...So Grandfather believed he would eventually be revived, even if he died partway through this ceremony...?"`
`"Ridiculous! That's insane!!`
` When you die, it's over, right?!`
` The dead don't come back to life.`
` Isn't that a miracle humanity's been chasing after for thousands of years and still hasn't accomplished?!`
` So is this what it means?`
` Something like, you'll be able to meet them in the afterlife, where they'll be restored?!"`
`"...If what you're saying now is right, ...would that mean that...`
`Grandfather, whose remaining life is slim and who's been driven mad by love, is committing suicide...`
`no, ...a massive forced group suicide...?!"`
`".................."`
`"...Genji,`
` ...is such a thing possible...?!"`
`"......I don't know.`
` ...The Master is a man who sometimes has the wisdom to see a thousand years into the future.`
` However, there are times when that appears to be nothing more than madness to commoners such as myself..."`
`"Okay, should we take that for a 'yes'?!`
` What do you say, Kumasawa-san?!"`
`"I-I don't know anything...!`
` That's right, I don't know...`
` Do you think I would be on this island today if I did know?`
` I would have faked an illness or done anything to take the day off, that's right!!"`
`"What about your opinion, Doctor Nanjo? You've been Grandfather's friend for many years..."`
`"......I-I feel the same as Genji-san.`
` ...Kinzo-san was a man who far surpassed ordinary people.`
` I've even felt a sort of inhuman power from him at times.`
` ......Even I......don't know what Kinzo-san was thinking when he wrote that epitaph...!"`
`"...All we can say...is that even if Father did write this script, someone else is carrying it out."`
`"That's right.`
` ......At the very least, there's another culprit who attacked Grandfather and Kanon-kun.`
` Furthermore, that person is still continuing the crimes just as the epitaph says...!"`
`"...The letter in the beginning that we didn't think deeply about...`
` What was it that was written there?"`
`We thought back to the recitation of the letter last night...`
`Beatrice had proclaimed something inside it.`
`She had proclaimed that, according to her contract with Kinzo, she would collect everything of the Ushiromiya family as interest.`
`But then she had also revealed a special clause.`
`If someone discovered the location of the gold Grandfather had hidden, that right would be lost.`
`When the letter was read, Grandfather was still alive.`
`...But at that time, it had already been sealed with wax by the Head's Ring.`
`...Which meant Grandfather had handed the ring over to Beatrice while he was still alive.`
`...If we take a straightforward approach,`
` maybe we should assume Beatrice is carrying out that strange contract, with Grandfather guaranteeing her that right.`
`...In other words, this was the same as saying Grandfather knew of and approved of the contents of that letter.`
`In other words, it's basically a joint message from Beatrice and Grandfather...`
`telling us that Beatrice will start collecting interest if we don't solve the riddle.`
`...In other words, Grandfather and Beatrice were demanding that we try and solve the riddle of the epitaph.`
` And if we couldn't, they were saying that the massacre would be carried out according to the epitaph.`
`What does that mean?`
`What do they want?!`
`I don't have a clue what it means!`
`"............`
`......Look, another letter from Beatrice."`
`"...Huh?`
` What did you say?"`
`Maria was pointing at the top of the table, where the canned food everyone had been eating just now still lay.`
`A Western envelope from Beatrice certainly was sitting there, ...but so what...?`
`"...What in the?!"`
`Aunt Natsuhi let out a hysterical cry, looking between her own hand and the table.`
`...Because the envelope she had just opened was still grasped in her hand.`
`...So why is there still an envelope on the table...?!`
`"...Wh-What the hell?!?!`
` What's going on, Maria?!!`
` Where did that envelope come from?!"`
`"...Just now, I looked and it was lying there.`
` Uu-."`
`"...I-I don't know anything, anything!!"`
`"This isn't funny, there's only the eight of us here!!`
` There's no way some ninth person snuck in!!`
` There wasn't enough time during the few seconds that we gathered around the portrait, right?!"`
`"Get back, all of you!!!`
` Back against the wall!!"`
`Aunt Natsuhi was pointing the rifle at Genji and the others, bellowing at them...!`
`Genji-san was overpowered, his face looking like he didn't have a clue what was going on...`
`Of course, I felt the same, ...but a few moments late, I reached the same conclusion Aunt Natsuhi had.`
`Until just a few seconds ago, there had been no letter like this on the table...!`
` And nobody entered this room!`
` That means someone among us placed it there during the few seconds when everyone was looking away, preoccupied with the portrait...!!`
`"Battler-kun, open that envelope and read what's inside!"`
`"S-Sure!!"`
`I picked it up.`
` ...It was still sealed with wax.`
`Even without disturbing its contents, I realized that this was an as-yet unopened envelope, an unknown envelope!`
`Without relying on a paper knife, I tore it open and pulled out the letter inside.`
`The contents were as follows.`
`'Are you enjoying the riddle of Kinzo-sama's epitaph?`
` As you are all probably aware, you have very little time remaining.`
` Please abandon any naive hopes of escaping after the storm passes.`
` This game can only end with my victory or yours.`
` When time runs out, I will win by default.`
` There will be no ties.`
` Make sure that you do not misunderstand your current situation.'`
`"That's what it says..."`
`"......It isn't clear who put this letter there.`
` However, I have been able to narrow down the list of suspects.`
` It's you all!!"`
`"...M-Madam...`
` That's just...too horrible..."`
`"Just before I moved towards the portrait, I set a can of food down here.`
` At that time, there definitely wasn't anything as strange as this letter there!!"`
`"And at that time, Jessica, George-kun and Battler-kun were already in front of the portrait!!`
` And they didn't leave the spot in front of the portrait until the letter appeared!`
` So the person who set that letter down is one of you four!!!`
` Beatrice is here!!!"`
`"......Uu-.`
` We aren't Beatrice.`
` ...Beatrice 'exists'!"`
`"Silence!!!`
` I don't know whether I should suspect one of you or all of you.`
` ...But without a doubt, at least one among you is the culprit!!!"`
`"......Th-That's right.`
` There can't be a 19th person...!`
` There's no way witches exist!!`
` Even when Kanon-kun was killed, `
`...yeah, that could be explained if Kumasawa-san was the one who did it!!`
` The truth is that Kumasawa-san entered the boiler room with Kanon-kun and killed him!`
` And then she lied, saying he had already fallen when she got there!!"`
`"Y-You're making a mistake, Milady...!!`
` Why would I do something like that...?!!"`
`"...I don't have the slightest idea how my parents were killed in that closed room.`
` But when they were killed, everyone except for the servants had an alibi.`
` ...The only ones who didn't were the servants...`
` But...does that really mean it's okay to suspect them...?!"`
`"...Y-Yes, ...now that you mention it, they have no alibi for any of the cases...`
` ......Nng!!"`
`Should we really be so quick to make that judgment?!`
`But this time...in this room, in this place, in this moment...in this minimally small bit of time and space, it's obvious.`
`Only one of the four of them could have set the letter there in our blind spot...!!`
`We can't tell who put it there, but it's obvious that one of the four did it...!!`
`"...N-Natsuhi-san,`
` please, calm yourself...`
` A lot has happened today!`
` I understand how much strain is on your mind right now...!"`
`"Doctor Nanjo, it truly pains me to call you suspicious...!`
` However, you are Father's personal doctor and his closest friend!`
` You have been by his side for many years, and you might even know about Beatrice.`
` Could you be hiding some kind of old obligation?!"`
`"Of course not...!!`
` Calm yourself...!"`
`It was pitiful to watch Doctor Nanjo frantically pleading his innocence.`
`It was probably a normal reaction that anyone would give if they were suspected.`
`Kumasawa was the same.`
`Ever since Jessica voiced her suspicions of Kumasawa murdering Kanon, Kumasawa had been totally flustered.`
`That was why Genji's still calm appearance looked so bold.`
`Aunt Natsuhi pointed the barrel of the gun.`
`"......Genji,`
` you were Grandfather's number one subordinate.`
` ...Was Beatrice an illusion you showed to Father, with you as the performer?!"`
`"......If by suspecting me, you recognize me as the Master's greatest servant,`
` ...then I count it a great honor, regardless of the circumstances.`
` ......However, I am not the one who put the letter there."`
`"Do you expect us to just accept that?!!`
` You must be the ringleader!`
` Maybe Kumasawa and Doctor Nanjo are your accomplices!!`
` ......And Maria-chan too."`
`Not content to suspect just the adults, Aunt Natsuhi pointed the gun relentlessly at Maria too.`
`But Maria acted as though nothing had happened.`
`......Or maybe she thought she would be fine even if she was shot.`
`"Maria-chan,`
` ...by this point, we can no longer remove someone from suspicion just because they're young.`
` So for the last time, let me ask the question that everyone's had since last night!`
` ...Yesterday, who was the Beatrice who handed you that letter?!!"`
`".........Uu-."`
`"...Maria, don't dodge the question!!`
` Make it clear!`
` Who gave you that letter?!!"`
`"...Kihihihihihi.`
` How many times do I have to tell you?`
` It's Beatrice.`
` The thousand-year-old Golden Witch.`
` ......If you want to know what she looks like, just turn around.`
` ...See, she's right there.`
` Beatrice is.`
` ...Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!"`
`"D-Don't mess with us, Mariaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`"Enough, Jessica!`
` Maria, too.`
` Don't you understand the situation?!`
` What are you hoping to gain by saying stuff like that?!`
` Stop stirring each other up pointlessly!"`
`"...I don't understand.`
` ...Who do you all want the culprit to be?`
` You only believe in Beatrice when you don't want to suspect one of your own.`
` When you're trying to settle a grudge because someone who's close to you has been killed, only then do you want to believe in a Human you can attack with violence, and deny Beatrice."`
`"......That's why you can't 'see' her.`
` ...Beatrice 'exists'.`
` You all can't see her!"`
`"Silence!!!`
` I don't want to label you as the culprit, but there is no longer any doubt that you enjoy making this situation unpleasant and are providing assistance to the enemy!!"`
`"...Kihihihihihihihi.`
` ...Then what will you do?`
` Shoot me?`
` I don't mind.`
` Very soon, the door to the Golden Land will be opened.`
` Then all the dead will be resurrected.`
` ...Right now, death is nothing to be afraid of.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!"`
`"M-Mom, she really is suspicious!!`
` We can't keep her with us!!"`
`"But Aunt Natsuhi, please, calm down...!`
` There's no reason to shoot Maria!`
` Please remain composed...!`
` The letter was meant to provoke us, but it's nothing to be afraid of!`
` Even the culprit is scared of what will happen tomorrow.`
` They're scared of the police!`
` Right now, this island is free from the reach of the law, but that's only because it's isolated by this typhoon!`
` Once the typhoon passes, the law will return!`
` So you mustn't shoot...!!"`
`"...How can you stay so calm, George nii-san?!!`
` One of these four is the culprit!`
` No, maybe all four of them are working together!`
` How can you stay so calm when one of these four might be the culprit who killed your parents?!!"`
`"Even I have the desire to find the culprit and kill them...!`
` But that would be simple barbarism.`
` I will leave the judgement of crimes to the law!`
` So no matter how suspicious they are, you mustn't pull that trigger!!"`
`"I-I feel the same as George-aniki...`
` Aunt Natsuhi,`
` get ahold of yourself for a second...`
` Anyway, it'd be bad to shoot, ihihi...!`
` In times like this, I hear you should tilt your head back and say 'Stay cool' three times..."`
`"......Let me make this clear.`
` Witches don't exist!`
` Not on Rokkenjima, not in the Ushiromiya mansion!"`
`"I declare it as Ushiromiya Natsuhi, representative of the Ushiromiya family!!`
` There's no witch here!`
` I won't accept Beatrice!!`
` No matter what you're planning, I won't let you lay one finger on my daughter or the rest of them!!!`
` That's my duty as a mother and as representative to the family!!"`
`Those words...were the final words of farewell...that settled everything.`
`...To protect her daughter, Aunt Natsuhi would regard any suspicious person as an enemy.`
`...The only reason George-aniki and I were standing on this side was because, by coincidence, we had a clear alibi regarding the letter.`
`If I hadn't approached the portrait,`
` ...I would also be at the other end of that gun barrel, treated like a criminal...`
`...But even though part of me thought that, `
`...part of me was thinking that chasing all the suspicious people from this room would finally guarantee our safety...`
`Genji-san and Kumasawa-san and Doctor Nanjo...`
` All of them were on Grandfather's side.`
`Maybe you could say that once Maria started blindly believing in Beatrice, she was also on Grandfather's side.`
` ...That's right, they're all suspicious.`
`But is this really okay...?!`
`If we throw out all of the suspicious ones in such a lawless way, will we still have the right to defy the lawlessness of the witch...?!`
`Aunt Natsuhi didn't tell them to leave with her own words.`
`...But with wordless pressure, she induced them to say that themselves.`
`...Because if Doctor Nanjo didn't say those words, this cold silence would surely continue forever.`
`"......Calm yourself, Natsuhi-san.`
` ......Still, I understand your feelings well.`
` I myself feel like there's something wrong with my head after all of these strange, repeated incidents...`
` So I understand well why you want to suspect us..."`
`".........If you really have nothing to do with this, ...then my actions now would be beyond rude.`
` ......However, ...please understand, just this once."`
`"......Very well.`
` ...Let's leave the room.`
` ......What do you say, Genji-san?`
` ...Shall we return to the parlor and continue our chess game?"`
`".........If that is what you wish, ...by all means."`
`"......I-I don't want to...!`
` After all, that means we'll have to leave this room knowing that the wolf is among us, right...?!`
` I don't want to, Madam, please forgive me. Eeeeeeeeekk......!"`
`It was obvious what Kumasawa-san was trying to say.`
`If she was innocent, then she was being ejected into dangerous territory along with the culprit.`
`...In the current situation, urging her to leave this room along with the suspects was almost exactly the same as letting her get killed...`
`However, Kumasawa-san really was suspicious just for being the first one to discover that Kanon-kun had been murdered.`
`...At that time, everyone except Kumasawa-san had an alibi.`
`...Unless we could prove the existence of some contraption...or the existence of some 19th person, Kumasawa-san was by far the most likely suspect.`
`I didn't want to believe it.`
`However, Aunt Natsuhi and the rest of us were in such a difficult situation that we couldn't help suspecting her as well...`
`So we didn't say anything to stop Aunt Natsuhi from trying to oppressively chase them from the room.`
` ...We had stopped her from shooting, but we were passively agreeing to chase the others out of the room...!`
`On top of that, Maria spoke to the fretful Kumasawa-san.`
`"......It's okay.`
` ...Beatrice is kind to those who respect her.`
` ...You believe that Beatrice 'exists'.`
` ...So it'll definitely be okay.`
` ...I'll watch TV in the parlor.`
` Let's watch it together.`
` ...It's so boring here, without TV.`
` ......Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi hihihi."`
`It looked like Kumasawa found Maria's roguish laugh very frightening...`
`However, the three other people had agreed to leave the room.`
`Kumasawa couldn't fight the flow and had to agree, crying as she went...`
`"...Well then, Natsuhi-san.`
` That will be all for tonight.`
` ...Let us meet again tomorrow."`
`"...Yes.`
` Please understand, at least for tonight.`
` When the police come, all of us will surely apologize for our rudeness.`
` ...You may play chess, but do it in a safe place if you can.`
` ...Genji, I leave them in your hands."`
`"......Certainly."`
`"...H-Hohoho...`
` It can't be helped, can it...`
` They always say that the most frightening bears are those with their children."`
`"...Genji, Kumasawa, my sincere apologies.`
` ...Let us meet again tomorrow.`
` ......Maria-chan too.`
` ...Please forgive your cold Aunt."`
`"Uu-.`
` I forgive you.`
` Uu-!"`
`"Madam, the keys to this room.`
` ...I will hand both over to you."`
`Genji-san pulled two golden keys from his pocket and handed them to Aunt Natsuhi...`
`"...And, I will also hand over my bundle of keys to the inside of the mansion."`
`He took out a bundle of about ten keys of various shapes, and handed it over.`
`......To the servants, those keys were probably proof of their position.`
`Being placed in charge of those keys meant that they were trusted, relied upon.`
`...When they were forced to return them, ...it meant that they had lost that trust.`
`...Thinking about it this way, ...to Genji-san, who had worked here for a span of many years, there could be no greater shame.`
`...However, Genji-san's usual indifferent expression remained on his face.`
`"...Genji,`
` ...I had planned that, after Father passed away, I would reward you for your many years of hard work and allow you to retire.`
` ......To treat you like this...`
`...makes me feel ashamed from the bottom of my heart......"`
`"I have already received the Master's favor.`
` ...Everything I have done until today has been in repayment for that.`
` ......Please, do not worry over it."`
`"...Well then, ...shall we, everyone?`
` ...Goodnight to you all."`
`"Uu-.`
` Goodnight.`
` Goodnight to you too, Battler! Uu-!"`
`"...Ah, ...Maria.`
` Wait a sec."`
`Knowledge of guilt made me call Maria back.`
`...I groped around in my pocket...and took out that scorpion keychain.`
`"......This repels magic, right?`
` ...Wear it."`
`"Uu-...?`
` Didn't you say you dropped it...?"`
`"...Back then, I got ticked off and just bluffed that I'd lost it.`
` ...There's no way I'd lose the precious charm you gave me."`
`"............"`
`Maria silently took the charm.`
`...I was unable to say anything after that...`
`"......Well then, everyone, good night to you..."`
`We watched them leave, our expressions completely worn out, ...and we weren't even able to respond.`
`...Until the door closed and we heard the auto-lock, we were unable to breathe...`
`Then, we were finally allowed to take a breath.`
`...After that, I noticed that Beatrice's letter, which I had been gripping the whole time and which was soaked with my sweat, actually had two sheets.`
`...The paper had been tightly stuck together, so I'd mistakenly thought that there was only one.`
`There were no characters on the second sheet.`
`...The thing drawn there was a magic circle, written with a red ink like blood.`
`......Just like how every magic circle up until then had been different, this magic circle was one I'd never laid eyes on before.`
`Inside the circle, a large triangle and a small triangle were fit together in a simple design.`
`But just as before, there was writing in Hebrew, and it seemed clear that it held some kind of meaning.`
`I wanted to know what that could be, ...but we had just chased Maria, the only person who could understand the meaning of magic circles, out of the room...`
`......I thought of this magic circle as Beatrice's second message.`
`...What does this magic circle mean?`
` .........Damn it...!`
`After chasing out all the suspicious people, all we had to do was stay barricaded here until morning, and everything would probably be over.`
`...Once the typhoon has passed, when the seagulls cry, will everything be resolved?`
`But the letter, which had unexpectedly appeared in the study, forced us to reject that naivety.`
`...It had made it very clear that, if time ran out, it would mean the witch's victory.`
`When time runs out, is the witch planning to take on the offensive?`
`...This time, is she planning to display some fearful magical power, maybe something that could have been used to kill six adults at once?`
`...Wait, when is time supposed to run out anyway?`
` ...I don't know...anything...`
`".........With this, ...we should finally be safe.`
` ...Finally.`
` ......Definitely..."`
`Even as she said that, Aunt Natsuhi couldn't stop gripping that rifle.`
` ...There was no release in the tension of her expression.`
`Of course, none of us felt like breathing a sigh of relief.`
`.........At least, not until we could hear the cry of the seagulls once more......`
`After we chased them out, ...nobody wanted to say anything.`
`...All of the suspicious ones had been driven away.`
`Even though we knew there might be some innocents among them, we still did it.`
`...We chased them out of this paradise...`
`where people don't have to suspect each other.`
`But our motive for chasing them out was suspicion of one person towards another, the worst kind of crime for a human.`
`...If we had accepted the existence of a 19th person, of the witch,`
` ...then we all might still be talking face to face, trusting in each other.`
`In that instant,`
` we had agreed to chase out all of the suspicious people.`
`...But had that been the right thing to do?`
`...During this endless silence, we could do nothing but be quietly tormented by that sin...`
`Aunt Natsuhi faced the door, without letting go of her rifle for even an instant, sitting far back in the sofa.`
`...She would probably spend the night staring at the door without a wink of sleep.`
`George-aniki gazed through a gap in the closed curtains by the window,`
` looking down at the courtyard and the mansion that surrounded it.`
`...I didn't know whether he was checking to see if a suspicious shadow would become visible through the window...`
`or whether he was wondering to himself about something.`
`Jessica was sitting sideways on the sofa next to Aunt Natsuhi...with a dead expression on her face.`
`...And every once in a while, as though she'd just remembered something, she'd take out the inhaler she had used during her asthma attack and stick it in her mouth.`
`...I just heard it from Aniki, `
`...but apparently Jessica liked Kanon-kun.`
`It was apparently so vague that she hadn't realized it herself.`
`...You know.`
` It's the kind of thing other people tend to spot before the person in question realizes it.`
`...Which means...`
`she might've first learned of her feelings when the person she liked died.`
`......It must've been so terrible, so sad.`
`Come to think of it, ...Kanon-kun was the one who handed her that inhaler.`
` ...Maybe she was remembering that.`
`I was fishing around Grandfather's study, ...thinking I'd research the meaning of the magic circle on the letter's second sheet.`
`Even though we were shut up here in a defensive position, my rebellious nature made me want to find some key, some way to resist.`
`...After all, we've got plenty of time before tomorrow morning.`
`Who could fault me for how I use that time?`
`No one else showed that much interest in this magic circle.`
`...Its meaning was unknown, and once we understood it, we were sure to find some message that would cause us unnecessary anguish.`
`...I felt the same way.`
`...However, I couldn't just ignore it, so I killed time by going through the motions of researching it...`
`"......You sure are enthusiastic.`
` ...Did you find anything that might serve as a hint...?"`
`"...Not a thing.`
` The first tough part is finding a book written in Japanese.`
` ...Just how many languages could Grandfather read?`
` He's incredible."`
`"Aren't you tired, Battler-kun?`
` ...You should take a rest while someone else stays awake.`
` Aunt Natsuhi said she'd stay up all night for us, but there's no way her body can handle that.`
` We should take turns sleeping."`
`"Then you sleep first, Aniki.`
` ......I'll keep researching 'til I get sleepy."`
`"...You mean...that magic circle just now?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` We've got plenty of time to kill.`
` I thought it'd be interesting to find out what kind of message Beatrice-sama put in it."`
`"......Give it a rest.`
` Mess around with stuff like that, and you'll end up getting possessed by something weird."`
`"Don't worry.`
` I've been certified by Maria.`
` ...She said I've got no spiritual talent at all.`
` Ihihi...!"`
`'!s1`
`...too cruel...`
`...to Maria?"`
`'!sd`
`@:dwave_eng 0, nat_1e591:`
`"...But Mom,`
` if Maria wasn't involved, and there's a culprit besides her, `
`...then she's obviously a soft target for the murderer.`
` ...If she's killed because of this, `
`......then we've...just left her to die..."`
`A gloomy silence settled once again.`
`...It looked like Jessica regretted letting her emotions take hold of her and snapping at Maria.`
`...She's always been like that.`
`...Always acting tough and regretting it later.`
`"...I understand how you feel, but Maria was in close contact with the culprit,`
` and she might have been siding with them, talking like that over and over to further confuse matters.`
` ......I am relieved that we chased them out."`
`"...That's pretty harsh, Aunt Natsuhi.`
` ...Couldn't it just have been the nonsense of a nine-year-old girl?"`
`It probably wasn't very convincing to hear that coming from me...`
`I myself thought Maria was creepy on several occasions, even doubting her true nature.`
`...And when Maria was chased out of this room, I couldn't deny I'd felt some relief...`
`".........If that is the case,`
` then tomorrow, we will apologize for what we did.`
` ...I will take full responsibility for chasing them out of this room.`
` ...This isn't something the rest of you have to worry about."`
`I could feel a tragic determination in Aunt Natsuhi's words.`
`...To protect her own daughter, she had resolutely chased out the suspicious ones.`
`...And if, as a result, she had to watch the people who had unfortunately been suspected die, so be it.`
` ...She was prepared to take full responsibility.`
`"...Why does Maria have to keep saying stuff like that?`
` She's bringing about her own ruin..."`
`"......I think the reason Maria-chan adores witches and magic so much...`
`...might be Aunt Rosa."`
`"Aunt Rosa?`
` What does she have to do with this?"`
`"...Didn't you realize it too, Battler-kun?`
` ...Maria-chan's real father ran off somewhere a long time ago.`
` ...Although Aunt Rosa tried to confuse the issue by saying he's on a foreign business trip."`
`"......Talking about Rosa-san's family has become a kind of taboo in the Ushiromiya family."`
`"I think Aunt Rosa thought about remarrying.`
` ...But I also believe Maria-chan may have become her shackles and made that quite difficult.`
` ......After all, she sometimes...`
`got really emotional and hit Maria-chan."`
`"......I agree with you there.`
` ...It looked like Aunt Rosa was trying hard to like Maria.`
` ...Which means...`
`that she didn't really like her.`
` ......She might've thought of Maria as someone who stood in the way of her remarrying..."`
`"...I think that emotional rejection from her mother must've left some deep scars on her young heart.`
` ...So, she learned about this occult hobby from somewhere and immersed herself in it to bury the holes in her heart.`
` ...Did you know?`
` To Maria-chan, the image of a witch isn't negative at all.`
` ...Remember yesterday, at the beach, when she showed us her notebook...?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...It was full of all those fun-looking scribbles."`
`Yesterday, when we were down by the beach, doubting the witch...`
`...Maria got all riled up and started explaining about witches.`
`And not one of the pages had shown a picture of an ugly witch.`
`They were all brightly colored, beautiful, cute witches who looked like they were having fun.`
`There was absolutely nothing sinister about them, like a boy might have imagined.`
` ...They were beings adorned with beautiful dresses, who could grant anyone's dreams with their mysterious magic and who made everyone happy.`
`...The sorrow of not being loved by her mother.`
`...Had Maria sought help from witches as beings who could give her happiness and save her?`
`Someday, a witch would come, and using her wonderful magic, would bring Maria happiness.`
`...Even though she believed that, as she grew older, she had to face reality as her fleeting dreams were sliced to ribbons one by one.`
`...If something claiming to be the witch of Rokkenjima appeared in front of a girl like that,`
` whispering that she'd take Maria to the Golden Land, where Maria could be happy...`
`"...............`
`'!s1`
` ...Now that it's come to this, I want to confess what's in my heart.`
` ...Throwing out Maria-chan...`
`no, ......Genji-san and the rest too, `
`...was probably...the wrong thing to do, I think..."`
`"......It wasn't...`
`...pleasant..."`
`'!sd`
`@`
`"Then, how do you all explain that letter?`
` No one could have set it there except the four people standing behind us.`
` I made sure of that with my own eyes.`
` ...If those four are innocent, how was that letter placed in a closed room with eight people?"`
`"......That's right...`
` ...When you put it that way, those four really do seem suspicious.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ......But, `
`...~ib~it's all useless.~ib~`
` Aah, ~ib~it's all useless~ib~`
`..."`
`"Useless? ...What is?"`
`"Right.`
` ......It might not be worth anything anymore, but let me spin the chessboard around again.`
` ...In other words, if one of those four really was the culprit, isn't that weird?"`
`"...............That's right...`
` ...Wasn't setting that letter openly on the table the same as confessing that one of them was the culprit?"`
`"...You're right, that's weird.`
` ...If they were going to do it, you'd think they'd put it in the crack of the door, for example, to make it look like someone had slipped it in from the outside!`
` Of course, they should've known that they'd be suspected if they didn't make it look like the culprit was outside the room!"`
`"Yeah, that's it exactly.`
` ...If the culprit was one of those four, `
`setting that letter right in the middle of the table would be both risky and meaningless."`
`"......But, putting aside whatever trick was used to set it there,`
` if we assume that the culprit is someone other than those four, ...in other words, someone who was outside the room,`
` then they had a lot to gain from that letter..."`
`"......Enough, Battler-kun.`
` ...It's meaningless to discuss such matters now."`
`Natsuhi-san quickly guessed what I was getting at.`
`...No, maybe she had thought of it long before I had...and had simply held her tongue...`
`"...If the culprit's outside the room, ...then they'd be totally stuck the moment we shut ourselves up in a closed room like this.`
` ...That's right.`
` It's the same as my theory about how Grandfather disappeared from this room, isn't it?"`
`"...That theory was that Grandfather left the room of his own accord.`
` ...If the culprit used some tactic to lure him out, and Grandfather left of his own accord, then..."`
`Come to think of it, ...when we found the scorpion magic circle on the doorknob to the study, Maria said it herself.`
`...Beatrice couldn't get through this door.`
`But she could induce someone to leave of their own accord.`
`"...Which would mean...`
`...we fell for the culprit's trap completely...`
`and sent out some new potential sacrifices."`
`"......Genji and the rest aren't fools.`
` When they try to protect themselves, they should find the next safest place after this room.`
` They will definitely be able to hide themselves there."`
`Aunt Natsuhi hadn't answered the question.`
`...Aunt Natsuhi herself had realized that if the culprit wasn't in our group back then, that letter would make sense as a trap.`
`However, it wasn't worth the risk of calling back the people she had once thrown out.`
`...To Aunt Natsuhi, right now, her greatest and only duty was to protect the children......`
`By her thinking, in order to do that, a few sacrifices were unavoidable...`
`"......Hey, Aunt Natsuhi.`
` Let me say something a little harsh, okay?`
` ...At that time, ...what if, by coincidence, Jessica had also been standing behind you.`
` ......Would you have chased Jessica from the room too?"`
`".................."`
`"It's true that a lot of brutal things have happened.`
` ...But as a mother, you thought you should protect your daughter no matter what.`
` Because of that duty, you chased them out, even though you knew that you'd eventually be held responsible for it.`
` ......It's not like I'm condemning that.`
` But, umm,`
` ......I was just thinking about what a great mother Jessica has."`
`"...That's right.`
` ...You've been dealing with these incidents since morning, and you've been pulling all of us along this whole time, without losing your composure.`
` ...If you were all confused too, the rest of us would probably be in the culprit's grasp by now.`
` ...So I think we all have to thank you."`
`"............Thank you."`
`".........`
`...So what you two are trying to say...`
`...is that you want her to act as Maria's mother too...?"`
`".................."`
`'!s1`
`always thought of Maria as a real little sister and adored her.`
` ......And yet, `
`...a few things happened, we got a little confused, `
`...and I've said a lot of mean things to her, hurting her...`
` ......Mom, `
`...please.`
` ......Let's stay together with Maria...`
`...no, everyone...`
` ......There was no...`
`culprit among us...`
` The culprit in this case is...`
`...the witch, Beatrice, okay...?`
` So, ...let's stop suspecting each other..."`
`'!sd`
`...Was she coping with her throbbing headache again, ...or was she thinking of something...`
`".........`
`You are...`
`...my precious daughter, ...the one I finally received a whole twelve years after I married my husband.`
` I would become the worst kind of demon to protect you."`
`That was some pretty strong language at the end there...`
`She realized very well that her words were an idealized view of what a mother should be, `
`but even so, she was strongly resolved to protect her daughter, even if she had to become a demon.`
`......But that was her guilty conscience tormenting her.`
`......Today's been so long.`
`...So many things happened in one day, ...and we've been driven into a corner so thoroughly...`
`...I wonder if we have the right to greet tomorrow the way we are now...`
`.........Th-There it is.`
`"...I found it.`
` ...It's this magic circle."`
`Inside the book I'd been flipping through, I had found the same magic circle that had been drawn on the second sheet of the letter.`
`George-aniki peered at it as well.`
`This magic circle's name was...the third magic circle of Mars.`
`The Hebrew written on it was from Psalms 77 verse 13 of the Old Testament.`
`'What god is so great as our God?'`
`The meaning of the magic circle was...`
`...'discord'.`
`...Agitate internal divisions and cause the enemy to bring about their own downfall.`
`"......Wait a sec...`
` Seriously...?"`
`Could there be a more fitting way to describe our current situation and mental state?`
`We couldn't help but be stunned into silence.`
`"...So, ...this letter was a trap...?!`
` How did they place it here?!`
` There wasn't anyone in this room except for the eight of us, right?!"`
`"A-Anyway, let's ignore how they got it in here for now.`
` ...The culprit was after just one thing!`
` They wanted to spread the seeds of doubt inside this impregnable room and use us to throw the sacrificial sheep out...!!"`
`"In that case, ...they're after...the people who went out of the room...!!"`
`"M-Mom, ...what should we do?!!`
` Those four are in danger...!"`
`"..............."`
`It wasn't surprising that Aunt Natsuhi remained unpleasantly silent.`
`...Even if this was all a trap by the culprit, even if the four who had been chased out of the room were in danger,`
` it had nothing to do with the safety of the four people in here.`
`And there was no way to prove the innocence of the four people we'd chased out.`
`...If we're willing to let them die, then we shouldn't leave this room no matter what.`
` ...That way is...safest!!`
`At that time, suddenly, the piercing sound of a phone rang through the room.`
`It was the antique extension phone set on the table in Grandfather's study.`
`...It had rung right after we started talking about the letter being a trap.`
`It was natural we'd think of it as an SOS from the ones we'd chased out.`
`But then Aunt Natsuhi spoke.`
`"......W-Why a phone call?!`
` The phones should be broken down and unusable...!!"`
`"That doesn't matter...!`
` If that's Maria calling for help...!"`
`"If the problem with the phones was the culprit's work in the first place,`
` ...then this call is...`
`...probably..."`
`With that one sentence, the ring of the phone, which had once sounded like a scream for help, ...now started to sound like a ghastly lure from some unknown person...!`
`Aunt Natsuhi hesitated over whether to pick up the receiver.`
`"L-Let's pick it up, Aunt Natsuhi...!`
` The phones might've been fixed for some reason...`
` It could still be an urgent call from Maria-chan and the rest...!"`
`"That's right...!`
` And if it actually is a call from the culprit, bring it on!`
` Why don't we listen to what they've got to say...?!`
` It's just a phone call.`
` No matter what they babble through the receiver, it's not like it's gonna hurt you...!!"`
`"...If you don't pick it up, `
`...then I will...!"`
`"...I-I will take it.`
` ...Hello?"`
`I stretched out my hand to take the receiver, but Aunt Natsuhi grabbed it before I could reach.`
`...We all held our breath, trying to figure out who the person on the other end of the phone was...`
`But for a while, Aunt Natsuhi kept saying 'hello'.`
`......A silent phone call...?`
`There's no way Maria and the others would do something so creepy.`
`'!s0`
` Could this phone call...`
`...possibly.........`
`really be...?`
`Natsuhi stopped repeating 'hello' and strained her ears.`
`......Because she thought she heard something far away on the other end of the receiver.`
`.........What was that...?`
`"...Huh?`
` ...Is someone...`
`......singing...?"`
`"What do you mean, ...singing?"`
`"......I don't know.`
` Faintly, from the other end of the phone, ...I can hear someone singing...`
` I wonder what...it could be..."`
`"G-Give it here for a sec...`
` Hello?!`
` ..................?!"`
`I half forced the receiver from the stunned Aunt Natsuhi's hand and pressed it against my ear.`
`.........At first, I didn't hear anything.`
`...But, ...because I had been told about it beforehand, I noticed.`
`......It sounded far away from the receiver, rather than someone speaking in a quiet voice, `
`......and it sounded like a girl singing a song.`
`...That voice did sound like Maria's, ...but that just made the situation even more inexplicable.`
`At the very least, the one who had made the phone call hadn't been Maria.`
`After all, Maria was singing some song far away from the receiver.`
`......In that case, the one who made the phone call should've been Genji-san, Kumasawa-san, or Doctor Nanjo.`
`......And yet, they weren't saying anything.`
` ...Why...?`
` For what reason...?`
` .........The person who made this phone call...`
` Who was it...?!?!`
`"Hey!!`
` Hello?!!`
` Who is it? Answer me!!`
` Is that Maria singing?!`
` Answer me!!"`
`"W-What's happening?!`
` What is it?!"`
`"I don't know...!`
` All I can say is...`
`this is probably a trap, ...and Maria's in trouble..."`
`Aunt Natsuhi took the receiver again, but after yelling into it several more times, she realized that she wasn't getting anywhere and hung up.`
`After that, she dialed quickly.`
` ...Then she clicked her tongue.`
`That's right, if the phones are working, we should be able to reach the police.`
`...But judging by Aunt Natsuhi's reaction, the outside telephone line still didn't connect.`
`"...L-Let's go!`
` Even if we know it might be a trap, we have to go!"`
`"Yeah, definitely!!`
` Jessica, Aunt Natsuhi, stay here!"`
`When Aniki and I tried to dash out, Aunt Natsuhi stopped us.`
`"Hold it.`
` ......I cannot let you go alone.`
` I will go too.`
` Jessica, wait here."`
`"What, so I'll be the only one left out?!`
` Nice try, but I'm going too...!!"`
`"Yeah, it might be better that way.`
` ...If the goal of that phone call was to split us up further, it wouldn't be a good idea to leave someone to watch this room."`
`"There's no time to argue.`
` Let's all go!"`
`Aunt Natsuhi raised the rifle high and took the lead.`
`I couldn't go unarmed myself.`
`I found a three-pronged candle stand and readied it.`
`Although the pins on it used to fit candles were short, it was almost like a three-pronged spear.`
`Then, the four of us left the study.`
`We left the study, which should've been the safest place inside the mansion.`
`By doing this, we had been lured out, even though we had barricaded ourselves in a safe closed room.`
` ...Perhaps, we were...`
`...doing exactly the same thing Grandfather had done when he disappeared from that room...`
`"Maria!!`
` Where are you?!`
` Answer me!!"`
`I listened closely, but didn't hear anything...`
`The mansion was vast, and since the passing typhoon was making its last stand, the sound of the rain was even noisier than before.`
`"...Maria-chan said she wanted to watch TV in the parlor, right?!`
` Let's try going downstairs!"`
`"......That's right.`
` Let's try there.`
` ...Everyone, be mindful of your surroundings!"`
`"Yeah!!"`
`With Aunt Natsuhi in the center, her rifle readied and her finger on the trigger,`
` we moved in a group, our backs together, checking our surroundings in all directions...`
`It was just as though the magic of that magic circle designed to spread discord had worked.`
` ...We had split up, and furthermore, had been dragged out into dangerous territory.`
`...In other words, even now, we were doing just what the culprit wanted us to do.`
` ...This was a separate world where it wouldn't be odd for anything to suddenly occur...`
`Aunt Natsuhi nervously pointed the barrel of the gun at every dark spot and shadow.`
`It felt like that motion was out of fear rather than caution...`
`But the rifle she held in her hand should've been a trump card that the culprit feared...`
`"...You know, I've been thinking.`
` It wouldn't be impossible to stick one of those 'icepicks' into someone's chest, like in Kanon-kun's case.`
` ...But splitting the skull and sticking them into the forehead, like in my parents' case, wouldn't be that easy."`
`"You think the culprit had that kind of animal strength...?!"`
`"...They probably had some kind of weapon, a device that can shoot or pound in those 'icepicks'.`
` That handle was too short to be driven in that deeply by a human's strength alone."`
`"...Either way, they have enough force to break through a skull.`
` ...I heard Kanon's wound reached as far as his lungs.`
` ...If you happen to see your opponent, don't go forwards.`
` You mustn't move away from my back."`
`Just how sinister and frightening was the weapon that could shoot those creepy icepicks?`
`...And could I do anything to combat it with just this candle stand in my hand?`
`In the first murder, the culprit probably assaulted all four of our parents at once as they discussed the inheritance problem in the dining hall.`
` ...And there were four of us here now.`
`...Apparently, I wasn't the only person thinking this.`
`...George-aniki,`
` Jessica,`
` ...and, of course, Aunt Natsuhi, `
`...were stretching their senses to the utmost limit, in the highest and worst state of tension, slowly advancing one step, then another...`
`......Aaah, what have we done?`
`...Because of the seeds of doubt spread by that one letter, we threw Maria and the rest into the middle of this terrifying world...`
`We finally reached the first floor.`
` ......The parlor was just across the hall.`
`When we listened carefully, ......we could hear it faintly.`
` ...Maria's eerie singing voice.`
`She wasn't singing naturally, as though she were in a good mood.`
`......She was singing mechanically, like she was at a graduation ceremony and she'd been ordered to.`
`...The song she sang was just a common folk song, one that everyone has probably sung in school at one time or another.`
`...But why that, in the middle of the night, alone, with all her heart, over and over, why...?!`
`Right after leaving the study, we had called out in loud voices, asking Maria where she was.`
`...But this time, no one said even a single word.`
`...We hid our breath and the sound of our footsteps, and, intensely focused on our surroundings to the point of being completely high-strung, ...we stepped forward...`
`The door to the parlor was closed.`
`But we could hear Maria's singing voice through it...`
`Aunt Natsuhi put her hand on the handle of the doorknob...`
`when George-aniki stopped her.`
`"...I'll open the door...`
` Aunt Natsuhi, Battler-kun, ready your weapons."`
`"......Understood.`
` ...Take care."`
`"They might attack as soon as we open it...`
` George nii-san, watch yourself...!"`
`"...Sure...`
` ......Then...I'll open it...`
` ......Huh?!"`
`He tried to open it, but immediately felt the hard resistance of the lock.`
`Aunt Natsuhi took the bundle of keys from her pocket and gave them to George.`
`...There were about ten keys, and none of us had a clue which was which.`
`Because of this, George had to fumble around loudly and test several of the keys.`
`...Since we had hidden our footsteps, preparing to make a surprise attack on the room, this felt almost fatal...`
`The whole time, we could hear Maria's voice from the parlor, singing the same song over and over.`
`...It was like a broken, crazy cassette tape...`
`We'd been in that room almost constantly since morning.`
`...All the frightening things had occurred outside that room.`
`...That had left us with the impression that only this room was safe.`
`......That baseless impression was quickly falling apart...`
`"......Nng, ......it's open."`
`"...Thank you.`
` George-kun, Jessica, move behind me."`
`"...Aunt Natsuhi,`
` let's jump in at the same time and split up in different directions.`
` If we just stand around after opening the door, those icepicks might fly right through the center...!"`
`"I agree.`
` ......Ready...?"`
`"Ihihi...!`
` I really wish I could say 'no'...!"`
`I readied myself.`
`...If they're gonna be throwing icepicks, I'll whack 'em with this candle stand!!`
`"...Go!!!"`
`Aunt Natsuhi and I rammed into the door before flying into the parlor,`
` quickly splitting up left and right and searching the parlor for someone who might be waiting for us.`
`But what our eyes landed upon......`
`...was an incredibly...`
`...strange sight...`
`The parlor......was stained with blood.`
`This place, where we spent almost the entire day,`
` where we pressed in together to protect ourselves from some unknown malice,`
` ...had been stained with fresh blood, had become an ocean of blood...!!`
`On the floor lay Genji-san, Kumasawa-san, and Doctor Nanjo, their entire bodies stained bright red with the blood...`
`......But the only way we could identify them was by their clothes.`
`...That was because...aaah, that's right, this is how the whole tragedy started...!!!`
`Their faces...`
` Just like our smashed up parents in the shed, ...you couldn't tell where their eyes stopped and their noses began!!`
` It was as though they'd rudely plunged their faces into tomato pot pies, all squished up, ...uuwaaaaaaAAAAAAaaaaaaAAAAaahhh!!`
`And that wasn't all.`
` Their bodies had other wounds.`
` ...It was those 'demon icepicks'!`
` They were in...Genji-san's stomach, Doctor Nanjo's thigh...no, his knee?`
` That's right, of course it's his knee...!`
` In the epitaph, the sixth twilight was the stomach! And on the seventh twilight, the knee was gouged!`
` So after seeing one of them stuck near Kumasawa baa-chan's calf, I couldn't help masochistically laughing 'Ahh, that's right'...!!`
`On the sixth twilight, gouge the stomach and kill.`
`On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill.`
`On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill.`
`Aaaaaah, ...now even the eighth twilight is over.`
` And the next one, the ninth twilight, ...what was it again...?`
`Maria......was there.`
`......She was facing the wall in the inner part of the room, ...standing stock still, completely alone.`
`She faced away from this horrible scene, standing by the wall, singing her song over and over...`
`There was nothing else in the room.`
`...Just the corpses of the three who had been brutally killed, ...and the phone receiver, which was still off its hook, proving that this was the room the call had come from.`
`......Just that and Maria, her back to this scene as she kept on singing while facing the wall......`
`...We couldn't even scream at this...bizarre scene.`
`...We could only stare, shocked, with our mouths hanging loosely open...`
`"......M-Maria.........?"`
`Jessica called out to her.`
`...But Maria showed no reaction.`
`......Alone, she kept singing on and on...`
`We had come here, trying to save Maria from some approaching danger.`
`...So, now that we had found her, we should've been running up to Maria, hugging her, joyous that she was safe.`
` ...And yet, not one of us could do that...!`
`Everyone thought it. But they couldn't say it.`
` After all, because...because...that's right, even if that's crazy......no, it couldn't be......!!`
`"...M-Maria!!`
` Stop singing!!`
` Are you listening?!!"`
`At some point, ...Aunt Natsuhi and I had pointed our weapons at Maria's back.`
`...I yelled at Maria in a violent voice.`
`...But there was no reaction.`
` She just kept singing...!!`
`With the candle stand still readied, I ran up to her, and forcefully...no, violently slammed my hand down on her shoulder.`
` Then I pulled on her shoulder, forcing her to turn around!`
`"...Uuwhoa.`
` ......Uu-."`
`Maria's small body was quickly pulled down and fell.`
`...And, as though unhappy at having her singing interrupted, ...Maria looked into my face with her usual expression.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`Even in this gruesome situation, ~ib~she was just like normal!!~ib~`
`"Maria, what is this?!`
` Wh-Who did it?!"`
`"......Uu-.`
` Beatrice."`
`"C-Cut that crap!!!"`
`I threw the candle stand I'd been holding against the wall.`
`The violence of that reckless sound should've gone straight into Maria's heart.`
`...But Maria's expression didn't change at all!`
`"Quit it, Battler-kun!`
` Maria-chan, ...this time, you should've seen the face of the culprit who killed these three.`
` Was the culprit...the same Beatrice who gave you the letter?!"`
`"...Uu-.`
` Beatrice."`
`"Well, in that case, it's certain.`
` There is a 19th person, Beatrice does exist!!`
` Then, Maria, will you at least tell me this much?`
` How did they kill these three people?`
` What did they use to kill them in such a brutal way?!"`
`"...I don't know."`
`"How could you not know?!`
` It happened in this room!!`
` Are you trying to tell me you were so absorbed in singing that you didn't notice?!"`
`"Calm down, Battler-kun!!`
` ...M-Maria-chan,`
` talk to me.`
` ...Okay?"`
`George-aniki, as he always did, crouched down next to Maria so that their eyes met and talked to her very kindly...`
`"...Maria-chan, ...why were you facing the wall and singing...?"`
`"......Uu-.`
` ...Beatrice said to face the wall and keep singing for a long time.`
` Uu-."`
`"So, did Beatrice come here?!`
` Were Genji-san and the rest still alive then?!"`
`"...Uu-.`
` Everyone came into the parlor together and sat down.`
` ...Genji-san made sure to lock the door."`
`"It was locked when we got here... But then, how did Beatrice get into the parlor?!!"`
`"Uu-.`
` Beatrice is a witch, so locks don't matter.`
` She turned into butterflies and came in through the crack in the door."`
`"Huuhh?!`
` Calmly joking at a time like this?!!!`
` Like hell that happened!`
` What are you saying?!"`
`"Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!`
` You can't believe it?`
` That's why I didn't want to say.`
` No matter how I say it, you won't believe.`
` But Beatrice is a witch.`
` She can do anything with her miraculous magic.`
` That's why Beatrice doesn't care whether a door is locked or not.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihihi...!"`
`"A-And then?! After Beatrice appeared, what happened to everyone?!"`
`"...Beatrice talked to us.`
` She said Grandfather's study was protected by a powerful force, and she couldn't enter no matter what she did.`
` So she told us she'd select three sacrifices from the four people in the parlor.`
` ...Everyone said 'no way'.`
` Kihihihihihihihihi, Kumasawa-san kept saying 'no way, no way'.`
` But Beatrice chose.`
` ...And when she did, Beatrice said I'd be fine.`
` ......Why do you think?"`
`"It's because of the scorpion charm with the fifth magic circle of Mars, the one Battler used to pray for my safety, the one he put his feelings into.`
` Because of that power, Beatrice couldn't do anything to me, and me alone."`
`"So she decided to use the other three as sacrifices.`
` After that, Beatrice spoke."`
`'Come, face the wall and sing a song for me.`
` ...You will sing lots and lots of songs, so no matter what happens, no matter what you hear, you won't hear you won't hear you won't know.`
` Come, sing lots of fun songs for me.'`
`"So I was singing the whole time.`
` Over and over.`
` So I didn't hear anything, didn't know anything.`
` ...And then all of you came.`
` Uu-."`
`"Are you asking us to believe that?!`
` You think we're stupid?!!!"`
`"Kihhihihihihi!`
` Then who will you suspect this time?`
` Will you suspect me?`
` Gonna try killing me right here?`
` Even if you do that, Beatrice won't stop 'existing'.`
` Now, the eighth twilight is over, and Beatrice will revive!!"`
`"Are you serious?! I've had enough of that talk!!`
` As if witches could exist, as if I'd let myself get tricked!!!`
` I won't accept it! Beatrice doesn't 'exist'!!`
` I definitely won't accept it!!`
` So I won't let her exist, I won't let her revive!!`
` The legend will remain a legend forever.`
` I won't acknowledge something like thaaaaat!!!"`
`"Quit it, Battler...!!`
` It's not like Maria killed them or let them die!!`
` B-Beatrice came, and Maria had to obey, was unable to resist...!!"`
`"......Huh?!`
` ...A-Aunt Natsuhi?`
` Sh-She isn't here...!"`
`"Huh? Wha-?!"`
`"M-Mom? Where did she go...?!"`
`".........Just now, she left by herself, reading a letter."`
`A letter?!`
` Th-That makes sense, the culprit must be so exhilarated now that we've reached the eight twilight.`
`They might've left a letter so that they could brag even more.`
`We were so wrapped up in questioning Maria that we forgot to look for a letter...!`
`But even as well-armed as she was, why had she left the room by herself in this dangerous mansion after reading it?!`
`Jessica tried to chase after her and tugged at the handle to the door, but it resisted strangely and wouldn't open...!`
`"Mom, Mom!!`
` What's going on?!!`
` Open up, ...open up...!!!"`
`It was only natural.`
` ...Natsuhi had picked up the candle stand, which Battler had thrown at the wall and which had fallen to the floor.`
`......She had then skillfully wedged it between the doorknobs on the double doors like a bolt, holding them closed.`
`...The intricate design of the candle stand caused it to get caught solidly, and it really did make a sturdy seal on the door.`
`The tragic scream of a daughter for her mother...`
`Did it reach Natsuhi's ears, or not...?`
`Natsuhi's figure was...`
`...alone in the entrance hall.`
`It was the place decorated by the portrait of Beatrice.`
`Natsuhi threw down Beatrice's last letter, the one she had read in the parlor, `
`...readied her rifle again, and in a voice that rang clear, yelled in the massive space that was the entrance hall.`
`"...I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi, representative of the Ushiromiya family!!!`
` Show yourself, `
`...Golden Witch, Beatrice!!!"`
`The entrance hall was dimly lit.`
`Other than a faint light which shone on the center of the room, everything was blotted out by the jet-black darkness.`
`...In that darkness, `
`......butterflies glittering in gold squirmed, twinkled, `
`...and sneered.`
`Natsuhi gave one more huge gulp and pointed the cold barrel of the gun at the gold butterflies......`
`"......So you have finally...`
`...shown yourself.`
` .........I still can't believe...`
`...that something like you really exists...`
` ...But that isn't a problem."`
`"...Both I who bear the title of representative to the Ushiromiya family...`
`and you who claim to succeed the Headship of the Ushiromiya family...are here right now.`
` ...At this point, whether you are a witch or not is a trivial matter!"`
`"......Come, `
`...let us settle this.`
` ...Which of us will truly succeed the Ushiromiya family?`
` ...I, Ushiromiya Natsuhi, `
`......or you, `
`...Beatrice?!!`
` Allow me to respectfully accept your request for a duel...!!"`
`The gold butterflies slowly formed a human shape, which walked into the dim light...`
`Natsuhi readied the rifle...`
`...and glared.`
`The witch raised her golden staff overhead...`
`...and laughed.`
`Natsuhi's finger...`
`slowly squeezed the trigger......`
`"And...gooooooooooooooooo!!!"`
`Battler made an all-out dash at the door and rammed into it, crushing the candle stand that had been barring it and making it possible for a big gap to be opened in the door.`
`He kept kicking the candle stand through that gap, and the door was finally released.`
`At that time, they heard it.`
` ...They certainly heard the crisp sound of gunfire ring out once...!`
`"Mom!!`
` Moooooooooooooooom!!!"`
`"Jessica-chan, you mustn't run off by yourself...!!"`
`"Was that the sound of a gun just now?!`
` Did Aunt Natsuhi shoot?!!"`
`At whom?`
` At the culprit!!!`
`The noise had come from the entrance hall.`
`And the entrance hall...looked like a stage.`
`Like the heroine of a tragedy, on the ground and bathed in light,`
` ......arrayed in the beauty of that silence,`
` ...Aunt Natsuhi lay face up, crumpled on the floor...`
`Half-crazed, Jessica ran up to Aunt Natsuhi.`
`...On Aunt Natsuhi's forehead, `
`...it was almost as though a sparkling shard of pigeon blood ruby had been placed there.`
`'!s0`
`from it, one stream...`
`of blood makeup...`
`passed by her eye...`
`and began to traverse her face......`
`'!sd`
`'!s0`
`@`
`...then, `
`......she...`
`...shot...`
`herself...in the forehead...?!`
`'!sd@`
`"Mom, Mom, Mom!!!`
` Gyyyaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"`
`"...I-I don't get it!!`
` Why did Aunt Natsuhi run away alone, `
`...and why did she shoot through her own forehead?!"`
`"...Maria-chan, Aunt Natsuhi left the room after reading a letter, right?!`
` There's no letter here!`
` Damn it, what did Aunt Natsuhi read, and why was she lured out here?!"`
`"I don't know, I don't know, who cares about that...?!!`
` What the hell, why did she kill herself?!`
` Why...did she leave me all alone?!`
` Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh...!!"`
`Jessica clung to her mother's corpse, crying earnestly...`
`My body was consumed with an anger I didn't know what to do with, and I snatched the rifle from Aunt Natsuhi's hand.`
` I spun around, pointing the barrel of the gun into the darkness on all sides, as though I was pointing a light from a lighthouse, trying to find the culprit.`
`George-aniki, even in this situation, was trying to calmly figure something out, but that might've been a fruitless effort.`
`......And only Maria was completely indifferent.`
`...So is this all supposed to be some kind of predetermined fate?`
`No, that's not it.`
`This is all...a prelude to a wonderful world.`
`The door to the Golden Land will finally...`
`open.`
`"...On the ninth twilight, the witch shall revive, and none shall be left alive, `
`...and on the tenth twilight, at journey's end, you shall attain to the power of the Golden Land's treasures, once and for the last time.`
` ...With this, everything is over, Beatrice.`
` Congratulations, ...congratulations.`
` ...So lead me. Lead me to the Golden Land you told me of...`
`...right now...!!"`
`There, all of the dead will be revived, and even lost love will be restored.`
`......So, in Maria's eyes, it's just as though all of today's tragedies didn't happen.`
`It's as though all the time she spent deprived of love never happened.`
`"Stop it!!`
` What's so fun? What's to be congratulated?!!`
` There were 18 people on this island!`
` 14 are dead!`
` Only the four of us are left!!`
` I'm definitely not gonna die!`
` Until the night is over...no, until the typhoon passes, and the seagulls gather again at the harbor, I'm definitely not gonna die!!`
` I'll stay alive, I'll stay alive no matter what!!"`
`"......Kihihihihihi.`
` Give it up, Battler.`
` ...Guns are useless against witches.`
` Survival and all that stuff doesn't matter...because it's over.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~The journey has already ended~ib~.`
` ......See, look at the clock."`
`...Huh?`
` The clock?`
`Hearing those words, I looked at my wristwatch.`
`Both needles were almost touching near the top.`
`...Very soon, it will be 12:00 at night.`
` ...In other words, 24:00.`
`When you think about it, isn't 24:00 is a strange time?`
`...It can be called 24:00, and it can also be called 0:00.`
`It's the hour at the culmination of the previous day, ...and at the same time, it's hour zero as the next day begins.`
`"......Beatrice!!"`
`Maria suddenly called out happily and ran towards the darkness.`
`It was almost as though Beatrice was somewhere in that darkness, and Maria was running up to her.`
`As Jessica hugged her mother's corpse,`
` as George-aniki stood there, confused,`
` I looked down the barrel of the rifle,`
` ...gazing into the darkness...`
`The space in front of Beatrice's portrait lay in that direction.`
`And...the thing Maria was running up to was...`
`'!s0`
`subject.`
`You've got to be kidding me, `
`...this is...just impossible...`
`...Like I'd fall for something like this, `
`...witches don't 'exist', I won't accept it...!`
`Something like you shouldn't 'exist', `
`because this is a human world! You think I could accept something that's not human?! I definitely won't accept it!!`
`When I pulled hard on the rifle's lever, the cartridge was ejected, fell on the floor, and a new cartridge was loaded.`
`Then, I sighted the witch down the barrel...`
`Maria turned around.`
`......Still clinging to the Golden Witch, she turned around.`
`"...Didn't I tell you it was meaningless?`
` ......Mere lead bullets are meaningless against Beatrice.`
` ...Humans are so stupid, aren't they?`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi."`
`"I won't accept the existence of witches!!`
` Who are you?!!`
` Just try moving one step, just try moving one finger!!`
` I'll blast you away!!!"`
`'!s1`
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*, `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*, `
`ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!""`
`As the witch...no, the witches laughed, ...even the large clock in the hall joined in on their laughter...`
`It was probably telling us that the time was 24:00.`
`It was both a tone telling us that we had reached the culmination of this day, `
`and a tone informing us that all had returned to nothing.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~The rule that the witch would win when time ran out had already been revealed.~ib~`
`"......Battler,`
` ...George nii-chan and Jessica.`
` ......The journey has ended, and the witch has...revived, see?"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`And ~ib~none shall be left alive~ib~.`
`The witch shall praise the wise and bestow four treasures.`
`One shall be all the gold from the Golden Land.`
`One shall be the resurrection of all the dead souls.`
`One shall be the resurrection of the love that was lost.`
`One shall be to put the witch to sleep for all time.`
`Sleep peacefully, my beloved witch, Beatrice...`
`"George-sama, please look!`
` They're so cute, look, look!"`
`Shannon found a pair of hammerhead sharks swimming playfully in the tank...`
`and looked as excited as a grade schooler seeing an aquarium for the first time.`
`"Yeah, they really are cute.`
` Almost makes me want to eat them."`
`"I-I'd feel so sorry for them...`
` Did you know?`
` I hear the Japanese are only people in the world who go to aquariums and say how delicious everything looks."`
`"Is that so?`
` ...I'm sure even Americans and Italians would want to eat these."`
`"...Uh,`
` ...um......`
`err..."`
`"Those clothes look good on you.`
` Really."`
`Shannon clutched at her chest with both hands in embarrassment.`
`...She apparently felt like she was being made fun of for wearing these clothes she wasn't used to.`
`Though George's face didn't show it, he'd actually said something so completely unexpected that it surprised even him,`
` and he was as embarrassed as Shannon on the inside.`
`However, when he saw how embarrassed Shannon was, `
`he started to imagine he was teasing a girl he liked, `
`and instead of embarrassment, a ticklish amusement welled up in him.`
`......No, he wasn't just imagining it.`
`...He really was teasing the girl he liked.`
`Before now,`
` ......he wouldn't have expected to hear a line like that anywhere these days, not even in a manga or something.`
`In fact, if he'd seen another couple acting like this, his first instinct would be to start throwing rocks at them.`
`But even if someone were to start throwing rocks at us now, `
`I'm sure they'd be no different than confetti celebrating our relationship.`
`Now, I can't even remember those lonely days...`
`when I felt jealous of couples who were completely oblivious to their surroundings.`
`To use an old-fashioned phrase, these really are rose-colored days I'm living in...`
`I'm so entranced that I barely notice that massive tank in the world's largest aquarium anymore.`
`Instead, all I see are the expressions flitting across Shannon's face as she plays with the fish.`
`"...It's amazing, isn't it......?`
` It's my first time seeing a tank large enough for a whale to swim in."`
`"I heard this tank is the biggest selling point here.`
` And that it's the biggest in the whole world."`
`"Is that so?`
` That's amazing.`
` ......It's really wonderful.`
` It doesn't even look like a tank at all, more like they sliced off a part of the sea with a knife and brought it here."`
`"You're right.`
` This really is a little sea."`
`Despite its size, I hadn't thought of the tank as anything more than a tank.`
`That's why I found her metaphor so interesting.`
`No matter how far humans broaden their experiences, they always end up viewing the world through the lense of their own values.`
` Maybe that's why it's so interesting to interact with people who have different worldviews.`
`I voiced my thoughts on this.`
`She responded.`
`"True, this may not be the real sea.`
` ...But if those little guys swimming in there believe it's the sea, then that's what it is."`
`"Even though they're inside a finite tank?"`
`"The sea is finite too.`
` Then again, even if the sea were infinite,`
` how much could we cover in our whole lives?`
` I'm sure it'd be only a minuscule fraction of the sea."`
`"...You're right.`
` It's ironic, isn't it?`
` Even though the world is so vast, most of us humans live our lives without ever leaving our own country."`
`"If the inhabitants of a place believe they're living in a complete world, `
`then even the bottom of a narrow well can be a wonderful world, an entire ocean.`
` ...At least to the frogs that live there."`
`Shannon, who spent her days as a servant on a small island 10 kilometers in circumference called Rokkenjima, `
`said that with a smile.`
`After we finished walking through the whole aquarium, we had a small late-afternoon lunch at a restaurant with a nice view.`
`The word 'buffet' has the power to make any boy's heart leap.`
`I was like that myself once.`
`But with Shannon beside me, this buffet felt different.`
`I couldn't shamefully pile on only the things I liked.`
`I was...how should I put it...worried about my appearance and choose a menu suited for a snob: `
`toast, salad and coffee.`
`If I'd been by myself, I would've made a pile of oily stuff like yakisoba, mashed potatoes, gratin, and so on.`
`"Shannon, is that going to be enough for you?`
` If it is, then I guess we men are animals with really bad fuel efficiency."`
`"...Umm, `
`th-that's not what I..."`
`On Shannon's tray, there was only tea and salad.`
`Maybe the mere fact that I thought she was a whole plate short proved I was thinking with a man's stomach.`
`"Actually, I should be asking you the same thing.`
` Don't you think men should eat a little bit more than that?`
` ...I imagine you normally eat much more for lunch, right?"`
`"Oh, right, dang.`
` Come to think of it, you already know how much I eat normally because of meals I've had at the Head Family household."`
`"That's right.`
` So I was worried you might have an upset stomach today..."`
`Shannon was kind enough to guess that I wasn't feeling well.`
`Looks like my stupid attempt to show off made her worry.`
`And apparently, my stomach wasn't going to let me show off any longer.`
`"...Gah, ahaha...`
` Okay, I'll confess.`
` I was just trying to look cool...`
` I held back just because I was with a girl..."`
`"I thought so.`
` Considering how much you eat during lunch at the family conferences, I thought this wasn't nearly enough.`
` Please, don't be so reserved, and feel free to go choose another dish."`
`"It's not fair for only me to be embarrassed.`
` What about you, Shannon?`
` How will you be able to keep up with the Ushiromiya family workload on such a sparse diet?"`
`"......Umm, uh, `
`............au."`
`Shannon fell silent and blushed bright red.`
`Apparently, I wasn't the only one showing off.`
`When I realized that, my embarrassment disappeared completely.`
`"Oh, so that's not enough for you either, is it?`
` Yeah, you usually eat a bit more than this for lunch."`
`"A-A woman's stomach is made of magic, so this is enough...`
`au."`
`"So, we've both been showing off to each other.`
` Let's not hold back anymore, shall we?"`
`I smiled to show that I wouldn't make fun of her anymore and rose from my seat.`
`"After finally coming to Okinawa, it'd be a waste if we didn't eat some bitter melon.`
` I'll go get some fried bitter melon or something.`
` Shannon, come with me.`
` C'mon, c'mon."`
`"Ah, yes...!"`
`To anyone watching us, we might seem like an incredibly charming and embarrassing couple.`
`But it's only after becoming a couple that you realize.`
`To us, this exchange of words is everything, our entire world.`
`That's why no matter how much everyone else stares at us with blank expressions, we never notice.`
`......Indeed, at this age, I finally understand the feelings of couples who want to endlessly flirt without any regard for their surroundings.`
`After I returned with a plate piled up with fried food, Shannon arrived with a pretty cake.`
`While laughing at our fake stoicism, we resumed our lunch.`
`"Even though it's a restaurant with a view of the sea, it's so cloudy."`
`Luckily, our window seats gave us a view of seaside scenery so grandiose that it extended even beyond our field of vision.`
`However, because of the cloudy sky, we were only seeing a fraction of its usual beauty.`
`"That's right.`
` If it were clear, we'd undoubtedly see a deep blue sea."`
`"Yep.`
` I'll bet you're already used to the sea around Rokkenjima, but the deep blue of the sea here would surely have been a sight to see.`
` ...It's a real shame."`
`"Oh, ...but no matter how blue the sea is at work, it might as well be gray to me.`
` But, I'm not working today, so...umm..."`
`Apparently, Shannon was doing her best to say an embarrassing line.`
` But I didn't let her get off easy.`
`"So close.`
` If only you'd said 'When watching the sea alone with you, George-sama, it looks deep blue no matter how gray it is', `
`I'd have given you full marks and a prize."`
`'すす、すみません……。`
`"Uh, `
`ah, `
`I-I-I'm sorry......`
`nnnnnn..."`
`"Wanna hear what the prize was?"`
`"Umm, `
`......`
`uh, `
`if you don't mind telling me......"`
`"No.`
` I won't tell you.`
` Ahahahahahaha."`
`"Th-That's no fair..."`
`When I was in elementary school, I was always the kid who got bullied.`
`When everyone teased me, I grew nervous and speechless, to the delight of the bullies.`
`Back then, I wondered why everyone teased me.`
`But now, teasing Shannon like this, I understand why.`
`This is so much fun.`
`I can play with her emotions however I please, `
`...and I can have them all to myself.`
`Right now, I can't think of any greater pleasure.`
`That's why I have to go easy on her.`
`It's not as though I want to make her feel embarrassed and upset.`
`So I decided to be nice and change the subject.`
`Best not to be too obstinate.`
`"When you've finished your lunch, do you want to take a walk on the beach?`
` Maybe the clouds will clear up and we'll get a beautiful view of the sea."`
`"That's right.`
` I want to go see it."`
`"Yeah, let's do it.`
` ...But...that cake really does look delicious.`
` Maybe I'll go get one of those too."`
`"You mustn't...`
` If you eat cake after eating so much, you'll get fat.`
` It looks like Hideyoshi-sama's blood is pretty thick in you, George-sama, so you'll get chubby if you don't take care."`
`"Shannon, you won't stop liking me if I get fat, will you...?`
` After all, I wouldn't stop liking you if you got fat."`
`"I-I didn't mean it that way...`
` If you don't take good care of your body, it'll be bad for your health...`
`au."`
`"Mother warns me all the time too.`
` I wonder if I'll have to take up Tai-chi-quan or something like she does and get some exercise."`
`"When going on a diet, it's better to start by rethinking your eating habits, rather than just exercising all the time.`
` Apparently, the exercise only helps if you're eating well first."`
`"In other words, you're telling me to hold off on the cake, huh?`
` Then, I guess I'll just have to gaze at you while you stuff your cheeks with it, Shannon."`
`"Uh, `
`umm, `
`.........`
` ......A whole cake is probably too much, `
`......but maybe just half of one would be okay.`
` Here, it's really delicious."`
`Shannon cut her own cake and tried to move half to my dessert plate.`
`I had no doubt that she wanted to share the delicious cake's flavor with me.`
`However, I meanly pulled my plate away from her.`
`She blinked in surprise.`
`She could't seem to figure out if I was refusing the cake or not.`
`So I winked, opened my mouth, and said 'aah'.`
`"*giggle*`
` So that's what you really wanted.`
` ......Sheesh, you're such a pampered child, George-sama.`
`'あ〜ん。」`
`'!s1`
`say 'aah'."`
`With a partly embarrassed, partly exasperated face, Shannon offered the cake to me with a fork.`
`*chomp*`
`It tasted like a cheap chocolate cake you might find anywhere.`
` And yet, it was exceptional.`
`Because eating cake in such an embarrassing way, as if we were a couple of perfect fools, had been my dream for many years.`
`It made this cake's flavor heavenly...`
`If the Earth is destined to end, I wouldn't have any regrets if it happened right now.`
`......It was such a moment of bliss.`
`After that, we gathered shells, ran from waves, and enjoyed each other's company while walking along the beach.`
`In the end, the clouds never parted.`
`However, we both believed that the sea reflected in our eyes was a deep blue.`
`"......Somehow, I'm so happy...`
`that it scares me."`
`"You do say that from time to time.`
` What is it you're afraid of?"`
`"...I'm...`
`...a servant of the Ushiromiya family.`
` For someone like me...to be walking like this with a member of the family...`
` Umm, `
`.........it just felt like it was too much for me."`
`"I'm also surprised.`
` I didn't just meet you yesterday or today, Shannon-chan.`
` We've known each other for years now.`
` However, we can only meet during those family meetings that only happen a few times a year.`
` ...Back then, I couldn't even imagine having the sort of relationship where I could spend time with you like this.`
` It was the same for you too, right?"`
`'……その…。」`
`'!s1`
`......I`
`......umm..."`
`"Hmm?"`
`'……その、妄想してただけで……。」`
`'!s1`
`...did imagine it.`
` No, uh, I mean...!`
` Maybe I should call it...`
`...a kind of daydream......`
` I did think about what it'd be like, being in a relationship with you, a boy who was always so gentlemanly and considerate...`
`umm, though it was only ever a fantastic daydream......"`
`"Then, we must have your believing heart to thank for our relationship.`
` Magic dwells in the power of love.`
` So, I'm sure that magic brought us together."`
`".........You're right.`
` ...I really do think......it was magic."`
`"But, you know, that's not actually true.`
` As you kept looking more and more beautiful every year, you became a larger and larger presence in my mind too.`
` If the same thing happened to you, `
`then the fact that we're here today is simply an inevitable consequence, rather than something caused by magic or a miracle."`
`"...............No.`
` A miracle did happen, `
`George-sama."`
`She stopped walking down the beach, gazing out beyond the sea.`
`" ......A miracle?"`
`"No, it was magic.`
` ...It happened."`
`I was bewildered by that slightly mysterious phrase, which I sometimes heard her use.`
`"......Magic, you say?"`
`"Yes, magic.`
` .........I doubt you'd believe me if I explained, so I won't.`
` But...this bit of magic definitely had the power to grant the miracle that brought us together."`
`"Are you talking about some kind of ritual?"`
`"Yeah,`
` you might call it something like that.`
` ...Except that it really was magic, not just some ritual."`
`"...Hmm?"`
`Maybe it's all girls, not just Shannon, who tend to treat encounters as miracles or coincidences.`
`For a man like me, an encounter with a girl is 70% hard work to try and make her like you, 20% courage,`
` and 10% coincidence.`
`The part that means everything to her...is a much smaller factor in my mind.`
`...Maybe that way of thinking itself is calculating and typical of men.`
`But if I said that out loud, it might dissolve all kinds of magic.`
`To my mind, there were lots of coincidences, compromises, and expended effort on both sides before we gained the relationship we have today.`
`At the culmination of all that, we get to spend this joyful time together,`
` and if she wants to call that magic, I've got no objections to her choice of words.`
`So I'll stand up for that magic.`
`"You're right.`
` ......If the same fate were repeated a hundred times, maybe you and I could get into a relationship like this only one of those times.`
` In the other instances, even though we'd be aware of each other, maybe we would've only maintained a reserved relationship after all this time.`
` From the perspective of those other 'me's and 'you's, you and I are undoubtedly in a miraculous relationship right now."`
`"That's not what I meant...`
` ......It really was magic.`
` ...No matter how often you tell men something like this, they'll never believe it.`
` Kanon-kun didn't believe me at all either."`
`"...I believe you.`
` ......I'd hate for the magic to fade away because I didn't believe in it."`
`"George-sama..."`
`In a small voice, I apologized for saying something that trivialized her magic.`
`Shannon seemed to be glad to hear me say that.`
`After all, if two people believe in the magic of love, it becomes eternal.`
`"Oh, that's right.`
` I was wondering if you'd be willing to agree to a little whim of mine."`
`"...Yes?`
` What is it?"`
`"You call me 'George-sama', right?`
` It's not that I dislike it, but would you consider not calling me that anymore?"`
`"Of course, you have to keep up your appearance with the Ushiromiya family, so I wouldn't force you to do so during your everyday routine on Rokkenjima.`
` But, when we're alone, I'd rather you didn't call me that.`
` Yeah, let's make that a rule."`
`"A-A rule?`
` Wh-What would happen if I violated that rule...?"`
`"Hmm...`
` Maybe we should have some kind of punishment game if you break the rule.`
` ...Yes, what should it be...`
` ......Wanna hear?"`
`"N-No, I don't want to hear..."`
`"Ahahahahahaha.`
` I'll have to think about what it should be."`
`"Okay,`
` ......George`
`...san."`
`"...Yeah.`
` I love the way that sounds.`
` I'm so happy, `
`Shannon."`
`'!s1`
`I also...`
`...have another name.`
` ......It's Sayo."`
`"I see.`
` The rule's gotta be fair, after all.`
` I'll follow it too, and from now on, I'll call you Sayo.`
` Okay,`
` Sayo...?"`
`"Y-Yes."`
`I held her shoulder and drew her close.`
`When I forcefully pulled her delicate body towards me, she dove into my chest like a doll.`
`As I held her head in my arms, we both looked at the horizon.`
`"What a deep blue sea.`
` I'm so happy we got to look at this sea, just the two of us."`
`"......Me too.`
` I'm so glad to have a chance to look at this deep blue sea with you."`
`As we gazed at the gray sea and a light rain began to sprinkle down, `
`we kept listening to each other's heartbeats.`
`The sound of waves flows into my ears.`
`...No, it's the sound of an enraged sea.`
`My body, bathed in painfully cold splashes, does not allow me to forget.`
`It won't let me forget the memories of the day my old fate was broken and smashed.`
`Once, tomorrows were literally like looking into a mirror.`
`All I ever saw there was the person I already was.`
`......Tomorrow was absolutely no different from today.`
`That was my old fate.`
`...But then, for the first time, I saw a different fate beyond the mirror.`
`The witch whispers to me.`
`She tempts me to take a bite out of the fruit of knowledge.`
`She torments me, saying I'll be furniture as long as I stay in God's paradise.`
`So I decided to choose the path of knowing love...and tried to become a person.`
`...Those days were like sweet honey, `
`...but at the time, I didn't realize that they'd be the start of a new kind of suffering...`
`I've arrived at a small island on a motorboat I've only just learned how to use.`
`No, this can hardly be called a small island.`
` It's little more than a rock jutting out of the water.`
`On this rock...is a torii and a small shrine.`
`It was probably built to worship the guardian deity of Rokkenjima.`
`......Even though I don't know exactly what it signifies, I know it has to be something holy.`
`Even in a place like this, I've got to take just one more look around, to see if there's anyone who might get mad at me for coming.`
`......I see nothing but the stormy ocean, Niijima looming in the distance, and the waves breaking against Rokkenjima's steep cliffside.`
`I ready myself,`
` ...timidly approach the small shrine,`
` ...and take the mirror that lies there as an offering.`
`The mirror looks old, cloudy and dirty.`
`...That would probably make any normal mirror seem horribly cheap.`
`...However, since the mirror's been placed in this small shrine, its appearance seems to give some sort of divine quality to it.`
`......And there's one thing I can tell.`
`This is no simple mirror.`
`...It may seem like an old, battered mirror to a non-believer like myself, but it has a great significance.`
`......Is it really okay to break this after being captivated by honeyed words?`
`......No, this isn't really a mirror.`
`...This is the life I couldn't escape until today, my fate.`
`I'll break it.`
`I'll smash it...and seize the life that lies beyond this mirror.`
`If I don't smash it, my life will be a pair of facing mirrors forever.`
` Nothing will ever change in the slightest...`
`The witch whispers to me.`
`She tempts me to take a bite of the fruit of knowledge.`
`Or maybe I've already tasted of that fruit.`
`After all, I've already experienced those maddening emotions.`
`Just as Adam and Eve felt compelled to pluck their fig leaves...`
`I can no longer...`
`...go on without breaking this mirror.`
`I've struggled with conflicting emotions for many days before this moment.`
`Inside my heart, the virtuous part of me kept on fighting the part that sides with the witch.`
`And now, here I am.`
`Did the part of me that's here right now...win or lose?`
`There's only one thing I know.`
`To obtain something, you must be ready to lose something.`
`Cowards who don't risk anything, who never try to change anything, ...will never be given the key that opens the path to a new future.`
`That key is already in my hands.`
`And that key is...to break this.`
` To smash it.`
`Is there any other effort I can make, as furniture imprisoned in Rokkenjima?`
`No.`
` This is the only way for me.`
`Come, have courage.`
`I'll free myself from being mere furniture.`
`And by accepting a new kind of suffering, I'll become human.`
`This is surely a small...yet large trial I must impose on myself.`
`'!s0`
`!d1000`
`I'll smash to pieces...the eternally unchanging fate that imprisons me...!`
`I raise the mirror high...`
`...I think back on the days of conflict that came before...`
`...And, finishing my reflections in the blink of an eye,`
` ...`
`...`
`I throw it down.`
`The thunder roars, ...crying out against me for my outrageous act.`
`...It truly is the hatred of angels trying to banish me from eternal paradise.`
`I look down at the mirror tumbling at my feet, broken in two equal parts, `
`...and after making sure I've accomplished my task,`
` ......I scream up at the raging skies.`
`'………あなたが約束を守ってくれる番ですよね……？」`
`'!s1`
`I've kept...`
`...my promise...`
` ......Now,`
` ......it's your turn to keep yours, right...?"`
`Thunder roars once more.`
`...I've already been banished from paradise.`
`So I'll have to struggle on my own if I want to live.`
`The witch told me.`
` ~ib~That~ib~ is the single element of this world.`
`To lose it means losing the world.`
`...Like how a canteen with a hole in the bottom can't be filled, no matter how much water you pump into it...`
`"...I've kept my promise.`
` ......Now, it's your turn to keep yours.`
` ...Please, grant my wish,`
` Beatrice-samaaaaaa!!"`
`My mind wandered.`
`Back to the days when I could barely imagine the happiness I have now.`
`I was a middle schooler at the time.`
`A normal girl who thought about love as much as you'd expect of someone at that age.`
`But in truth, it was wrong of me to have that dream.`
`...After all, I am furniture.`
`Furniture is nothing more than a tool, not a human.`
`As a person less than human, simply receiving an education was an enormous blessing.`
`So in reality, even thinking about falling in love was more than I deserved...`
`The Ushiromiya family conference was a customary event held every October, `
`but relatives sometimes visited at other times.`
`...Of course, they didn't come just to drink tea.`
`On this day, Eva's family was visiting the Head Family on Rokkenjima.`
`The three members of Krauss's family and the three members of Eva's family had gathered in the parlor`
` and were having a friendly chat about recent events.`
`Genji had supposedly told Kinzo of Eva's family's arrival, but he still hadn't come down.`
`...He was probably immersed in his 'research' and couldn't spare the time.`
`This often happened, so the others waited patiently for their fickle father to arrive.`
`"Hoh.`
` How promising.`
` Make sure you work hard under your father, building the skills you'll need if you want to lend him a hand soon."`
`"Thank you very much.`
` I've learned countless precious things from the many experienced people Father has introduced me to.`
` And these were all things I could never have learned in school."`
`"When you're in school, it's not math and language you're learnin'.`
` What they're really teachin' you is the right outlook and attitude for learnin' more.`
` Once you've got that base, you can finally start a long period of study that'll last your entire life."`
`"People who don't get this end up spendin' their whole lives as fools who never learn.`
` Just gettin' full marks in math and language won't do you any good at your company!"`
`"Indeed, that is exactly right.`
` Hideyoshi-san, your style of education never fails to impress."`
`"George isn't quite a full man yet!`
` He'd better always keep that in mind and embrace his studies."`
`"Stop it, dear.`
` George is always giving it his all.`
` Right?"`
`"Truly admirable.`
` I wish our Jessica would learn from him..."`
`"...Sheesh.`
` Are you still holding a grudge about that test score?`
` I'm studying for tests the best I can.`
` At least don't say it here.`
` Pissing me off."`
`Once people started praising George for his diligence, the conversation usually turned to Jessica, who hated studying.`
`Jessica made an openly displeased face, as though she'd known this would happen.`
`"My, my...`
` Schoolwork aside, it seems Jessica had better learn to choose her words a little more gracefully.`
` How improper for the single daughter who bears the weight of the Ushiromiya family crest."`
`"Come now, she's quite appealing in her own way, isn't she?`
` Times change.`
` The time when we had to act all modest to entertain men ended long ago."`
`"That's right, that's right!`
` I knew you'd understand, Aunt Eva!`
` Eheheheh!"`
`"......Haah...`
` My headache is truly trying today."`
`"Are you okay?`
` Aunt Natsuhi, you're looking a bit pale."`
`"Thank you, I am fine.`
` ...Still, time really has flown.`
` It feels like just yesterday when you would run around half-naked by the beach and come back soaked."`
`"Wasn't your Jessica-chan the same?`
` And now she's a lady who fusses over how to put on makeup.`
` I see you've focused on your eyebrows. You look really cute today."`
`"Thank you very much.`
` No one noticed, so I was a bit unsure of myself."`
`A full smile rose to Jessica's face as the results of her own 'studies' were finally appreciated.`
`Eva smiled back in the same way.`
` ...Then, she turned that smile towards Natsuhi.`
`"Come on, Natsuhi nee-san.`
` You must take notice of small changes in your own child.`
` Poor Jessica-chan.`
` You probably wanted your mother to notice first, didn't you?"`
`"No problem, no problem.`
` That person never notices anything."`
`"Jessica,`
` I cannot condone you speaking of your mother in such a fashion.`
` Apologize."`
`"...Later, I will speak to you at length about your language."`
`"Tch...`
` If you don't want kids getting in your way, just say so.`
` I'm gonna take a step outside.`
` It's getting stuffy in here."`
`"Jessica...!"`
`Jessica was still at the age where tests and entrance exams are pretty nerve-racking.`
`Recently, she'd clashed often with her mother, who was enthusiastic about her education.`
`"Excuse me...`
` Kya?!"`
`Jessica, who was trying to leave the parlor in a bad mood, bumped into Shannon, who was pushing a serving cart filled with tea.`
`"Ah, Shannon. No need to worry about my tea.`
` I'm just gonna go wander around the garden."`
`"...M-Milady..."`
`"Shannon, the tea is getting cold.`
` Serve it quickly."`
`"M-My apologies..."`
`Shannon hadn't actually done anything wrong,`
` but Natsuhi, who felt like something shameful to herself had been shown, lashed out at her emotionally.`
`...This was something that often happened in the Ushiromiya family.`
`But it seemed Shannon wasn't strong-willed enough to just accept it and move on.`
`She shrank back and cowered while serving the tea.`
`She had the unfortunate habit of making more mistakes when she cowered.`
`Her pitiful appearance ruined the peaceful atmosphere that had existed a moment before.`
`It wasn't really Shannon's fault, but she thought she might be the source and felt a pressure on her chest.`
`Her shaking fingers made the utensils clang, and you couldn't have called it graceful, not even just to be polite.`
`The more pitiful she appeared, the greater the silence grew,`
` the more irritated Natsuhi looked, and the more Shannon cowered...`
`Shannon's thin neck felt like it was being suffocated and choked by the reaper known as stress.`
`At that time, George spoke brightly, blowing away the stiff atmosphere.`
`"This smells nice.`
` What kind of black tea is it?"`
`"Umm, `
`......this is..."`
`"No, don't say it.`
` I'll guess.`
` It's a very distinctive smell, so I probably know it.`
` ...Is it Earl Grey?"`
`"I-I think it probably is..."`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` Yeah, I'll bet it's Earl Grey.`
` When you get back to the kitchen, check the tin."`
`"Hoh.`
` George-kun, you know a lot about black tea, don't you?"`
`"One of the company presidents who's looked after me was very knowledgeable about black tea.`
` I managed to pick up a little while listening to him discuss the subject."`
`"Oh yeah, the president of Okonogi Foods.`
` Yep, that sort of trivia is that guy's specialty!"`
`"The names of black teas often refer to the places they're made, right?`
` So, did this come from a place with that name?"`
`"From what I've heard, there was a person called Earl Grey in England long ago, and it was named after him.`
` Furthermore, this distinctive smell doesn't come from tea leaves, but from a fruit called a bergamot, which is a relative of the mandarin orange."`
`"Is that so?`
` I never knew that.`
` Learning things like that makes tea taste all the more delicious."`
`"Same thing goes for alcohol and cigarettes.`
` Luxury items have a taste of romance.`
` Knowin' stuff like this deepens the taste."`
`"It's the same as reading the list of benefits on a medicine bottle.`
` Natsuhi nee-san, you should try reading the explanation on your favorite headache medicine someday.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Hahahaha!`
` That's a wonderful idea.`
` Try it tonight."`
`"...Yes, I'll do so."`
`"Shannon-chan, try opening that pot.`
` You should find some dried bergamot mixed in with the tea leaves."`
`"Ah, ...yes.`
` It's in there.`
` Something like dried orange peel is mixed in."`
`"Yes.`
` That's probably bergamot.`
` The main ingredient in Earl Grey's scent.`
` The scent is vivid, so you might expect the taste to be intense, but it's still gentle and easy to drink.`
` If you make it with milk, the scent should become more mild, which works great.`
` If there's anything left in the pot after you've poured for everyone, you really should try drinking it with milk."`
`"Ah, ...yes...`
` Thank you very much..."`
`George gave her a small wink.`
`Shannon finally realized that George had kindheartedly swept aside the tense atmosphere in the room.`
` And he had done it for the sake of Shannon herself, a cowering servant.`
`The Ushiromiya family did not pamper their servants.`
`Any display of awkwardness would be harshly punished.`
`So it was rare for them to be given a helping hand like this.`
`Thanks to George's kindness, Shannon managed to regain control of herself and finished serving tea without further incident.`
`As long as she stayed calm, she could carry out her work elegantly and flawlessly.`
`By the time the black tea was laid out on the table and its elegant scent filled the room,`
` the atmosphere had completely returned to its former peaceful mood, and everyone praised George's knowledge.`
`Shannon wanted to thank him for saving her, but it didn't look like she would get the chance.`
`So she decided to at least thank him inside her heart, praying to God that George would hear it as she pushed the serving cart away.`
`"George nii-san always lends a helping hand at times like that.`
` By changing the topic or something."`
`Shannon and Jessica were in the rose garden.`
`Jessica still hadn't returned to the parlor after getting into a fight with her mother and was nonchalantly killing time here.`
`"...When I think back on it, I get the feeling this wasn't the first time he's helped me like that."`
`Whenever I made a careless mistake and George was around,`
` I'm pretty sure he'd always naturally smooth things over and restore harmony.`
`...Maybe it wasn't something as direct as picking up a fork that had been dropped.`
`But that was his way of caring.`
`Even servants have their pride.`
` They want to fix their own mistakes by themselves.`
`...And if a guest lends them a hand, they'll lose face.`
`"He's really good at reading between the lines when stuff like that happens.`
` Well, I guess it's kind of like an art to him.`
` That guy's more of a show-off than he looks.`
` Ahahahahaha."`
`"Th-That's not true...`
` ...I think he's a really wonderful person."`
`"Hmmmm...?!`
` ...Shannon, you haven't fallen in love with George nii-san, have you?"`
`For once, Shannon had disagreed with Jessica in a slightly forceful tone, which immediately caught Jessica's attention.`
`"No, ...that's not it, I think......"`
`"Come to think of it, I've hardly heard any stories about George nii-san and love.`
` Hmm?`
` I think I remember hearing him say that family-oriented girls were his type, didn't I?`
` Sweet, that fits you perfectly, Shannon!"`
`"I-I-It does...?!`
`'!s1`
` ...I am not, uh, `
`...suitable for such a thing..."`
`"Not suitable? Like hell you aren't!`
` You've known him so long, you're practically a childhood friend.`
` They say that when you start from a natural relationship where you don't think of the other as a member of the opposite sex, things start to move pretty fast once you finally start thinking about it.`
` There's no doubt!"`
`Jessica loved teen magazines with this kind of story, and she was always getting excited talking about that kind of thing with her friends.`
`She was very quick to pick up on love stories like this.`
`So this wasn't the first time Shannon had been exposed to this kind of story.`
`But this certainly was the first time she'd started thinking of George as a member of the opposite sex.`
`She was furniture, while George was an honored guest and a member of the Ushiromiya family.`
`...Until now, she'd assumed that even imagining any deeper relationship with him would be impermissible.`
`So she hadn't thought of it.`
`Since it was someone else's problem, Jessica poked fun at it, seeming to enjoy herself.`
`It was all Shannon could do to hide her blushing cheeks.`
`If George were to appear at a time like that, she'd have no chance of keeping her cool.`
`They saw George come out from the entrance hall of the mansion.`
`It looked like he'd seen them as well.`
`He headed over, waving his hand.`
`Shannon had to frantically try and regain her ordinary composure before George reached them...`
`"Grandfather finally came down.`
` Now they're having an adult discussion, so they chased me out."`
`"Hahaha, escaping then was the right choice.`
` It'd be better to kiss the angel of death than look at Grandfather's face."`
`"You shouldn't speak that way.`
` ...But you know, I think Grandfather might think of us as angels of death.`
` After all, we came here to talk about borrowing money for business reasons."`
`That's right, this wasn't the customary annual October family conference.`
`Eva's family had visited to apply for a business loan from the Head Family.`
`Kinzo had vast resources, and he lent those out to his children.`
`Of course, they didn't borrow money because they were living in poverty.`
`...How would they expand their businesses with the vast sums they wanted to borrow?`
`How much interest would be attached, and how long would they have to repay it?`
`This wasn't the sort of loan designed for the poor.`
` It was a loan for those who were on the offensive.`
`Kinzo strictly judged whether it would be worth lending out his fortune, and afterwards, he strictly oversaw its use.`
`So Rokkenjima would sometimes play host to this spectacle, where relatives visited and described their businesses to Kinzo.`
`To the parents, these meetings burdened them with the strain of having to move a vast amount of money.`
`But to Jessica, who lived on this isolated island called Rokkenjima, it was a precious opportunity to meet up with her cousins.`
`So being able to talk with the occasional guest such as George like this...`
`immediately cured the bad mood she'd gotten from that fight with her mother.`
`"My family's totally stingy too.`
` They've probably got money to spare, so why not lend it out graciously?`
` Dad and Grandfather'll probably get pigheaded and act all important."`
`"It's natural to be prudent when lending money.`
` Of course, my father will use what he borrows to expand his business, and he came with a plan that promises a solid probability of repayment.`
` Everything else is left up to the presentation.`
` ...But I really wish I could watch from the corner and learn.`
` Mother chased me out.`
` I'm a little let down."`
`"...It seems the Master still tends to scold Krauss-sama and Eva-sama as if they were kids.`
` I'm sure she didn't want to let her son see that."`
`As Shannon hung her head, she thought back on a scene familiar to those who worked in the mansion.`
`Even Krauss, who acted haughtily towards his siblings, was still treated like a child by Kinzo.`
`...Shannon herself had often seen Kinzo slap Krauss and tell him to sit up straight.`
`......It was probably very embarrassing to be coerced like that at his age.`
`Taking care to avoid being present at times like that...was one of the important responsibilities held by the servants working here.`
`...However, the fact that Shannon had ended up witnessing such a scene...meant that she'd messed up at least once in the past.`
`"Yes, I imagine so.`
` ...Maybe figuring that out and staying away is part of a child's duty.`
` ......Aaah!`
` That aside, the flowers in this garden are truly splendid this year."`
`George stretched as he said that.`
`...And he smoothly changed the subject away from one that was a little gloomy.`
`This time, Shannon noticed it too.`
`......This person, George, could sensitively figure out the situation, and always changed the subject to something harmonious out of kindness.`
`It was so smooth that Shannon hadn't noticed it until today.`
`Today, Shannon really had to admire the way George did that.`
`Of the boys close to Shannon's age that she'd known, nearly all had been classmates during her period of mandatory education.`
`But they had all been young...and none had possessed the composure George had.`
`Mere moments ago, he'd been just another guest,`
` ...but right now, she couldn't help but think of him as something more.`
`However, such thoughts were mere distractions from her work as a servant.`
`Shannon tried to chase them away with a small shake of her head.`
`"Hmm?`
` What's up?"`
`"Ah, no, it's nothing...!`
` Umm, shall I make some tea?`
` Uh, ......I will prepare some more of that Earl Grey."`
`"Ahaha, so you've remembered the name of that tea.`
` I'm glad."`
`"Um, .........umm........."`
`"Hmm?"`
`"...Umm, ......thank you for your concern back then..."`
`Shannon was finally able to put her gratitude into words.`
`If you wrote it out, it wouldn't be very long,`
` ...but Shannon had needed a little spark of courage to say it out loud.`
`But George played dumb.`
`"What do you mean?`
` I don't remember doing anything I should be thanked for.`
` Heheh."`
`He seemed to be playing the gentleman in his own way, letting her know he wasn't doing it out of a desire for gratitude.`
`George's response seemed to be more or less exactly what Jessica had predicted.`
` She couldn't help but burst out laughing.`
`"See?`
` Isn't he a bit of a show-off at times like this?"`
`"N-No...`
` That's not......"`
`Jessica poked fun at Shannon as the latter remained silent, red-faced.`
`George didn't know the details, but he naturally joined in, laughing the same way.`
`The three of them lazily walked around the garden, catching up on recent events.`
`George, as the oldest cousin, talked about his life experiences.`
`Jessica talked about recent life on Rokkenjima.`
`And Shannon talked about her recent work.`
`They kept going on about these trivial things.`
`Even when Shannon heard the others talk about deeply interesting things,`
` she never felt any particular interest in the actual content of their stories.`
`She was nothing more than a servant, and she had no intention of delving into her masters' lives.`
`She simply wanted them to enjoy their time speaking with her...`
`and would only pretend to listen intently and nod at the right moments.`
`But for some reason, the things George talked about today seemed to catch her interest powerfully.`
`Even things she'd normally ignore felt like they contained a trace of kindness behind the words.`
`For some reason, she wanted to know more things about George, no matter how trivial.`
`So, ...she stared fixedly at him.`
`She thought that as far as looks went, this Ushiromiya George...`
`was probably about average and didn't stick out in any particular way.`
`But he was diligent, serious, ...and had a deep prudence which allowed him to understand people's hearts and show concern.`
`But she'd never noticed these things before now.`
`She may not have met him many times, but she'd known his face for many years.`
`Even so, she hadn't noticed once until now.`
`...Shannon, embarrassed by her own obliviousness, blushed.`
`George, perhaps thinking that Shannon would listen intently to his stories, kept talking happily and at length about things he'd done and seen.`
`...But Jessica didn't miss that slight change in Shannon.`
`So, she decided she'd change the conversation to the topic she was sure Shannon was most interested in.`
`"...Oh yeah, come to think of it,`
` George nii-san, have you finally gotten a girlfriend, or what?"`
`"Wh-Where did that come from...?"`
`Normally, that reaction should've been answer enough.`
`But for some reason, as she was now, Shannon wouldn't be able to understand it unless he said it clearly.`
`"U-Umm...`
` George-sama is very nice, `
`......so I'm sure...`
`...umm, ...he's very popular..."`
`"Well, err, ...hahahahahahahahahaha."`
`"Quit it Shannon.`
` Isn't cornering him like that actually pretty mean?`
` Heheheh!"`
`"I-I wasn't trying to be mean........."`
`"Well, I'm flattered that you have that mistaken impression of me,`
` but unfortunately, I still haven't had a relationship with any particular girl.`
` After all, my looks are below average, as you can see.`
` And I can't speak tactfully in a way that can entertain a girl."`
`"I-I don't think that's true.`
` ...And, I think a man's charm is decided by something that can't be measured by his appearance.`
` Th-That's why, umm,`
` ...I think you might be considered a...um...a very attractive man, George-sama..."`
`Shannon was being uncharacteristically verbose.`
`She hardly ever spoke at such length.`
`George seemed fairly pleased to hear someone applaud his charm like this, but he was just a little surprised at this sudden high praise.`
`Jessica, now sure her guess was spot on, appeared to be barely holding back laughter.`
`"Thank you, Shannon-chan.`
` I hope I do bump into a girl who's generous enough to feel attracted to me before too long."`
`"Yes, I'm sure you'll run into one.`
` ......I'm sure there's at least one...`
`...no, a l-lot of girls who will recognize your real charm."`
`She probably wanted to say that there was at least one girl very close to him.`
`...Shannon avoided saying that much, drawing a final line as a servant.`
`"...R-Really?`
` ...I guess I'm kind of...embarrassed..."`
`He had probably never been praised this heavily by a girl before.`
`George's face turned just as bright red as Shannon's.`
`As she watched the two of them, Jessica giggled sadistically.`
`"Well, I'm sure you'll eventually bump into a wonderful partner, George nii-san,`
` but I doubt you'll be able to properly escort your partner as you are now, right?`
` It looks like you're diligent, but you've completely abandoned your study of 'that'."`
`"...S-Sorry about that.`
` I'll start studying that bit by bit."`
`"And how do you plan to do that all by yourself?`
` Are you gonna watch romance movies or something?`
` Or are you gonna learn from Uncle Hideyoshi?`
` Heheheheh!"`
`"Tch...`
` Well, you're acting pretty triumphant.`
` Men are no match for girls when it comes to this sort of thing."`
`Normally, when George and Jessica got together, their parents would say 'George is diligent and admirable', and 'Jessica is lazy and rude'.`
`So it was probably unbearable fun for Jessica to have their roles finally reversed.`
`George realized this as well, so he resigned himself to being the one getting teased for once.`
`"So, George nii-san, as long as you're okay with it, why not practice a bit with Shannon?`
` It'll be your job to keep Shannon entertained all day long on a date!`
` What do you think?!"`
`"Wh-Wh-What are you...?!`
` M-Milady...!"`
`When she heard Jessica's audacious plan, Shannon's face turned bright red with a 'poof', and a doughnut of smoke started to rise from her head.`
`"Th-That's a very tempting plan, ...but I wouldn't want to burden Shannon-chan.`
` It'd just end up wasting one of her precious days off, wouldn't it?`
` I'd be butting in on that sacred time that she should be spending alone with someone she really likes.`
` I couldn't do something so boorish."`
`"I-I-I also, umm, `
`......don't have a person I have feelings for or anything, so, umm, `
`...there's no...no, yes, there's no need to hold back for my sake...!"`
`Shannon's blood had all rushed to her head, and it looked like even she didn't know what she was babbling about.`
`Jessica, who knew how Shannon normally was, seemed to be finding this hilarious.`
`She couldn't hide her cackling laughter anymore.`
`"...I-Is that true...?`
` I can't believe a cute girl like you would be single, Shannon-chan..."`
`'!s1`
`am a servant, so, umm, `
`......of course I don't have any relationships with boys, umm..."`
`"Which means that, if Shannon ever wants a chance at getting herself a wonderful guy,`
` she needs practice with relationships too, right?`
` So you both want the same thing.`
` Sweet, that'll be perfect, heheh!"`
`Jessica irresponsibly cheered the two of them on.`
`By now, even George was hanging his head and turning red.`
`"George, I've been calling to you for a while now.`
` Didn't you hear me?"`
`When Eva appeared in what was already an embarrassing situation, both of them got even more flustered.`
` Jessica watched and laughed loudly.`
`"Ah, M-M-Mother...!`
` Sorry, I was so engrossed in our conversation.`
` I didn't notice...!"`
`"Oh, Eva-sama, ...you have my deepest apologies..."`
`"It looks like you young kids are getting really fired up together.`
` You're all about that age.`
` Oh, I know how kids your age can talk about that sort of thing forever.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Ah, come on, you're still young yourself, Aunt Eva.`
` Please tell us how you and Uncle Hideyoshi met."`
`"Oh my, there's no way I could say that.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*`
` You all really are so young.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"S-So, what is it, Mother?`
` You called because you wanted something, right?"`
`"Your father and the rest have finished talking.`
` We're going to talk to Grandfather about you, so come on."`
`"About me?`
` What could that be?"`
`"The same thing you were all talking about just now.`
` You know what I mean, right?"`
`"O-Oh, that.`
` That isn't really something we need to talk to Grandfather about, right...?"`
`"What's going on?`
` Wait, George nii-san, are you getting married?!"`
`"C-Congratulations...!"`
`"No, no...!`
` Didn't I just say I didn't have a particular woman I was interested in?"`
`"That isn't something to brag about, is it?`
` ...Good grief."`
`Eva smiled bitterly, looking a little exasperated.`
`"...Oh, ...I get it!`
` George nii-san, it's one of those, right? An 'omiai', a marriage meeting!"`
`"A marriage meeting, ...you say?"`
`"......Nng, ......well, yeah.`
` ......Hahahaha..."`
`Surely, as a man, George wanted to find a partner by himself and bring her home with him.`
`So it seemed he thought it a bit pathetic to meet his partner for the first time in a marriage meeting arranged by his parents.`
`"Shouldn't marriage meetings be done at a more mature age...?!`
` I still don't feel like I've become a full-fledged adult..."`
`"Of course, we have no desire to rush into an immediate engagement or marriage, right?`
` There's nothing wrong with deepening your friendship first, and then having her moved to our family register after you've gotten older and settled down."`
`Judging by Eva's forceful attitude and George's noncommittal one, the others could catch a glimpse of the story behind this marriage meeting.`
`They didn't know who George was supposed to be meeting, but it was surely someone who would profit Eva's family in a business sense.`
`The very fact that they'd be satisfied with a mere engagement to deepen the relationship between the two families, rather than an immediate marriage, made it feel almost like a political maneuver.`
`"You see, marriage isn't something you should enter into only after you start liking someone.`
` You marry first, and then you adjust.`
` If you marry based purely on emotions, you'll always end up regretting it.`
` There's certainly nothing wrong with choosing a person with a secure background for your partner in life, and then developing your affection later."`
`"Aunt Eva, isn't that kinda rude to Uncle Hideyoshi?`
` Heheh!"`
`"I love that man.`
` I want to always be with him, and to live my life by his side."`
`"......Eva-sama, that's wonderful.`
` Truly splendid..."`
`"Thank you.`
` But we built up those feelings while we were husband and wife, you see?`
` And I believe that in the future, we will be much, much closer than we are now.`
` I think that's what's best for a married couple."`
`"Still, I don't think you can use that to argue that it's okay to marry someone you don't even like."`
`"But it also doesn't mean that it's okay to marry anyone, as long as you like them.`
` It only takes an instant to get married, `
`but your life as a married couple will last a long, long time after that.`
` So you should search with prudence and avoid making decisions based on momentary emotions.`
` Don't you think a matter like this would be better handled by us, rather than a person lacking in life experience such as yourself?"`
`"...Th-That may be true, but..."`
`"I'm proud of you, my only son.`
` You've grown magnificently, and I'm sure you'll do us proud no matter where you go.`
` ...And now that Battler-kun has left the family register, you are Father's only male grandchild carrying his blood.`
` ......We must prudently choose a fitting partner for you."`
`As everyone related to the Ushiromiya family knew, Eva adored George immensely.`
`But that didn't mean she had pampered him.`
`She had been strict with him and had raised him into a wonderful boy who wouldn't betray her expectations.`
` ...That was why she treasured him so.`
`"Your partner certainly won't be selected based on your parents' profit and loss.`
` ...I'll bring you a suitable and truly wonderful woman.`
` At this moment, your immaturity might make this seem unpleasant to you.`
` ......But if you're going to take my advice on anything, listen to me now.`
` Have I ever failed to act in your best interest?"`
`"..................No, ......you haven't..."`
`"That's enough for now.`
` So, let's go.`
` We're keeping Father waiting.`
` Hurry to the mansion."`
`"Well, sorry, you two.`
` See you later."`
`George bowed to the two of them, ...and after bowing once more to Shannon, he dashed off to the mansion.`
`"I'll be going with him.`
` Forgive me for interrupting such an entertaining conversation, Jessica-chan, Shannon-chan."`
`"N-No, no.`
` Please, don't worry about it.`
` Come on, Shannon.`
` Let's go."`
`"Y-Yes...!"`
`"It's okay.`
` I'm sure you'll meet someone wonderful soon too, Jessica-chan.`
` A wonderful person suitable for you."`
`"So, if he's at the same level as me, hahaha, you mean a guy with shit grades?`
` That kinda pisses me off, hahaha!"`
`"And of course, you too, Shannon-chan.`
` I'm sure that a wonderful man suitable for you will appear."`
`"Y-Yes!!`
` Thank you very much..."`
`As Eva giggled and smiled, she approached Shannon's ear with a hand over her mouth, as though she was trying to tell her a secret.`
`"......Huh?"`
`"I'm sure you'll find a perfect match for a lowly servant like yourself.`
` ......Have you forgotten to be grateful for your education?`
` Know your place."`
`"......Th-That's not what......I meant..."`
`"George is the eldest grandson carrying Father's blood.`
` He's a person who may bear the burden of the Ushiromiya family someday in the future.`
` To answer to that expectation, he has studied tirelessly, entered a wonderful college, and is getting wonderful grades.`
` Did you really think you could snatch George away, you uneducated, incompetent, unqualified, uncultured servaaaant?"`
`Those malicious words all poured into Shannon's ear without spilling a drop...`
`......To Shannon, it was like cold water was being poured in there.`
`"............I-I...`
`...didn't mean..."`
`This was all whispered to Shannon in secret.`
`And with the same smile as before.`
`...Jessica, who could only see Eva's expression, didn't think it was anything other than Eva telling Shannon some embarrassing story about love.`
`When their secret conversation ended, Eva patted Shannon's shoulders, as though she was urging her on.`
`"Don't worry, `
`I'm sure you'll find a 'perfect' match for a partner.`
` Right?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*`
` ...Okay, Jessica-chan.`
` See you later."`
`"Yeah, see you later.`
` And make sure you tell me about you and Uncle Hideyoshi next time!!"`
`"No waaay.`
` Ahahahahahahahahaha...!"`
`Eva laughed loudly and headed back to the entrance hall.`
`Behind Jessica, who was cheerfully waving her hand,`
` ...Shannon reflected very, very deeply on those words of Eva's about knowing her place...`
`...It's time for me to take a serious look...at how full of myself I've been acting.`
`I forgot.`
` I'm furniture.`
`Furniture isn't human.`
`So, I am a being who must feel gratitude for even being treated like a human,`
` and I am not permitted to wish for anything more.`
`People sometimes develop affection for furniture they're used to using, `
`but that is an emotion on the human's side, and the furniture has no right to hope for such a thing.`
`...It's enough that furniture serves with simple honesty day after day.`
`That feeling I got when talking to George-sama and Jessica-sama...is the same as a forbidden drug to me.`
`In other words, it may be an emotion I must never experience.`
`"...Shannon,`
` you've had your head in the clouds for some time now.`
` Do you not feel well?"`
`"N-No.`
` My apologies..."`
`Natsuhi's words were right on the mark.`
`Even Shannon couldn't believe that she hadn't noticed Natsuhi until she had called.`
`Normally, it was essential that she focus on her cleaning at this time of day.`
`But she'd spent all her time sighing and hardly making any progress...`
`"Even when there aren't any guests around, you must always be alert.`
` Behavior like this is shameful for an Ushiromiya Family servant."`
`"...Yes Ma'am.`
` I will take care...from now on..."`
`"The Head and my husband will return very soon.`
` Have you finished cleaning the study?`
` Have you finished cleaning the staircase?"`
`"M-My apologies...`
` Not yet..."`
`"Yes, I know.`
` So I had Lunon do it.`
` While you were plodding around, cleaning the hallway, she finished cleaning the study and the staircase."`
`"...That's because, umm, `
`...I wanted to clean it properly, so it took some time..."`
`Shannon was simple and honest, so she would always carry out her tasks seriously and properly, without any omissions.`
`So, she was always slow with her work.`
`In contrast, Lunon cleverly avoided doing extra work whenever it was possible.`
`So, she could complete her jobs with a result that looked almost the same to an outsider, but in a much shorter time.`
` In other words, she was a shrewd employee.`
`Compared to that, it's probably fair to say that Shannon wasn't very shrewd at all, talking back to Natsuhi when Natsuhi was in a bad mood...`
`Of course, there was nothing that Natsuhi couldn't stand more than a servant talking back.`
`Her forehead creased, and she spoke sternly.`
`And yet, her slow, admonishing style of speech was even more terrifying, and finally made Shannon realize she had said the wrong thing...`
`"Then perhaps you should aim to do a truly thorough cleaning.`
` Shannon, I order you to clean the reception hall right now.`
` It is an important hall, where several pictures treasured by the Head are displayed, and where honored guests of the Ushiromiya family are welcomed.`
` Clean it thoroughly, so that not a speck of dust remains, and so that even you are satisfied.`
` Of course, you will finish before the day is out.`
` Until you finish that and report to me, you will not be permitted any food or rest.`
` Understood?"`
`"......Y-Yes, Madam."`
`"That is good.`
` Servants should endeavor to only use those words.`
` The next time you talk back, your punishment will be even more severe, so with that in mind,`
` engrave these words into your heart."`
`"Yes, ...Madam.`
` ...Thank you for your guidance."`
`"You are welcome."`
`Behaving as though her headache was troubling her, Natsuhi headed off down the corridor...`
`When she couldn't see her anymore, Shannon hung her head and sighed.`
`...This was what happened when she had her head in the clouds.`
`Even though I'm bad at everything I do, I should be able to at least carry out the cleaning as well as an average person can, right?`
` It's because I can't even perform that very well...that I'm crying so pathetically.`
`But what's even more shameful...`
`Is that, not only have I been unable to perform a single bit of cleaning well,`
` but just now, when Natsuhi was scolding me, `
`...I imagined that person appearing and rescuing me.`
`If only George-sama were here.`
`Would he casually step in and save me?`
`Surely he'd show up cheerfully, intentionally acting like he didn't know what was going on, `
`nimbly change the subject, and make me forget I'd ever been rebuked by Natsuhi...`
`I kept envisioning him...`
`suddenly appearing from the other side of the door,`
` or the other end of the hallway.`
`I envisioned the kind of person that would be an appropriate partner for him in a marriage meeting.`
`And I envisioned how unfitting I was for him.`
`Eva clearly told me.`
` It's been repeating over and over in my dreams...`
`"......You're still as clumsy as always, Nee-san.`
` Milady has been in a bad mood since this morning.`
` That just now happened because you talked too much, when you should've just hung your head in silence."`
`"...Kanon-kun..."`
`Kanon was suddenly there.`
`...His footsteps were always quieter than a cat's, and he never left any trace of his presence.`
`He probably could've stood there forever, and she still wouldn't have noticed him...`
`The expression on Kanon's face was...one of hatred.`
`He made that expression for Shannon, who didn't know how to do it herself...`
`"Madam and Lunon can fall into hell.`
` That person knows where Madam checks and only cleans those areas.`
` Her cleaning just now was like that.`
` I know because I saw.`
` ......She wasn't really cleaning.`
` ...She's just the worst kind of parasite, leeching off your thorough cleaning."`
`"You mustn't use such dirty words...`
` Dirty words pollute your clean soul, Kanon-kun.`
` So at least don't use those words in front of me.`
` ...Okay?"`
`"......Hmph."`
`Kanon turned away as though sulking.`
`It was a reaction that hid his true feelings, which was very like Kanon, ...but I was a little happy.`
`He was getting mad for my sake.`
`"...Cleaning the reception hall will be tough.`
` I'll help."`
`"Thank you.`
` But I was the one Madam ordered, so don't worry.`
` ...Don't you also have your own work, Kanon-kun?"`
`"......It's a filthy job.`
` My soul was polluted long ago."`
`Kanon then hung his head and bit his lower lip...`
`"Just hearing you say you'll help is enough for me.`
` ...If you don't go back to your own job, then you'll be punished as well.`
` ...And that would make me sad."`
`Shannon knew Kanon's character well.`
` ...Sometimes, he didn't think enough about himself.`
`If I don't refuse forcefully, he'll help me even if it means neglecting his own job...`
`Kanon was a little sad that his goodwill had been rejected,`
` but he realized that what he was doing would only hurt her more in the end, and he gave a single, small sigh.`
`".........`
`...Understood.`
` ...Do your best, Nee-san."`
`"Yes.`
` ......And I am also partly to blame."`
`"You aren't at fault at all, Nee-san...!"`
`"...No.`
` I am.`
` ...So go now."`
`Kanon-kun's face showed that he still hadn't completely accepted it, but without being any more obstinate, he disappeared.`
`......Even though Kanon-kun came to give me words of comfort when I was down...`
`Even so, I was dejected again because it wasn't 'him'.`
`That in itself...was a sin.`
`It went far beyond any dream the likes of me could be permitted to see.`
` I don't know my place.`
`...Shannon, who had neglected breakfast, already felt her concentration begin to waver.`
`...But if she didn't finish up cleaning the reception hall, she wouldn't receive Natsuhi's permission to eat.`
`That cruel Natsuhi had surely told the kitchen something to that effect.`
`...I have to respectfully receive Madam's punishment.`
`That's right.`
` My position in the world is furniture, ...and I've been intoxicated by a dream that's beyond me...`
`I finished cleaning the hallway and went to the reception hall.`
`Maybe my hunger made my nose more sensitive.`
`I could sense a delicious aroma wafting from the kitchen, even though it was far away, and my empty stomach was encouraged even more.`
`...Until I finished up here, I wouldn't get any soup.`
` I just had to resolve myself to doing it.`
`Several portraits were hung in the reception hall.`
`One of those portraits...was thought to hold a special meaning amongst the servants.`
`...It was the portrait of the witch.`
`That wasn't its true name, but everyone in the mansion called it that.`
`The name of the woman with elegant blonde hair, drawn as the subject of that portrait, was Beatrice.`
`...It was whispered that she might be the former mistress of Kinzo, the Family Head.`
`......And also that she was the great witch who had given Kinzo the gold of the legend.`
`The witch, Beatrice, master of the night on Rokkenjima.`
`She was gracious to those who respected her, but she would surely curse those who made light of her.`
`It was in Shannon's character not to neglect rules and beliefs such as those.`
`...So she thought of the portrait of her other master as that person herself, and always treated it carefully, treasuring it.`
`...And it had become part of her daily routine to tell the witch, who only existed inside the portrait, the secrets of her heart.`
`...She was furniture.`
`Furniture doesn't complain.`
` Cannot complain.`
`So she had no right to speak her mind about her difficult days.`
` She had no right to open her mouth and say those words.`
`So, ...she at least spoke her mind inside her heart.`
`She spoke her mind inside her heart, using words she couldn't say aloud, ...and protested to the formless witch.`
`Of course, the witch didn't answer.`
`She didn't console, and she didn't laugh it off.`
`...Shannon could only interpret that silence as she liked, as though the witch was responding agreeably.`
`...Beatrice-sama.`
`...Please listen to the story of my worthless self.`
`As Shannon wiped the dust from the witch's portrait, she spoke that inside her heart.`
`......I certainly am incompetent and uncultured, just as Eva-sama said.`
`...I am not a person.`
`...So maybe I have no right to love...`
`...But in that case, why was I given a heart that can know love?`
`...At that point, Shannon held back her tears for a moment.`
`The sound of the rain, which had started falling, along with the chill air in the reception hall, made her feel as though her shabbiness had increased another level.`
`"Real furniture...doesn't have anything like a heart.`
` So they don't have to love people, right?`
` So they don't feel pain.`
` ...If I'm just another piece of furniture, ...why do I have a heart?`
` ......If it's going to be this painful and this harsh, ......I wish I was never given a heart like this......!"`
`......I see.`
` So, a heart was given to furniture.`
` It would seem that even that man is capable of some quite amusing things, every now and then...`
` *cackle*cackle*...!`
`"Wha............"`
`'!s0`
`answered...`
`...and laughed.`
`Was it my imagination?`
` Was I hearing things?`
` No, that's wrong.`
`...After all, the next words became a 'voice', and I could hear them, not with my heart, but with my ears...`
`"Humans have continually searched for the elements that make up the world, since before the modern era.`
` It is said that in ancient times, the Greeks tried explaining the world with the four elements of wind, fire, water, and earth.`
` And after that, over several millennia, humans added several elements to those four,`
` trying to explain the world with several interpretations such as the five elements, the six elements, the seven elements, the eight elements, and the twelve elements, `
`but they were never able to describe the one sole truth that exists, the 'single element'."`
`"......However, a single man appeared by the guidance of a star...and finally explained the single element that makes up the world.`
` Know what it is...?"`
`'!s1`
`.........ah, `
`.........wh...`
`......wh-who........."`
`Shannon fearfully turned around...`
`Right there, ...she 'existed'.`
`Not as an illusion, but as a reality.`
`The contrast made by the lightning made it clear that this was no mere daydream.`
`"......It's 'love'.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch of the portrait elegantly held a golden pipe to her mouth and giggled.`
`...She laughed at the ignorance that causes humankind's thoughts to stray far from the most simple answer.`
`"That man explained everything in the world with love.`
` That is the single element.`
` That man fully explained how the world was constructed with the smallest possible number.`
` ...How simple and clear, how splendid, exhilarating, pleasant and thrilling.`
` ...The year that man was finally born is called the start of the modern era.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*!"`
`Shannon lost any words to speak.`
`She thought that when first meeting an unknown guest, her first words should be to ask that person's name.`
`But without saying anything, ...Shannon knew this person's name, so she refrained.`
`No, ...surely it would be the greatest disrespect for someone who lived or worked on this island to ask this woman her name.`
`After all, ...she was the other master of this island, besides Kinzo.`
`"...B-Beatrice-sama......"`
`"Indeed.`
` I am Beatrice.`
` ......Even after a thousand years, I see that people still always give me that look when we first meet.`
` ...*cackle*."`
`The witch giggled at how Shannon's reaction didn't betray her expectations.`
`Shannon realized that she had met with a being that mustn't be met with, and she took a step backwards.`
`...That's where the wall and the portrait were, so even as she gazed at the witch, the witch's portrait was touching her back.`
`"The source of your troubles is love.`
` ......Love, the single element that makes up this world.`
` In other words, it is everything in this world.`
` ......When it is lacking, then your world is lacking too.`
` It is no different than scooping water into a canteen with a hole in it.`
` ...Even if you scoop and scoop, that eternal desert of the heart never fills.`
` It is the original sin that humans are founded upon and everything is made of."`
`"Understand?`
` When Adam and Eve put the fruit of knowledge to their lips, love is what they learned of.`
` ...Because of that, humans were chased out of the garden and became fully 'human'.`
` Which means that knowing love and suffering is what makes one human.`
` ...You kind-hearted child.`
` You ought to be praised.`
` Now that you have gained this knowledge, you are no longer furniture.`
` You are now 'human'.`
` I recognize that with all the authority of my name."`
`".........Umm, ......uuu......"`
`"Hmph.`
` Is it hard for a common person to understand?`
` ...Very well then.`
` *cackle*cackle*...`
` Forgive me.`
` It has been a long time since I have spoken with a human.`
` Allow me to apologize for my talkativeness."`
`Without waiting for a reply from Shannon, Beatrice laughed pleasantly for a while.`
`"Perhaps this isn't much by way of an apology,`
` ...but I would be willing to grant that wish of yours with my power, if you so desire."`
`"...Huh...?"`
`The meaning of those words surprised Shannon even more than the witch's sudden appearance.`
`"I am offering to bring you and the one you love together.`
` ...Normally, I would demand something of equal value in return."`
`"...*cackle* However, I am in a good mood.`
` And you have never failed to pay your respects to me in the past.`
` That is something worth rewarding."`
`"......I-Is that true......?"`
`Normally, Shannon would've been shocked and struck dumb by this seemingly impossible guest.`
`......However, almost as though she was already under the witch's spell,`
` ...Shannon responded.`
`"With my magic, it would be no trouble at all to arrange for you to be joined with the one you love."`
`'Yes, of course.'`
` ...Shannon almost said that without thinking, but held back with her last bit of common sense.`
`After all, this is a witch.`
` A sinister being.`
`The witch Beatrice is clearly trying to slip in through the cracks in my heart and take me prisoner......`
`That sort of temptation, which so many fairy tale picture books warned me about when I was young, is right in front of me now.`
`"Fear is also a form of respect.`
` It may be pleasant for me, but we will make no progress this way."`
`"...I may not differ much from the image of a detestable witch that you hold in your mind.`
` However, I do bestow my favor upon those who respect me.`
` Aren't humans the same?`
`  Well, I doubt any human would bestow a favor upon one with such a hostile attitude."`
`"......M-My apologies...`
` I didn't mean..."`
`Shannon eventually realized how rude she was acting towards this guest.`
`And, ...she finally digested the words that had been spoken to her a short while ago.`
`'You are no longer furniture.`
` Now, you are "human".'`
`...As she reflected upon those words,`
` ...Shannon felt as though the witch understood all her worries...`
`"...What was that, umm, `
`...just now...`
`...about a reward?"`
`"I say that I can arrange for you to be joined with the man who has captured your heart.`
` Think of it as a sign of my gratitude for your diligence in polishing my portrait day after day."`
`"..............."`
`"Calm yourself. I ask for nothing in return.`
` I am generous.`
` ......However, though I ask for nothing in return, I do have a request."`
`Look, here it comes...`
`Part of Shannon's heart sent her a warning.`
`This is what all those scary picture books she'd read when she was little had warned her about......!`
`"Do you know of the small torii and shrine that have been constructed on the ocean very near this island, which you can see when you gaze at the cliffs...?"`
`...Shannon immediately remembered it.`
`When you reached Rokkenjima by boat, there was a torii and a shrine on a reef that was too small to be called even an islet.`
`I'm pretty sure Kumasawa-san told me its history, but I can't remember it well.`
`...A traveling shugenja, a kind of holy man, had built it or prayed there or something.`
`"...Yes, I know about it, `
`...but why do you bring it up......?"`
`"I will not explain everything including the very basics to one ignorant of demons.`
` Simply put, ...it's causing me trouble.`
` ...The truth is...there's a mirror kept inside that shrine.`
` I want you to break it."`
`It was quite a suspicious request.`
`Shannon didn't know the details, but anything stored inside a shrine would have to be something sacred.`
`...And she wants me to break it?`
`Why would a witch ask a human for help, instead of doing it herself...?`
`There was no need for Shannon to speak her thoughts aloud.`
`Beatrice responded to Shannon's reasonable doubt before Shannon could give her answer.`
`"The magical power of that mirror opposes my own.`
` ...I cannot explain it well with human words.`
` ...For example, let us speak of the differences between utensils.`
` That mirror is a fork, and my power is soup.`
` You cannot drink soup with a fork, correct?`
` If only the resistance of that mirror were gone, I could produce a spoon ideal for drinking soup.`
` ...After that, I could drink soup as I pleased, and even dig my way out of a rocky prison.`
` ...I could even gouge someone's eye out with it. ...Was that not the phrase?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......I-I don't know what you're talking about.`
` ...If my poor education is to blame, I apologize."`
`"It comes down to this.`
` If you take action and break that annoying mirror for me,`
` I shall grant your wish as a reward."`
`"...I am in quite a good mood today.`
` You may even change your wish and receive all the gold I bestowed upon Kinzo, if you so desire.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......I-I refuse......"`
`"...What?"`
`When she heard Shannon's words, Beatrice realized for the first time that her expectations had been betrayed.`
`"If you have a reason, tell me.`
` If there has been some misunderstanding, I shall resolve it."`
`"......I-I don't really understand the reason.`
` ......But...up until now, this island had been at peace, and nothing bad has happened.`
` ...So, even if I don't break the mirror, the peace that has existed until today should continue into the future."`
`"Hmm...`
` Yes, yes, you are quite right.`
` It's just as you say.`
` If you don't break the mirror, the same unbreakable days that have passed until now will continue into tomorrow and the next day.`
` Why don't I give you an absolute guarantee?"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"I shall stake my name, Beatrice, on it.`
` ~ib~The unbreakable days before this time will continue into tomorrow and the next day~ib~.`
` And for eternity, in perpetuity."`
`Shannon felt overwhelmed by an eerie illusion.`
`The mirror probably existed for the purpose of restraining the witch.`
`...So, if Shannon broke it, the person who stood to gain was supposedly the witch herself.`
`...And yet, Shannon felt somehow that she had to do it for her own sake.`
`It felt like some premise had been switched around...`
`"I will do nothing but grant you a chance to bring your feelings to fruition.`
` ...It's up to you to decide whether you'll break it or not.`
` If you break it, I shall grant your wish."`
`"If you don't, the tomorrows that came before today will continue for all eternity.`
` Your wish will not be granted for all time.`
` ...Do you understand?`
` Do you see what I mean?`
` *cackle*cackle*."`
`The witch was speaking.`
`She was pressing Shannon, saying she must break the mirror if she ever wanted to be united with George.`
`It was a declaration...that Shannon's feelings would never be brought to fruition unless she broke it...`
`"...Please, ...stop it...`
` I don't...`
`want to hear something like that......!"`
`"It was never my goal to cause you pain.`
` ...Oh well.`
` When love leads to madness, that is when we see the true charm of humanity.`
` Enjoy that emotion to your heart's content."`
`"However, if you wish to borrow my power, feel free to break that mirror at any time.`
` And then you may yell my name and awaken me.`
` I will certainly keep my promise.`
` ...This way, you should have no complaints, right?`
` I won't force you to decide right now.`
` Easy, is it not?"`
`Was it really such an easy thing to do?`
`...No, it certainly wasn't.`
`To Shannon, who was burning with infatuation and worried by love, being tempted constantly and eternally with a way out was truly a cruel trial...`
`"I won't set a time limit on that promise, `
`...but there is a time limit on the magic that can grant your wish.`
` ...That limit is not of my making.`
` The one you love will decide it himself.`
` ......You see my meaning?"`
`"......N-No, I don't understand."`
`"When the one you care for finds the partner to whom he ought to pledge his love, that limit will be reached.`
` ...I may be a witch, but I am no demon.`
` I possess no magic to tear apart a pair of those who love each other...`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`The one you love will soon be attending a marriage meeting, yes...?`
`You may have stronger feelings for that man than anyone else in the world.`
` However, that doesn't mean you are the most suitable partner for him, does it...?`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~I know~ib~`
` with whom he will be having his marriage meeting.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~That girl is the most suitable~ib~`
` for Ushiromiya George in the entire world.`
`She came from a good school, achieved good grades, and possesses both composure and thoughtfulness.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`She is more beautiful than you, wiser than you, ~ib~more suitable than you~ib~.`
`How could an ignorant, incompetent, uncultured girl like you be suitable?`
` You know better than anyone.`
` There are none less suitable than you!`
` Even imagining that you and Ushiromiya George could be joined is sinful, and foolish, foolish, foolish, know your place!!`
` Have you forgotten to be grateful for your education?`
` Know your place.`
`George is the eldest grandson carrying Father's blood.`
` He's a person who may bear the burden of the Ushiromiya family someday in the future.`
` To answer to that expectation, he has studied tirelessly, entered a wonderful college, and is getting wonderful grades.`
` Did you really think you could snatch George away, you uneducated, incompetent, unqualified, uncultured servaaaant?`
` *giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"`
`"...St-Stop it, don't bully Shannon!!`
` Who the hell are you?!!"`
`At that time, as Shannon held her head, trying to protect her heart from the blade of Beatrice's words, Kanon ran in front of her.`
`Kanon didn't care who this woman was.`
`If this was an enemy tormenting Shannon, whom he loved and respected as a sister, nothing else mattered.`
`"......Kanon-kun, `
`...stay back...!`
` This person is...!"`
`".................."`
`It seemed Kanon also realized that the being standing before him was the witch of the portrait.`
`And also...that she was something to be feared.`
`"...I simply wished to give Shannon a chance to claim her reward, but it seems I said too much and ended up hurting her.`
` I must apologize for that."`
`"...But I shall leave behind that promise as a reward to you.`
` If you need my power, call me at any time.`
` I have already told you how."`
`"......Well then, let us call it a night.`
` Hostile gazes may be pleasant, but they damage your beauty, yes?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*..."`
`"Disappear...!!`
` I don't know who you are, but you're threatening Shannon!`
` Don't ever show yourself again!!"`
`Kanon's words seemed to deeply annoy the witch.`
`"...Watch your language, lowborn.`
` ...I may be gracious to those who respect me, but I am brutal to those who do not..."`
`While she still smiled, the witch's face began to twist itself...`
`Then, an oppressive feeling that couldn't be noticed with any of the five senses gradually filled the room...`
`Even though they couldn't understand it, they immediately realized it was something terrifying...`
`When you swim in the ocean and something large passes by in the water beneath you, you want to escape to land even before you learn what it is.`
` ...That's exactly what this was like!`
`"...P-Please stop, Beatrice-sama!!`
` Kanon-kun is still a child.`
` I apologize for his language!"`
`".................."`
`"............!"`
`Kanon placed his body between the witch and Shannon.`
` ...There was tense sweat on his forehead.`
`At that time, the witch certainly held Kanon's fate in the palm of her hand.`
`...She didn't even need to lift a finger.`
`She held a grasp on his fate so tight that a single twist of her smile could easily crush it...`
`Kanon understood that as well.`
`So he started sweating.`
` His knees felt weak...`
`However, Beatrice abruptly released that feeling of tension and laughed.`
`"......Very well.`
` If you ask, I will forgive you just this once.`
` ...Kanon, is it?`
` In deference to her, I shall forgive you tonight and send you off.`
` You ought to thank me.`
` Well then, let us call it a night."`
`"......In parting, I shall leave you with a small souvenir.`
` Hold out the palm of your left hands, you two."`
`When Beatrice grinned broadly and snapped her fingers, `
`their left hands stretched out in front of them against their will...and their palms opened.`
`It was a strange sensation, as though only their left hands now belonged to someone else.`
`It felt like only their left hands had become puppets, `
`which were being pulled by strings hanging down from the ceiling.`
`"Wh-What...`
`are you trying to do...?!"`
`Kanon resisted, but he couldn't retract his hand of his own free will.`
`"Don't struggle.`
` It will be over soon."`
`When Beatrice held her pipe aloft, a gold-colored, sparkling dust came out of the smoke and hovered in the air.`
`...That sparkle eventually became several gold butterflies.`
`The beautiful butterflies danced freely throughout the reception hall, forming a fantastical and beautiful world.`
`...And two of those butterflies alighted on the palms of Shannon's and Kanon's hands.`
`"?!"`
`"Ouch...!"`
`There was a sharp pain, as though they had been burned.`
`When the two of them tried to examine their palms, that hold on their bodies, which had been there a second ago, had gone without a trace.`
`"......A-A mark...?`
` What is..."`
`There was now a tiny burn mark on the palm of her hand.`
`...And it was shaped like a butterfly...`
`"Wh-What is this supposed to be...?"`
`Apparently, Kanon had the same mark on his hand.`
` He stared at the witch hatefully.`
`"A simple greeting.`
` I have no hidden motive.`
` ...It is nothing more than a bruise, so it will heal in just a few days.`
` There's not even any need to care for it.`
` I made that mark so that tomorrow, you will not forget that I truly was here, and that I made a promise with you."`
`"......An encounter with me can be quite shocking.`
` ...Sometimes, when the next morning comes, people try to think of such an encounter as a dream or an illusion.`
` ......You ought to consider this slowly and carefully, Shannon.`
` ...And you should probably take a good rest, look at my mark tomorrow morning, and try considering it again."`
`"I shall not coerce you in any way.`
` You should freely decide your future, by your own will.`
` ......Still, to think that one could obtain the object of their desire for such a small price...`
` Surely, this would annoy to no end the great artists who write plays about blighted love.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Well then, let us meet again when the chance arises.`
` How entertaining it is to have a conversation again after so much time.`
` Goodbye, furniture.`
` Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!"`
`Beatrice's body crumbled like smoke and blew away.`
`...It was golden smoke...no, a cloud of gold butterflies.`
`They scattered in all directions inside the reception hall, ...leaving a golden splash before disappearing into thin air.`
`......After that, only the cold silence was left.`
`It was so silent, it made both of them think they might've been daydreaming until just a moment ago...`
`...Which was why the witch had left those marks.`
`She had done so to make it impossible for them to think of this as a daydream.`
`As Shannon and Kanon remembered the butterfly bruises on their hands and the pain they'd felt when they'd been made,`
` they kept standing still, stunned......`
`And from that moment on...`
`...Shannon was tormented by days of suffering and conflict......`
`"Whaaaaaaat?!`
` What do you mean, separate rooms?!`
` So wait, you and George nii-san stayed in different rooms on purpose?!"`
`"...Y-Yes...`
` Umm, ...is it really so strange...?"`
`Jessica's cheeks had been stuffed with a chocolate-coated chinsukou biscuit that Shannon had brought as a present from Okinawa, `
`and it all came flying out at Shannon when Jessica cried out...`
`"...Sh-Shannon, why did you even go on a trip to Okinawa...?`
` You were even alone with George nii-san!"`
`"Well, umm, ...he said there was a huge aquarium in Okinawa and invited me to go...`
` And...I like fish and stuff..."`
`"No, that's not the point!!`
` We're talking about a healthy guy and girl going on an overnight trip, right?!`
` And you're saying there weren't even any hugs and kisses?!`
` And seriously, what's up with the guy and girl staying in different rooms?!!"`
`"As for k-kisses, no comment.`
` Ah, but we did hug...`
` George-san's chest was warm..."`
`"That's not the point!!`
` Aah, geez!`
` Why do couples like this exist?!`
` Aaah, geez!!`
` I can't take it anymore!"`
`From Shannon's point of view, it was an incredibly happy trip for various reasons, `
`but it looked like Jessica found their pace to be pretty irritating.`
`For a while, Jessica chewed her present, `
`complaining about romance and pretending to faint in agony on her bed.`
`Shannon and George had chosen to go to Okinawa because there was a huge aquarium there.`
`They did this because an aquarium had given them the opportunity to start going out.`
`Since their relationship had started at an aquarium, having their first overnight trip also be to an aquarium must have held some commemorative value.`
`"That's like a huge commemorative turning point!`
` And your first overnight trip!!`
` How could you not make all kinds of progress there?!`
` But instead, `
`you both got separate rooms?!`
` A couple taking two single rooms?!`
` Aah, geez, seriously, what's wrong with you?!"`
`"...Err, umm, ......but we are both unmarried...`
` ...George-san says showing restraint is good manners for a couple..."`
`"Like I said, the whole point of this overnight trip was so you could overcome that stage, right?!`
` You should be way beyond just kissing and hugging by now!"`
`"M-Milady, I don't know what you mean by that, `
`b-but George-sama was a real gentleman with me until the end.`
`'!s1`
`...I also...`
`wondered if those things would happen, you know, `
`...but even though we are going out...`
` I-I mean, it's not like we're married or anything..."`
`"These things you seem to be expecting...`
`......umm, should only be done after making a vow before God, umm, `
`...a-a-and...`
`au."`
`Shannon's face got bright red.`
`She made a circle with both hands, restlessly intertwining, separating and making heart marks with them.`
`Apparently, the dramatic progress Jessica had looked forward to hadn't happened, `
`but it seemed to have been a very important experience for Shannon in her own way.`
`...In the end, whether Jessica was jealous of Shannon or made fun of her, it didn't change the fact that Shannon had a huge lead on her.`
`'!s1`
` I can't believe you got ahead of me!!`
` Even though we promised that we'd find boyfriends at the same time, you beat me,`
` aarrrrrrgh!"`
`"U-Umm...`
` You're a wonderful person, Milady, so I'm sure you'll find someone wonderful much quicker than me..."`
`"Don't try to console me!!`
` Shannon, you traitor, get out, shut uuup!`
` *cough*cough*, *cough*cough*cough*!!"`
`Jessica threw several cushions at her.`
`But midway, she had an asthma attack and started to choke pretty badly.`
`Shannon hurriedly ran over to a nearby side table and started searching around on top of it.`
`A cute basket was placed there, and inside of it was Jessica's bronchodilator.`
`Shannon picked it up and handed it over to Jessica.`
`Jessica's asthma attacks always came suddenly.`
`Because of that, she always needed to carry this medicine around.`
`She breathed in the medicine and, after a while, managed to overcome her choking as her asthma finally settled down.`
`Shannon thought this a good chance to leave and tried to exit the room after bowing courteously...`
`As she did, one more small cushion came flying and hit Shannon on the head.`
`She noticed that Jessica was on the verge of crying, half of her face buried in her last and favorite cushion.`
` That face was red and meek...`
`"...M-Milady...?"`
`"...Sh-Shannon, `
`be honest with me...`
` ......Is my...`
`hairdo and stuff...weird...?"`
`"What are you saying...?`
` I think your hair is very beautiful."`
`"Then...then, then, are my eyes strange, or maybe my nose?`
` ...Or is it the way I talk after all...?`
` Is that why I can't get a boyfriend...?"`
`"Of course not.`
` Milady, you are wonderful enough as you are.`
` And I think your charm will keep on increasing more and more from now on."`
`" ......But I'm the only one who can't find a boyfriend...`
` Saku and Hina managed to get boyfriends, but only I can't...`
` Is it because I don't have any charm after all...?`
` You know, everyone says they'll bring their boyfriends to the cultural festival...`
` And I was so sure I'd have a boyfriend before then, so I started bragging...`
` ......There's no way I'll get a boyfriend.`
` I'm...I'm the only one..."`
`Before she realized it, Jessica was shedding huge tears.`
`Jessica didn't really feel like crying, and of course, she felt like supporting Shannon's progress in love as a friend.`
`...However, as she had cheered Shannon on, her true feelings had suddenly gotten mixed in, and she couldn't help but shed tears...`
`...Shannon understood Jessica's innocent and easily injured heart.`
`The rough style of speech Jessica usually used...`
`was all just an attempt to protect that fragile heart.`
`...As a daughter and successor to the Ushiromiya family, and as a girl isolated on Rokkenjima, the only person she could expose her true feelings to was Shannon.`
`Shannon understood that.`
`So, ...she strongly regretted acting smug, even if it was only a little.`
`"...S-Sorry...`
` I'm so weird, crying like this.`
` Sorry, ...*sniffle*."`
`"You are a wonderful person, Milady.`
` There's no way you won't find a wonderful man..."`
`"......Sh-Shannon, it's about time, right?`
` If you don't go quickly, Genji-san and Mom will get mad.`
` I'm just fine, so hurry up...!`
` Heheh, sorry for crying like this.`
` ......I'm such a moron."`
`Jessica faced away, acting as though she didn't really want to trouble Shannon,`
` waving her hand as though chasing Shannon away.`
`Shannon took that as a sign that Jessica didn't want to be bothered anymore, `
`bowed her head, and left the room...`
`When Shannon's footsteps disappeared into the distance, Jessica lay down on her bed, still hugging a cushion.`
`...Her expression was still a little meek, with tears in her eyes,`
` ...but for the first time in a long time, she had a very, very quiet and honest conversation with her heart.`
`'!s1`
`...want to fall...`
`in love..."`
`As Shannon happily watered the flower beds in the garden, she sensed someone's presence.`
`She turned around, thinking that if one of the family had come to visit, she must greet them,`
` ...but what she saw was that witch.`
`"...B-Beatrice-sama......"`
`"It's been quite some time.`
` How are you?`
` Has your relationship with the one you love progressed since last we met?"`
`As Beatrice sat on the rose arch, she happily blew on her pipe.`
`Sitting in a place like that would crush the roses, `
`and it might have been dangerous if the arch fell over, ...but this was a witch, after all.`
`Showing concern for her safety was probably a waste of time.`
`"...Y-Yes.`
` Thanks to you, ...it's going smoothly."`
`"Naturally. The effects of my magic are immediate.`
` Perhaps you feel your meeting was a predetermined fate.`
` However, that is a mistake. Don't even think fate has anything to do with it."`
`"......I-I understand that."`
`The witch was calling attention to something.`
` Two things, actually.`
`First, that Shannon's relationship with George was a fate that'd be absolutely impossible under normal circumstances.`
`...Second, that the power of the witch was great enough to overturn that fact.`
`Shannon had just gotten wrapped up in those sweet days...and had started believing the illusion that all fate revolved around her.`
`...But she remembered the witch's words.`
`Originally, her relationship with George had been impossible...`
`...no, it might be impossible in the future as well...`
`"...*cackle*cackle* Sorry, please forgive me.`
` It's just like doctors.`
` You cling to them when you're worried about your health, but after you're healed, you forget even to thank them.`
` ...I've never been thanked as a witch, so I couldn't help acting a little rudely.`
` Forgive me."`
`"......The gratitude I feel has never slipped my mind.`
` ...It's thanks to your power that I was able to achieve happiness, Beatrice-sama.`
` ...And without that power, the fate that brought me and George-sama together would never have happened.`
` ...I have never forgotten that."`
`"Sorry, sorry.`
` It's not like I came here to bully you.`
` Being rude is just part of my personality.`
` Do forgive me.`
` ...More importantly, I heard, I heard!`
` So, you went on a trip alone with him.`
` I imagine it must have been quite fun."`
`"Y-Yes!`
` It was very...umm...fun."`
`Shannon's face suddenly lit up.`
`The witch laughed lightly, as though amused by the speed of that transformation.`
`"Already, the one you care for is more than the object of one-sided love.`
` You are a pair of lovers now.`
` ...When two people are filled with love, nothing else is needed to establish a complete world.`
` Perhaps you could call that a wonderful, ideal world.`
` Heheheheheh!`
` Even witches would be jealous."`
`Beatrice laughed pleasantly.`
`That smile made her look as though she blessed the lovers' rendezvous from the bottom of her heart, without a trace of malice.`
`After that day, Beatrice had shown herself before Shannon every once in a while.`
`Even now, Shannon thought of her as an unsettling being.`
`...However, she was also indebted to this person for the magic that led to her current relationship with George.`
`So Shannon tried with all her might not to act surprised or scared.`
`"Th-That's right.`
` ...Umm, Beatrice-sama,`
` I bought some sweets as a souvenir from our trip.`
` ...Would you...umm...like to try some too?"`
`"Oh???`
` A souvenir for a witch......?"`
`It seemed that even a witch who boasted of living for one thousand years hadn't imagined that she'd receive a souvenir from a sweet lovers' trip.`
`When she saw that surprised expression, Shannon thought of this witch as a friend for the first time.`
`"Hohoh, an Eastern cookie made from wheat flour and lard.`
` To wrap that in Western chocolate is truly a blending of the Japanese and Western styles, the silk road of sweets."`
`"......What?`
` What's so funny?"`
`"N-Nothing.`
` My apologies."`
`This witch, who surely held a terrifying power, `
`was chomping down on sweets one after another, making a sound like a squirrel stuffing walnuts into its mouth.`
` After a while, Shannon couldn't conceal her laughter.`
`"Hmmm, a good meal.`
` ...I should serve you some Dolce Vita from Nero one of these days.`
` Roses are the symbol of eternal love.`
` I believe a rose dolce would be appropriate for you now."`
`The witch was in a great mood, fully enjoying modern candy.`
`"Umm, ......here.`
` I truly am grateful.`
` I believe you've done more than enough for me already, so I'm returning this."`
`The thing Shannon had softly set on the table...`
`was a gold-colored butterfly brooch.`
`"There is no need to return it.`
` If you continue holding that, your relationship should remain firm in perpetuity."`
`"...Maybe it was the power of magic that brought us together,`
` but I think only the two of us working together can turn that into something that lasts forever."`
`"Hmmm.`
` ...Love and roses are the same.`
` Too much fertilizer causes the roots to rot.`
` Some flowers cannot be raised without hard work.`
` In that case, do as you wish.`
` You may wear it or keep it in a box.`
` That is my goodwill, given to you.`
` Having you return it to me won't please me at all."`
`"Ah, ...m-my apologies...!`
` That's not what I..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` No harm has been done.`
` That brooch is already yours.`
` If you treasure that proof of our friendship, it would indeed bring me some comfort."`
`"You may hold on to it and gain its benefits.`
` Or you may keep it in a box.`
` If you wish, you may even give it to another who is worrying about love.`
` ...Or you could simply treasure it.`
` Of course, it would pain my heart if you wasted it."`
`According to Beatrice, she had appeared several times in the past in response to a person's summons, to give them some tool imbued with magical power.`
`...However, when most people used that power to resolve their worries,`
` they quickly grew unsettled by it, forgot their former gratitude, and threw away the tools they had been given with disgust.`
`"So, it is quite rare for me to be thanked for my goodwill.`
` ...In fact, this might even be the first time.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`The witch laughed heartily, but it looked like a sad laugh in Shannon's eyes.`
`She herself had been like that in the past...no, maybe she was still like that now.`
`Beatrice was definitely a witch, with a strange and terrifying power.`
`Most people probably wouldn't want to stick around her if they could help it.`
`Surely, even those who had relied on that strange power sometimes felt fear rather than gratitude as a result.`
`...It must have deeply hurt the witch to have that happen over and over.`
`Since the time she had started thinking that way,`
` ...Shannon had tried to stop being frightened of Beatrice.`
`This was surely something that had tormented the witch for over a thousand years...`
`Maybe she really liked those sweets.`
` Beatrice, who normally spoke abusively, praised the black tea that Shannon served her and looked to be in remarkably high spirits.`
`After doing that for a while, the witch and the servant grew animated in their discussion of the trip with George.`
`The things Shannon actually knew about Beatrice were surprisingly few.`
`First off, she was a ghost-like being who appeared in unexpected places at unexpected times.`
`And it seemed that not everyone could perceive that she was there.`
`Apparently, everyone has something called a wavelength, and the ability to perceive witches varies greatly among different people.`
`Only Shannon and Kanon could interact with her enough to exchange words like this.`
`...There were a few people who could sense her presence, but most people couldn't even feel that much.`
`From what Beatrice said, Krauss and his wife in particular had zero magical talent.`
` And no matter how much she followed them around, they would never notice her.`
`Once earlier, when Shannon messed up and Natsuhi got really mad at her, Beatrice had started playing around, hitting Natsuhi on the head with her pipe.`
`...I see, Natsuhi really doesn't notice a thing.`
`But Shannon, watching that, had burst out laughing without thinking, and had gotten scolded even more.`
`"Then...what about the Master?`
` I hear he's been doing research in magic, so I'm sure he'll be able to notice you, Beatrice-sama."`
`".........Kinzo is the same.`
` He also has a pitiful lack of magical talent.`
` ...It's the blood.`
` He has so little talent that I pity him."`
`"...............?"`
`As soon as they started talking about Kinzo, it felt like the atmosphere around Beatrice changed.`
`She had spoken about Krauss and the rests' lack of magic talent as though she looked down on them, but she spoke of Kinzo in a different way.`
`Anyone connected to the Ushiromiya family would know about Kinzo's Legend of the Gold.`
`...According to that, Kinzo was given the gold after summoning the witch, Beatrice.`
`...In other words, she must have had some kind of relationship with Kinzo.`
`"That was because...he succeeded despite having not even a scrap of talent.`
` ...He kept studying by himself like mad and managed to become a magician."`
`"And that's......something really incredible, right...?"`
`"...Indeed."`
`The witch, who usually looked down on people, was uncharacteristically offering her praise.`
`...While she lambasted him by saying he had no talent, she praised his efforts.`
`"And then......the Master summoned Beatrice-sama with the power of magic..."`
`"Indeed.`
` ...Well, I only answered the summons on a whim.`
` After all, in this period where magic has long been denied, here was a man who was without a scrap of talent, yet so desperate to succeed.`
` I thought I'd drop by and poke some fun at him, and that's when my luck ran out.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`Her choice of words highlighted how much of a disaster this had been for her.`
`Shannon hesitated over whether it would be safe to continue this discussion, but Beatrice continued on her own, ignoring Shannon.`
`"After all, his contract did have a proper format and set of rules.`
` Various procedures were mixed up, but...well, in deference to his enthusiasm, I graciously accepted his contract.`
` ...Then, I gave him a mountain of gold."`
`"And then the Master...used that gold and succeeded in business...and grew his wealth into what it is today."`
`"Indeed. His talent in magic was minimal, but it seems he had a knack for business and gambling.`
` ...Or perhaps it was due to the bravery and madness that led him to risk everything on unreasonable bets.`
` ...Madness sometimes acts as magical power.`
` I see, if you look at it that way, perhaps it isn't quite fair to say he was completely lacking in magical talent.`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`Shannon felt like she was daydreaming.`
`While everyone in the Ushiomiya family knew the story of how Kinzo idolized black magic, summoned a witch, and received the gold, in actuality, it was all rambling that no one believed in.`
`And now, Shannon was having this story confirmed by the witch herself...`
`She felt a little flustered by this incredible secret that only she knew.`
`"Once Kinzo gained his vast fortune, he could realize every dream that can be satisfied by objects obtainable in the human world.`
` ......And in the end, he searched for the truth of this world."`
`"The truth...of this world?"`
`"...The single element that makes up the world.`
` Kinzo, who had gained everything one can obtain in the human world, searched for that, the final desire humans seek."`
`The single element.`
` ......She seemed to remember the witch using that word before.`
`When Beatrice saw Shannon trying to remember what that was, she laughed bitterly, waving her hand and saying there was no need to worry.`
`"...I underestimated Kinzo just a tad.`
` I truly didn't expect him to display such power."`
`"...And thanks to that, I'm in this state.`
` I've been sewn in place on this island for several decades now, without even a friend to drink tea with.`
` ...No matter whom I try to talk to, my voice doesn't reach them, and no matter where I go, I cannot do anything.`
` Such boring decades."`
`As she laughed in self-derision, she tapped her teacup with her finger.`
` It made the light sound of pottery.`
`...Shannon didn't know whether the word 'self-derision' was really an accurate expression to describe the look on the witch's face.`
`Shannon didn't understand everything, but she could more or less figure out the situation.`
`...And it was probably a topic that she couldn't press the witch on easily, not unless the witch started talking about it herself.`
`To sum up everything she had said up until now...`
`Beatrice, who had been summoned by Kinzo's magic, could not leave this island for some reason.`
`And she had lost her power and her form, living her days in boredom.`
`During that time, her words had reached Shannon, who never forgot to show sincere respect for the witch.`
`And Shannon had helped the witch regain her power, if only a little bit.`
`...As a result, it was now possible for the witch to drink tea with Shannon like this...`
`"...Beatrice-sama, what in the world was that mirror you told me to break?"`
`"Aaah, that.`
` ......Long ago, it seems various things happened on the islands around this area.`
` Because of that, malignant forces gathered here and began to draw in an evil distortion.`
` It seems a traveling eastern magician or something built a shrine for the repose of souls and sealed them in there."`
`"...That in itself has nothing to do with me, but unfortunately, that magical power rested on a different foundation than mine.`
` It created a strong interference with my magic and was extremely bothersome."`
`"Is that how it was...?`
` And I just assumed it existed only to seal you, Beatrice-sama..."`
`"I was not its target.`
` But it was a divine mirror.`
` As a result, my power was sealed away.`
` ...To use food as an example, maybe it would go something like this.`
` Let's say the Western food I ordered is being made in the kitchen.`
` However, when they try to set the table, the area for the guest seating is in the Japanese style with Japanese-style dishes.`
` So, the kitchen is unable to serve a plate that would be out of place, and no matter how long I wait, my Western food won't arrive. ...Something like that."`
`"So, you destroyed that Japanese-style guest seating and returned the area to a blank slate for a time.`
` Thanks to that, the meal I had ordered was finally delivered, and my power came back, you could say.`
` However, so far, only the aperitif has arrived.`
` It will still be quite some time before the main dish.`
` As I am now, I'm even more fragile than a shoe store fairy."`
`'!s1`
`...ahahahahahahaha."`
`"Mu.`
` What's so amusing?"`
`"Nothing...`
` I just thought your metaphor was pretty funny.`
` I never would've thought to use a story about food as a metaphor for magic."`
`"I thought it a rather skillful comparison, but I certainly didn't expect it to be laughed at.`
` I'm a bit offended."`
`A slightly sulky expression rose to the witch's face.`
`...It wasn't a strange expression at all to be appearing on the face of some friends as they enjoyed their tea.`
`"...Although I may not look it, I was known for doing extremely brutal things in the past.`
` ...I've gotten soft.`
` Now I can even have a foolish discussion while drinking tea with a human."`
`She was probably talking to herself.`
`As Beatrice gazed at the sea birds tracing the horizon, she put her tea to her lips again.`
`"...The clouds have come out.`
` When the ocean loses its brilliance, it's nothing more than a gray puddle."`
`"You think so?`
` ...I think the ocean is a beautiful deep blue, even when it gets cloudy."`
`"......Hmph."`
`Maybe the witch noticed the deep meaning behind Shannon's words.`
`...She laughed lightly and set down her empty teacup.`
`"...It seems those things buried in your eyes aren't black pebbles anymore.`
` How is it?`
` ...Do you see how it feels for furniture to be reborn as a human?"`
`"......Yes.`
` ...I never knew the world was this kind."`
`Since the start of her relationship with George, Shannon's face had grown brighter more often.`
`Her smile had made everything go smoothly and had even changed her fortune.`
`...Shannon made less mistakes in her work than she had before, and the family members' opinion of her was slowly starting to change.`
`Just the other day, she had been surprised when Krauss, who rarely exchanged words with her, had suddenly started talking to her.`
`"You've been wearing a splendid smile more often lately, haven't you?`
` Has something good happened?"`
`"N-No...`
` But...every day is fun, yes."`
`"Hmph.`
` Wonderful.`
` It goes without saying that coffee is more delicious when poured with a smile.`
` ...Could I ask for that smile once more?"`
`"...Y-Yes sir!"`
`That had become a chance for Shannon to gain confidence in herself.`
`Of course, it didn't go beyond her own heart, and it wasn't so big a change that anyone would notice.`
`...But she had begun to change, bit by bit.`
`Shannon understood it clearly.`
`Knowing love was the same as gaining a soul.`
` ...The same as being reborn, from furniture into a human.`
`There was absolutely nothing mistaken in Beatrice's words.`
` ...By knowing love, Shannon had learned what it was to be human.`
`"...These have been unusual snacks.`
` It was time well spent.`
` It's probably about time for you to return to your work,`
` so let us end our tea party now.`
` ...After all, it seems a certain person doesn't like seeing us drink tea together."`
`"Huh?"`
`The witch gripped a teaspoon and flipped it with her fingers, sending it up in the air.`
`...After that, it was launched by the fingers of some invisible person...and flew straight into a nearby bush.`
`The bush shook violently, and Kanon came out.`
`...It seemed he had been there for some time, watching their tea party.`
`The spoon was gripped in his hand.`
`...If he hadn't caught it in an instant, it might've hit him hard in the forehead and caused him to start oozing blood.`
`"............"`
`"Do not worry.`
` Our tea party is over now, Kanon."`
`"How long were you there?`
` If you had called to us, I'd have poured you some tea too..."`
`"I imagine that you didn't want to interrupt a pair of women talking, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"............"`
`Kanon kept silent, but there seemed to be a slightly hostile look in his eyes.`
`...On the outside, he acted with respect.`
` But unlike Shannon, Kanon did not trust the witch.`
`When Beatrice hit the table with her pipe, the tea set turned into gold butterflies, which flew upwards all at once.`
`They then scattered in every direction, and the cleanup was already done.`
`"It was fun, Shannon.`
` ...Let us meet again if the chance arises.`
` ...My magical power is still quite lacking.`
` It's tiring even to show myself."`
`"...If you're that tired, never appear again."`
`Kanon had said it in a small voice, but the witch seemed to have heard it perfectly.`
`She giggled, but did not reply.`
`"Shannon,`
` tell me more about George at our next tea party.`
` There are no snacks sweeter than a person's love life.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` See you again."`
`Beatrice's body also became gold butterflies, which scattered in all directions and disappeared.`
`...It was a fantastical and beautiful scene, like a blizzard of gold leaf.`
`For a while, Shannon quietly watched the witch's exit...`
`Kanon approached her from behind and spoke with an expression that was drastically different from hers.`
`"......Nee-san, didn't I tell you to stay away from her?"`
`"Beatrice-sama isn't that bad of a person.`
` ...Yes, she might be a little shady, but-"`
`"The fact that only we can see her is suspicious enough...`
` That thing isn't human.`
` Who knows what she might be planning?"`
`"Kanon-kun, I think that's a little rude."`
`There was a touch of sternness in Shannon's voice, which was unusual for her.`
`...To Kanon, who knew her well, she must've sounded extremely stern.`
`Kanon, looking excessively surprised considering Shannon's tone, fell silent.`
`"It's true that Beatrice-sama is different from humans.`
` She has a terrifying power, so I think it's right for us to fear and respect her.`
` ...Still, I think it's incredibly rude to despise her just because she isn't human."`
`"......I understand what you're trying to say, Nee-san.`
` ...You've changed ever since she gave you that brooch.`
` It's like you're her prisoner.`
` She brought you and George-sama together, and now you're indebted to her."`
`"...Don't say things like that."`
`"That thing isn't human.`
` We don't know what she's thinking.`
` So you mustn't trust her.`
` ......And we aren't humans either,`
` Nee-san."`
`Kanon's words grew more serious.`
`...Those words probably gouged at Shannon's heart.`
` She bit her lower lip and hung her head.`
`"We are furniture.`
` ...Even if we receive names and are treated as humans, that won't change the manner of our birth."`
`You are no longer furniture...`
`Those words Beatrice had given her, which had made her happiest, floated through Shannon's mind...`
`"I am not...`
`...furniture."`
`"No, you are furniture.`
` We are less than human.`
` ...Nee-san, you're just pretending to have forgotten, ...pretending to be human.`
` You know that as well as I do."`
`"I...am not furniture.`
` ...I'm human...!"`
`"No, you aren't.`
` We have never possessed what it takes to love or be loved."`
`Kanon's criticism seemed to have shifted away from Shannon's meetings with the witch.`
`...Shannon picked up on that quickly.`
`"I heard from Milady.`
` Seriously, what were you thinking?`
` I can't believe you would go on a trip with George-sama...!`
` You've forgotten your place as furniture.`
` You've just been tempted by that witch, mistakenly believing that you've become human!"`
`"Listen, Kanon-kun.`
` ......It's true that we're furniture.`
` Lesser beings, inferior to humans.`
` ...But if it were possible to make up for what we lack, `
`...wouldn't that be the same as becoming human?"`
`"...Such a thing could never happen."`
`"No, it could.`
` If we can do that, we won't be furniture anymore.`
` We can become human."`
`".........`
`......Ridiculous.`
` ...As if you could ever...do such a thing."`
`Kanon spat those words out, ...but did so weakly and turned away.`
`He was probably giving up.`
`...After all the suffering he'd undergone during those days he'd lived as furniture, his heart was firmly sealed...`
`"...You can do it too, Kanon-kun.`
` ...You can become a normal human."`
`"............`
`Stop it, that's the witch talking."`
`"Yes.`
` Beatrice-sama taught me.`
` ...By obtaining the single element of this world, we can become human.`
` Or rather, nobody's human if they don't have 'that'.`
` ...That's why people spend their entire lives trying to gain that single element."`
`"I don't understand what you're saying, Nee-san.`
` I don't want to listen to ranting."`
`"Then I'll teach it in a way even you can understand.`
` ......Look, see what I'm pointing at?"`
`"......?"`
`Shannon quietly pointed at the sea, towards the horizon.`
`Kanon didn't understand what she meant, and couldn't do anything except look between the horizon and Shannon's expression, which seemed to be posing a riddle.`
`"The sea.`
` ...Kanon-kun, what color does the sea look to you?"`
`It was an extremely simple question.`
`For a while, Kanon tried to guess at the meaning behind it,`
` but he couldn't think of anything, so he answered obediently.`
`"...It's a hazy, dark-gray color.`
` So what?"`
`Objectively speaking, the sea, laid out beneath a cloudy sky, could probably be described best by Kanon's words.`
`...But as Shannon closed her eyes and smiled, she shook her head slightly.`
`"It looks deep blue to me."`
`"...Is that what you mean?`
` Like how Japanese people use the word 'blue' to refer to a green traffic light?"`
`"No.`
` ...The sea is deep blue.`
` If I understand and you don't,`
` ...then that's the difference between us..."`
`Kanon bit his lower lip and was silent for a while.`
`"............`
`......I...don't understand."`
`"Kanon-kun,`
` ...would you stick out your hand?"`
`As Kanon was taken aback, unable to understand what she was saying, she took his arm and opened the palm of his hand.`
`Shannon softly set something there.`
`It was that magic brooch, which she had received from Beatrice.`
`A magic charm, shaped like a gold butterfly, that could bring love to fruition.`
`"This is...`
`...hers...?"`
`"No, this is mine.`
` ...So think of it as me and treat it with respect, okay?"`
`"............"`
`After being spoken to like that, he couldn't just throw it away.`
`Kanon didn't know what he should do, and he stood there confused for a while, the brooch still on the palm of his hand.`
`Shannon put the palm of her hand on top of Kanon's, and the brooch was warmed by both of their hands.`
`"This charm holds true magical power.`
` ...I'm sure it'll teach you an important emotion, Kanon-kun."`
`"...There's nothing to be learned from that person's magic."`
`"No, there is something.`
` ...So wear it.`
` If that's embarrassing, I hear it's okay if you just hide it in your pocket."`
`"......Ridiculous...`
` As if I'd let the magic of that person lead me astray."`
`Even as he said that, Kanon couldn't be cold-hearted towards something Shannon was urging him to take.`
`In the end, Kanon took it and agreed reluctantly, `
`saying he'd prove that he wouldn't surrender to the witch's power.`
` Shannon smiled and nodded back.`
`"I'm sure you'll be able to learn something important from it.`
` ...And I'm sure you can become human.`
` And when you do, I'm sure this ocean will look like a beautiful blue to you as well, Kanon-kun."`
`"...Gray is gray no matter how many times you look."`
`"That's wrong, Kanon-kun.`
` ...It only looks like that because you have no ****."`
`"Huh...?"`
`Because of the howling wind, he hadn't been able to catch the main point of what she'd just said.`
`So Shannon said it once more.`
`...The single element of the world.`
`She spoke once more of the world where it existed, where the sea was deep blue.`
`"I'm sure you'll be able to see a deep blue ocean too.`
` After all-"`
`Without love, it cannot be 'seen'.`
`"......Who is that?"`
`"...It is Kanon, Master."`
`It was rare for Kinzo to leave his study.`
`...However, the fact that he had didn't mean his noble research had been suspended.`
`He may have left the study because of a change in mood, `
`but that didn't mean the thoughts filling his head were any different from those he had while inside the study.`
`Kanon knew that no matter what the time, speaking to Kinzo when he didn't want to be spoken to would always disturb his research.`
`"It's cloudy out there.`
` Will it get worse?"`
`"Yes.`
` According to the weather report, it could rain at any time.`
` ...Shall I bring an umbrella?"`
`"It will not come to that.`
` ...Leave me alone for a while.`
` If my children ask, say that you do not know where I am.`
` I am busy on a journey through my own thoughts."`
`"...Certainly.`
` Then, if you would excuse me."`
`Before Kanon finished bowing, Kinzo had already returned to his own world, having forgotten Kanon's presence completely.`
`And once again, he began rambling to himself.`
`Amidst those words, ...the name of that witch popped up many times.`
`"...Ooohh, Beatrice...`
` My hand will not reach your smile...`
` What can I do to revive you, what can I do to make you smile at me once more...?`
` ...What is lacking?`
` My research, my materials, my catalyst?`
` Or is it magical power or luck or an oracle...?!`
` Ooohhh, Beatrice, what can I do to see your face one more time...?`
` Ooooooooohhhhhhh......"`
`As Kanon listened to his master's weeping voice with his back turned, he turned around just once.`
`'!s0`
`......right behind his isolated, old master, `
`...was the shadow of a person who shouldn't have been there.`
`It was...the witch.`
`At once, thinking that the witch must be plotting to do Kinzo some harm, `
`Kanon dashed back to Kinzo and tried to form a shield with his body.`
`But when he saw the expression on the witch's face, `
`...that emotion of his vanished.`
`'!s0`
`...sorrowful...`
`...or maybe pitying.`
`"You fool, Kinzo...`
` ...Can't you 'see' me, even though I am here?"`
`Right behind Kinzo, as he repeated the witch's name over and over, desiring to be reunited with her more than anything else, `
`was the witch herself.`
`And yet, Kinzo didn't notice anything.`
`...When Beatrice tried to rest her hand on his shoulder, he didn't notice.`
`"...Why, why does my hand not reach Beatrice's smile?!`
` Is it the age of the moon, `
`the cycle of the comets, `
`the alignment of the planets?!`
` What is lacking, what is, what is?!!"`
`"......It's useless, Kinzo.`
` ...Without love, `
`it cannot be 'seen'."`
`Kanon took the brooch he had received from Shannon out of his pocket.`
`...By learning something new, would he become able to glimpse something he couldn't 'see' now?`
`"...............`
`Without love, it cannot be 'seen'."`
`He looked at Kinzo's back once more.`
`...The witch could no longer be seen there.`
`The biggest fall event for the Ushiromiya family was the family conference in October, `
`but to Jessica, there was another major event that came before that: the school cultural festival.`
`Jessica liked school.`
` To her, it was a place where she could let out the stress she'd built up from the rigid lifestyle she was forced to lead at home.`
`For today's cultural festival, she'd formed a group with her friends...`
`and had announced that they'd perform some light music on a temporary stage.`
`She had prepared and practiced for this over and over until today, always anxiously awaiting this day's arrival, `
`......but there was one thing that worried her.`
`She looked at the clock.`
`...There was still a little time, ...but she felt uneasy.`
`Would that person really come?`
`After taking a single deep breath, her heart jumped when all her friends suddenly started speaking in shrill voices.`
`"No wa-y, Hina's boyfriend's so a-wesome!!"`
` "Isn't he?!`
` Isn't he?!"`
` "Rin's boyfriend looks re-ally smart!`
` Is it true that guy's a glasses beast?!"`
` "No way, no way, my husband'll be a pretty bo-y!"`
` """*giggle*♪ *giggle*♪"""`
`...It may not be like this for all girls, `
`...but at least at Jessica's school, the cultural festival was basically a boyfriend exhibition.`
`Jessica didn't have a boyfriend.`
`She had many friends of the opposite sex, but no special 'only one'.`
`...But Jessica was a little famous around the school, and everyone thought it'd be natural for her to have a fitting partner.`
`Furthermore, her pride had led her to pretend that this was true.`
`She'd somehow managed to keep them fooled until this year.`
`...But for various reasons, she hadn't been able to escape this year's cultural festival...`
`"Jessie-,`
` is your boyfriend he-re?"`
`"Wha?!`
` Ah, uh, no, looks like he's not here yet.`
` Maybe he's busy with work.`
` Ahahahahahahahahahaha..."`
`"So what kind of person is he, Jessie?`
` At least give us a hint.`
` What kind of relationship?`
` What kind of relationship?!"`
` "Awesome, so he's a working man?!`
` Will he come in a suit?!`
` Of course he'll be wearing glasses, right?!`
` Kyaa-!!"`
` "Heeeeeey, he actually doesn't exist, right?`
` If you come clean now, we'll let you join us!`
` Let's cry together through this year's cultural festivaaaal!"`
`"No no no, he exists he exists he exists, I told you, he really exists...`
`ahahahahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`Jessica's bitter smile was covered with cold sweat.`
`...It was starting to seem doubtful whether she really had deceived her sharp-witted friends...`
`"Okay.`
` Then, how about making a fake boyfriend and taking him with you?"`
`"A-A-A fake?!`
` Wh-Who...?!`
` I can't think of...anyone who'd do that!"`
`Shannon's ridiculous plan surprised Jessica into hysterics.`
`Even so, it was probably more realistic than the crazy methods running through her head about getting a boyfriend in the big rush before the cultural festival.`
`"For example, `
`...what about Kanon-kun?"`
`"K-K-Kanon-kuuuuuun?!`
` N-N-No way, no way!!`
` Anyway, I'm sure Kanon-kun has work on the day of the festival,`
` ...and I don't wanna bother him..."`
`"Of course, I've already checked the schedule.`
` Kanon-kun has that day off."`
`"......Wh-Why are you always so clever when it comes to stuff like this...?`
` No, wait!`
` It'd be even worse if he's off...`
` I can't pull him away from a precious day off just for my own vanity!"`
`"If you don't pull Kanon-kun away, he'll always be shut away by himself,`
` so I think it'd be perfect if you could drag him out of his shell."`
`'!s1`
`...You think so?`
` ...No, `
`but...`
`I'd feel bad for him..."`
`"Then I guess you're out of options...`
` How about meekly confessing to everyone that you don't have a boyfriend?"`
`"...True, it may be terribly embarrassing, `
`but you'd only have to endure for the short and yet loooong time before graduation.`
` To a pair of lovers, there's no sweeter honey than the face of a single person with an inferiority complex☆"`
`'!s0`
` You aren't really worrying for my sake, are you? You're teasing me, riiiight?!!"`
`Jessica wrestled about with Shannon, her eyes teary.`
`But Shannon was unphased, laughing with her usual smile.`
`"Yes,`
` this is to get you back for making fun of me and George-sama all the time."`
`Listening to Shannon's comeback, the likes of which didn't happen even once a year, Jessica hugged her cushion and rolled around on her bed, pretending to faint in agony.`
`She couldn't stand Shannon's smile, which looked so triumphant, `
`but right now, she was the only person Jessica could talk with.`
` She could choke her to death with her cushion later.`
`"Is it really so bad, Milady?`
` It's a cultural festival, but it's also a chance for you to have fun with Kanon-kun."`
`"No, that may be true, but...`
`no, no, no, no...!!"`
`Jessica buried her head in her favorite pillow to hide the fact that her face had grown bright red.`
`And she grumpily chewed the fingernail on her thumb.`
`...It really was a reaction to be appreciated.`
`Shannon and Jessica were of about the same age, of the same sex, and friends.`
`And they were both right in the middle of puberty.`
`They could never talk enough about love.`
`That's why they could talk freely about these topics to each other.`
`So, Jessica had heard a lot about how Shannon and George's love was progressing,`
` and Shannon had heard a lot about what type Jessica liked, what kind of man she might be interested in.`
`Judging by Jessica's reaction, it'd probably be rude for us to go into precisely what these things were...`
`However, this story won't get anywhere if we just have Jessica rolling around forever, so let's dive in.`
`Jessica had been thinking about Kanon ever since he'd shown up.`
`It was extremely rare for young men to visit Rokkenjima.`
`So maybe it was natural for Jessica, a girl in puberty, to develop an interest in Kanon.`
`But if anyone said that, it would destroy the romantic ideals of a maiden's pure heart and love at first sight.`
`Shannon had been with Kanon a long time at the orphanage, so she'd known him since before they started working.`
`So, Jessica had asked persistently about what his hobbies were, what his favorite food was, what type of girl he liked.`
`......Even to Shannon, it was clear that Jessica was infatuated with Kanon.`
`"Come on.`
` ...Isn't this a good chance to take Kanon-kun on a date?"`
`"B-B-But but but, ...Kanon-kun might also have someone he likes, so...`
`wouldn't he take it badly if I made him go with me just to show off...?"`
`"People who aren't honest with themselves, like you, are...`
`...what was that word I learned from George-sama...?`
` That's right, I think it was '#fefefetsundora#ffffff'.`
` Apparently, they'll be all the rage in a decade or so."`
`"Wow, George nii-san sure is incredible, `
`managing to foresee future trends like that.`
` Awesome.`
` ...No, wait!`
` Are you saying I'm living in the wrong decade?!`
` Waah, waah, waah, I give up!!"`
`...It took several days of wasted efforts, but in the end, Jessica agreed to the plan of having Kanon pretend to be her boyfriend...`
`"...Yes, Milady.`
` Did you call me?"`
`Jessica regretted calling out at such a bad time.`
`...Kanon always looked sullen, but he had some bad days and some better days.`
`...Unfortunately, this reaction was the former.`
`"N-N-No, umm, well, `
`......errr."`
`"..............."`
`All that confidence and effort she'd built up practicing in front of a mirror all night was wiped out in about five seconds...`
`Jessica turned bright red and hung her head.`
`When he saw that, Kanon sighed.`
`...Jessica thought that he was exasperated with her, and her face went pale.`
`"......I heard from Shannon.`
` This is about having me go with you to the school cultural festival, right, Milady?"`
`"Huh?`
` ...Ah, aaaaaaahhh!!`
` Nice one, Shannon...`
`I mean...!`
` Y-Yeah, yeah.`
` Th-That's right, but, umm, err!`
` ......D-D-Do you have any plans that day...?"`
`"...I was strictly ordered by Shannon to work specially for you on that day, Milady.`
` I have never been to high school, so I don't really understand, `
`but I hear it's a place where girls can be shamed if they don't have a boy with them.`
` ...And I was given special orders to see to it that the daughter of the Ushiromiya family is in no way inferior to the common people."`
`'!s1`
`wahahahahahahahahahaha, Shannon, I'll beat you to death lateeeeer!!!"`
`Jessica kept yelling with a strange voice and a broken smile, like a tea kettle filled with boiling water.`
`As Kanon watched this, he sighed again.`
`Kanon wasn't an idiot either.`
`He fully understood what Jessica intended by inviting him.`
`...But to be honest, playing along with Jessica's love game seemed like it'd be nothing more than an annoyance to him.`
`However, Shannon had asked him over and over.`
` He was deeply indebted to her,`
` so he couldn't refuse.`
`...And that brooch was in his pocket.`
`Could this strange turn of events have been brought about by the magic power residing in this brooch?`
`.........Ridiculous.`
`But he remembered what Shannon had said to him that day.`
`...Could Shannon 'see' something he couldn't?`
`I don't understand Shannon's feelings.`
` We are furniture.`
` ...As if we could...ever become anything more.`
`It was a truly odd exchange between Jessica, who was still rambling on in a strange voice, and Kanon, who sighed deeply...`
`"Jessie, someone's here!!`
` Didn't you hear?!"`
`"Huh, ah, ah, sorry!!`
` Wh-Who is it...?"`
`As my friends all gathered together, ...they were looking this way with hard-to-describe expressions, whispering to each other in small voices that weren't small anymore.`
` My attempt to play dumb felt pretty transparent, even to me.`
` Did I really just say 'sorry, who is it'?!`
` Like I don't know who just showed up...!`
` Aaaaaaaaah, it's useless, it's useless, my mind's going blank...`
`'!s1`
` He's so cuuuuuuuuuuuuuute!!"`
` "Wait, he's real?!`
` No way, seriously?!"`
` "Jessica, you traitor!!`
` He's incredible!!"`
` "He's younger?!`
` I never heard he was younger!"`
` "Where where?!`
` Where, where, where's Jessie's boyfriend?!"`
` "She really is into little kids!!"`
`"H-H-H-H-Hey!`
` A-Aren't you late, wahahahahaha!"`
`"...I didn't know where the entrance was.`
` I must apologize for my tardiness."`
`"R-Right, umm, ...that outfit looks really good on you.`
` Wahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`"...Shannon...said normal clothes wouldn't do, ...so we went and bought this the other day.`
` ...Does it look strange on me...?"`
`"W-Wahahahahahahahahahahahaha, that's not true!`
` Shannon, when I get back I'll promote you two leveeeeeeeels!!"`
`"......It feels like everyone here's a girl. It's uncomfortable."`
`"Y-Y-Yeah, isn't it?!`
` C-Come on, let's not hang around here, let's go to the stage, okay?`
` 'Cause I'll be up pretty soon!`
` Come on come on come on!!"`
`Jessica seemed just as uncomfortable.`
`It looked like being bathed in everyone's interested gazes was hard on her.`
`...When he saw Jessica's appearance, Kanon thought he might have made things difficult for her by coming.`
`"...I get the feeling I'm getting in the way.`
` Am I being a burden?"`
`"I-I-I told you, no way!!"`
`"...Please tell me at any time if I start getting in the way..."`
`((Kyaa, no waaay, he calls himself 'boku'!!!!))`
`"Ahiiiiiiiii, th-th-there's no way you'd get in the way, Kanon-kun!!"`
`(((Kyaaaaaa, she calls her boyfriend 'kun'!!!)))`
`"...What would you like me to do, Milady?"`
`((((No waaaaay, she makes him call her Milady, like a butler #fefefeomgomg#ffffff!!))))`
`"Nooooooooo, you can't call me Milady todaaaaaaaaay!!"`
`".........I-Is that so?`
` As you wish, Jessica-sama."`
`(((((Kyaaaaa, she's trained him to call her 'sama'!!)))))`
`"S-S-S-Sorry, Kanon-kun, could you close your eyes for juuust three seconds...?"`
`((((((Hiiyaaaaaaa, a kiss, it's a kiss, she's gonna kiss him!!))))))`
`"...A-As you wish."`
`'!s0`
`*thunk*!`
` *bam*bam*,`
` *slam*,`
` *crash*!!`
`...By the time Kanon opened his eyes, a horrible tragedy had occurred in the room.`
`Everyone had been driven into the walls, their arms and legs outstretched.`
`Jessica had slipped her brass knuckles back into her pocket before Kanon's eyes opened.`
`"A-Anyway, let's go over to the stage.`
` Our turn's coming up soon, so take a seat and wait for a bit.`
` 'Cause we've gotta get ready!`
` Go straight to the end here and you'll see a temporary stage, you'll know where to go. Please wait there!"`
`She pushed Kanon's back, as he seemed to be having trouble moving himself, and chased him out.`
`Even though Kanon was confused by Jessica's attitude and her panicky state, which he'd never seen before, he followed her instructions and headed in the direction she had indicated.`
`After seeing him off with an awkward smile, Jessica slammed the door shut and yelled loudly.`
`"There you go, you saw, right?`
` You saw that, are you happy now?!`
` Wahahahahahahahaha, sucks for you!!!"`
`"...Ugugugugugugu, I lost the bet."`
` "I was sure Jessie didn't have a boyfriend."`
` "Are you sure that was her boyfriend? I'll bet she's just abusing one of her servants, right?"`
` "Waaaah, Jessie's boyfriend's incredibleeee...!"`
`"Sh-Sh-Shut up!!`
` Come on, let's get ready!!"`
`When Jessica took the brass knuckles out of her pocket again, everyone energetically returned to their tasks.`
`".........Haah."`
`Kanon went down the corridor Jessica had shown him...and ran into a temporary stage set up where the vending machines should have been.`
`It was probably being rented by the hour by some group or club.`
`The ones singing were student groups, but the crowd was still incredibly excited.`
`Disliking that clatter, he leaned against a wall in the darkness by himself.`
`...So this is what they call high school.`
`It sure is noisy.`
` ...That's what Kanon thought.`
`Then he remembered Jessica just now, acting in a way that he'd never seen before.`
`...Honestly, she was in such high spirits that alcohol might have been involved.`
`To him, remaining composed and intellectual at all times was the highest virtue.`
`In that sense, it was very hard for Kanon to get used to the atmosphere of a school cultural festival.`
`...He had a responsibility to report everything he saw and heard to the Master.`
`...So he also had to report about how Jessica had acted without restraint earlier.`
`...At the very least, it was not fitting for the daughter of the Ushiromiya Head Family.`
`The Master, Krauss-sama,`
` ...and especially Natsuhi-sama will probably be angry.`
`If I am to report it in a way that protects Milady, should I blame it on inappropriate school friends...?`
`"......What was all that?`
` ...So stupid."`
`Kanon thought back on how Jessica had acted earlier and sighed again.`
`He could understand Natsuhi's headache a little now.`
`...Come to think of it, Natsuhi-sama, as the president of the PTA, was supposed to go to an informal gathering after attending the ceremony in the gymnasium.`
`She said she wouldn't be able to see Milady's performance, didn't she?`
` ...That's probably for the best.`
`"......Crowds certainly are unpleasant.`
` ...What in the world is going on?"`
`Several female students keep glancing at me.`
`It seems they're all whispering the same things Milady's school friends said, and it's truly unpleasant.`
`Come to think of it, didn't Shannon warn me?`
`...If you walk alone at something like a school festival,`
` you'd better watch out, because lots of strange people will come and talk to you.`
`"E-Excuse me, are you by yourself?"`
`Just as expected, a group of girls I'd never met started talking to me.`
`Their stares started to make my back tingle.`
`...Didn't she tell me some magic words that could chase them off in times like this?`
` ...Ummm.`
`"...Sorry.`
` I'm with someone."`
`"Uh, oh, really...?!`
` I-I'm sorry!"`
`Ah, it worked.`
` Instant reaction...`
`Well, that got rid of them, but it hasn't really changed the number of people staring at me.`
`'!s1`
`"No way?!`
` It's that kid?!" `
`"I can't believe it, I was sure he was fake!" `
`"Isn't he cu-te? So he's younger?!`
` Lucky Jessie!!"`
`".........Haah."`
`...There's no way I'll ever come to a place like this again.`
`Kanon sighed for about the zillionth time that day.`
`When he did, the lighting changed, and the standing audience started cheering.`
`He looked around and realized that there was suddenly a large group of people there.`
` And unlike earlier, they were mostly guys.`
`With this huge crowd, he couldn't even see the stage.`
`Fortunately, there was a fallen beer case nearby, so he tried using that as a footstool.`
`When he did, he realized that there was now a new group on the stage.`
`Their leader is Milady.`
`She's changed into stage clothes, and she's even holding a guitar.`
`...I didn't know she could play.`
`Then again, maybe she can play.`
`I've seen her practicing air guitar before.`
`Natsuhi-sama wouldn't approve of any hobbies outside of study.`
`Maybe she was always practicing in secret.`
`...Come to think of it, she's been returning really late from school recently, hasn't she?`
`...Maybe she's been practicing at school, far away from Natsuhi-sama's prying eyes.`
`It really is for the best that Natsuhi-sama didn't come.`
`...If Milady were to get scolded by Natsuhi-sama after putting so many hours of practice in, she'd probably be dejected...`
`!s0`
`"Everyone, thaaaaaaaaaanks for gathering here today!!"`
`I could hear Jessica-sama's forceful voice through the speakers.`
`...Jessie-sama?`
` Maybe that's her nickname at school.`
`The students in the audience kept calling out that name.`
`...I'm a little offended by that crude name. It's inappropriate for Milady.`
`Jessica-sama was in high spirits as they kept shouting 'Jessie-sama'.`
`...Everyone here was probably a fan.`
`Her mike performance picked up on that and electrified them even more.`
`...It was almost like a music program on TV.`
`.........At first, he'd thought this was all silly, but that feeling had changed into appreciation.`
` It was incredible, in its own way.`
`Kanon never listened to music of his own free will, but he'd often heard the kind of music the Ushiromiya family liked.`
`...Since it was almost all classical, Kanon had naturally taken a liking to that kind of music.`
`...So to Kanon, the song Jessica sang was...how should you say it...`
` ...Extremely colorful.`
`In any case, if Natsuhi-sama heard it, she'd probably faint.`
`But everyone looked like they were having a really good time.`
`Some die-hard fans, who had even brought pen-lights,`
` sang along and danced crazily with the same movements, almost as though it had been planned ahead.`
`On the stage, Jessica-sama also sang enthusiastically, dripping with sweat.`
`......He couldn't find a single element that was appropriate for a daughter of the Ushiromiya family, `
`...but it looked like so much fun.`
`'!s1`
` Jessiiiiie, Jessiiiiiiiiiiie!!!"""`
`'!s1`
` Oyashiro-sama is stalking me!`
` Curses, disappearances,`
` sacrifices, torture,`
` Onikakushi, does that make a good snack?!`
` Don't say Marisaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`...I must not go along with it, but...`
`...At any rate, Milady is full of life and looks like she's having a great time.`
`As I watched Milady enjoying herself, I thought.`
`Could this be Ushiromiya Jessica's true nature?`
`...Don't I know better than anyone...that during her life on Rokkenjima, she's had no choice but to kill her sense of self?`
`So the time she spends...not as Milady, successor to the Ushiromiya family, `
`but as a single girl called Jessica, living life to the fullest, must be very important to her.`
`...I've worked close to Milady, seeing her in all seasons, and thought I knew everything about her.`
`...But that was all limited to one side of her, the Milady of Rokkenjima.`
`...We are furniture.`
`We serve on Rokkenjima and end our lives on Rokkenjima.`
`...So I've come to think of Rokkenjima itself as our whole world.`
` As though, like in Ptolemaic theory, `
`the ocean spilled off the end of the world into an abyss.`
`But when I look at Milady like this, I can see how horribly narrow that outlook is.`
`...I still can't go along with the excitement of the crowd.`
`...But I feel like I can see something that 'cannot be seen' on Rokkenjima.`
`......I'm not sure if this is the unseeable thing Shannon was talking about...`
`...But the ocean still doesn't look blue to me...`
`"Wasn't the cultural festival at Jessica's school today?`
` ...How is the principal doing?"`
`"...He seemed to be in good health.`
` That's right, Diet Member Takamiya was also there.`
` He said to give you his regards."`
`"Hmm, busy as usual?"`
`"It appeared so.`
` That person is also very energetic.`
` Oh, and I believe President Emoto also made an appearance."`
`Naturally, the topic of Jessica's cultural festival came up at dinner.`
`School events often became social gatherings for local volunteers.`
`It was the same for the Ushiromiya family, who were celebrities around here.`
`Natsuhi remembered the name of one VIP after another at that social gathering, telling Krauss the news about them.`
`...Jessica didn't really have any interest in that discussion and rudely slurped her pumpkin soup.`
`"...Milady,`
` perhaps you ought to take more care with your manners."`
`".........Yeah, yeah, sorry 'bout that."`
`"Jessica,`
` how many times must I tell you to watch your language?"`
`"...Yes Ma'am."`
`Jessica answered, discouraged.`
`When he saw that, Krauss smiled a little and paused his conversation with Natsuhi.`
`"How was the festival for you, Jessica?"`
`"Huh?`
` Ah, `
`...well, it was okay!"`
`"I was watching.`
` You did an excellent job."`
`"Huh, ...huh?!`
` ...A-Ahahahaha, w-well!"`
`Jessica's face turned bright red.`
`...She probably hadn't imagined that Natsuhi would actually come to see her on stage.`
`She felt a mix of happiness and embarrassment.`
`Actually, she hadn't really wanted her mother to watch, since she didn't want to be told that her music was inappropriate for the Ushiromiya family.`
`...But it certainly didn't make her unhappy to hear a parent say she'd done a good job, after watching her try her best...`
`"Jessica acted with both composure and dignity.`
` Fitting behavior for the students' representative."`
`'!s1`
`......oh, `
`...yeah."`
`The smile that had been there until a second ago crumbled like sand.`
`...Jessica immediately realized that her mom was talking about something different.`
`Jessica was also the school's student president.`
`...She had no interest in doing something so annoying, but her parents had been pushy, so she'd grudgingly accepted.`
`Unfortunately, she was popular at school, so she won the election easily.`
`So, Natsuhi was praising her for the student council sponsorship ceremony at the beginning of the cultural festival.`
`Actually, she had just carried that out halfheartedly.`
`After that, she immediately met up with her friends and held a stage rehearsal for the rest of the time...`
`"That experience of standing above people and bearing responsibility will surely prove useful in the future.`
` I'm sure it will help Jessica mature as a member of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"But you rushed a little while giving the greeting.`
` You get a pass on content, but the fast pace of your speech lessened the impact.`
` It might help if you developed a habit of pausing every once in a while."`
`"............Yeah."`
`After she finished eating, Jessica didn't feel like going straight to her room.`
`Her room was basically the place her parents had ordered her to be.`
`So perhaps for Jessica, instead of returning to her own room, `
`being in an unknown location in this large mansion was a meager form of resistance...`
`Jessica felt that even being in the mansion made it hard to breathe, so she went outside to the rose garden.`
`".........`
`...Well, even if she did show up, I'm sure she would've said something about how it wasn't appropriate for a successor of the Ushiromiya Family.`
` ...So isn't it better this way?`
` Ahahahahahaha."`
`Jessica laughed at what she was sulking over.`
`...She laughed at what kind of words she could possibly have been expecting.`
`...That was dumb of me.`
`In the end, I was just acting like an entitled brat.`
`I'm a little exasperated with myself, and it makes me want to laugh.`
`"...Milady."`
`"Wah, ...Kanon-kun.`
` D-Don't scare me like that, hahaha...!`
` *cough*cough*!"`
`Just as she was about to force a laugh, Kanon suddenly started talking to her, and she choked.`
`"What's up?`
` Got something to say...?"`
`'!s1`
`Umm."`
`"...Yes?"`
`Jessica's expression became the one she always wore when looking at Kanon.`
`The listless Jessica from a second ago was gone.`
`If he had still only known Jessica as the eventual successor to the Ushiromiya family, as he had until yesterday,`
` ...he might have mistakenly thought that Jessica's mood had sprung back to normal.`
`...But that wasn't right.`
`He now knew a part of her that he couldn't have 'seen' until yesterday, `
`so he understood that there was no way Jessica actually felt the way she appeared.`
`"Oh, ...about today's cultural festival...`
` ...Well, thanks for coming with me so I could show off.`
` You saved my butt out there."`
`"...That song.`
` ...You were really good."`
`"Wha?!`
`'!s1`
`......ahahahahahaha?!`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, jes_2e234:`
`Even though she had heard the words she most wanted to hear,`
` Jessica acted shyly and couldn't accept them openly.`
`"...I cannot sing.`
` And I don't know how to play any instruments other than the harmonica and the recorder, which I learned in elementary school.`
` ...So I simply assumed you were the same, Milady."`
`...At the time, Kanon had never felt as though he'd been looking down on Jessica in this way.`
`But all the people he'd seen playing special instruments were on the other side of the Braun tubes in the TV.`
`...At the very least, he'd been under the impression that it'd be impossible for Jessica.`
`"...I am furniture.`
` ...So I didn't believe there was any need to sing or play instruments."`
`But...`
`I'm not sure anymore.`
`"...Seriously, Kanon-kun, `
`enough with that 'I am furniture' business...`
` That's like a proper attitude you servants are supposed to have, right...?`
` Servants are supposed to be like living furniture.`
` ...Genji-san says it a lot."`
`"It isn't just a proper attitude...`
` ...Because we really are...furniture."`
`"I know the kids from the Fukuin House...receive assistance from Grandfather in various ways,`
` and I realize how grateful you are for that.`
` ...But it's a bit cruel for you to have to call yourself furniture just because of that.`
` We're all human, aren't we?"`
`"............"`
`"Kanon-kun, when you saw me singing, ...what did you think?"`
`"...It looked like you were having a lot of fun."`
`"I don't think that's true."`
`"...Huh?"`
`"You didn't just think it looked fun.`
` ...You were envious, weren't you?"`
`".........`
`That's not..."`
`Kanon probably hadn't noticed that emotion himself.`
`...Most likely, Kanon saw something he'd never seen before, learned about it for the first time, ...and felt envious.`
`And to trick himself out of that emotion, he'd called himself furniture over and over...`
`"I know I'm a successor to the Ushiromiya family or whatever,`
` ...and, well, I'm sure there'll be a lot of annoying stuff to do from now on.`
` As far as that goes, I can't do anything but give up, since I was born under an unlucky star."`
`"...Probably, just like you had to live at the Fukuin House, I don't have a choice either.`
` I couldn't choose the stars under which I was born."`
`"......That may be true."`
`"But there's one place where you and I are completely different.`
` ...Know what that is?"`
`I am furniture, and Milady is not.`
` ...He was about to say that, but stopped.`
`"...I do not know."`
`"Kanon-kun, you decided that your fate determines everything about you, and you gave up.`
` But I can't accept this kind of fate, so I do the best I can.`
` ...So, while there's still the rigid and cornered 'me' that's gotta stay as the daughter of the Ushiromiya family, `
`I've created another 'me' that can do what I like to the fullest."`
`"......Another...you."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...Kanon-kun, you've been instructed to say 'because I am furniture'.`
` ...I'm sure you've gone through a lot of tough times just because of that.`
` ...I think that's...`
`...really unfortunate.`
` ......But the idea that your entire life'll be decided by that alone...just seems sad to me."`
`".................."`
`"You know, it's always possible for people to create another 'self' inside them, a self that they can truly grow to like.`
` I'm not talking about escaping from reality, okay?`
` ...When I'm that other self, I can really feel like I'm living a great life.`
` So no matter how constrained and boring everyday life gets to be, I can always live on without suffocating."`
`'!s1`
`another self inside yourself...`
`that you can truly grow to like..."`
`To make another me, one that isn't furniture...`
`Through her relationship with George-sama, has Shannon given birth to another self that isn't furniture?`
`...And did this other Shannon...see something that cannot be 'seen' by furniture?`
`"That's right.`
` ......Well, I don't know anything about your private life, Kanon-kun.`
` But...I can sorta guess.`
` Your private life...probably doesn't exist at all.`
` Am I right...?"`
`Kanon couldn't reply, but that was answer enough.`
`He had no concept of a private life.`
`So, Kanon would always be Kanon.`
`So, furniture would always be furniture.`
`"...Kanon-kun, Kanon isn't your real name, right?"`
`In the Fukuin House, new graduates would be given new families and a new life, so they were also given a new name.`
`...In his case, that was 'Kanon'.`
`"......Certainly, ...this name of mine may be a temporary thing."`
`Before, he had thought of himself as Kanon, and no one else.`
`...But he remembered.`
`...There definitely had been another self that wasn't Kanon.`
`But that was far, far away, beyond the distant fog of oblivion...`
`"So even for you, it should be okay to have times when you're Kanon-kun, and times when you aren't.`
` ...Maybe when you act as a servant, that Kanon-kun calls himself furniture and strictly limits his own will."`
`"...But when you aren't Kanon-kun, I think it's okay to live much, much more freely."`
`Those words definitely weren't just lip-service.`
`Jessica had also been like this in the past.`
`She had cursed her own birth into an environment different from all of her friends at school.`
`Only she had been in a heavily constricted environment, forced to learn all sorts of things,`
` and she had even been told whom she was and wasn't allowed to play with.`
`...It may have been sad, but she'd given up, resigning herself to the fact that she'd been born under that kind of star.`
`But one day, Jessica stopped giving up and surrendering.`
`Stuff like Ushiromiya family customs and pressure didn't matter.`
`She created a real 'Jessica' inside herself, one who could do what she really wanted to do.`
`"You know, I go by the nickname Jessie at school.`
` When I'm Jessie, I live life honestly and to the fullest.`
` And because of that, I can do my best when I'm Jessica too."`
`"...Would it really be so bad...`
`if you could also have times when you're Kanon, and times when you're...umm, `
`...your real name?`
` ...When you aren't Kanon, ...can't you try becoming another self that you can like?"`
`"............A time when...I am not Kanon."`
`He'd once thought of his real name as being completely meaningless.`
`Because of that, he'd thought that 'Kanon' summed up everything about him.`
`And now, Jessica was telling him to create something new, another self that wasn't Kanon.`
`"...Kanon-kun,`
` if you don't mind, tell me.`
` ...What's...your real name?"`
`"..............."`
`He was silent for quite some time.`
`Maybe Kanon's real name had risen to the tip of his tongue.`
`...After hesitating for a long time over whether he should say it, `
`...in the end, `
`...he swallowed it back down.`
`"...I forgot.`
` ...My name doesn't matter anymore."`
`Those words contained a faint rejection.`
`"No matter what kind of real name I had,`
` ...the only truth now is that here, I am Kanon.`
` The past has nothing to do with anything.`
` ...The materials with which furniture is made, be it a trunk of a tree or otherwise, are meaningless in the end."`
`"...I told you to stop that!`
` You aren't furniture, you're human, right?!"`
`"I am not human!"`
`Kanon clearly voiced his refusal.`
`...It was with a rage that he normally didn't show.`
`Jessica couldn't say anything back and was struck silent...`
`"...You are human, Milady.`
` So you are free to live any way you please,`
` and any kind of future is possible for you.`
` It's almost like you have wings and can dance through the sky like a bird.`
` But I am not like that.`
` Even if I looked like a bird, I'd be nothing more than a domestic duck.`
` ...Even though they have wings, they cannot fly."`
`'!s1`
` ...It's just...`
`too cruel...!"`
`"...Furniture and ducks!!`
` What the hell is all this?!!`
` ......No. ......"`
`Jessica had unconsciously gone along with Kanon's forceful manner of speaking, but she realized that she shouldn't fire back and swallowed her words.`
`"......I don't know anything about you.`
` I don't even know your upbringing, and I don't know the hardships you've been through.`
` ...So I can't even imagine why you started calling yourself furniture."`
`"...But know this.`
` You aren't furniture or a duck.`
` You're a real human."`
`"..............."`
`"If you want to say Kanon-kun's furniture when he's working as a servant, that's fine.`
` ...But...in that case,`
` ...don't you think you can create a self for when you aren't furniture, for when you're human?"`
`"...Only a human like Milady can embrace that possibility.`
` ...I am not like that.`
` I have no future, no possibilities, ...no dream that I am allowed to see.`
` ......So, Milady, `
`'!s1`
`say any more...`
`...cruel things..."`
`"Why...`
` Why...do you say stuff like that...?"`
`"Because it seems you mistakenly think I'm a human, the same as you, Milady.`
` We are different sorts of beings.`
` I just wanted to make that clear."`
`"...I heard from Shannon.`
` Something about Milady liking me."`
`"Huh, ...wha?!`
` Ah, ......no, wahaha..."`
`"...I look almost identical to a human.`
` So, ......like Shannon, I could probably delude myself into thinking I'm human...and pretend to love, for a time."`
`"...But then, I would surely be fooling myself.`
` No, I would be fooling you too, Milady.`
` Shannon and George-sama will definitely fall apart.`
` ...Even though Shannon herself probably realizes that day will come, ...she's taking part in such a stupid..."`
`"...Th-There's nothing stupid about it!!`
` Sure, George nii-san's a wonderful person, and he's gotta match up to his parents' expectations.`
` ...I'm sure when it comes to marriage, Aunt Eva'll interfere in various ways, and, umm, I think their future prospects look like they'll be full of trouble, okay?!`
` ...But you know what? George nii-san isn't the kind of guy who'll surrender to that shit!`
` Shannon's no Juliet, and he'll definitely bring her happiness!!"`
`"People cannot engage in romance with furniture.`
` ...What I'm trying to say...is that even if you can love furniture, I cannot love you, Milady."`
`"............Nn-"`
`Those words of Kanon's...crushed all of Jessica's bittersweet feelings from that day.`
`There was no way her emotions could've predicted that she'd be refused so bluntly...`
`In an instant, she lost the willpower that had led her to try and unravel something stubborn in Kanon's heart,`
` ...and before she knew it, she was just standing there in shock...`
`"...Milady, if your feelings for me were due to my conceit, then I must ask that you forgive me."`
`"...N-No.`
` Well, ...I won't deny that."`
`"...Thank you very much."`
`"Huh...?"`
`"Thank you very much...`
`for thinking of me as a human.`
` Those feelings alone really do make me happy.`
` ...Anything more would be too cruel for me, so..."`
`"No, I-I've said enough.`
` ...Umm, `
`......sorry about that."`
`Jessica recklessly scratched at her head and spoke, trying to force her voice to sound bright.`
`'!s1`
`...ran on ahead by myself...`
`and was a burden on you.`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, jes_2e321:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, jes_2e322:`
`"No.`
` ...I was also...happy that I could see you having fun."`
`"Then...let's call it a night.`
` ...If I don't go back to my room and turn off the lights, Mom'll get mad at me again.`
` ...Hahaha."`
`"That's probably for the best.`
` ...I wish you a good night, Milady."`
`"...Yeah.`
` ......Good night......"`
`Kanon saw Jessica trod away with her back to him, looking disheartened.`
`But then, she suddenly broke into a reckless dash and disappeared in the direction of the mansion...`
`As he watched her back, ...for just an instant, `
`Kanon was tormented by the feeling that he'd just made a huge mistake.`
`...But he hadn't made a mistake at all.`
`...He'd been forced to refuse her now for her sake, while the pain was still at its smallest.`
`"......Nice going, making a woman cry like that.`
` *cackle*cackle*`
` I didn't expect you to refuse her that strongly.`
` ...If you'd given a normal answer, another pair of lovers would've been born thanks to my magic."`
`"How long have you been there...?`
` ......What a horrible person."`
`When he turned around, the witch was suddenly there.`
`...It looked like she'd been there the whole time, watching the two of them as though enjoying a play.`
`"I shall forgive you for your insults just this once, in deference to that amusing little show.`
` ...Even after a thousand years, no more interesting show exists than complications between boys and girls.`
` To me, it's a pleasure that's better and more addictive than opium.`
` ...Hmm?"`
`Kanon pulled the butterfly brooch out of his pocket.`
`It was the manifestation of the great magic the witch had bestowed.`
`Without hesitation, Kanon slammed it against the ground and stomped on it.`
`"...Hoh?`
` What is the meaning of this? You know that was given by me."`
`"Just now, I figured it out.`
` ...What you're doing isn't as tasteful as being a cupid of love.`
` You're just a demon who enjoys showing love to those who can never be together, deceiving them."`
`"......Hmph.`
` ...You are free to think that.`
` Most humans I lend my power to say the same thing."`
`"Don't play dumb!!`
` You didn't lend Shannon your power because you felt sorry for her.`
` ...You found a weak point in Shannon's heart as her chest burned with love, and you made her break the mirror that sealed you.`
` What's more, `
`...you guessed how this would all end, and now you're toying with her!`
` Am I wrong?!"`
`"Hehheheheheh, *cackle*!`
` Furniture has a thoroughly pitiful existence.`
` So, you have no dreams, no future, and even no love?`
` Good, good, there is nothing better than knowing your place.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......Nngg..."`
`"As you noticed, there was a faint love residing in Jessica's heart.`
` You seem to think you've snipped it in the bud."`
`"...But did you know?`
` Trees grow thicker branches if you thin out and prune them.`
` ...A girl who loves furniture, is it?`
` Amusing, how truly amusing!`
` Shannon and George will also eventually reach a stalemate with their unfulfillable love, ripening into the sort of large fruit I love."`
`"However, regretfully, it seems to be going so smoothly for those two that it's hardly entertaining anymore.`
` But on the plus side, it seems the two of you will amuse me to no end, *cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch laughed.`
`Even though she had known the two could never be together, she had lent magic to bring them together.`
`However, they couldn't escape the fate that prevented them from ever being truly joined.`
`...The witch knew that.`
`Even if they were joined, Shannon and George, Kanon and Jessica would eventually break up.`
` They would wander through an endless desert in this hell of love, tormented by an eternal thirst...!`
`"What, did you think I'd lend you my power and ask for nothing in exchange?`
` I'll gladly assist a pair in love.`
` And in exchange, I'll enjoy watching the cruel fate they'll eventually meet.`
` I have never come across a better show, not over the course of a thousand years...!"`
`"Just look at Kinzo.`
` See how he ended up: an old, pitiful man who learned the taste of love before being thrown out of paradise!`
` Look at how he lives, like a dead man that cannot fully die.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"You truly are a witch.`
` Disappear! Get out of my sight, demon...!!"`
`"...Oh, I would disappear even without your prompting.`
` My power still hasn't returned.`
` It is still tiring to continue showing myself.`
` ...I overdid it when I gave you lovers my power.`
` ...As I am now, it will not be easy to maintain that power without that brooch as a catalyst."`
`Kanon ground his foot even more into the stomped brooch.`
`He felt it break under his foot.`
`Then, it evaporated like water...`
`and changed into butterflies that sparkled gold, fluttering out from beneath Kanon's foot...`
`"Maintaining this form is quite painful for me as well.`
` I will hide myself for a time, just as you desire.`
` My magical power will rise as surely as the moon and the tides.`
` ...And eventually, a fitting time will come for my revival."`
`"...I know not in the slightest whether that will be tomorrow, next year, or even a hundred or a thousand years in the future.`
` But as long as there are those who entertain me, I will surely gain power and revive.`
` ...I will disappear for a short while, ...until that time comes."`
`"The bruise on the palm of your hand is already gone, `
`so if you wish, tomorrow morning, you can let my existence vanish like an illusion or a dream.`
` ...After all, nothing saddens me more than being forgotten."`
`"However, I will surely be revived.`
` Be on your guard, so that you will not regret that day's coming when it arrives.`
` I will surely have my second coming and rule over everything as this island's true master.`
` ...That is the time when the door to the Golden Land will be opened again.`
` ...The greedy dead will surely wake me...!"`
`"...You talk too much!!`
` Disappear, now, Golden Witch...!!"`
`The witch became a cloud of gold butterflies and scattered away, leaving behind a scornful laugh.`
`...The whole area sparkled like a gold blizzard in a snow globe.`
`It was a fleeting fantastical scene that disappeared in a heartbeat...`
`The witch could no longer be seen.`
`...However, Kanon felt like he could still hear that shrill, unpleasant laugh...`
`...Aah, how amusing, how truly amusing.`
`Why is the human world still so amusing after all the years I've been away?!`
`Go mad with love.`
` Go mad with gold.`
`Those who don't go mad from one of the two are not human!`
`I see, so that's why the word 'furniture' is so fitting, *cackle*cackle*!`
`Furniture is created to serve humans.`
`And I cruelly treat humans as playthings to sate my thousand years of boredom.`
`What a truly amusing three-way deadlock, that I cannot control furniture!`
`Kinzo, you fool, what a truly entertaining scheme you've worked out!`
`Furniture, you fools, just you try and see if you can fell me...!`
`Tonight, two seeds of love have been sown.`
`...Including the one already sown, that makes three!`
`"Beatrice...`
` Why...did you leave me alone in this painful world...?`
` ...I hate you.`
` I will hate you for all eternity for not even trying to answer, despite being yearned for so...!"`
`"Master, drinking any more will be damaging to your health.`
` ...Doctor Nanjo warned you as well, did he not?"`
`"Be silent, Genji!!`
` You do not understand, you do not understand my grief and sadness!`
` And I believed at least you, my oldest friend, would understand my pain!!`
` Why can you not understand?!`
` Oooooohhh, Beatriiiiiice, `
`why did you leave me all alooooone...?!!"`
`".................."`
`"Aaaaaaaagggghhh!`
` Hic, hic...!`
` What the hell do you mean, furniture?!`
` I don't get it...!`
` Aaaaahhhh!!"`
`"...Oooh, poor Jessica-sama.`
` ...Even though the cries I hear coming from your room tell me of the situation, there is nothing I can do.`
` ...This is all a tragedy due to a pair who are too young getting too close, when the positions of their birth are too distant.`
` ...I can do nothing but understand Milady's feelings, hide my footsteps, and quietly walk away..."`
`'!s1`
`...wh-`
`what...`
`do you mean by that, `
`George-san...?"`
`"I mean what I said.`
` ...I still haven't built up my castle.`
` Once I manage to do that, I'll finally be able to think of myself as an adult.`
` ...When that happens, I want to marry you."`
`"...Th-`
`That's, umm, `
`...err..."`
`"But...`
`my heart won't let me do that anymore.`
` ...So I want to give you an engagement ring."`
`'!s1`
`...you say...`
` But, umm, `
`......I...`
`...am.........`
`...furniture......"`
`"Oh, right, that.`
` Well then, furniture has to listen to what people say, right?`
` ...Right now, I'm having a ring made that'll be fitting for you.`
` I think it'll be ready in time for me to bring it to the upcoming family conference.`
` I'll give it to you then, so please, I want you to let me hear your answer."`
`"...If you accept,`
` then I'll proclaim our engagement right there, in front of all the relatives including Grandfather."`
`"...G-George-san......"`
`"I'm sure some people won't approve of our relationship.`
` ...But there's no need to look at their faces.`
` ...Because you only have to fill your eyes with me."`
`"I will definitely bring you happiness.`
` That's the one thing I can promise you with certainty."`
`I just can't wait to see how it will ripen!`
`The gold butterflies do not swoop upon the juice of overripe and rotting fruit.`
`I cannot wait for the day of harvest to come!`
` Is the time of the banquet here yet?!`
` *cackle*cackle*hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
`They had eaten breakfast at a coffee shop in the station building.`
`...By chance, the inside of the shop had been decorated with Halloween colors, since it was October.`
`Maria had seemed to be awfully pleased with that.`
`For quite some time, she talked loudly inside the train about wanting to have a Halloween festival, without caring that she was attracting the attention of others.`
`Halloween is popular in Europe and America, but people aren't that familiar with it in Japan.`
`The shopping district was colorfully decorated with orange pumpkins, `
`but the costume parades of children demanding sweets and saying 'trick or treat' were nowhere in sight.`
`"Uu-!`
` I want a Halloween festival!`
` I don't wanna wear these clothes, I wanna look like a witch!`
` Uu-uu-!"`
`"The family conference isn't for playing.`
` We're going to meet Grandfather, so you have to dress up nice."`
`While it wasn't completely full inside the train, it was really packed, with almost all the seats occupied by passengers.`
`Maria was making a fuss among them, stomping her feet on the seat while Rosa scowled at her.`
`Rosa had warned her many times to lower her voice, but Maria hadn't obeyed her at all.`
`...Once Maria got like this, no matter how much you tried to explain the situation or calm her, she wouldn't listen.`
`Before, Rosa used to pamper Maria and give in to her at times like this.`
`But...that had probably been a mistake.`
`Surely, Maria had gained the mistaken impression that throwing a tantrum long enough would make her mother give up and do what Maria said.`
`Rosa had realized that error with the help of an educational book, and since then, `
`she'd hardened the part of her heart that wanted to pamper her beloved daughter...`
`Her mutual understanding with Maria began to grow weaker and weaker, and she began to get discouraged by her own powerlessness more and more often...`
`"Halloween, Halloween!!`
` If you don't give me sweets, I'll play a prank, uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"I don't have any sweets to give you!`
` We just ate breakfast!"`
`"If you don't give me sweets, I'll play a prank!`
` If you don't give me sweets, I'll play a prank!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`A stout old woman, who was sitting nearby as Maria stomped her feet, picked a candy out of her handbag and held it out to Maria.`
`"Uu-! I got a sweet, I got a sweet!`
` Look, look, Mama, `
`Mama!`
` <Happy Halloween>!"`
`"Hey, Maria, you can't just accept sweets from strangers, right?!`
` Give it back!!"`
`"Oh, don't worry about it, ho ho ho.`
` She's such a spirited young lady.`
` How old is she?"`
`Maybe there was no malice in the old woman's words.`
` ...However, Rosa seemed to find that remark extremely humiliating.`
`"Maria, haven't I always told you not to accept sweets from strangers?!!"`
`"Uu-!`
` Uu-!!`
` She gave it to me!!`
` Uu-`
`uu-!!`
` No, it's mine!!"`
`"Let go of it!`
` How many times do I have to tell you to do what Mama says?!!"`
`"It's mine!!`
` Miiiiine!!`
`'!s0`
` Uuu--uuu--!!"`
`"Don't I always tell you not to say uu-uu-?!!"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`Rosa reflexively hit Maria violently on her cheek.`
`...In a flash, Maria started crying loudly.`
`Rosa immediately took the candy from Maria's hand and pushed it back towards the dumbfounded old woman sitting next to them.`
`"...Please, do not just give sweets to my daughter!"`
`".........I-I'm so sorry."`
`Breathing heavily, Rosa once again held the candy out to the old woman.`
`...After getting flustered about what she should say for a few moments, `
`perhaps the old woman realized that her actions may have troubled this parent and child, `
`and she accepted the candy back, apologizing...`
`After that, Rosa finally took notice of her surroundings...`
`Her daughter's clothes were all messed up, she was crying and shouting with her nose dripping, `
`and there were many dumbfounded passengers watching them.`
`...Except for the sound of the train running, the interior was completely silent.`
`Fortunately, that pitiful silence didn't last more than a short while.`
`...However, it was followed by an even more painful atmosphere as everyone began to whisper.`
`Maria shouted, cried, kicked and stomped her feet as usual, paying no heed to the people sitting around her.`
`...Impulsively, Rosa tried to slap her again, `
`but she noticed the cold eyes of the people in the train...and couldn't.`
`When the train stopped, Rosa forcibly pulled Maria's arm and got off, almost dragging her daughter along.`
`Maria didn't stop crying.`
`Rosa took her to the end of the platform and hit her cheek again.`
`At the moment she was hit, Maria stopped crying for an instant, but before long, she shouted and cried even more than before.`
`Overwhelmed with emotion, Rosa grabbed the nape of Maria's neck and dragged her, tugging at her hair.`
`"Uu-!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Uu-!!`
` Mama, it hurts, Mama, it hurts!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`'!s0`
` That uu-uu- of yours!`
` I told you to stop!!`
` That's the reason you can't make friends in class, right?!`
` Get ahold of yourself!!`
` Why are you still a kindergartner inside your head?!!`
` Why can't you do what Mama says?!!`
` Why?!!`
` Why?!!!"`
`With those severe words, Rosa hit Maria's cheek over and over again.`
`The more Maria cried and shouted, the more Rosa hit her.`
`And the more Maria was hit, the more intensely she cried and shouted...`
`"Mama, it hurts...!`
` Mama, it hurts...!`
` Mama, save me, Mama, save me...!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`'!s0`
` This is exactly why you can't make friends!!`
` This is why Papa's business trip never ends!!`
` This is why I-"`
`"Um, ...excuse me, ...Ma'am, is everything all right...?"`
`"Do you...want something...?!"`
`The one who timidly called to her was the station attendant.`
`Rosa glared at the attendant with a look that said 'don't butt into the problems of a mother and child, stranger'.`
`Of course, the attendant surely hadn't wanted to get involved either.`
`However, Rosa had been yelling on the platform for a much longer time than she had imagined.`
`...Her emotional scolding had led the passengers on the platform to advise the attendant to call out to her.`
`Rosa yelled at the attendant, saying not to worry anymore, since they'd be getting on the next train.`
`...And then, finally...or rather, for the second time, ...she noticed the passengers on the platform staring at her from a distance.`
`...Rosa sweat slightly and felt a breeze make her sweat go cold, tormenting her.`
`Maria still kept on crying, shielding her own head.`
`...Of course, if this beating continued, she'd probably keep crying indefinitely.`
`'!s1`
`......I did it...`
`......again..."`
`As the terrible heat in Rosa's head faded, `
`...she knew she had surrendered her soul to evil again.`
`"Mama, Mama!`
` Mama, come back...!`
` Uu-!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`Rosa fell to her knees and hugged Maria, whose face was all soggy with tears and mucus.`
`"......Maria, ...I'm sorry. ...I'm so sorry..."`
`"Mama, ...Mama...`
` Welcome back, welcome back..."`
`Finally, ...Maria realized that her mother was her mother again.`
`She clung to her mother's body and cried, burying her face in her mother's chest.`
`"...Forgive your bad Mama...`
` Forgive your bad Mama...`
` ......I'm so...sorry...!`
` Please, don't hate your Mama..."`
`"Uu-...`
` I'm just fine...`
` Won't hate Mama.`
` ...Mama was only being possessed by the bad witch again.`
` ...But you came back, so I'm just fine."`
`"Yeah, ...that's right...`
` ...Mama was just...being possessed by the evil witch again...`
` ...I'm sorry, ...I'm so sorry..."`
`For a long time, the two of them hugged each other, asking for and sharing words of forgiveness.`
`After a while, they calmed down, and both moved back at the same time.`
`Maria's face and Rosa's face...were both deep red after crying their eyes out.`
`"...Do you want to have a Halloween festival, Maria?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...I wanted to show those pumpkin marshmallows to George onii-chan and Jessica onee-chan..."`
`It was a candy they'd been selling near the cash register at the shop where they'd eaten breakfast.`
`...A fancy sweet that had a big orange marshmallow in the shape of a jack o'lantern attached to the tip of a stick.`
`Maria had wanted it and had insistently pestered Rosa for it.`
`...Rosa had refused, saying that there was no way she could buy sweets right after breakfast.`
`"...Then, Maria,`
` ...I don't know if they sell those in this town or not, but let's get off and try searching for them, okay?"`
`"...Y-Yeah!`
` I love you Mama, love you so much...`
` Thank you..."`
`"I love you too, Maria..."`
`The truth was that they didn't have time to waste loitering around at a stopover station.`
`If they missed the airplane, they'd fall half a day behind schedule.`
`She should have left home with more time to spare, but she'd ended up leaving late after choosing Maria's clothes.`
`...Because of that, Rosa had been a bit impatient since the morning.`
`She looked at the clock.`
` ...They had to get on the next train immediately.`
`But, her daughter firmly joined hands with her to go buy the sweet with her mother, and that hand was warm.`
`...To Rosa as she was now, it was more important to renew her bonds with Maria.`
`...To her, Maria was not only a beloved daughter, ...she was everything Rosa had.`
`Fortunately, they could see a big supermarket right in front of the station.`
`...They might not be able to find exactly the same sweet, but Maria would probably be happy with a similar one.`
`Besides, Rosa couldn't show up with a face swelled from crying.`
` She must fix her make-up.`
`"Maybe we won't find a marshmallow exactly like that one, ...but hopefully we can find something like it.`
` ...Let's buy some and surprise all your cousins together."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...As long as we buy it together, any sweet is fine."`
`They exited through the turnstiles of the station in this unknown town.`
`Maria walked across the pedestrian crossing together with her mother, chuckling to herself, as though she was walking in an amusement park.`
`Both faces were still deep red, `
`...but the two of them, mother and child, smiled warmly at each other without any restraint...`
`"......Dear,`
` what are you doing in a place like this?"`
`"Oh, it's you.`
` ......It's nothing.`
` I just find this a pleasant place to think."`
`"...All of our preparations for today have been completed.`
` Why don't we have some tea and relax while we wait?"`
`"......Forgive me.`
` I'm always making you handle such troublesome matters."`
`"...Please,`
` rely on me even more.`
` ...I am your wife."`
`"...Naturally, I'm grateful to have you always coming to my aid.`
` ...That's precisely why I am able to devote myself to my work."`
`"I understand.`
` ...I understand about your work.`
` And the topic of Father's inheritance, right?"`
`"......That has nothing to do with you.`
` It's nothing more than fishing for rotten meat amongst greedy siblings."`
`"...It's okay, dear.`
` ...Everything will go well.`
` Your businesses have never failed to work themselves out."`
`"............"`
`Natsuhi softly cuddled close to Krauss's shoulder.`
`She complimented Krauss on his hard work, ...but Natsuhi knew better than anyone that his work wasn't going well.`
`...Krauss's project was something like a seesaw where a large amount of money swings.`
`Big investments can lead to massive payoffs, `
`but like large seesaws, they tend to shake a lot while moving very slowly, instead of showing immediate results.`
`At times, it's possible to make further investments, so that the seesaw inclines faster towards the side you want.`
`...Of course, you'd only do that if you were confident you'd be able to recover all your investments in the not-so-distant future.`
`...However, the seesaws Krauss chose never turned out as he would have liked them to.`
`...His foresight wasn't wrong, ...but the times were moving sluggishly.`
` They never managed to catch up with him.`
`For example, think of a literal seesaw, placed in a park.`
`It's a really popular item, so there's always someone playing on it, `
`and you've got to wait a long time for your turn.`
`...Let's say that one day, you spotted one of those seesaws that was completely unused, and you raced to grab it first and have it all to yourself.`
`However, ...unless someone got on the opposite side of the seesaw, you wouldn't be able to play on it.`
`What if lots of time passed...and nobody came to the opposite end?`
`Seesaws are popular, so if you wait long enough, a companion will surely show up.`
`...But Krauss noticed something.`
`The weather's getting worse.`
`So, nobody's coming outside to play.`
`But seesaws are popular, so someone will surely come eventually.`
`...If he vacated his place because of the worsening weather, it would certainly be snatched away, `
`and once again, he'd end up longingly gazing from a distance at someone else having fun on the seesaw...`
`On one side of the seesaw, he continued to wait patiently, all alone...`
`That was Krauss's project...and his current situation.`
`".........If only I'd had a bit more courage...and the self-confidence to believe in my own foresight,`
` ...I would never...have failed."`
`"...Yes, that's true.`
` Your foresight is never wrong.`
` ...You are the only one who inherited Father's resourcefulness.`
` You inherited an innate disposition that none of the other siblings did."`
`"...But I could never believe in it!`
` I always shut my own projects down like a coward.`
` ...Why can't I believe in myself?!`
` Who would believe in a man who can't believe in himself?`
` Nobody believes!!"`
`"...I'm always sitting on the seat where the losers must sit...`
`...and my father, my mother, `
`...my siblings all sneer at me...`
` How long is it going to take for me to be set free of this emotional complex...?`
` Just how long will it take...?"`
`...Natsuhi was the only one who knew.`
`Only she knew of Krauss's anguish.`
` As the eldest son of the Ushiromiya family, who would soon be forced to bear an immense responsibility, `
`he couldn't open his pained heart to anyone, and was always getting compared to his father's great enterprises...`
`"...I've made preparations concerning all other matters, so that you will be able to devote your attention entirely to the family conference.`
` ...Yes, everything else has been seen to."`
`"......Thank you.`
` ...Will there be...`
`...any problems dealing with Father?"`
`"No.`
` ...Genji and Doctor Nanjo are on our side.`
` ...I'll never allow those greedy siblings to make contact with Father."`
`"Hello, Gohda here.`
` ...Yes, please leave it to me!`
` I'm anxious to put my skills to work for the big annual job."`
`In the kitchen, multicolored ingredients were gathered and the preliminary arrangements were promptly being started.`
`Even though it was still morning, the ingredients for dinner were already in saucepans and steaming.`
`Normally, he had to deal with several assorted matters, but on the day of the family conference, he could devote himself entirely to cooking.`
`To Gohda, who was originally a chef, this was surely the greatest gala occasion of the whole year.`
`"Yes, dinner will be calf steak...!`
` A wonderful cut of meat is already anxiously waiting for tonight in the refrigerator.`
` Please, be sure to look forward to dinner."`
`It was rare for Gohda to be in this good of a mood towards his fellow servants.`
`Gohda bragged about being the Ushiromiya family's personal chef, and knowing he was considered worthy to display his excellent cooking at the family conference was his greatest honor.`
`"...Understood.`
` I will leave everything to you.`
` ...Also, is Kumasawa there?"`
`"Kumasawa-san?`
` I happened to see her earlier, but she is not here.`
` Perhaps she went to get things ready in the guesthouse."`
`"...Is she loafing around again?`
` ...No, it is fine.`
` Please continue with your work."`
`"Yes, leave everything to me, Gohda...!"`
`Genji placed the telephone back on the receiver, sighing lightly.`
`Genji sighed once again, thinking of Kumasawa, who was probably hiding again even though things were this busy,`
` and the ostentatious Gohda, who only felt like doing anything on a day when he could show off.`
`"Excuse me.`
` The preparations for all the rooms in the guesthouse are complete."`
`"...We received instructions from Milady to prepare a room for four people, so that the children can spend the night together, ...so what shall we do?"`
`"...I hear Battler-sama will be coming for the first time in six years.`
` Presumably, Milady wants to stay up late into the night with her three cousins.`
` ...Make the preparations.`
` You do not need to tell Madam."`
`"I see.`
` Certainly."`
`"...So, tonight, we'll have the late night shift, followed immediately by the morning shift.`
` It looks like these two days will be tiresome."`
`"Speaking of which, the weather forecast is saying a typhoon will strike in this area...`
` Will everything be all right?"`
`"...Assuming the typhoon doesn't stray too far from its course, it may affect the boat ride back for the family members.`
` The family conference's schedule might be extended until Monday or Tuesday.`
` ...Our task may be a long and tiring one, but I earnestly ask that you take care not to make any blunders."`
`"......Shannon, remain calm and do not panic.`
` Kanon, be sure to greet our guests in a sociable manner."`
`"...Y-Yes, `
`I'll be careful."`
`"...I'll be careful."`
`"Today, we must conduct ourselves in a manner suitable for a very important guest.`
` ...See to it that you make no blunders."`
`"...We understand.`
` ...All guests who visit here are important."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"Kanon,`
` in the truest sense, `
`we will be receiving ~ib~a very important guest~ib~ today.`
`' Make sure that you are prepared."`
`"...Yes sir."`
`"......Shannon, is something the matter?`
` ...You seem to be uneasy. Do you have some prior engagement at this time?"`
`"Huh?`
` N-No, it's nothing.`
` My apologies..."`
`"Nee-san,`
` important guests will be arriving today.`
` ...Detach yourself from your private life."`
`"I-I don't know what you mean by private life..."`
`As Shannon blushed just a bit, she turned her gaze away from the clock.`
`...Was it about time for the airplane carrying the family to arrive at Niijima?`
`...She'd tried to hide the fact that her upcoming, long-awaited reunion with George was making her heart race, `
`but Kanon, who stood beside her, seemed to see right through her.`
`"...Shannon, please don't say a word and accept this...!"`
`...Inside a bathroom stall, George was practicing something over and over, taking out a small velvet box hidden in his pocket like a quick-draw desert gunman.`
`"That's not it...`
` Shannon likes men who're more assertive.`
` I-I've gotta pump it up with more horsepower...!"`
`"Shannon, put this on your ring finger.`
` ...Th-That's an order, okay...?"`
`"Aah, if I don't say properly that it's on the left hand, maybe she'll put on her right hand!`
` N-No, Shannon isn't that ignorant, `
`aaah, but unless there's some room for her to express her free will, that'd be a little, I mean, `
`uuuuuu, nnnnuuuuuuu, muuuuuuuaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!"`
`As he crossed his arms, muttering, someone knocked on the door.`
`George was snapped back to reality.`
`"Hey, George-kun.`
` You okay?`
` Got a stomachache or something?"`
`"Ah, ahahahaha, hey, Uncle Rudolf...!`
` It's okay, I'm fine!`
` No need to worry, ahahahahahaha...!"`
`"Really...?`
` That's good then.`
` But you know, you're straining way too much.`
` Your ass'll burst."`
`Rudolf washed his hands, laughing cheerfully as he left.`
`...George, realizing that the most embarrassing part hadn't been overheard, relaxed and felt extremely relieved...`
`"Kyrie, isn't Rosa here yet?"`
`"Not yet.`
` She's pretty late."`
`"It's a good thing the weather's delaying our flight.`
` If the schedule had gone on normally, she would've missed the plane.`
` What'd she plan on doing then?"`
`"...Rosa-san is very much an adult now.`
` She'll manage it somehow.`
` No matter how old they get, older brothers always treat their younger sisters like children."`
`"Of course, Dad's always a kid, no matter how old he gets."`
`"What'd you say? If I'm a kid, that'd make you a baby.`
` Come on, Battler-chan, up ya go!"`
`"Stop it, that tickles, wahahaha, stooop!"`
`"You look more like two bratty friends than a father and son.`
` ...Look, she's here."`
`"Ohoooooooooh!!!`
` If it isn't Rosa-san!`
` Maria-chan, long time no see!!"`
`"Long time no see!`
` Uu-!"`
`"Maria!`
` Shouldn't that be 'It's good to see you again'?`
` Greet Hideyoshi-san properly."`
`"Uu-.`
` It's...good to see you again..."`
`"There ya go!`
` Well said!`
` How about some candy as a reward?!`
` ...Oh, huh?`
` Where'd I put it..."`
`"Rosa-san, it's good to see you again.`
` It's good to see you too, Maria-chan."`
`"It's been too long, Kyrie nee-san, Hideyoshi nii-san.`
` ...And...oh my, Battler-kun?!`
` Look how big you've gotten...!"`
`"Ah, come on, hahaha...`
` It's embarrassing to hear that from everyone I meet...!"`
`"Hey, Rosa.`
` You're late.`
` If the plane was on time, you'd barely have made it..."`
`"I'm sorry.`
` We had some trouble making our train connection.`
` So, are we waiting on the weather again?"`
`"Oh, don't complain.`
` I much prefer the 30-minute plane trip to spending six hours bouncing about on a boat.`
` Even if we're kept waiting here for an hour, it's still much faster overall."`
`"Is that Maria...?`
` You sure have gotten big...`
` She's at that growing age..."`
`"You haven't seen her for six years, right?`
` Of course she's changed.`
` Women are creatures who can be born again in a single day when they have a change of heart."`
`"...Uu-?"`
`Maria, noticing a big man she didn't recognize mixed in among the relatives, hid behind Rosa's back and glared at Battler.`
`"Come on, Battler, say hi.`
` The last time you met her, she was just three years old, so you're practically meeting for the first time."`
`"Yeah, of course she wouldn't remember something that happened when she was three!`
` Hey Maria, long time no see.`
` You sure have gotten big!"`
`"Maria,`
` this is Battler onii-chan.`
` Rudolf nii-san's son.`
` ...Understand?"`
`"............The brother's son is...`
` The brother is the son...`
` ............??`
` ......Uuuu---!!"`
`She was obviously on her guard.`
`After all, it was hardly surprising that she'd be scared if a large guy like Battler suddenly started speaking frankly to her.`
`Battler noticed that as well and thought of various ways he might approach her.`
`Then, he spotted the candy she had in her hand.`
`It was the jack o'lantern sweet Rosa had bought for her.`
`"I see, it's October, so that must be for Halloween.`
` Ihihihi, if you don't give me sweets, I'll play a prank, right?!"`
`Normally, trying to snatch a sweet away from a small child will result in them crying and screaming.`
`The adults seemed dubious about Battler's tactics, but Maria looked unexpectedly pleased, her face splitting into a wide grin.`
`"Halloween, Halloween!!`
` See Mama, Battler also knows about Halloween! See, see?!!"`
`"Hey, call him Battler onii-chan!`
` Sorry, Battler-kun."`
`"No, no, don't sweat it.`
` Please call me Battler.`
` 'Cause I'll be calling you Maria.`
` Look, Maria, it's Halloween!`
` If you don't give me sweets, I'll play a prank!!"`
`"If you don't give me sweets, I'll play a prank!!`
` Kyahahaha, *giggle*!!"`
`From inside her purse, Maria picked out a jack o'lantern sweet similar to the one she had in her hand and presented it to Battler.`
`When Battler accepted it, that seemed to be enough to confirm their friendship.`
`The adults were amazed at how good children can be at getting along with each other.`
`Maria had been throwing a tantrum because she wanted a Halloween festival, `
`so Battler, who knew about trick-or-treating, must have felt like an ally.`
`Her defensive posture from before was completely gone.`
`Now she was all cheery, as though they'd been friends for decades.`
`"That's right, Halloween's a pretty minor event in Japan.`
` You always see people marching in costume parades on the news from overseas, but I've never seen it here."`
`"I wanted to wear a costume too.`
` Wanted to say 'trick or treat' with all the cousins wearing costumes..."`
`"I see, I see. Next time, let's do it together!`
` What would you like to dress up as?"`
`"A witch!!`
` Beatrice!"`
`"Oh, Milady, what are you doing in such a place?`
` Madam was looking for you."`
`"I'm here because I don't wanna be found.`
` ...Anyway, I'm sure she just wants to scold me, like 'is your appearance all right?' and 'watch your language'."`
`"Hohohoh...`
` Without a doubt."`
`"...You know,`
` when the day of the family conference comes, I always start thinking about this witch for some reason."`
`"Hoh...`
` And why might that be...?"`
`"The family conference is the day when everyone related to Grandfather gathers.`
` ...I hear that this time, even Battler's gonna be coming after six years.`
` ...What if, just like that,`
` some 'relative' who hasn't shown themselves for several decades suddenly shows up? That's what I'm always thinking about."`
`"......Hohoh.`
` Could a relative like that exist...?"`
`"I mean Beatrice-sama.`
` ...Nobody knows her background.`
` Could she be Grandfather's mistress from long ago?`
` ...What if one of her descendants suddenly appears and tell us to return the gold we were given, or something?"`
`"Hohohohoh...`
` Krauss-sama and the others will probably discuss the Master's inheritance problem this year too.`
` ...Once they get so fired up talking about the witch's gold, one could hardly be surprised if that witch herself were to show up, yes?"`
`"Kumasawa-san, `
`...I guess you keep quitting and getting rehired, but you've been here as long as Genji-san, right?`
` ...You know more...about Beatrice, don't you?"`
`"......Who knows?`
` Hohohoh...`
` Even if I try to remember, this old woman here can't even recall what she had for breakfast this morning..."`
`"Kumasawa-san, you're always dodging with those excuses, but you know something, right?`
` Sometimes you feel kinda devious, like you know something and you're laughing behind our backs."`
`"Hohohoh, ...that's harsh.`
` ...I don't have any secrets.`
` ...The only thing I can say is that Beatrice-sama is the Golden Witch...`
`and that she is the other master who controls the night of this island."`
`"Okay, now you're just repeating stuff Grandfather's said.`
` It must be a pain to play along with Grandfather's crap, even though you get paid for it."`
`"...However, I can say this much."`
`"...What?"`
`"...In ancient times, Rokkenjima was feared and called 'Azukishima' (Azuki Bean Island).`
` The 'Azuki' is said to be a corrupted form of 'Akujiki' and in fact it was called 'Akujikishima' (Evil Appetite Island). That is what is told among the fishermen."`
`"I've heard about that before.`
` Supposedly, there's lots of sunken rocks and shipwrecks around here, so the fishermen got scared and stayed away whenever they could, right?"`
`"...Evil spirits settled down in Akujikishima and have continually eaten the souls of people since ancient times.`
` ...Quite a few people lost their lives because of this island."`
`"And then that monk, the traveling shugenja or whatever, built that shrine, reposed the souls and settled them there, right?`
` ...Sounds pretty crazy, though."`
`"And that shrine for the repose of souls was destroyed by an eerie violet thunderbolt this summer, which tore up the darkness of the night..."`
`"Kumasawa-san, you really like those stories.`
` Okay, sure, it'd be pretty creepy if a thunderbolt took out a shrine.`
` But, well, it was all worn out from the start.`
` Maybe it just got washed away by some big wave.`
` Hahahahaha."`
`"The evil spirits of Akujikishima woke from their slumber and summoned Beatrice-sama.`
` ......If Beatrice-sama happens to pay a visit to the family conference..."`
`"If she does...?"`
`Kumasawa fell silent for a moment.`
`...Jessica was pressing her to keep going, so that gap felt strange and eerie.`
`When Kumasawa noticed that she had Jessica plenty scared with her silence, she grinned broadly.`
`"Well now, I wonder what would happen.`
` Hohohohohoh..."`
`"Whoa, that sounds great."`
`"Of course.`
` Won't you be able to do better at work... if you get a chance to enrich your heart by living the good life every once in a while...?"`
`"Yep.`
` Can't live right unless both your wallet and your heart are enriched, after all.`
` Sure, I'll keep that day open.`
` Go ahead and make reservations."`
`"Okay.`
` Don't even think of missing it."`
`"Yeah, I'm counting on you.`
` I love you, Kyrie."`
`After kissing the receiver, Rudolf hung up.`
`...Before his seat, there were several executives with their sleeves rolled up, eagerly awaiting the end of that phone call.`
`"Sorry to keep you waiting.`
` Have we heard anything from the States yet?"`
`"Yes.`
` You have a call from Dale Watanabe, the lawyer.`
` I'll transfer it."`
`"...On the whole, how's it going?"`
`"Well, uhhh, ...there does seem to be one unfortunate matter.`
` It appears the other party has no intentions of withdrawing from the trial."`
`"...Guess there's no fooling them.`
` Haha...`
` Please, transfer it here."`
`"Understood.`
` I'll do that right away."`
`The executive ordered that the external line be transferred to the secretarial office.`
` At once, the phone in front of Rudolf rang.`
`"Hey there.`
` <Hello, hello>!`
` Sorry for the wait, Ushiromiya speaking.`
` Thanks, thanks.`
` How's it going on your end?"`
`"<Hello, President Ushiromiya>.`
` Let's skip the pleasantries and jump into the main issue.`
` I've got good news and bad news, which would you like first?"`
`"...Might as well start with the bad.`
` I hate fighting when there's no dessert."`
`"Very well.`
` The bad news is that the other party is getting ready to prosecute.`
` Just a few days ago, a similar trial resulted in a decision in favor of the plaintiff.`
` The defendants were using roughly the same arguments we planned to use, but they were rejected in every case.`
` I'm afraid to say it, but if we face the courtroom as we are now, it's extremely likely that each one of our claims will get rejected."`
`"...So, that trial ended up being a total bust after all.`
` ...And I thought their position was even more solid than ours.`
` That hurts.`
` Okay, what about the good news?"`
`"I managed to contact the executives of the other party.`
` I explained the situation we're in, told them we have no intentions of tarnishing their brand's image, and managed to get an understanding.`
` They'll send us their terms over the next few days, and if these are carried out, they promise to withdraw their charges.`
` This is their proposal according to the number two man on their board of directors."`
`"Your impression?"`
`"To be honest, I expect their terms will be extremely severe.`
` We estimate that changing the company name and the brand name will be inevitable.`
` I think we'll be able to earn some leeway by playing with the amount of settlement money, making a public apology in a major newspaper, `
`and carrying all this out within a reasonable amount of time."`
`"They sure are making this complicated, when they could just tell us to go broke."`
`"They only recently switched to a new president, and their groundwork hasn't been completely laid yet.`
` If we resist until the bitter end, they fear the forces opposing the current president won't hesitate to aid their enemies.`
` Hence, their big shots want this matter settled as quickly as possible too.`
` So, we might still have enough leeway to get them to mitigate their terms if it'll lead to a quick settlement."`
`"Either way, are we still looking at a crazy sum of money?"`
`"You need to be prepared for that.`
` Even that would be much cheaper than paying punitive damages."`
`"Thank you very much, sir.`
` Please contact me if anything new happens.`
` We're paying you the big bucks, so no idle chitchat.`
` Hahahaha.`
` <Thank you, thank you, goodbye.>"`
`Rudolf hung up the phone.`
`The executives sitting in reception seats seemed to have guessed at the contents of that discussion.`
`"...You guys hear that?`
` Simply put,`
` they'll forgive us if we can pile up enough money.`
` Now, all we've gotta do is haggle over the amount of that money."`
`"But President,`
` the likely sum for the settlement Mr. Watanabe indicated is too much.`
` We don't have that much of a margin...!"`
`"If we'd known this would happen, we never would've started diversifying..."`
`"The calculations were that we could escape a capital crisis if we managed to endure for three years.`
` ...To think we'd be stabbed at a time like this... How bad can our luck get...?!"`
`"I guess we fell at the 'step' of the 'hop, step, and jump'.`
` It's enough to make you cry."`
`"We have no choice but to draw the money from the main bank."`
`"Banks are no good.`
` They only bet their money on winners.`
` ...The economy's improving, but we can't show weakness to the banks."`
`"...President,`
` do we have access to any funds that are unaccounted for?`
` Funds we are unaware of?"`
`"Quit it.`
` Do I look like that kind of man?`
` The contents of my wallet are totally exposed to you guys, okay?`
` The account books over there show all our company has."`
`"In that case, ...we need to raise money.`
` We need a sponsor who can draw in several million for us as soon as possible."`
`"...President,`
` couldn't something be worked out with one of your personal connections...?!"`
`"President!`
` President...!"`
`"...Aaaah, calm down, you bastards.`
` ...Let me worry about raising the money.`
` You guys just keep the business running without making too much noise.`
` Our accusers are saying they'll let us be if we can show them the money.`
` We've already got thick pipelines in Asia.`
` Things'll probably be shaky, but we'll be able to maintain our current deals.`
` Basically, if we can just bring the money together, we'll be able to solve all our problems."`
`"Just you watch. I'll fix all of this.`
` I won't leave you out in the cold.`
` Time to start getting your hopes up again.`
` Once this is all behind us, I'll be rewarding all of you guys with a champagne tower.`
` I promise you that.`
` So shut up and follow me.`
` Got it?!!"`
`The airplane suddenly shook, probably due to turbulance.`
`Rudolf was jostled awake.`
`He'd woken early that morning and ended up drifting off to sleep while resting in his seat.`
`"...You okay?`
` Are you sure you aren't still pretty sleepy?`
` After all, it seems you've been really busy with work lately."`
`"Being busy with work is nothing to complain about, right?`
` Once I've got nothing left to do, it won't be long before we're out in the cold."`
`"Good point.`
` Now that even Battler-kun's back, we'd be looking at worse than just the two of us going around begging."`
`"...Yeah.`
` Our family's all together again for the first time in six years.`
` ...So, the leader of our family's got to give it his best if we wanna spend some time alone together..."`
`When he looked out the window, he saw that the airplane had already started to drop in altitude considerably.`
`The fishing boats, which had only looked like black grains a short while ago, were starting to become clearly recognizable.`
`"......If I could prostrate myself before Father and get 10 million yen every time he slugged me, I'd do it a dozen times...`
` Or maybe he could just go and die already.`
` ......I've always depended heavily on his financial support, and now I'm after his inheritance.`
` .........I'm headed straight to hell.`
` ...I can hardly complain if Father doesn't want to meet the man I've become..."`
`"...Could it be that, once again, you do not plan on making an appearance at the family conference?"`
`Nanjo looked at Kinzo's face, sighing.`
`...Kinzo's eyes remained rooted to a strange book on magic.`
`"I have no intention of joining those vultures in their debate.`
` They can discuss how they'll suck my bones dry on their own.`
` ...How utterly contemptible."`
`".........`
`...My, my.`
` How troublesome..."`
`Nanjo shook his head slightly.`
`...To him, children and grandchildren were lovely things.`
`He believed watching them grow was the only way to truly enjoy old age.`
`So Kinzo's words were very saddening to Nanjo.`
`"If the time comes for me to leave this room, I will show myself.`
` ...Just as she does not show herself yet."`
`When Kinzo raised his face, his gaze pointed at the portrait of the witch, which was respectfully displayed on the wall...`
`"............"`
`Kinzo's mind didn't dwell for a moment on the fact that today was the family conference, where all of his beloved relatives would gather.`
`...It was filled only by the face of the witch in the oil painting, who never smiled except inside the portrait...`
`Everybody knew that interrupting Kinzo when he talked about Beatrice would trigger his wrath...`
`"Today, I will...hold a certain ceremony."`
`"Hoh.`
` ...And what might that be?"`
`"...Perhaps it is closer to a gamble than a ceremony.`
` ...After all, magic without risk can never house a miracle."`
`Nanjo had heard Kinzo say this many times before.`
`You might even call it a pet phrase of Kinzo's.`
`...Kinzo apparently believed that magic and miracles could occur if you gambled your own fate with a certain amount of risk and triumphed...`
`"I wonder what sort of gamble you're making,`
` as the man who was once called the Golden Gambler...and who's now so old he might pass on at any time...`
` This should be well worth watching..."`
`"Hmph, `
`...I see.`
` So the secret ritual I have developed after much research...appears to be nothing more than a gamble to one unversed in magic such as you.`
` Very well."`
`".........If I have faith in miracles and win, `
`you will see clearly on this day that all my research did bear fruit, despite it seeming to be little more than the product of my eccentricity.`
` If you win, `
`......it will all end just as you have already seen, as nothing more than the eccentricity of an old man who might leave this world at any time."`
`"Hoh...`
` Just what sort of gamble could you be planning to take...?`
` As your friend, that bet...or ceremony, as you called it...`
` ...I can only pray most sincerely that you achieve victory in it."`
`"Yes, ...I thank you."`
`"...Speaking of which, Kinzo-san,`
` have you heard that a much longed-for guest will be present at the family conference this year?"`
`"What...?"`
`For once, Kinzo reacted to Nanjo's words and turned around.`
`"That's right, Battler-kun from Rudolf-san's family.`
` I hear he'll be coming after an absence of six years.`
` I'm sure he's became a splendid boy."`
`".........Oh, Battler?`
` ...I wouldn't call him 'longed for', a guest who's failed to show up for a mere six years."`
`After hearing Battler's name and making a disappointed and ill-humored expression, Kinzo turned his back again.`
`"I imagine those six years went by in a flash for you, considering how you've immersed yourself in your research in this room..."`
`"Hmph.`
` ...However, we might actually receive a visit...`
`......from a truly longed-for guest.`
` ...Everything depends on the results of the roulette.`
` ...The roulette has already started to spin.`
` Will it be rouge, or noir?"`
`"......Tonight, let us enjoy ourselves, as we see what kind of miracle the roulette will show us.`
` ...The payoffs are large.`
` And I don't intend to lose...`
` ...Beatrice, ...accept my bet......"`
`At that time, the telephone on the table rang.`
`The piercing sound seemed to irritate Kinzo, and he picked up the receiver to preserve the silence as much as he could.`
`"...What is it?`
` I'm busy."`
`"Genji speaking.`
` Everyone has arrived."`
`"What of it?`
` Just serve them some tea or something."`
`"...Certainly.`
` I will do so."`
`Kinzo hung up the phone rudely.`
`Looking at that, Nanjo sighed yet again and shifted his attention outside the window.`
`As he is now, I doubt Kinzo would pay any heed to any sort of guest.`
`...Could any guest possibly make Kinzo come out 'when the time comes', as he said?`
`Kinzo had a single person in mind, but that was a guest who certainly wouldn't appear...`
`Nanjo stared at the witch of the portrait with her impassive expression, unable to decide whether she was smiling or sad, and then gazed up at the lead-colored sky...`
`So, are all the pieces in place...?`
`Shall we line them all up again and start a new game?`
`"Any objections from you...?"`
`"...Nope, none."`
`The witch looked at him challengingly while elegantly smoking her pipe.`
`And Battler?`
`He just rudely shrugged his shoulders as if he didn't care what she did.`
`He didn't meet her eyes.`
` But that didn't mean he didn't intend to challenge her.`
`...It showed his clear determination to never be taken in by this bastard's tricks.`
`It was an expression of his determination to fight.`
`"Don't tell me you're jumping into this without a plan...?"`
`"I don't even know how you'll make your first move, so I've got no plans or anything.`
` ...Go ahead and move first."`
`"Hmph... Naturally, I'll do so.`
` How shall I break down your defenses?`
` How many moves will it take to checkmate you?`
` ...This is where you'll see me at my finest."`
`"......No matter what moves you come at me with, I won't believe in you!`
` ...As long as I stand my ground on that point, I won't lose.`
` And that means...`
`this game's built in a way that makes it impossible for you to win..."`
`"Perhaps you're right.`
` However,`
` I'm the one who decides how many times we'll hold this game.`
` We'll repeat it over and over again, until I win and you acknowledge your defeat, see...?"`
`"In other words, this is torture.`
` An eternal torture that shall continue until you surrender to me...!`
` It shall go on endlessly, until you acknowledge me and the existence of witches!"`
`"...Then I'll play your game endlessly, as many times as it takes, until you run out of patience.`
` I've never lost in a test of stubbornness."`
`"Oh, did a certain witch plant that idea in your head...?`
` *cackle*cackle* Very well...!"`
`"I'm tired of listening to you ramble.`
` ...C'mon, get this started!"`
`"Then let us begin!`
` I already know all of your moves.`
` A defense doesn't amount to much if the plan behind it is known!`
` Don't think you'll be able to defy me with the same moves!!"`
`"...Beatrice,`
` I've got just one thing to say before we start."`
`"What is it...?"`
`"Go ahead and say whatever you want.`
`'!s1`
`is something `
`I'll decide `
`for myself...!`
` No matter how impressive this magic of yours is,`
` my soul won't yield to you!`
` You think this is torture for me?`
` You're wrong!!"`
`"Then what else could it be...?!"`
`"This is torture for you!!`
` Someday you'll surrender to me and give up!`
` Until then, you'll be tortured over and over again!"`
`"How amusing, what an entertaining metaphor!!`
` Torture where we torment each other...yes, truly amusing!`
` Come, shall we begin that torture?!!`
` Ushiromiya Battleeeeer?!!!"`
`Every year, the relatives visiting Rokkenjima would let out a sigh of admiration at the rose garden that first greeted them...`
`They would stop there to chat about the roses' beauty and how well they were blooming that year.`
`In the midst of all this, there was a single unhealthy rose, and Maria became overwhelmed with dejection at its condition.`
`But George used his quick wits, `
`and, saying that everything would be fine if they took care of this poor thing, marked it with a candy wrapper and immediately restored Maria's good mood.`
`Then Battler, with whom she'd been getting along well since that morning, started talking about Halloween.`
` This was such a favorite topic of Maria's that she began playing around energetically again.`
`To Maria, that marshmallow jack-o-lantern candy bought by her mother was probably the greatest sort of treasure.`
`...They seemed to have bought several, and she demanded a trick-or-treat from every person she met, giving them candy instead of the other way around.`
`"I wonder why Maria likes Halloween so much.`
` I always figured it was a pretty unfamiliar event for the Japanese."`
`"Well, it's a kid's festival where they get to parade around in costumes, right?`
` It can be fun to play around in an outfit that's different than usual."`
`"Hmm, ...I think there's a slightly deeper cause behind it.`
` After all, she is the 'witch' Maria-chan."`
`"Come to think of it, when we were at the airport, didn't Maria say that if she was gonna wear a costume, it'd be a witch?`
` Does she like witches?"`
`"...Yes, she loves them.`
` So much that it becomes a problem."`
`"Hey, it's not so bad.`
` You expect kids at that age to love fantastical stuff like that."`
`"If it was just a heroine on some TV anime, at least it'd be cute...`
` ...*sigh*"`
`Judging by Rosa's appearance, she wasn't very happy about her daughter's love for witches, as a mother.`
`The cousins other than Battler seemed to realize this, and they shrugged, wearing stiff smiles.`
`"Hmmmm?`
` So you're arguing that because she likes witches, she also likes Halloween?`
` If we don't know, why don't we just ask her?`
` Hey, Maria.`
` How are Halloween and witches related?"`
`As Battler asked that, George and Jessica let out a stifled 'ah'.`
`...As if they were trying to stop him, but too late.`
`Maria might have been waiting for just that question.`
`After beaming for an instant, her expression turned a little mean, as if to say "You're totally clueless, aren't you?"`
`It was the face of a hobbyist who's been ticked off by an outsider saying something stupid about their favorite subject.`
`"Uu-.`
` ...To the Celts, the changing strength of the sun over the course of a year signified...`
`its birth, its growing up period, its aging and death, and then its revival."`
`"I get it.`
` In spring, the weak warm sun starts to grow up and get hot,`
` and then it gradually gets weaker and worn out. Sort of makes sense to think of it as the sun living out an entire life."`
`"Yes.`
` So, they thought that at the end of October, the sun died, was laid to rest in the land of the dead, and was then revived at the winter solstice.`
` And the name they gave to the last day of their year, when the sun ended its one year lifespan and died...was Samhain, and they celebrated then."`
`"It's an interesting idea, to think that the sun is revived on the day of the winter solstice, when the daylight hours start to grow longer again.`
` It's a case that makes it clear how much the ancients regarded the sun as sacred."`
`"...I see.`
` So, what does that have to do with witches?"`
`It seemed that my casual urging forward had slightly infuriated Maria.`
`She glared at me with eyes that told me to shut up while she explained.`
`...Maria seemed to be having a blast as she talked, so I decided not to interrupt...`
`"In the interval between October and November, life and death become the closest they ever will.`
` ...The Celts believed that during this time, the world of the living grew closer to the world of the dead and otherworldly beings,`
` and many of those living in the other world would come to visit.`
` ...It was like the Bon festival in Japan.`
` Kihihihihi."`
`At the time, people believed that souls returning to the physical world would go into people's houses or possess people and do bad things.`
`So, in order to avoid harm, they performed rituals.`
`One of those was to imitate creepy monsters and scare the souls back, which was apparently a way to avoid being possessed.`
`"That part became a festival, which turned into a costume parade.`
` ...You really know a lot, don't you, Maria?!"`
`"...Ain't it the truth.`
` Even I never knew Halloween had such a history."`
`"But where did that whole trick-or-treat thing come from?"`
`Her knowledge was so extensive that the adults had suddenly started listening in too.`
` Maria, who was normally treated like the youngest all the time, puffed out her chest with pride.`
`Saying that this was just a kids' discussion, Rosa suggested that the adults go on ahead and set their luggage down in the guesthouse,`
` but nobody else agreed to go with her, and she let out a heavy sigh.`
`"Uu-.`
` Trick-or-treat is just for fun.`
` It has nothing to do with what was originally a Celtic ceremony.`
` That was created later when Christian customs were mixed in.`
` ...However, I think it's right for Halloween to be that way."`
`According to Maria, the souls of the dead weren't the only ones who visited from the nonhuman world.`
` There were also spirits with intimate connections to people's everyday lives.`
`Humans could receive favors from those spirits, so they'd manage to gain magnificent blessings,`
` as well as a year's worth of good crops.`
`"So basically, Halloween was also a bit of a harvest festival?"`
`"I get it.`
` ...Now that you mention it, I guess October's a turning point in all kinds of ways, including with the seasons.`
` Sort of the opposite of April in Japan.`
` ...Yeah, that might be a good place to mark it."`
`"Uu-!`
` And also, the witches hold a witch assembly then, called a Sabbath.`
` The witches thank the spirits that give out blessings of prosperity and reward them."`
`"Halloween costumes imitate the guests that come from the other side.`
` ...In other words, you might say giving out candy is a way to show gratitude for the yearly harvest."`
`"Uu-!`
` Just like George onii-chan says!"`
`"So Halloween is a time when those two worlds intermingle?`
` In other words, it's the most important chance for witches to intermingle with guests from that world.`
` Is that what you're trying to say?"`
`"Uu-!!`
` Just like Battler says!"`
`"And you know what?`
` You know what?!`
` October is when the power of witches and demons is at its most vigorous and prosperous!`
` Kihihihihihihihi, I'm sure Beatrice will come!"`
`"And then, we'll eat marshmallow candies together, and she'll bring me to the Golden Land with her!`
` We'll sing magical songs together, learn magic spells together, learn how to draw magic circles together!`
` And then, we'll learn the secrets of runes, and I'll become a great witch really, really quickly!"`
`"My, my, isn't that wonderful.`
` It's best for kids to have dreams.`
` By the way, Rosa,`
` how old will Maria be this year again...?"`
`"M-Maria,`
` ...that's enough of that!"`
`"Don't worry about it, Rosa-san.`
` It's a dream all girls have at one time or another."`
`"Th-Thank you very much.`
` ...But Maria has already graduated from that age.`
` ...Hey, I'm telling you to stop!"`
`Rosa scolded Maria, trying to shut her up before her cheery discussion about black magic earned her the snickers of the relatives.`
`"Oh...?`
` That sounds pretty detailed and impressive.`
` ...By the way, who was Beatrice again?`
` ...Hmm, I know I've heard that name somewhere before..."`
`Battler had been gone for six years...and had completely forgotten about the Legend of the Rokkenjima Witch.`
`However, when he said he didn't know Beatrice's name, Maria's once-bright mood soured in an instant.`
`When he saw that, Battler immediately remembered that it was the name of the witch of this island, but the damage had been done.`
`...Until Maria's mood improved, she went on and on about many mysterious and fabulous episodes regarding the Golden Witch...`
`"That's enough, Maria.`
` Thank you, Battler-kun, for letting her chat with you.`
` ...Kanon-kun, don't you have work to do?`
` Please leave now.`
` Gohda-san, it looks like everyone wants to set down their bags for the time being.`
` Sorry, but could you guide everyone to the guesthouse?"`
`"Certainly.`
` ...Well then, everyone, allow me to guide you."`
`"...Then, if you will excuse me."`
`Gohda led the relatives, and they began to head towards the guesthouse.`
`They were eager to set down their luggage and take a breather, so they didn't realize that Rosa and Maria weren't coming with them.`
`After watching them leave towards the guesthouse, Rosa's face changed suddenly.`
`She let go with the hand that had been gripping Maria this whole time.`
`...There was a bright red mark there, making it clear how much excessive force she had been using on Maria's slender arm.`
`That hand then slapped against Maria's head, pinched her left ear, and lifted...`
`"Even though I'm always telling you not to talk about witches...`
` ...Haven't I always said that was our promise together...?"`
`"Mama, ouch...Mama, ouch...ouch ouch ouch......"`
`"You really do like blabbering on about Halloween all the time, don't you...?`
` A festival for witches...?`
` Who cares about the Celts, black magic, all that idiotic trash...?`
` You're nine years old, nine...`
` Because of that scene you made in the train, I went to all the trouble of making a stop and buying you those disgusting monster marshmallows that look like they have fluorescent paint on them...`
` I went out of my way to buy it, even though it made us late.`
` How much more will you embarrass me before you're satisfied...?!"`
`As Rosa cursed, she twisted Maria's ear up, almost as though she was about to tear it off...`
`An expression of anguish spread across Maria's face while she frantically stood on her tiptoes, trying to soften the pain in that ear...`
`Rosa suddenly grabbed the candy that Maria had been holding.`
`She threw it on the ground and stepped on it over and over.`
`To Maria, it was supposed to be proof of a memory...of a brief span of time when her mother had bought something fun for her...`
`But now, that same mother was grinding it into the ground right in front of her.`
`...It was as though a brand had been pushed into Maria's eyes, leaving a mark that could never be erased...`
`'!s0`
`disgusting, disgusting...!!`
` It's because you're like that, it's all because you're like that!!`
` Disgusting disgusting disgusting!!!"`
`As she said that, she struck Maria's head over and over again with her palm.`
` ...She didn't hit Maria's face.`
` Because the red swelling would stand out.`
`Maria closed her eyes tightly, patiently bearing her mother's violence...`
` ...No, that wasn't quite it.`
`"...Come back, Mama... Come back, Mama...`
` Save me, save me, Mama...`
` Defeat the bad witch..."`
`She kept bearing Rosa's assault, muttering that over and over...`
`"Didn't I...`
`tell you...`
`to stop...`
`talking about...`
`witches?!!`
` Why you, `
`you, you!!!"`
`Rosa, tired from hitting her daughter, breathed so hard her shoulders shook.`
`...Maria grasped her hands together, withstanding it, hoping 'her mother' would return soon...`
`"...Mama, Mama...`
` Come back quickly...`
` Save me, Mama...`
` Beat the bad witch..."`
`"F-Fine, just stay there like that forever!!`
` Just stand there, mumbling about witches and Halloween forever!!"`
`After hurling those words at Maria, Rosa left in the direction of the guesthouse, leaving Maria behind.`
`...Maria, forgetting even that it was okay to cry,`
` kept staring down at the jack-o-lantern candy that had been trampled beyond recognition...`
`"Oh, Rosa.`
` Where were you?"`
`"I'm sorry.`
` The roses were so wonderful, I just..."`
`"Rosa, set your luggage down quickly and come with us.`
` We're gonna go say hi to Aniki."`
`"Hmm?`
` What happened to Maria-chan?`
` Is she still by the flower beds?"`
`"...Yes.`
` It seems she found a rose she likes and insisted that she'd take care of it, refusing to listen.`
` I decided to let her do what she wants for a while."`
`"......We sometimes forget that girls have their own little world.`
` Sometimes, we have to respect that, right?"`
`"...That's right.`
` ...Thanks for your concern, Kyrie nee-san."`
`"...Gohda-san,`
` where is our room?"`
`"I will guide you, this way.`
` Allow me to hold your luggage."`
`"I'll be fine. I can carry it myself, thank you."`
`Rosa went into her room, guided by Gohda.`
`She then closed the door somewhat violently and threw her luggage on top of the bed.`
`"...............`
`........."`
`She got down on her knees in front of the bed, ...burying her face in it.`
`For a while, Rosa made as if to shred the sheets with her fingernails, sobbing constantly...`
`"......Maria-sama,`
` ...are you all right?"`
`Kanon appeared from behind a thicket after watching Rosa leave.`
`"...Kihi, ...kihihihihihihihihihi... `
`...I'm fine.`
` ...Kihihihihi."`
`Maria gave a creepy laugh, but to Kanon, who had seen the whole thing, it looked like she was enduring as best she could...`
`"She's a horrible person.`
` I can't believe she's a mother..."`
`"...It can't be helped.`
` You can't expect anything better than that to enter a container of that level.`
` ...I'm just fine.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihi......"`
`Kanon got down on his knees and picked up the trampled candy.`
`...It was tragic just looking at it.`
`He thought about dusting it off and returning it to her, but really couldn't do so with it in that condition.`
`Just as he was wondering what to do, he met Maria's gaze.`
`...No, that wasn't quite right.`
`Maria was looking at the candy Kanon had picked up.`
`...Right now, Maria's heart was surely the same as the candy that had been trampled into a pulp...`
`Kanon realized this, but didn't know what he should do...`
`"...That's right...`
` ...I'll exchange it for the one I received earlier."`
`Kanon remembered that a similar candy he'd received from Maria was in his pocket.`
`Maria stuck out her hand.`
`...Kanon thought she was trying to take it, so he held out the candy, but Maria didn't try to grasp it.`
`...Then Kanon realized.`
`...She was saying 'Give it back'.`
`...No matter how tragic and trampled it was, this candy was Maria's.`
`...Her mother had bought it for her.`
`No matter how tragic, it had to be this candy, and no other...`
`If only it were intact enough that it could be fixed by dusting it off...`
`...Kanon hung his head.`
`"......Dusting it off is the most I can do.`
` ......I'm sorry."`
`Kanon held out the miserable-looking candy Maria wanted.`
` She took it and spoke.`
`"...Thank you.`
` A Human can't do anything except dust it off, but a witch could restore it to how it once was.`
` It would be easy for Beatrice.`
` Kihihihihihi."`
`'!s1`
`...you know about Beatrice...`
`sama?"`
`Except for Battler, there was no way anyone related to the Ushiromiya family could have failed to know Beatrice's name.`
`...But just now, Maria had bragged about Beatrice to Battler.`
`She had spoken almost as though she was meeting with Beatrice regularly.`
`Kanon felt a sharp pain inside his left hand, which was curled into a fist.`
`...In the past, a witch called Beatrice had appeared to tempt him and Shannon.`
`He'd always tried to think of it as a bad dream.`
` ...However, Shannon insisted that it definitely was a real witch.`
`And then, this summer...`
`...The shrine to the local Shinto god was hit by lightning, disappearing without a trace over the span of a single night.`
`...He knew about Shannon breaking that mirror.`
`...And he remembered that, as the witch departed, she said she'd eventually be revived.`
`And now, ......this girl who believed absolutely in Beatrice...spoke as though she'd met Beatrice herself.`
`...Kanon couldn't suppress a vague sense of foreboding welling up in his heart.`
`For a while, Maria remained silent, as though she could see into Kanon's heart.`
`...Almost as though she was waiting for a memory of Beatrice to be revived.`
`And then, she spoke, as though it was a fact.`
`"Kihihihihi...`
` You know, I'm friends with Beatrice.`
` I'm even gonna meet her today and play.`
` Kihihihihihihihihi..."`
`"You're going to...play?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` Of course we'll play.`
` We're gonna study magic together.`
` Kihihihihihihihi..."`
`...The face of that witch, whom Kanon had tried to pretend was a bad dream,`
` ...began to slowly creep into the back of his mind...`
`"Father says he's extremely busy with his research.`
` Unfortunately, it seems he'll be unable to come down."`
`"...Come on.`
` We've put this conference in our schedules and come all the way out to Rokkenjima during this crazy busy fall season.`
` You'd think Dad could at least be a bit more sociable."`
`"Yeah, seriously.`
` ...Doctor Nanjo,`
` is it really his research and his mood that are the problem?`
` He isn't already bedridden, unable to get up, right?"`
`"...Well, ...I wonder.`
` There is not much I can say..."`
`Nanjo glanced at Natsuhi.`
`It seemed he thought it wasn't his place to speak without first getting Natsuhi's approval.`
`"Father's state of health is better than ever.`
` It would be exceedingly rude to call him 'bedridden'...!"`
`"But he only has three months left to live, right?`
` Normally, wouldn't you expect him to be wasted away, unable to get out of bed?`
` Isn't that right, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"......For a normal patient, that would probably be the case.`
` But Kinzo-san has extraordinary willpower.`
` ...Perhaps that willpower has frightened even the reaper away..."`
`"Well, if he's that energetic, then I guess we have little to worry about for the near future, right?"`
`"...Though, if he's got that much spunk, I wish he'd at least come to greet us.`
` ...Isn't the whole point of this family conference to come and see Dad's face?`
` I'm not even sure why we came now."`
`"Don't say that.`
` If he were here, you'd complain the whole time about being unable to relax.`
` Shouldn't we celebrate the fact that all of us siblings have gathered this year to spend some time alone?"`
`"We didn't get to see him at last year's family conference either, right?`
` Can't you understand why his blood children might want to see him after two years?"`
`"...If there's anything you'd like to say in greeting, I will tell him for you.`
` Or, Eva-san,`
` ...is there something you'd like to discuss with Father beyond merely greeting him...?"`
`"......Nngg.`
` ...Come on, what are you talking about? Sheesh."`
`"Give it a rest, Eva.`
` Natsuhi-san, forgive us.`
` Eva's just worried about Father's condition, as his daughter.`
` Please try and understand how she feels."`
`"Indeed.`
` Look how quickly you've grown to respect Father, now that you know how much longer he has to live.`
` ...Yes, I believe I do understand why you want to see him so much.`
` ...Hmph."`
`"......What are you trying to say?"`
`"Quit it, Aneki.`
` Why don't we pray that his mood'll improve by dinner?`
` ...Anyway, we've only just arrived.`
` For now, we're only here for a casual greeting.`
` And we could even hold the family conference without Dad.`
` ...In fact, there's a few things we siblings shouldn't bring to him until we've formed a unified opinion.`
` Isn't that right, Hideyoshi nii-san?"`
`"Yep!`
` Just as Rudolf-kun says.`
` ...This is the only time of year we can all meet in person.`
` We've gotta take this valuable time seriously and be frank with each other."`
`Even though the tea hadn't yet arrived, ...they were very determined.`
`"But before that, perhaps we can spare the time to enjoy some black tea at our leisure,`
` surrounded by the wonderful furnishings of the parlor..."`
`Kyrie's words seemed to contain a subtle admonition directed at everyone gathered there.`
`They all understood, and as they cleared their throats and straightened their neckties, the atmosphere in the room returned to normal for a time.`
`"...Excuse me.`
` I've brought some tea."`
`"Hey, Shannon-chan.`
` You just keep gettin' prettier and prettier!"`
`Shannon entered the parlor, pushing the serving cart.`
`Everyone decided to relax and enjoy some black tea for the time being...`
`A wonderful aroma began to spread throughout the room.`
`As far as anyone could see, the strained atmosphere from before Shannon's arrival seemed like a lie.`
`...Of course, Shannon, who was setting out the tea, probably didn't even notice.`
`...Kyrie seemed to laugh faintly at how 'adult' everyone was suddenly acting.`
`Rudolf didn't like it when Kyrie took the initiative and spoke at the family conference.`
`...It was his worthless male pride.`
`He probably didn't want to look like a weak man who took advice from his wife.`
`She understood that and did her best to refrain from saying any more than was necessary.`
`So, she separated herself from the circle of siblings, who only superficially appeared to be enjoying some time together alone, and casually drank her tea near the window.`
`"Oh, Rosa-san.`
` I thought you siblings were enjoying some alone time..."`
`"...You must be joking."`
`"Sorry, don't take it the wrong way.`
` I'm just a little exasperated by my husband."`
`Apparently, Rosa hadn't been able to keep up with that 'on the surface' friendliness.`
`...They'd come here to fight bloodily and dirtily, each trying to grab a part of the inheritance for themselves.`
`She probably didn't like suddenly pretending that they were all chummy.`
`...Or maybe she was still too immature for that.`
`"...It looks like the wind's started blowing hard out there.`
` ...The plants are all shaking so much."`
`"The typhoon's probably gotten pretty close already.`
` ...I wonder if we'll see a lot of rain tonight."`
`"......Maria-chan really has grown a lot this past year."`
`"......Does it look that way...?`
` She still can't even fold her own clothing yet."`
`"No, it's true.`
` It's because she has such an affectionate mother.`
` She'll grow into a girl with a rich heart."`
`Rosa fell silent.`
`......Maybe she was unsure as to what Kyrie meant by that...`
`"...I'm...`
`a failure as a mother.`
` ......Children don't get to choose their parents.`
` That poor girl..."`
`"Doesn't that go both ways?`
` ...A parent can't choose what kind of child they have either."`
`"..............."`
`Rosa bit her lower lip...`
`"This isn't a matter of assigning blame.`
` Isn't it enough that you take your time and watch over her as she grows, conscious of the fact that you'll be living together?"`
`"You spend every day with Maria-chan, so you probably don't notice the small changes.`
` But the rest of us, who haven't seen her for a year, can see clearly how much she's grown..."`
`"...If you really mean that, thank you very much."`
`"Then, if you will excuse me.`
` If there is anything you desire, please call for it at any time."`
`Shannon bowed politely and left the room.`
`As Hideyoshi and Rudolf, who had a soft spot for women, watched her go, `
`...the atmosphere in the room began to revert back to what it had been right before Shannon's visit.`
`"......If Father can't come down...well, that does still leave us with certain things we can discuss.`
` Right, Rudolf?"`
`"Yep, that's right.`
` ...We didn't come all the way out here just to drink some dusty tea, right?"`
`"...Very well.`
` What is this matter that you're clearly so eager to discuss?"`
`"......My, my.`
` Those people really are determined.`
` They certainly got started quick."`
`"I need to join in too.`
` ...If I don't assert myself, those people will quickly forget that there are four siblings."`
`"...Sounds like you've got it pretty tough yourself.`
` ...Maybe I spoke too harshly.`
` Forgive me."`
`"No, I don't mind.`
` ...I'm the one who should be apologizing.`
` As a pair of mothers with daughters, we should talk more often.`
` Every single time we meet, we end up talking about something shady..."`
`"...You can blame the atmosphere in this mansion for that.`
` Once you breathe in this air, everyone gets so strained.`
` ...Just once, I'd like to have a nice, long cup of tea with you, when we aren't attending a family conference.`
` There's a wonderful coffee shop in Ginza that's a favorite of mine.`
` Please let me invite you sometime soon."`
`"Thank you, Kyrie-san.`
` That sounds great..."`
`"Oh, no.`
` The sky's gotten dark pretty fast.`
` I could almost believe the people in this room made the weather worse.`
` ...There's already thunder.`
` Oh?`
` Was that one there...?"`
`"...Huh?"`
`There really were small splashes of rain on the glass of the parlor window.`
`...The weather seemed to have worsened faster than expected.`
`...Just then, a silent thunderbolt struck inside Rosa's head, and she remembered that her beloved child was out in the rose garden.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`A normal girl would try to go inside if the weather got bad.`
` ...But Maria was different.`
` She would sometimes get stubborn and refuse to move if rain or even spears fell from the sky.`
` ...That's right, I...`
`...told that child...~ib~to just stay there doing that forever~ib~, didn't I...?`
`"...O-Oh no...!`
` Maria...!!"`
`Everyone looked back at Rosa when she let out a small scream.`
`"...What? What is it?"`
`"I-I'm sorry, I'm going outside for a second.`
` I'll be right back!"`
`"...What the...seriously, what's going on with her...?"`
`"Don't worry, she'll be back soon.`
` ...More importantly, shouldn't we begin?`
` ...Our main topic."`
`"That's right.`
` We can keep talking about that without Rosa.`
` Let's return to our discussion."`
`"............"`
`Rosa dashed from the entrance hall into the rose garden.`
`When she opened the door, the wind that hit her was too strong to be called a light breeze...and told her that the typhoon was approaching faster than she'd thought.`
`Just as Kyrie had said, the wind was mixed in with small droplets of rain.`
` There was also a low rumble of thunder.`
`...It could start raining anytime.`
`Rosa headed for the rose garden.`
`She headed for the place where she had scolded Maria a short while ago.`
`...It was almost lunchtime.`
`The children had been told to come to the mansion around lunchtime,`
` so they were probably in the guesthouse, waiting to be called.`
`...Even if Maria didn't come to them, they would surely think I took her to the mansion with me...and wouldn't worry much.`
`...After all, she had been with her mother, so there should've been no reason to worry.`
`I was here, and I abandoned my daughter to the worsening weather...!`
`"Mariaaa!!`
` Are you there?!!`
` If you're there, answer me!!"`
`"......Uu-."`
`I was right.`
`She was still standing stock still, ...exactly the same way she had been, in the place where I had scolded her.`
`Held in her hand...was the candy that I'd bought, given her, and then stepped on and crushed.`
`With that gripped in her hand, she stood there as the powerful winds whipped her hair about, tormenting her...`
`"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!!`
` Sorry, Maria...!!`
` Forgive Mama...!"`
`"...Uu-.`
` Mama, welcome back...`
` ...I waited a long time for you to come back.`
` ...The scary witch pinched me, but I stayed strong, waiting for Mama to come back without crying..."`
`"...Maria...!`
` ...Forgive your Mama, ...forgive your Mama..."`
`"You didn't do anything wrong...`
` You were just possessed by a bad witch again...`
` So I'm fine.`
` I really like you, Mama.`
` I love you..."`
`"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!`
` I'm sorry, I'm sorry...`
` ...Please forgive your Mama...`
`...for losing to the bad witch......"`
`Rosa buried her face in Maria's small chest, crying and begging forgiveness.`
`...And once again, those tears dripped down after who knows how many times.`
`If only the brilliant sun had been shining on the two of them,`
` all of their cares would have evaporated, and it might've felt like they could begin anew.`
`...However, what surrounded the two of them was the worsening weather.`
`Sadly, there were only fierce winds with occasional thunder.`
`The sound of Maria sniffling brought Rosa to her senses.`
`...If Maria stood exposed to the wind for too long, she'd probably catch a cold.`
`"...Okay, Maria,`
` it's almost time for lunch.`
` Why don't you come back to the mansion with me?"`
`"Uu-.`
` Won't go."`
`"Wh-Why not...?"`
`Rosa thought she'd already received Maria's forgiveness, so she hadn't imagined Maria would refuse.`
`But that expression on Maria's face didn't look like that of a child resisting her mother.`
` ...So Rosa couldn't understand why Maria wanted to stand still, pointlessly, as the weather grew even worse.`
`Maria answered that question...`
`"It's Beatrice.`
` She'll be here really soon.`
` So I'm waiting."`
`"......Maria..."`
`Rosa struggled to find words for a moment, then fell silent.`
`...They'd only just managed to make up, after all.`
`She chose her words carefully, trying to get Maria to come with her to the mansion without denying the witch outright.`
`"...Beatrice is...`
`coming?"`
`"Uu-!"`
`"Really...?`
` Then instead of waiting here, why don't we wait in the mansion?`
` If you stay in this wind too long, you'll catch a cold..."`
`"She'll come!`
` Beatrice will come!!`
` And when she does, I'll give her candy.`
` I'll do trick-or-treat!`
` I'll give her a jack-o-lantern marshmallow candy and say <Happy Halloween>!!`
` Uu-!!"`
`Maria pulled yet another sweet out of her handbag, moaning uu-uu-.`
`Rosa was bewildered and didn't know what to do...as Maria started being difficult again...`
`At that time, there was a sudden blast of thunder.`
`It was probably a sign.`
`...A sign that this island had been sealed off by the storm, detached from common sense and reality.`
`So, after this moment, all common sense would probably cease to apply.`
`The wind blew even stronger, and amidst that blizzard of scattered rose petals, `
`...a figure appeared, leaving Rosa unable to imagine that this was a scene from reality.`
`...It was probably...no, definitely...fantastical.`
`After all, that shadow of a person was......`
`"Beatrice!!"`
`Maria dashed over to the shadow.`
`...Normally, Rosa would scold her daughter if she dashed over to someone whom she hadn't seen before and didn't know.`
`...But Rosa forgot to do that, was unable to do anything but stand there, stunned.`
`"...It's been quite some time.`
` Have you been well?"`
`"Uu-!`
` I've been well!`
` Witches don't catch colds!`
` Uu-!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Indeed, a witch can use curses to make people catch colds, ...but how foolish would it be if she caught one herself?`
` From now on, you should take care not to catch something like a cold yourself."`
`She patted Maria's head as she said this, smiling roguishly...`
`Rosa couldn't have known the name of the woman who was happily spoiling Maria.`
` ...However, Maria had called it out in the beginning when the woman appeared.`
`So, even though Rosa had never met her, even though the woman still hadn't introduced herself, Rosa was able to know her name.`
`......However, that name held a special meaning on Rokkenjima and in the Ushiromiya family.`
`...There's no way something that stupid could be...!`
`"Beatrice!`
` <Happy Halloween>!`
` Look at what we bought!`
` I'll give you one too, Beatrice.`
` Uu-!"`
`"Indeed, <Happy Halloween>.`
` Hoh, is this for me?`
` How truly adorable, that a candy would be made out of this, the lonely light of a man lost in the darkness of Purgatory, unable to go to heaven or hell."`
`"...Right now, on this island that has been cut off both from the world of humans and the world of nonhumans,`
` there may be no more suitable sweet.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"......Hmm?`
` Maria, what's wrong with that one?"`
`The witch noticed the sweet Maria was grasping.`
` ...It was Maria's candy, which had been stomped on by Rosa until it reached this pitiful state.`
`"...Uu-.`
` Got stepped on and smashed.`
` ...Can you fix it, Beato...?"`
`Maria didn't go so far as to say that it was her mother who'd stepped on it.`
`However, for some reason, when the witch saw that candy, she looked at Rosa and grinned.`
`...A chill went down Rosa's spine, as though this gaze was staring straight through her.`
`"It shall be easy.`
` Give it to me."`
`"Uu-!"`
`Maria held the candy out gleefully.`
`...Rosa could do nothing but watch, stunned.`
`...How did this person plan to trick Maria, somehow undoing the fact that the candy had been pitifully trampled...?`
`Maria looked as though she believed it could be fixed good as new.`
`...Without real 'magic', there was no way such a thing could be possible...!`
`"My, my, it is quite crushed, isn't it?`
` ...Come, Maria.`
` Close your eyes and try to remember."`
`"Because it really was that wonderful a candy.`
` The candy of your memories is always full and fluffy.`
` So you try to remember as well.`
` What kind of candy was it really♪"`
`...Along with those strange words, spoken as though singing an improvised folk song, the witch threw the sweet into the air.`
`Maria was closing her eyes and remembering, just as the witch had told her to.`
`...What shape had that crushed candy really had?`
`Therefore, only Rosa saw that scene.`
`The sweet that had been thrown into the air...burst into a gold color...no, that wasn't it.`
` Those were golden butterflies.`
`It scattered into several golden butterflies, ...and they began to gather at the witch's hand, which was held up to the sky.`
`And as she did this, ......unbelievably, ......it returned to its beautiful original form, no different from when it had been bought...`
`Only Rosa and the witch witnessed that scene.`
`Unable to comprehend what was occurring right before her eyes, Rosa stood with her mouth hanging open, completely forgetting to shut it...`
`"You may now open your eyes.`
` Take it.`
` With this, your sweet has returned to normal."`
`"Uu-!!`
` Beatrice is always incredible, incredible, *giggle*!!"`
`"..............."`
`There was a stark contrast between Rosa's shock and Maria's innocent joy.`
`...Was that what the witch was laughing at?`
`A smile floated to Beatrice's face, one different from the smile she'd shown Maria.`
`"...Does my face seem familiar?`
` If you stare so fixedly, you might burn a hole through it."`
`"Umm...ah, I-I'm sorry...!"`
`Those words triggered something very clearly in Rosa's mind.`
`...Rosa knew this face.`
`......She knew it from the portrait of the witch.`
`But...no, wait, ...could this mystery woman really be...?!`
`"...Maria,`
` I give you this in exchange for the sweet you gave me."`
`"Uu-...?`
` A letter?"`
`The witch pulled a Western envelope from her pocket and gave it to Maria.`
` However, when Maria made to open it, the witch stopped her.`
`"You must not.`
` The time will soon come for you to open it, but until then, you absolutely must not.`
` Take good care of it.`
` That will be your invitation to the Golden Land."`
`"The Golden Land!!`
` So you'll finally take me there!!`
` *giggle*!`
` *giggle*!!"`
`"Take it and treat it with care.`
` You must not show it to anyone."`
`"Uu-!`
` I'll keep that promise!`
` You've always gotta keep promises with witches!"`
`"...And this is for you."`
`"Huh......?`
` ...M-Me...?!"`
`She probably hadn't imagined that the witch would speak to her, too.`
`Rosa was bewildered by the second Western envelope, which was thrust before her.`
`She'd seen this type of envelope before.`
`...There could be no mistake.`
`It was one of Kinzo's special envelopes, used when he wrote with his own hand and bearing the Ushiromiya family crest.`
`It was sealed with red sealing wax,`
` ...and furthermore, it had a mark that seemed to have been made by the Head's Ring.`
`In other words, even without asking what was inside this letter,`
` ...Rosa knew that this woman, whom Maria called Beatrice,`
` was trusted enough to be placed in charge of a personal letter of the current Ushiromiya Head...!`
`"It could have been any of the four siblings.`
` However, the fact that I have met you here probably means that you were chosen by Kinzo's roulette.`
` ...So take it.`
` Then read its contents aloud while seated at the dinner table, when all of the siblings are gathered."`
`"......What did you say...?"`
`Rosa looked back and forth several times between the witch's face and the envelope that had been handed to her.`
`Today was the family conference, and the biggest object of discussion would be the inheritance problem.`
` ...So, she had joined together with Eva and Rudolf,`
` and they planned to force a certain condition on Krauss to try and extort several hundred million yen in cash out of him.`
`It was as if the witch could see through all of that.`
`...What does she intend to announce...when all of us siblings are gathered?`
`And with a personal envelope that no one but the Ushiromiya Head can use...!`
`"...Maria,`
` the weather is getting worse.`
` Return to the guesthouse and wait for lunchtime.`
` ...And Rosa, we will meet again later.`
` Allow me to introduce myself again at that time.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`The witch turned her back to her, laughing.`
`...Then, she began to head towards the mansion with an air of composure.`
`Maria energetically called out and watched her go, then began to dash towards the guesthouse, leaving Rosa behind.`
`...As though she wanted to inform the other cousins of her fortunate meeting with the witch as soon as she could.`
`At last, Rosa was left alone in the rose garden as the winds grew stronger,`
` ...unable to do anything but pray that what had happened was just a daydream...`
`When the witch reached the entrance hall, ...Genji could be seen there.`
`Genji welcomed the 'guest' approaching from the entrance hall with a respectful bow...`
`"I have been waiting, `
`......Beatrice-sama."`
`"...It's been quite some time, Genji.`
` ......Hmph.`
` You've gotten old."`
`"...No matter how old it becomes, furniture carries out its work like furniture until the end."`
`"...I remember how that man's wife used to be jealous of you.`
` ...Is Kinzo doing well?"`
`"He is doing extremely well."`
`"...Hmph.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch probably laughed because she knew Kinzo's own doctor had announced that Kinzo didn't have long to live.`
`...However, if anyone actually looked at Kinzo and noticed his vigor, which wasn't at all what you'd expect from someone nearing the end of his life,`
` they might easily call that 'doing extremely well'.`
`...Maybe that's what the witch was laughing at.`
`"Then let us go and greet him.`
` I look forward to hurling curses at each other after 30 years."`
`As the witch grinned, she started walking, leaving Genji behind.`
`...Her gait was like that of a family member who knew the inside of the mansion well.`
`Genji followed her in the manner of one who served her.`
`At that time, Kyrie came out of the parlor.`
`...She'd probably gone out to fix her makeup or something.`
`And when she saw Genji following a witch, she was surprised, although her expression did not change.`
`A guest for Kinzo had arrived, despite him being almost dead, on the day of the family conference when the fate of the inheritance was to be decided.`
` ...And furthermore, this person was familiar enough with the Ushiromiya Family household that Genji was following behind her.`
`...Kyrie immediately realized that this person she had never met before was deeply important.`
`Kyrie and the witch's eyes met.`
`...Realizing that it would be rude to pretend not to notice, she greeted the witch.`
`"......It's a pleasure to meet you."`
`"You were Rudolf's second wife, yes?"`
`"Correct.`
` This is Kyrie-sama, Rudolf-sama's current wife."`
`From this exchange, Kyrie realized that this was a guest of fairly high rank, even amidst the Ushiromiya family.`
`......And, the fact that this was a guest on that level,`
` ...coupled with her resemblance to the portrait in the entrance hall, ...made Kyrie's eyes instantly open wide...`
`"...Pleased to meet you.`
` I'm Kyrie.`
` I wonder if this is our first meeting.`
` If we have met before, I apologize for forgetting your name."`
`"...So, you intend to force me to state my name, even though you already have a vague idea of the answer?"`
`".................."`
`Kyrie thought she'd given a sociable and humble greeting.`
`Her expression grew slightly cloudy at that openly oppressive response.`
`...At any rate, this didn't seem to be a person she could grow to like.`
`...But if Kyrie's guesses were correct, ...this 'witch' probably held a vital key to what her own husband was most interested in,`
` something that couldn't help but influence tonight's family conference...`
`So without shooting back a retort, Kyrie silently watched her go up the stairs to the second floor, with Genji following behind.`
`So, when someone tapped her shoulder from behind, she was so surprised, she almost choked.`
`It was...Natsuhi...`
`"......Kyrie-san,`
` why are you standing still in a place like this?`
` Are you not feeling well...?"`
`"I-I'm sorry.`
` ...I was just fascinated by the portrait of the witch for a bit."`
`"...Oh, you mean the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
` The one whose gold was supposedly necessary for the revived Ushiromiya family we see today.`
` ...Quite a fantastical story, just what one might expect from Father."`
`Natsuhi spoke in a perfectly ordinary way.`
`It was the sort of comment you'd expect from someone convinced that the thought of a witch existing was ridiculous, no more than another of Kinzo's ramblings.`
`...However, for some reason, that point of view didn't seem quite right to Kyrie now.`
`Just a moment ago, she herself had seen the Golden Witch come in from the entrance hall and climb up the stairs.`
`So, Natsuhi's words made it feel as though someone was trying to deny the existence of that person, or else make it seem like she was never there to begin with...`
`"...I'm sorry.`
` Maybe I'm getting a bit of a headache.`
` ...I think I'll rest for a little while."`
`"Oh, is that so...?`
` Then I have some good headache medicine.`
` I'll get it for you..."`
`The hallway in front of Kinzo's study was filled with the scent of sweet poison, peculiar to that green liquor...`
`Genji, who was completely used to it, did not grimace.`
`...And the Golden Witch didn't grimace either.`
`"...How long has he been in there since last he left?"`
`"I believe it has already been several years."`
`"......Is he that desperate to turn me into a bird in a cage?`
` ...How pitiful.`
` ......By now, you're the bird in a cage.`
` ...You're the ghost of this study, are you not?`
` ...How pitiful that he is unable to recognize even that."`
`"...Until he meets you again, he will probably continue his research, even after literally becoming a ghost."`
`"Is it love or madness or a delusion?`
` ...And yet, perhaps even those can form magical power when strong enough.`
` ...You sad magician."`
`The witch grasped the doorknob to the study.`
`...When she did, there was a sound like that of flesh burning and splitting open.`
`...It was the sound of the doorknob literally burning the witch's hand.`
`"...Beatrice-sama..."`
`"What is this?`
` ......A ward against magic!`
` ...Is that person unable to get by without relying on something like this...?"`
`"...I have heard that this door would cause you great pain, Beatrice-sama.`
` Shall I open it...?"`
`"No, ...it is fine.`
` If he wins, I will be a bird in a cage for all eternity.`
` ...If he loses, only the life of a laughingstock will be left, the life of a pitiful magician who went mad with love and lost everything."`
`"...Already, Kinzo and even I are nothing more than pieces laid out on the game board.`
` ...All that is left is for the roulette to decide who wins and who loses.`
` ......Until the roulette shows its result, there is no need for me and Kinzo to meet again."`
`The witch looked at her hand, which was beginning to heal bit by bit, even though it had been horribly burned.`
`"...Or perhaps that is why he has this ward here in the first place.`
` ......Hmph.`
` ...Yes, perhaps even that is honorable in its own way.`
` ...By now, everything sits on top of Kinzo's game board."`
`"I like it, Kinzo.`
` Allow me to enjoy my game with you.`
` ...Allow me to enjoy the failure of the final gamble...of the old magician who fell in love with me and threw away his entire life...!!"`
`"......Who is it?"`
`"Excuse me...`
` I have brought lunch."`
`"Enter."`
`"...Excuse me."`
`After receiving approval, Kanon entered the VIP room, pushing the serving cart that carried lunch.`
`...The servants called this room the witch's VIP room.`
`That was because Kinzo strictly ordered that it always be kept clean, so that it could be used at any time.`
`...Even so, guests would not be allowed into this room no matter who they were.`
`...That's why, at some point, the servants had started calling it the VIP room, which was supposed to be set aside only to welcome the special person Kinzo waited for, `
`...the witch from that portrait.`
`And today, Kanon realized that this was absolutely true...`
`When he entered the room, ......the blonde-haired witch was gazing out the window.`
`Outside, the rain was no longer falling weakly.`
`...As she looked out at the beautiful rose garden, which had been tended to over several days for today's sake...`
` As she saw the winds and rain ravage it, was she struck by some sentimental feelings?`
`Kanon was not able to tell anything more from her back, which faced him.`
`"...I will prepare the meal,`
` ...Beatrice-sama."`
`Kanon went out of his way to call out the witch's name, ...hoping that she'd turn around.`
`He wanted to know.`
`...He wanted to know if the witch who'd tempted him and Shannon in the past had really appeared again.`
`...When he did, ...the witch whose name had been called...laughed, her back still facing him.`
`Holding back her voice, she laughed.`
`Kanon was startled...`
`It was almost as though she had read his mind and knew that he had called out to her, hoping to make her turn around...`
`"......It smells good.`
` It appears Krauss hired a good cook."`
`".........`
`...Yes.`
` ...He is called Gohda and was employed here recently."`
`"...There's nothing better than being skilled at cooking.`
` ...Delicious food completes the three pillars of pleasure for living in the human world.`
` It is the secret to preventing boredom after a thousand years.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`Kanon and the witch's eyes met.`
`...Then, she grinned...`
`Without a doubt.`
` Certainly...`
`This was clearly...the witch from that day, Beatrice...`
`The witch that no one but he and Shannon could see in the past finally held a form...and had arrived openly as a guest through the entrance hall...`
`"......Bea...trice...`
`......sama."`
`"It has been a long time,`
` ......Kanon, the furniture.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`'!s1`
`......been quite some time..."`
`Kanon tried to remember to be polite to this guest for the time being.`
`...But the visit of this suspicious witch made dark clouds start to enshroud his heart, especially considering that today was the family conference...`
`"You appear to be uneasy about what I plan to do, now that I have appeared.`
` ...Am I right...?"`
`"..............."`
`Kanon didn't force an answer.`
`...This witch probably reads minds.`
`...So it's pointless to go to the trouble of saying it out loud.`
`......Of course, she could read even his inner resistance.`
`So the witch giggled at Kanon's childish defiance.`
`"...I came to fulfill my final promise with Kinzo."`
`"Your final promise...with the Master...?"`
`"...I lent Kinzo a mountain of gold.`
` ...When Kinzo gives that up, it will be returned to me with interest.`
` ......I came to accept that interest tonight."`
`".........I don't know what you're talking about."`
`However, uncertainty began to gather in his heart.`
`...Whatever this witch had to say, it couldn't be anything good.`
`"...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` There's no mistake!`
` Whenever witches have something to say, it's never anything good.`
` You are correct.`
` However, like scissors, the potential of witches depends entirely on how they are used.`
` ...Sometimes, there are those like King Solomon who succeed in great exploits."`
`"......However, most who make use of us end up meeting a cruel fate, just like in fairy tales.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!`
` ......But Kinzo is crafty.`
` He has incorporated even my collection of the interest into his ceremony.`
` Is he an absurdly powerful magician, who can surpass even me?`
` ...Or else a mere fool possessed by madness?`
` ...Amusing.`
` Truly amusing...!"`
`Kanon couldn't guess what the witch was muttering and laughing about.`
`...All he knew...`
`was that anything that made this witch laugh...`
`must have the exact opposite meaning for everyone else.`
`...And in the back of his mind, the horrifying words the witch had spat at him in the past began to resurface.`
`What, did you think I'd lend you my power and ask for nothing in exchange?`
` I'll gladly assist a pair in love.`
` And in exchange, I'll enjoy watching the cruel fate they'll eventually meet.`
`I have never come across a better show, not over the course of a thousand years...!`
`"............`
`...Could it be...that you..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Gehehehhahahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`"......Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved hometown.`
` You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key."`
`The witch suddenly began to recite a bizarre poem...`
`It was something he remembered hearing.`
`"Could it be......the witch's epitaph...?"`
`There was no mistake.`
`...It was the epitaph that accompanied the portrait of the witch Kinzo had put on display.`
`The relatives had guessed that it referred to the location of the hidden gold,`
` but no one knew what it meant for sure.`
`The witch suddenly began reciting that epitaph.`
`"...Kanon,`
` since you are furniture, I imagine you've heard about it from Kinzo.`
` ......The day when everything will be returned to the Golden Land...has come.`
` Rejoice.`
` ...The day when you will be freed from the shame of living as furniture...has finally arrived."`
`"............!"`
`"I believe you've wanted that for a long time.`
` ...To furniture, which finds no value in its own existence, merely existing day to day must be nothing but agony."`
`"...To those with souls, this world is worth clinging to, but those without souls find this world to be full of nothing but suffering.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`Complicated expressions flitted across Kanon's face.`
`...This was the day of release that Kanon had been looking forward to.`
`...However, the coming of this day had been mercilessly sudden.`
`And for some reason, he didn't like the hateful tone used by this witch as she informed him of the coming of this long-awaited day of rest.`
`...Kanon couldn't even decide what emotion he should be feeling...`
`"...Why do you not rejoice?`
` Could you actually have some regrets left in the real world?`
` ...As mere furniture?"`
`'!s1`
`...regrets.`
` Because I am...`
`...furniture."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` ...You truly are a model specimen of furniture.`
` ...How nice, how nice.`
` ...However, it won't be any fun if you have no regrets at all."`
`"...Are you saying regrets are how you find pleasure?"`
`"That is correct!`
` Most witches who live for a thousand years get tired of life!`
` In order to escape boredom, I adorn people's fates with fruit and brandy and cook them like cakes.`
` I find humans dancing through oppressive fates inside an oven to be so very entertaining...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` You see, I'm actually a tad famous in this regard.`
` ...So much so that rare guests come from far away to see my skill at cooking.`
` ...Heheheheh, perhaps this is something that mere furniture cannot understand."`
`Kanon couldn't understand what the witch was saying.`
`However, he fully realized that this was a terrifying being who treated the fate of humans as a show,`
` enjoying it whenever some harm befell them.`
`...However, furniture has no soul or life, much less a fate.`
` Pitiful 'furniture' does nothing but serve until the day they're released from the real world.`
`...To furniture like that, the witch, who had come to release them from everything, was a being to be received with overflowing affection...`
`Even though the day Kanon should have been waiting impatiently for had come, he was confused by his own inability to accept it easily.`
`...Why was it...?`
`......The face of Shannon, the person he loved as a sister, rose to his mind.`
`...And for some reason, Jessica's face did too.`
`".........Nng."`
`Kanon bit his lower lip hard enough that it hurt.`
`...Thinking about Jessica like that was something furniture must never do.`
` Even though he thought he'd known that, even though he'd complained about Shannon's relationship, ...why was it that Jessica rose into his mind at a time like this?`
`...He felt a little shameful at his own naivety.`
` And to forget about Jessica, he turned his thoughts to Shannon.`
`Shannon is also furniture.`
`...She has no reason not to rejoice at the coming of the day when all will return to nothingness.`
`...But Shannon, `
`...through her relationship with George, ...has experienced an emotion forbidden to furniture.`
`Even though she isn't qualified to be bonded with him, she's still trapped in a dream that she isn't allowed to have.`
`Will Shannon...`
`be able to joyfully accept this development?`
`...No, she won't.`
`...Shannon still has lingering regrets.`
`...Those will probably become a great source of pain and torture for her.`
`And those lingering regrets...were planted by none other than this witch.`
`Why?`
` Because that would be 'more interesting', nothing more...!`
`"......This day...that Shannon should have been waiting impatiently for...will probably be a harsh burden for her, `
`...giving her emotions that she must never experience.`
` ......I thank you for granting me...us furniture the day of our release."`
`"...And, I hate you for making this day so difficult for Shannon to accept...!"`
`"I wanted to make you suffer from your regrets as well, just like Shannon.`
` ...However, you continued to live like furniture with foolish honesty, never getting ensnared by me."`
`"......And yet, it seems you loved Shannon a little too dearly, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Shannon's regrets are now your regrets.`
` ...Will those feelings transform into hatred for me...?"`
`"..............."`
`"If you wish to kill me, give it a try.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` As Kinzo's furniture, you should have at least that much power, right?`
` However, if you kill me, then the day of rest for furniture will not come for all eternity.`
` ...Could you bear to live with that...?`
` Are you truly capable of resisting when I try to release you...?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` ......Kneel!"`
`"...Wh-What...?!"`
`"Kneel and kiss my shoes.`
` ......Otherwise, I will leave this place.`
` ...I'll go back and never show myself again for all eternity.`
` ......So, Kanon.`
` Do you think you could bear to live like that...?"`
`".........Nggg..."`
`"If the door to the Golden Land is opened, your hard life as furniture will end.`
` ...If you desire, I can even give you life as a human.`
` After that, you will be on the same level as Jessica!`
` Surely you want to experience the taste of love...!"`
`"......There's no point trying to hide it...`
` After seeing Shannon indulging in the sea of sweet love, you grew jealous.`
` ...You are sorely tempted to know the taste of love...`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"...Stop it, ...stop it...!`
` Are you trying to ensnare me again...?!`
` I won't be reduced to a toy for your amusement...!"`
`"Hoh.`
` Then I will be satisfied with Shannon alone.`
` After all, you aren't the only one who was implanted with a seed.`
` Even fruiting plants sometimes fail to bear fruit, after all."`
`"......The one who obtains the key must then travel to the Golden Land in accordance with these rules.`
` On the first twilight, offer the six chosen by the key as sacrifices.`
` On the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close..."`
`The witch recited the epitaph again.`
`It was so sudden, and diverged so strongly from the current topic.`
`However, that challenging smile made it seem almost as though she was using that epitaph as a threat against Kanon.`
`"......Do you not understand?`
` ...For the ceremony of the epitaph to succeed, at the 'second twilight', two who are close must be offered as sacrifices.`
` ......It could be any two who are close.`
` A husband and wife, or even a pair of lovers.`
` ...According to the rules of the ceremony, who will be selected is up to me to decide on a whim.`
` ...Don't you think there could no more fitting sacrifice for the second twilight than Shannon as she is now...?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle!!"`
`"......Y-You dirty......"`
`Kanon realized something.`
`...Until today, he'd thought he'd given up everything else and lived as furniture, acting like furniture.`
`...But in reality, that wasn't true.`
`He loved Shannon too dearly.`
`...Therefore, when Shannon was in pain, Kanon shared in that.`
`If only Shannon had continued to live as furniture, `
`indifferently like Kanon, without any regrets in this world, he wouldn't have had to be in so much pain...!`
`The witch planned to toy with Shannon, who had known the taste of love...`
`no, whom she had taught the taste of love, ...as she killed her.`
`She wouldn't be welcomed into the Golden Land and granted a compassionate release.`
` Instead, if the witch had her way, she'd be used as a sacrifice, subjected to the utmost of torture and pain, and forcibly turned into a human foundation for this evil ceremony...!`
`And this witch would probably make Shannon meet this horrible fate...for no reason other than that it was amusing to her.`
`...Furthermore, she was threatening to do this so that she could make Kanon, who had never submitted to the witch, finally give in...`
`It was that simple.`
` ...In the end, though he had tried to resist the witch and avoid pleasing her, he had only made things more amusing for her.`
`...After all, he was furniture.`
` No, a toy.`
` ...They were nothing but toys meant only to distract her from her boredom...!`
`".........Da...mn........."`
`"What will you do, Kanon...?`
` If you kneel, I might refrain from choosing Shannon as a sacrifice, see?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I've always wanted to make a toy like you surrender someday.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hehihihihihihihihi!!"`
`Without even a fragment of elegance, the witch sneered at Kanon and laughed indecently.`
`...That's right, she'd predicted Kanon's submission even before he'd made that decision himself...`
`"..................Nnng..."`
`...Kanon......chose to get down on both knees in front of the witch...`
`It didn't matter what happened to himself.`
`...However, ......the one thing he couldn't bear to see......`
`was Shannon, who had given him his only reason to live during his days as furniture, being toyed with like this...`
`That was why...`
`kissing the shoes of the witch...was an easy oath for Kanon to make.`
`...When his quivering lips actually touched the witch's shoe...`
`...Beatrice let a look of ecstasy rise to her face, ...then laughed with a voice filled to bursting.`
`At that moment, the witch, who had grown bored of life after a thousand years, was completely filled with the evil emotion that she lived for...`
`When lunch ended, the relatives moved to the parlor.`
`Rosa had bought a high-class brand of black tea from a famous store in Ginza.`
` That had been served, and the parlor was filled with a pleasant aroma...`
`Since the children were there too,`
` the adults tried to interact like normal relatives on the surface, talking peacefully about recent events and how their children were growing up.`
`It had started raining, `
`so the children couldn't do anything but sit here like this, watching TV, unable to go outside.`
`Maria was apparently a TV kid,`
` and she kept watching a boring daytime program without getting bored, giggling all by herself.`
`At first, Battler joined in, seeming to deepen his relationship with Maria,`
` but he had gotten up early that morning and was gradually hit by a wave of drowsiness...`
`"...Fuaaaaaah..."`
`"Oh, that's a big yawn.`
` Did you get up really early this morning?"`
`"...Well, something like that.`
` Now that all the tension's gone, I've started getting sleepy while listening to the sound of the rain."`
`"Tension?`
` Heheh, you call freaking out like that 'tension'?"`
`"At least it is for me.`
` ...Fuaaaaaaaaaaaaaah..."`
`Battler gave another great yawn and slowly lay down on the sofa.`
`He really did look tired.`
`George and the others had tried talking to him, thinking it was a sign of boredom, but when they realized he really was sleepy, they decided to let him be.`
`"My, my.`
` They say that if you lie down right after eating, it'll become a mackerel.`
` Hohohoh...!"`
`"...Stop kidding around.`
` Gohda-san said we'd be having calf steak tonight.`
` That'd make it mackerel steak."`
`"Kumasawa-san,`
` he looks pretty tired.`
` Could you get him a blanket?"`
`"Hohohoh.`
` Here you go."`
`Kumasawa brought a blanket over from the shelf.`
`...The large parlor wasn't cold, but the air had gotten a little chilly.`
`So when Battler took the blanket, he immediately wrapped himself up in it like a turtle.`
`"...You really were sleepy.`
` When would you like to wake up?`
` I'll wake you."`
`"...Nah, can't say I've got any particular requests.`
` ...You can wake me up if you need something from me,`
` ...and if you don't, just let me sleep forever.`
` ...Night..."`
`"Uu-?`
` Battler's sleeping?`
` A nap?`
` A nap?`
` Uu-uu-, I'll do it too!"`
`"H-Hey, Maria,`
` Battler's sleepy, so you've gotta leave him alone.`
` Kumasawa-san, could you give us another blanket?"`
`It was doubtful whether Maria really wanted to take a nap.`
`She probably saw Battler wrapped up in a blanket and wanted to do the same.`
`When she received the blanket from Kumasawa, she joyfully wrapped herself up in it and set up camp again in front of the TV.`
`"Sheesh.`
` ...And just when we'd finally gathered all the cousins together after six years.`
` This guy doesn't have a clue that he's the main guest of this family conference, does he?"`
`"...I can still hear you.`
` ...We took it easy eating lunch, and there's even a typhoon and rain outside now.`
` ...Since I've got nothing to do, that means it isn't my turn yet."`
`"I wonder about that.`
` If you have a passive attitude like that, and never do anything unless something else happens, your life will be pretty boring, right?"`
`"...No, that's not what I mean.`
` ...How should I put it?`
` ...At times like this, I like to think about it this way.`
` ...It isn't my turn.`
` If this were a play, it wouldn't be my turn to go on stage.`
` ...So the best thing to do is stay on the wings of the stage."`
`"You're always the main character of your own life, right?`
` Why are you acting like you're in a supporting role?`
` ...You've gotta move forward by yourself and get up on the stage."`
`"......That's not what I mean.`
` I'm trying to say it's not my turn yet...`
` Kuaaaaaaaaaaah...`
` Sorry, I'm sleepy, and my mind's a mess.`
` Gimme a break...`
` Munyamunya..."`
`"No kidding.`
` You're so sleepy you're spouting nonsense.`
` ...Let's leave him be for now."`
`"Hey, I can't let him get away with saying crap like that.`
` ...You're always the main character in your own life.`
` I've got serious issues with what Battler's saying!"`
`"He's just half-asleep.`
` Don't take him too seriously."`
`"......It's just that lack of guts...`
` You know, not wanting to go on stage just because you think you can't be the main character...`
` ...Something about it just pisses me off..."`
`With distant eyes, Jessica gazed out the window at the gray rose garden obscured by rain...`
`When she put her forehead up against the glass, the pleasantly cool sensation seemed to chase away memories she was trying to forget...`
`"......So, it just wasn't your turn yet? Is that it?`
` ...Then...just when will you get up on the stage...?"`
`In that case, who the heck is the main character on this stage...?`
`"......Dang, it's like you think you can do whatever you want.`
` ...What the hell is all this?`
` ...It's all screwed up...!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!`
` I was merely amused that your reason for denying me was based on whether there were 18 or 19 people.`
` I just tried changing my opening move, no more."`
`"...Your greatest basis for denying me is simply that I wasn't laid out as a piece on the game board.`
` So, all I have to do is start by focusing on the queen, like this.`
` ...Isn't opening the road for the queen on your first turn one of the classic moves in chess?"`
`"......Q-Quit playing around...`
` There's no way...I can accept something like this, right?!`
` A witch came in, walking right through the entrance hall, you say?!`
`'!s0`
`"What's this...?`
` In the last game, I gave you incredible freedom in making your moves, correct...?`
` This time, all I'm doing is moving my pieces in response to your moves.`
` ......Are you already giving up, right at the start...?"`
`"...Y-You bastard...`
` Don't mess with me!`
` Like hell I'd give in!`
` Great move, go ahead and just move however you like."`
`"Okay, so your turn's far from over, is it?`
` ...Move however you want!`
` Form a huge battle formation while you still can."`
`"I'll definitely withstand you.`
` I'll definitely corner you!!`
` Come at me as best you can. I don't want you to have any excuses."`
`"...You aren't even close to making me accept something like a witch.`
` ...That's right, just now, it looked like Maria's candy was fixed with magic, `
`but you might've actually had another one of the same candy hidden in your pocket... and switched them with that little show, making it only look like you'd fixed it with magic!`
` Yeah, that's right, that has to be it! It's useless, it's all useless...!"`
`"...Hohoh?`
` Rosa saw the moment when the candy split into butterflies, correct?"`
`"Wh-Who cares about that?!!`
` That was a hallucination or a trick, ...or maybe she just saw it wrong!!`
` That isn't a big problem!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` So, you throw out the part you can't explain as trivial?`
` ...I see, is that your move in response to mine...?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* You've dug your own grave,`
` ...Ushiromiya Battler...`
` Fuhahahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` It still isn't your turn yet.`
` Allow me to make my move for a little longer.`
` It has barely begun, the Turn of the Witch!!"`
`When they started hearing Battler's snores, the relatives went their separate ways, leaving the parlor and letting Battler sleep in silence.`
`Even though it had been so lively in the parlor with so many people gathered there,`
` ......when all of them scattered at once and were swallowed up by the vast mansion, it created an eerie silence, with no sound except that of the rain...`
`"Nope.`
` I haven't met a person like that even once.`
` Aneki?"`
`"...I haven't met them.`
` ...Kyrie-san, is that true?"`
`"...Even I only greeted her briefly when she came into the entrance hall.`
` She looked like she was a bit over twenty.`
` I told her my name, but she didn't tell me hers.`
` ...She was being guided by Genji-san, and I saw her go up to the second floor."`
`"So, it'd probably be faster to find Genji-san and ask him directly.`
` ...Still, what a strange turn..."`
`The mystery woman had spoken to Kyrie.`
`Without naming herself, she'd sneered that Kyrie should've had a vague idea as to her identity.`
`...That brought someone to mind.`
`...And then there was her look-alike, the witch in the portrait...`
`"Was this person trying to say she was...`
`...the witch of the portrait herself?"`
`"I realized she was probably laughing at me for that reason.`
` ...Even though it was our first meeting, she spoke as though she knew I'm your second wife."`
`"...Aneki,`
` you really don't know anyone like that?"`
`"You talk too much.`
` I've never seen a blonde woman like that go in or out of this mansion!"`
`"That kind of thing doesn't matter.`
` ...The problem's what happens if that woman starts callin' herself Beatrice, if she starts callin' herself the manager of Father's assets."`
`"Or, maybe she plans to call herself his mistress's daughter...and demand that she get a share of the inheritance.`
` ...Either way, we've had one heck of a joker slipped into the deck.`
` ......Did Nii-san bring her here?`
` ...Or did Father...?"`
`"This is bad.`
` ...We thought we could manage something if we could corner Aniki in our talks.`
` ...But this takes us back to square one."`
`"......`
`...I don't know what kind of schemes you've been making when I'm not around, dear,`
` ...but it looks like we've been given a little time to form a counter-strategy."`
`"...Yeah.`
` Better to have some time to prepare...`
`than to have that blonde-haired nee-chan suddenly appear at the dinner table and scare the shit out of us."`
`"...Until we know why she's appeared, there's a limit to the kinds of counters we can make.`
` ...What could she be after...?"`
`"Isn't it obvious?!`
` She's going to claim that she's the rightful heir to Father's inheritance!`
` Father is still captivated by Beatrice.`
` If he had a daughter with her, you can bet that he'd want to leave all his fortune to her!`
` She might even thrust some strange will in front of us!"`
`"...If we take it to court, we could probably claim a quarter of a half of it, `
`......but it'll probably be impossible to divvy out the inheritance until that's settled.`
` ...We can't have that.`
` I can't, and neither can you, Rudolf!`
` And the same goes for Rosa, right?"`
`"...Each one of us needs to gather money quickly for our own reasons.`
` ...It's our biggest weak point.`
` So, ...what are they after?`
` Kyrie, ...can you guess?"`
`"...............`
`...This is all news to me, but it sounds like we're starting from the premise that we've got an urgent need to collect money, right?"`
`"............Nnggg......"`
`"...Kyrie-san,`
` in a man's business, you sometimes need funding when you're on the offensive.`
` Please understand that."`
`"......What's this, Rudolf?`
` You didn't tell Kyrie-san about it?"`
`"...Sorry.`
` I wasn't really hiding it.`
` ...Actually, it was kinda..."`
`"It's all right.`
` If you decided this wasn't something you needed to tell me about,`
` I won't press you about it right here.`
` ...What's more important is finding out what this Golden Witch is after, right?"`
`"Yeah...`
` ......Now that you know what we know, can you see how the enemy might come at us?"`
`Rudolf had a certain measure of trust in Kyrie's unique thinking technique, 'chessboard thinking'.`
`Of course, it didn't give him any more peace of mind than fortune telling, `
`but every time Rudolf was polishing up some important strategy, he'd give a great deal of thought to Kyrie's advice...`
`For a while, Kyrie pressed her finger against her forehead, considering...`
`"......Judging by the fact that her arrival was kept hidden until today, `
`she must be planning to catch us by surprise in some way.`
` ......We can't tell for sure whether she's after assets or being recognized as a relative."`
`"However, her coming was kept secret until today,`
` which probably means she didn't want us to take any measures against her, something we might have done if we'd known beforehand.`
` So her goal is probably something that could be hindered if we were to take measures against her.`
` ...Understand?"`
`"I get it...`
` So, if she had a will that Father had already written, or something that could prove that she's a blood relative...`
` ...If she had some unshakable, rock-solid proof like that, you'd think she'd announce it beforehand."`
`"...That's right.`
` On the contrary, since we're in a position to doubt her, she should've brought a lawyer or an expert `
`and thrust some completely undeniable proof before us.`
` If she could."`
`"Hmmmm.`
` ...So, the mere fact that she's launchin' a surprise attack...shows that our foe can't win with a frontal assault.`
` Makes sense.`
` If a trump card can win no matter what, it's best to play it out in the open.`
` If you play it in a roundabout way, it might end up weakenin' its impact."`
`"...Skipping to the conclusion, `
`...we can probably expect to be faced with some huge surprise, `
`something related either directly or indirectly to the inheritance problem that's on everyone's minds.`
` ...Our opponent probably plans to overawe us simply by the impact of this shock.`
` ...However, no matter how great the impact might be, it cannot be absolute."`
`"In other words, ...we have enough leeway to take advantage of this."`
`"You've really got brains!`
` Even understandin' just this much is really reassurin'!`
` In other words, you're tellin' us not to get sucked into our opponent's pace."`
`"...In the end, it's an extremely simple conclusion.`
` No matter what our opponent brings up, we should deal with it calmly, without rushing things.`
` ...This is just the very first step in the art of negotiation.`
` You really can't say you've predicted your opponent's thoughts with just this."`
`"Come on.`
` ...Just like usual, that was pretty good.`
` ......Now that we know we've got a little leeway to attack, it helps us relax a bit."`
`"What we don't know is how she's connected to Krauss nii-san.`
` ...Will it be a surprise for Krauss nii-san too, or was he actually the one who called her here in the first place?`
` ...If it's the latter, that might make things very troublesome."`
`".........That's right.`
` ...Secretly calling a mystery woman on the day of the family conference...`
` ...It would be in terrible taste, but it does feel like something Nii-san would do."`
`"Aneki, let's do this.`
` ...As long as she can't clearly prove her identity, we won't accept her position in any way."`
`"That would be for the best.`
` ...Already, she's refused to introduce herself to Kyrie-san.`
` ...We can't let our conference be disturbed by the statements of some unknown woman."`
`"...She might even show us proof that she's a blood relative.`
` If she can prove Father's blood runs through her veins, like with a maternity record document, there's nothin' we can do."`
`"It's always possible to suspect that physical evidence has been faked.`
` And even if it's real, in order to prove that the person in the documents is the person we see, we'd need to check their condition at a hospital.`
` ...At the very least, it'd be impossible to prove that now, on Rokkenjima."`
`"...You're right.`
` So, in other words, it's something like this.`
` No matter what's shown to us now on Rokkenjima, it can't be accepted as truth.`
` We can't believe anything until the typhoon passes and they prove it to us at the proper place.`
` ...*giggle*."`
`"Spotting all kinds of holes in stuff like this is Aneki's specialty.`
` We'll be counting on you."`
`"Are you joking?`
` You'll be helping too.`
` ...We need the money.`
` We need it quickly, and a large sum!`
` Our fates are all tied together in this.`
` ......As if we'd just stand by and let some suddenly-appearing mystery woman destroy the inheritance we're after...!"`
`Rudolf and Eva always formed a united front as siblings at times like this,`
` sickened by the idea that their own inheritance might be snatched away by an outsider.`
`Kyrie noticed how indomitable they looked, shook her head slightly, and gave a small sigh as she gazed out the window.`
`Outside, it was still raining heavily, and everything was gray, having lost all vibrance.`
`The lush garden that the sun had shone on earlier now felt like a lie.`
`For some reason, the words Eva said a second ago kept repeating in Kyrie's head.`
`...So, in other words, it's something like this.`
`No matter what's shown to us now on Rokkenjima, it can't be accepted as truth.`
`There was an odd nuance to those words.`
`At that moment, the island was closed off by the typhoon and isolated.`
`They had access to no public institutions and no hospital.`
`So on this island, no matter what manner of proof related to the outside world was shown, it would always be possible to call it a lie.`
`It would be impossible to prove that something was the truth.`
`Now that they were isolated from the outside, all truths whose proof lay in the outside world would be called 'lies'...`
`So does that mean...`
`...that right now, on this Rokkenjima, no truth exists at all?`
`...Does it mean that everything will now be ruled by 'lies' alone?`
`It almost gives the illusion...`
`...that we've left the human world of truth...`
`...and have been shut away inside another world, one of lies.`
`...Kyrie remembered that woman's appearance one more time.`
`She remembered both what she had looked like...and the witch of the portrait.`
`On this island, which has been cut off from the world of humans and shut away in the world of nonhumans, ...a nonhuman being has come to visit.`
`Kyrie couldn't think of the smile that had appeared on that woman's face...as anything other than a portent of misfortune...`
`I get the feeling my chessboard thinking's missed a vital premise,`
` ...one that'll be necessary to understand that misfortune-bearing smile.`
`...Yes, `
`that smile made me feel as though someone inhuman was mocking me.`
`I've based my reasoning on the assumption that our opponent is a 'human' like us.`
`...However,`
` just like this island is now, she may be a being that isn't human, and human values may not matter to her.`
`If that's true, `
`...all of our reasoning is useless.`
`For what reason has the witch been invited here today?`
`......Only one thing is certain.`
` ...Now, in this instant, she's staying somewhere in this vast mansion...`
`"...Maria,`
` ......around lunchtime today, we......met her outside, right?`
` A woman.`
` Who...was she?"`
`"...Uu-.`
` I said it over and over.`
` ...Beatrice."`
`"Maria, did you ever meet Beatrice before that...?"`
`"Uu-.`
` I've met her every year."`
`"Every year...?`
` In this mansion on Rokkenjima?"`
`"Uu-."`
`"...I don't know what uu- means!`
` Is that true?!"`
`"...Yes."`
`"How long have you been meeting her?`
` How many years ago did it start?!"`
`"...Uu-.`
` ...I don't know."`
`"You don't know?!`
` What do you mean?!`
` Was it last year?`
` Two years ago?!"`
`"...Longer than that.`
` ...Uu-."`
`Rosa was astonished.`
`...Only the Ushiromiya family mansion existed on this island.`
`So there couldn't have been any humans other than themselves here.`
`And yet, Maria said she'd been meeting with this suspicious woman every year during the family conference...`
`If what Maria said was the truth, `
`...then that strange woman called Beatrice had been at the family conference every year.`
`...That's insane.`
`Is Maria saying that eerie woman was at the family conference every year, and none of us ever noticed it...?!`
`Even though Rosa had just met the woman herself a couple of hours ago in the rose garden,`
` she was overcome with a strange emotion that told her not to accept that existence...`
`'What' in the world did I meet with earlier today in the rose garden, as the typhoon grew near and the winds roared...?`
`"...Maria,`
` you said you've met with her every year.`
` ...What do you two do when you meet?"`
`"Uu-.`
` We sing songs and learn magic.`
` And I learn how to draw magic circles."`
`"R-Really?`
` That's incredible.`
` ...Maria, you often draw scribbles...`
`I mean, magic circles in your notebook, right?`
` Did she teach you that too?"`
`"Uu-!`
` You know what? Beatrice drew examples to teach me!`
` C'mon, c'mon, look! Look!"`
`Maria joyfully fished around in her handbag.`
`...Then, she drew out a single notebook and began opening to that page.`
`Most of the pages were covered with drawings that were literally scribbles.`
`All of them were occult-like things, `
`and, while it might sound rude to Maria, who was joyfully flipping through the pages, they were all creepy.`
`"Look! Here!`
` Beatrice drew it!!`
` Uu-!!"`
`Each one of the pages in the group Maria opened to...had an eerie magic circle.`
`...Furthermore, at a glance, Rosa could see that Maria hadn't drawn them.`
`The strength of the strokes, the thickness of the lines, how clean the shape was.`
`...By itself, it wasn't enough to guess the background of the person who had written it,`
` but it was enough for Rosa to be sure that it was someone older than Maria.`
`Rosa had to accept it now.`
`...There really was a person on this Rokkenjima that she herself hadn't known existed until now,`
` and this person had come to the family conference every year to play with Maria.`
`"......Maria,`
` umm, does the witch, Beatrice, live here...?`
` Or does she live outside the island like us...?"`
`"Uu-.`
` ...Beatrice is the witch of Rokkenjima, so she lives on this island."`
`"......So, you're saying she's on the island even on days when it isn't the family conference, ...right...?"`
`"Uu-."`
`"I don't know what uu- means!!`
` Yes or no?!"`
`"...!`
` ......Yes.`
` ...Uu-."`
`...Wh-What in the, what in the......`
`I can't believe it, I can't believe it...!`
`How long has this unknown witch been living on this island?!`
`I used to live on this island.`
`I lived on this island, passing the time in the mansion, in the rose garden.`
`And even so, I never...`
`...encountered a witch like that,`
` ...right......?`
`"Mama...?`
` Mama...?`
` What's wrong...?`
` Mama...?!"`
`"......My head......hurts..."`
`...I was probably getting a little mixed up with my memories from when I was a young girl.`
`When I was young, I was terrified of the witch, unlike Maria.`
`So for me, the name Beatrice was a synonym for terror.`
`......Surely, my fear from those days has been revived by the appearance of a woman going by that name...`
`...She can't be a witch.`
`...She's obviously a 'human' calling herself Beatrice, right?`
`That's right...`
`...That witch entrusted me with an envelope...`
`What in the world could that be?`
`Rosa pulled that Western envelope out of her pocket.`
`...It was one of the envelopes that bore the Ushiromiya family crest, which Kinzo used for his personal letters.`
`...And its red sealing wax had even been sealed by the Head's Ring, which Kinzo held.`
`......Which meant...this envelope belonged to the Ushiromiya Family Head.`
`...In other words, it was from Father.`
`Why was a woman calling herself Beatrice holding it, and why did she give it to me?`
`That's right, `
`I'm sure she said to read this aloud at dinner.`
`......What in the world could be written inside...?`
`A sense of uncertainty gripped Rosa,`
` as if opening this envelope might let loose incredible misfortune...`
`...However, at the same time, a little curiosity sprouted up too, urging her to find out what was written inside before the other siblings could.`
`Using common sense, ......one might guess that it contained a huge decision somehow related to Father's inheritance.`
`Actually, ...since she'd received it from a woman who called herself Beatrice, there simply had to be some connection.`
`...Does it mean this person wants, not just the four, but a total of five people to be included in the inheritance?`
`.........I need a large sum of money, ...and I can't wait long.`
`I feel like such a sinful daughter for discussing Father's inheritance while he's still alive.`
`......But this is no time to spout off cheap ideals.`
`...And I've even colluded with Rudolf nii-san and Eva nee-san, in order to get some money out of Krauss nii-san.`
`Coming from that position, ...I can't help but see the appearance of the witch as a sign of approaching misfortune...`
`......What could be written in here?`
` ...I'm sure it's something frightening.`
`......Shall I read it secretly myself first?`
`The witch requested that it be read at the dinner table, with everyone gathered.`
`...But if that's what she wanted, why couldn't she just read it aloud herself at dinner?`
`Why did she go to all the trouble of entrusting it to me?`
`......Simply put, is it because she doesn't mind if I read it secretly beforehand...?`
`...It'd be better to secretly read the contents first.`
`...I understand that'd mean breaking my promise.`
`...But this is no longer the time for cheap ideals...`
`Depending on the contents, I should probably discuss it with Eva nee-san and Rudolf nii-san too...`
`...They're always really good thinkers when it comes to this kind of thing...`
`When I gulped...and put my hand to the red sealing wax...`
`...Something suddenly pulled on my sleeve, and I let out a small scream.`
`"......Wh-What?!`
` .........M-Maria?`
` Don't scare me like that.`
` What is it?"`
`"...Uu-......`
` .........You mustn't."`
`"Huh...?"`
`In Maria's expression...was the same portent of misfortune she'd felt from that witch, and it sent a tingle up her spine...`
`"...Beatrice told Mama to read that letter during dinner.`
` ...You mustn't break a promise with a witch.`
` ......Kihihihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`"Th-That's not it.`
` I just wanted to look at the envelope for a second.`
` ...I'll keep my promise.`
` ...After all, I always tell you to keep your promises.`
` ...Of course I keep my promises..."`
`"Yes.`
` Mama's a good girl.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`"Th-`
`That laugh...`
` ...It isn't cute, so stop it."`
`"......Uu-."`
`"Come to think of it, you received a letter too, Maria.`
` ......What was written inside?"`
`"I haven't opened it.`
` ...Beatrice said I mustn't open it until the time to open it comes.`
` So I'm taking good care of it.`
` ...Uu-."`
`"...I-I see.`
` ...You listen well to what Beatrice says, don't you, Maria?"`
`"Uu-.`
` I'm Beatrice's disciple, so I listen well to what my teacher says."`
`".........I-I see."`
`Rosa realized something.`
`...Mixed in with Maria's gaze...was the glint of someone that wasn't her.`
`...If Rosa broke the rules and opened the envelope here, Beatrice would definitely learn of it.`
`...Because Maria was the witch's disciple.`
`......Maria was in contact with that witch...`
`"...I'll keep my promise.`
` So tell Beatrice not to worry, okay?"`
`"Uu-!`
` I'll tell her."`
`"...Hey, Maria.`
` ...If I wanted to speak to Beatrice, how could I meet her...?"`
`"I don't know.`
` ...Beatrice is very fickle, so she always appears suddenly.`
` I don't know a way to get her to meet me.`
` ...But you know, she's always watching me.`
` So if I get in trouble, she'll definitely come and save me afterwards.`
` ...She's definitely...erased her form...and is hiding close to me.`
` ......Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi."`
`"...D-Don't I always tell you to stop laughing like that?!!"`
`Rosa reflexively hit Maria on the head.`
`...That put a stop to Maria's laughing, ...but it wasn't able to erase the color that had risen to those eyes, a color that seemed to bear a portent of misfortune.`
`Rosa swore.`
`...She swore that, at least until they left this island, she would not leave Maria alone.`
`......She couldn't allow an unknown being to make direct contact with her daughter any longer...`
`"...Maria still hasn't come back.`
` ...I wonder if she's getting scolded by Aunt Rosa again."`
`Ever since they'd met Maria at the airport, she'd been romping around, chatting about Halloween the whole time.`
`...But maybe she'd cut loose a little too much,`
` acting a little too boisterous on the plane, on the boat, and during lunch, ...because Rosa had cautioned her several times.`
`At times like that, Aunt Rosa tended not to scold her much in front of people.`
`...More often, she would take Maria aside and scold her alone.`
`So, since Maria had been called off somewhere, they figured she must be getting scolded.`
`When they looked at the clock, they realized it was almost 6:00.`
`Of course, they couldn't imagine she'd been getting scolded all this time.`
`Maybe it was time for some anime she watched every week to start.`
`She probably hadn't left the mansion's parlor.`
`"Maybe Battler-sama woke up, and they've been playing together."`
`"After all, Maria-chan thinks of Battler-kun as a new friend.`
` ...She must've had a lot of fun when she played Halloween with Battler-kun at the airport."`
`"Battler looked like he was having a lot of fun himself.`
` Maybe he's gotten big, but he hasn't changed a bit."`
`"That's true.`
` ...I get the feeling Battler-sama was gracious enough to remain as he was six years ago."`
`"Shannon, do you remember what he was like then?"`
`"Yes.`
` Because he was...well, very energetic.`
` *giggle*."`
`"I also remember the four of us playing together six years ago.`
` Shannon acted a lot like a big sister back then."`
`"That's right.`
` I get the feeling she was even more dependable then than she is now.`
` Ahahahaha!"`
`"B-Back then, I...umm...didn't truly understand my place, so...`
`umm...I did quite a few rude things..."`
`"...Don't worry about 'understanding your place' in that sense.`
` When you're on the job is one thing, but when you're taking your break and with us, like now, I'd rather you stay and be friendly, just like the old days."`
`"That's right.`
` ...There's nothing wrong with acting differently, depending on whether you're the servant Shannon or off-duty Sayo.`
` ...You aren't a slave, you're just working as a servant, right?`
` ......I think of you, Shannon...`
`no, Sayo...as my oldest friend."`
`"......Thank you very much, Milady."`
`It seemed that Shannon understood the hidden meaning behind Jessica's words.`
`...After all, she'd heard a bit about Jessica and Kanon's history from both of them.`
`"............"`
`Apparently, George had heard something of that history too.`
`He walked towards the window and looked up at the darkening rainy sky...`
`"...Kanon may still be childish in some ways, but I think he's starting to grow a bit in his way of thinking."`
`"Well, uhh, hahahaha...`
` C'mon, quit it already.`
` Well, I guess I let myself get swept away by the mood once or twice...`
` You know, ...after watching you two...uhh, I might've gotten a bit jealous, feeling like I was getting left behind."`
`"...B-But forget about me.`
` More importantly, how's it going between you two?`
` Looks like it's goin' pretty good, huh?`
` Eheheh!"`
`"Err, ...I-I wonder..."`
`"Yes.`
` It's going very well."`
`Shannon was lost for words, her face red, while George answered brightly and immediately.`
`That carefree attitude made it easy to see that their relationship was proceeding so perfectly, it'd make anyone envious.`
`"Dang, I'm jealous.`
` ...So, does that mean Shannon's gonna resign and have a party soon?"`
`"I-I wonder...`
` I'm, uhhh..."`
`"Oh, there's a good question.`
` I wonder what she'll say."`
`George laughed teasingly as though pressing Shannon for an answer.`
` ...It was probably the way they usually flirted when they were alone.`
`Jessica could only smile bitterly and say yes, yes, thank you, that's enough.`
`"I have a dream.`
` I don't just mean some ambition to become the leader of my own domain in business.`
` I also dream of building a happy family together with a partner I can spend my life with."`
`"...I want two kids at the very least.`
` It'd be nice to be able to do some sports as a whole family.`
` And many more things besides that.`
` I often talk with Shannon about that kind of thing.`
` ......Though, every time I do, she always laughs and says I'm getting ahead of myself."`
`"...For some reason, even at the age I am now, I find myself thinking about what it'd be like to live peacefully in my old age.`
` ...With healthy grown-up kids and grandchildren running around all over the place.`
` If only I could spend the rest of my life at a slow pace surrounded by that, together with Shannon forever."`
`"Yeah, you're definitely getting ahead of yourself.`
` ...But, how should I say it... It sounds like you, George nii-san."`
`"Being surrounded by a family like that would probably be so wonderful.`
` ...The ideal family I've painted in my mind is something like that."`
`...To Shannon, who'd been raised in an orphanage, that harmonious image of a family was probably something to be yearned for.`
`...And George, who had made an absolute promise to grant that wish for her, may truly have been a fitting person for her to spend her life with...`
`To Jessica, Shannon was a precious friend.`
`...George was surely the one most fit to entrust that friend's future to.`
`"Well, I don't wanna throw cold water on you guys, `
`...but Uncle Hideyoshi aside, what're you gonna do about Aunt Eva?`
` Won't it be pretty tough to win her over?"`
`"............"`
`"Ahahaha.`
` There's no reason for anyone to worry about something like that.`
` ...No one but me gets any say in who I choose to be my partner.`
` I will bring Shannon happiness.`
` Whose permission do I need for that?"`
`"...Whoooa.`
` George nii-san, that was cool...`
` Can't believe you can say stuff that embarrassing out loud.`
` I don't remember you ever being that kind of character in the past."`
`"As they say, if you don't see a boy for three days, you should watch him closely.`
` ...I grow as much as anyone.`
` ...I intend to study more and more and grow to be the man Shannon deserves, the one who can bring her happiness."`
`Maybe even George realized how embarrassing the words coming out of his mouth were.`
`His face turned very slightly red, and he scratched his head.`
`".........George-san."`
`"It's okay.`
` I'm sure Mother will be difficult, but you can leave that to me.`
` You'll see. I'll make all the relatives accept you as my partner."`
`"Awesome...`
` I'm jealous of you, Shannon, seriously!"`
`"...U-Umm, I'm very grateful...`
`th-that you're willing to go so far..."`
`"Come to think of it, I'm starting to feel like a third wheel here.`
` Maybe I'd better leave, huh?"`
`As Jessica rose with a forced smile from the bed she'd been sitting on,`
` the phone rang.`
`Before Jessica picked up the receiver, wondering what this could be about, Shannon looked at the clock and jumped.`
`...Apparently, she'd spent too much time on her break.`
`"I-I'm sorry...!`
` I forgot it was time for work...!`
` Th-Then, if you will excuse me...!"`
`At the same time Jessica picked up the phone, Shannon began dashing out of the room.`
`"Ah, Shannon!`
` ......Again, the usual time, at the usual place."`
`"......Y-Yes.`
` ...E-Excuse me!"`
`"Hello, it's Jessica.`
` ......Ah, Genji-san.`
` Yeah, Shannon's going back to you guys now.`
` We held her up, `
`so please don't scold her.`
` Yeah, yes."`
`"I see.`
` So it's almost time for them to get ready for dinner."`
`Many plates were lined up on the counter in the kitchen.`
` Preparations for dinner were proceeding steadily.`
`...The number of plates lined up there...`
`...Was 19.`
`That was one more than should have been set up for the annual family conference.`
`"I can't accept it...!`
` Why can't I deliver it directly?!"`
`Gohda-san flared up at Genji, paying no heed to the pot that was spitting steam.`
`The Master enjoyed eating alone in his study, so his food needed to be served in that room.`
`However, that was something that always happened.`
`Of course Gohda-san would want to set the table for the Master with his own hands, since he'd put his heart and soul into his cooking.`
`...But the Master had imposed a strict rule that none but the servants bearing the Golden Eagle crest enter his study.`
`......So while Gohda-san would be able to greet the Master from outside the study,`
` not once had he been granted the honor of carrying his cooking inside.`
`Gohda-san was always irritated by this.`
`...Of course, he was a newcomer in terms of years of service.`
`However, he had piled up plenty of experience from his previous jobs, and he was quite confident that he'd be able to perform in front of Kinzo in a manner that would do him no disservice.`
`And yet, simply because he was not permitted to wear the Golden Eagle, he still hadn't been blessed with this honor.`
`...Can you imagine what damage that would do to his pride?`
`You might think tonight was a repeat of that, but it wasn't.`
`Because tonight, there was a person other than the Master who wanted their food carried to their room.`
`Apparently, this person is an extremely rare and honored guest, and we've been given strict orders to treat them in the same manner as the Master, the Family Head.`
`Gohda-san must have wanted to earn some points by serving this honored guest with his own hands.`
`After all, he was an extremely vain person.`
`If he wasn't qualified to serve the Master, then at least a guest of the same rank...`
`He simply couldn't find time during lunch, so Kanon-san had gone in his place.`
`...So, he truly desired to personally serve this person tonight's meal, the best dinner of the year.`
`But Genji-san had put a stop to that.`
`...Something about how Gohda-san didn't wear the Golden Eagle.`
`......After being told once more that he wasn't qualified, Gohda-san lost his patience.`
`Aah, so heartrending, Gohda-san...`
`I cannot do anything more than watch like this from the shadows...`
`"Kumasawa-san, if you have enough free time to dawdle around, please get the dining hall ready.`
` Is the tablecloth set?!"`
`"Hohohohoh... My apologies..."`
`When it became her turn to bear his wrath, Kumasawa slid out into the hall.`
`"Beatrice-sama is of exactly the same rank as the Master.`
` ...All rules regarding her are to be respected just as much as those involving the Master."`
`"...Gohda-san, please devote your attention entirely towards your own task and serve all the relatives..."`
`"I wouldn't mind if it was you, Genji-san, but is it really okay to let a child like this serve such a guest?!`
` If she made some blunder, it would be quite embarrassing."`
`"I know they've served here a long time, but that doesn't mean they've been trained in the proper areas.`
` If you'll allow me to speak freely, they are completely lacking in the fundamentals that might qualify them to interact with such a guest!"`
`"..............."`
`Gohda spoke bluntly, even though Shannon was standing right there in the kitchen.`
`Shannon was the one whom Genji had ordered to carry dinner to Beatrice's room.`
`...By the ranking system among the servants permitted to wear the Golden Eagle, Shannon certainly was the second-highest in rank.`
`...If the highest ranked, Genji, went to set the table in Kinzo's room, then it fell to Shannon to set the table in Beatrice's room.`
`Gohda's pride was always horribly injured by this ranking system.`
`...At times like this, he'd speak out bluntly and rudely against Shannon and Kanon.`
`Gohda kept raising examples of each of Shannon's failures until now, making a ruckus about how she couldn't do this or was terrible at that.`
`Shannon, who listened to this with her head hung in shame, heard Kanon's voice from behind her.`
`...Kanon had been leaning against the wall in the hallway near the kitchen entrance, a blind spot from the inside, and had been listening to all of this.`
`...He probably knew that if he entered the kitchen, sparks would start to fly his way.`
`"......I've got to say it.`
` The man's scum."`
`"......B-But we could learn a lot about the fundamentals of entertaining guests from him.`
` ...Gohda-san has learned so much, so he'd be a great reference..."`
`"Hmph.`
` ...Nee-san, you sure are nice."`
`"...More importantly, `
`......is the guest in the VIP room......`
`really Beatrice-sama, as they say?"`
`"...Yes.`
` ......I met her when I was sent to serve her lunch.`
` ...There can be no doubt it's her."`
`"R-Really?`
` Was she doing well?"`
`"..............."`
`Kanon remembered that he and Shannon had different impressions of Beatrice.`
`To Shannon, Beatrice was a cupid of love, who had granted her magic to establish her relationship with George.`
`Judging by the expression that rose to her face, `
`...it looked like she couldn't wait to inform Beatrice of how her relationship with George had progressed.`
`...However, Kanon already knew.`
`That witch came here with a terrifying goal in mind.`
`...The nebulous witch that only they'd been able to see in the past...had now revived so fully that she could walk in openly through the front door...`
`and even have dinner carried to her.`
`...Once, when she'd vanished from in front of Kanon...`
`The witch said something about how her own power was still weak.`
`......So, if that witch was now appearing so openly, did it mean she'd finally regained her former power?`
`And she said something else too.`
`......She definitely said that she'd sown the seeds of love...while fully aware that they would fail.`
`And she said even more.`
`......She definitely said that the day had finally come...upon which the door to the Golden Land would be opened.`
`"......Shannon,`
` ...she's planning to hold some bizarre ceremony with the Master, ...and you can bet it'll be something too horrible to imagine.`
` ...And no one will be able to resist."`
`"What are you talking about...?"`
`"She came here.`
` ...She came here as the Master requested, so that the door to the Golden Land would open, and so that everything would be returned to the Golden Land.`
` She definitely said that to me!"`
`".................."`
`In the past, `
`...the two of them, as furniture working for Kinzo, had been told what opening of the door to the Golden Land meant.`
`So Shannon understood everything, without having to ask a single question.`
`......And because of that...she felt a deep despair.`
`...Something tore at Kanon's heart as he looked at that expression twisted with grief...`
`".........How could...`
` ......Why, ...why now......?"`
`"...Didn't I tell you?`
` We ~ib~are~ib~ furniture!`
` ...Because you acted like a human, because of love, ......you're incapable of obediently accepting the day our service comes to an end...!"`
`"............Once, I wished this day would come.`
` ......But it never came, year after year...`
` ...I didn't know how long we'd be forced to endure suffering as furniture...`
` ......So I thought.`
` ...I thought that day of rest wouldn't come for all eternity."`
`"......I thought the same thing!`
` But I believed that it would definitely come someday!`
` So I never forgot that I'm furniture!`
` But Nee-san, you did forget!"`
`".........It's...my fault, isn't it...`
` ......It was I who..."`
`"Yeah, it's your fault, Nee-san.`
` ...If only you hadn't experienced love, `
`...we'd both be happy that this day has finally come!`
` You built up too many pointless regrets!`
` Even though you knew you'd have to leave this world someday!!"`
`".........Will the ceremony...begin tonight...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` .........And she said one more thing.`
` ...Tonight, George-sama will probably give you an engagement ring, Nee-san."`
`"....................."`
`That was a fact.`
`...George supposedly had an engagement ring hidden in his pocket today.`
`...And surely, he would hand it over tonight.`
`"...She brought you two together, planning to use you as the sacrifices of the second twilight.`
` ...Get it?`
` She tempted you and took advantage of you!"`
`".........I see.`
` ...I never thought of that."`
`"But she told me.`
` ...She promised that if you don't accept the engagement ring tonight, you won't be chosen as a sacrifice, Nee-san.`
` .........I think our chances of being able to go to the Golden Land together are very slim."`
`"There will be 13 sacrifices.`
` Only five will be left alive.`
` ...The chances of us being part of that group are tiny.`
` ...But if you just accept her offer, those chances will rise!`
` I want to take that bet!"`
`"Our salvation is in the Golden Land.`
` We're gonna reach that place and gain humanity.`
` And then, I want to live life as a human, together with you, Nee-san...!`
` If we do that, we might be able to find...`
`...true love!"`
`"............`
`...In the past, we used to dream about being able to go to the Golden Land.`
` ......If we go there, any wish will be granted.`
` ......We'll be saved from this pain.`
` ......That's what we believed."`
`However, in this ceremony, only a few people would be invited to the Golden Land, chosen by fate and chance.`
`...Everyone else would lose their life as a sacrifice midway through the ceremony.`
`However, in the past, Shannon and Kanon had thought that whether they reached the Golden Land or were sacrificed,`
` they would still be released from their duties as furniture.`
`...That meant this ceremony would definitely bring release to furniture like them, no matter what happened.`
`"I don't like it.`
` ...Together with you, I want to make up for all the suffering we've endured.`
` I won't become a sacrifice.`
` Nee-san and I will remain alive.`
` And we'll reach the Golden Land together."`
`"......So I won't let you become the sacrifice of the second twilight!`
` Please, Nee-san!`
` Don't accept that man's ring!`
` If you don't accept it, she promised not to select you as a sacrifice!!"`
`".........I...cannot do that.`
` ...Tonight's ring is very special.`
` ...My heart won't let me refuse it."`
`"Nee-san...!`
` The sacrifices of the ceremony are decided on the witch's whims!`
` And that witch has promised to overlook just you, Nee-san!!`
` You alone will definitely be able to go to the Golden Land!"`
`"...Only me?`
` What about you, Kanon-kun?"`
`"The witch's game...is enough for me.`
` ...I'll slip through her clutches.`
` ......I am not powerless.`
` I'll tightly grasp that faint chance..."`
`".................."`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kan_2e330:`
`......let's drag ourselves to the Golden Land.`
` Then, `
`...we will gain humanity."`
`"......And when we've done that, `
`...maybe I'll be able to...`
`...experience romance just like you, Nee-san.`
` Maybe I won't have to...`
`...make someone cry just because I'm furniture..."`
`"......Kanon-kun........."`
`'!s1`
`had enough of being furniture...!`
` ...I'll definitely...`
`become human...`
` ...I'll escape this pain...`
`...no matter what......!"`
`"....................."`
`There were tears in Kanon's eyes...`
`By now, Kanon had noticed.`
`...Shannon hadn't been the only one to know and suffer from the taste of love.`
`He had too.`
`The tears Jessica had shown him that day...`
`and Jessica's pitiful face as she tried to smooth things over and stay bright ever since then...`
`had slowly wrought some kind of change on Kanon's heart without him knowing it...`
`"......Shannon!`
` I have been calling to you for some time now."`
`Shannon jumped at the sudden sound of Genji's voice.`
`Apparently, he had called for her repeatedly.`
`She hurriedly answered.`
`...When she turned back, Kanon had disappeared.`
`...It seemed he didn't feel like showing his tears to anybody...`
`"Y-Yes.`
` I'm sorry for being careless..."`
`"I entrusted Kanon with lunch, but it should have been you, as the next in rank after me, who carried it.`
` ......Beatrice-sama is the most honored guest of this house.`
` There is no more honored guest than her.`
` ...Please think of her as another Master, and be polite."`
`"...Please, take extra care that you make no blunders, understand?`
` It is quite painful for me to entrust this to someone as inexperienced as yourself, but there's nothing we can do about the house's rules.`
` ...Carry out your duties with the utmost of care."`
`Gohda had officially agreed, but he glared at Shannon with an expression that told her he definitely wouldn't forgive any mistakes.`
`Even Shannon felt that Gohda might as well go himself if he was so desperate to go,`
` ...but she considered this one of her responsibilities as one who had been allowed to wear the Golden Eagle, and had to give up.`
`...And anyway...`
`...I wanted to meet Beatrice.`
`What will I talk about?`
` What will I ask?`
` ...I don't know.`
`Will this be a meeting of gratitude?`
` Or one of grief?`
`Or else, ...what?`
` ...I don't know.`
`Shannon piled the witch's food onto the serving cart and left the kitchen at a slow pace...`
`The person knocking was Krauss.`
`"Father,`
` today is our annual family conference.`
` Haven't the siblings gathered here just to get a glimpse of you?"`
`"Aaah, be silent!!`
` I say I won't leave!`
` You're there too, aren't you Genji?!!`
` Why haven't you had my food brought here as I ordered you to?!!"`
`Kinzo screamed across the door.`
`...Genji was waiting behind Krauss.`
`"...Your meal has been prepared so that it might be carried to the study.`
` ...However, Krauss-sama has expressed his wish that you eat downstairs tonight..."`
`"Father,`
` I'm not asking you to do this every day.`
` Just for this one night, won't you gather together with your family?"`
`'!s0`
` Since when have you considered vultures circling in wait for roadkill to be family?!`
` Would you call rotting, oozing maggots family as well?!!"`
`"...............`
`...My, my."`
`Krauss shrugged at this answer, which he had half expected.`
`"Genji, carry the meal here as you were told!!`
` Why don't you listen to what I say?!!`
` Why?!`
` WHY?!!"`
`"...Genji-san,`
` I leave this in your capable hands.`
` ...My voice will no longer reach that man."`
`Krauss gave his head a small shake, then quickly turned his back on the door to the study.`
`...He had only come calling to save face in front of his siblings, knowing full well how useless this was.`
`After Genji watched Krauss disappear down the stairs, he called again across the door.`
`"...Master,`
` we have finished preparations for your meal to be carried here.`
` ......Shall we bring some for Doctor Nanjo as well?"`
`Nanjo could be seen in the study.`
`Because Kinzo had forcefully pestered him into finishing their long-lasting chess game, they had been playing against each other since the early evening.`
`Nanjo had announced as a doctor that Kinzo's days were numbered.`
`...So, he couldn't refuse if Kinzo demanded that they finish this game while he still lived.`
`Kinzo was thinking deeply about his move, concentrating more than usual.`
`...It had been Kinzo's turn for quite some time, and Nanjo, who was tired of waiting, had randomly pulled out a book on magic that he couldn't understand and was skimming it.`
`"......Kinzo-san,`
` you won't think of a good move just by folding your arms and sitting in front of the board.`
` Perhaps we had better take a break and refresh our minds..."`
`"Be silent.`
` ...Hmmm.`
` ...That should be enough to solidify my defense.`
` Will the bishop and the knight be able to penetrate that opening...?`
` ......Hmmmmm..."`
`Today, Kinzo was focused on maintaining a strong defense.`
`...Normally, Kinzo's motto was that offense was the best defense.`
` However, today was completely the opposite.`
`"......I am also hungry.`
` Shall we suspend the game here?`
` Besides, I've used my head so much without a break that I'm already feeling dizzy.`
` ...At this rate, I might not be able to perform at my best."`
`"...Now that won't do.`
` .........In chess, both players must always make their best moves.`
` ...Any other sort of move is merely a nuisance to consider, ruining a game whose focus is predicting your opponent's thoughts.`
` ...Such a thing considerably reduces our enjoyment."`
`Kinzo sighed deeply and finally shifted his gaze away from the board.`
`Chess isn't chess without an opponent.`
`...If that opponent is tired and wants to suspend the game, there's no getting around it...`
`"True, the goal of chess is for both players to make the best possible moves and aim for victory.`
` ...It's an intellectual game where reading your opponent is key."`
`"...But Kinzo-san, have you forgotten that there's another goal besides victory?"`
`"......What?`
` What other goal could there possibly be?"`
`"Hahahaha...`
` To think that you of all people would forget something like that.`
` ...Chess...`
`is a way to pass the time having fun with a friend."`
`"Nng.`
` ...You've got me there.`
` I believe I once said those exact words to you, long ago.`
` ......Yes, you've got me there."`
`Kinzo, who almost always wore a frown, relaxed his face for once and laughed.`
`...Nanjo felt like he'd been reunited with a close friend he hadn't seen in ages.`
`"That's how it is.`
` Now that I've managed to take a shot back at you, what do you say?`
` Will you go down with me and have dinner?`
` Why don't we discuss Kasparov's middle game along with some coffee?"`
`"............`
`...An appealing proposition, but I'm afraid I must decline.`
` ...I can no longer leave this room.`
` ...After all, the ceremony has already begun."`
`"......Is that so?`
` Well, my stomach is growling.`
` ...I will go downstairs.`
` Any time you feel like it-"`
`"Nanjo,`
` ......thank you."`
`"...Oh, what could you be thanking me for?"`
`"...We didn't finish our match.`
` ...However, it seems I have somehow achieved that second goal of chess, which I had forgotten.`
` And it would appear that goal is no less important than achieving checkmate."`
`"This isn't like you.`
` Why so sentimental?"`
`"...You said it yourself, did you not?`
` My days in this world are numbered.`
` ...Now, go.`
` And don't come to this room again.`
` ...Let us continue this match in the Golden Land."`
`"............`
`...That's fine with me, but we'll have to start over.`
` Losing that rook was a serious blow.`
` ...Well then, I will see you later."`
`"Yes, later.`
` ......Maybe in the Golden Land, or in Purgatory.`
` Or possibly in the next world."`
`".................."`
`Nanjo didn't say anything beyond that.`
`And, with a motion made smooth by familiarity, he pushed the button on the table that would release the auto-lock.`
`Then, after looking at Kinzo's back one last time, he left the study.`
`As he did, Genji's voice came from the hall.`
`"...If you are ready, Master,`
` I will now carry in your dinner."`
`"It may be my final dinner.`
` I must savor it.`
` ...Please, prepare it."`
`"As you wish.`
` ......And are your preparations complete as well, Master?"`
`"...Indeed.`
` In the time leading up to this day, this room has been carefully wrapped in a multitude of barriers.`
` ......Even if her roulette chooses me, I will definitely repel it.`
` ...I will remain alive, and will surely become one of those who reach the Golden Land...!`
` ...I shall repulse the visit of the reapers trying to drag me off to the Land of the Dead..."`
`"......Excuse me.`
` ...I have come to serve your meal."`
`Shannon entered the VIP room, bowing her head and pushing the serving cart.`
`The young woman by the window, gazing out into the supposedly empty darkness, was definitely that witch.`
`"So, it is Shannon this time.`
` How long it's been.`
` ......Hoh.`
` Your face isn't nearly as pale as it once was.`
` I can see you're no Kanon.`
` I hardly recognize you."`
`"......Thank you very much."`
`Shannon solemnly prepared dinner.`
`...There were actually several things she wanted to ask the witch.`
`...But they were all jumbled up, and she didn't know where to start.`
`Her heart was also jumbled up, and she didn't even understand her own emotions.`
`...So, she could only do her job dispassionately, with everything still vague.`
`However, the witch saw what was in her heart.`
`You can't hide anything from a witch...`
`".........I won't apologize.`
` I am a witch, after all."`
`"...Apologize...for what?"`
`"Come now.`
` ...Kanon must have told you about it.`
` I only rescued your love life because of my mischievous spirit.`
` ...It was nothing more than a seed I sowed so I could watch your love grow complicated, become twisted, and fail."`
`"......I imagine some people think it's more fun to hear about love than to have it."`
`"You......couldn't possibly be trying to thank me, right?"`
`"...I am.`
` ...No matter what kind of ulterior motive you had when you gave me the magic of love, `
`...it doesn't change the fact that I received it from you.`
` ......So even if you sowed that seed knowing that the two of us wouldn't be able to stay together for life, `
`...I won't hold a grudge against you."`
`"......Hmmmm.`
` ...It seems furniture is dull after all.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` This is where I show my skill by cooking it into something interesting."`
`"...I don't understand what you're thinking, Beatrice-sama.`
` ...You are a Great Witch, and people like us don't even reach your feet,`
` ...nor can we even imagine your grand thoughts.`
` But there is at least one thing I can say."`
`"...What is it?"`
`"Thank you for teaching me to be human.`
` ......You said it yourself.`
` ...I am no longer furniture."`
`".........Be silent, furniture.`
` ...If you were a true human, hearing the announcement of your death on the day that you were to receive an engagement ring should have you dancing around, mad with grief."`
`"But what are you doing?`
` Your face looks so enlightened, as though you've accepted everything.`
` ...Truly an anticlimax, furniture...!"`
`"No.`
` I am not furniture."`
`"Be silent, furniture."`
`"I won't be silent.`
` Because I'm not furniture."`
`"Are you saying you won't obey my orders?"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"Furniture obeys orders.`
` ...But a human decides for herself whether to obey orders or not.`
` ~ib~So I won't obey your orders~ib~`
`."`
`"Hmph.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle* hahahahahahahahahahahaha...!`
` ...I take back what I said.`
` You really are interesting."`
`"...If I hadn't sowed those seeds, you probably would have allowed the ceremony to control your fate without clinging to any emotions.`
` ...But now you've grown to become something truly interesting, something that will entertain me to no end.`
` That is well.`
` For I am not fond of boredom.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......Dinner is ready.`
` ...Here you go."`
`"Hmm.`
` ...Doesn't this look delicious?`
` ......If Gohda makes it to the Golden Land, perhaps I shall commission him as my chief cook."`
`"...I heard from Kanon-kun.`
` ......Something about how, if I rejected George-san's proposal, you promised not to make me a sacrifice."`
`"Indeed.`
` I said as much.`
` ...You would make an ideal potential sacrifice for the Second Twilight,`
` ...but because Kanon cried and screamed, asking that I spare you, I graciously listened to his words.`
` With the condition that you abandon your engagement, of course.`
` ...*cackle*cackle* See how gracious I am?"`
`".........What a foolish offer.`
` And what a foolish threat.`
` ...So, you used that to thoroughly bully Kanon-kun, did you?"`
`"Hoh.`
` So you comprehend.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`Apparently, Shannon had seen through it.`
`...She had apparently guessed at how the witch had bullied and humiliated Kanon, with that horrible promise as bait.`
`"I made him crawl on the carpet and kiss my shoes.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` And that's not all.`
` ...Do you want to hear the other ways in which I humiliated him...?"`
`Shannon silently shook her head.`
`"I've finally come to understand you.`
` You like to bully, confuse, and trouble people, and you do it to entertain yourself.`
` ......So now I know for sure...the one, single way I can resist you."`
`"And what might that be?"`
`"I don't care about you.`
` ...I'll carry out the fate that has been given to me, that's all.`
` I won't entertain you."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"......~ib~I don't care about you~ib~u...?"`
`The witch's features twisted in hatred for just an instant.`
`...It disappeared immediately,`
` but the expression that briefly rose to her face was rare for the witch, whose malicious smile usually never faded for a second.`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` ...I see, so you might resist me in that way.`
` How amusing.`
` How truly entertaining.`
` I'll kill you.`
` You and your lover both...!"`
`"...If that's the fate you've decided upon, do as you will.`
` ......I won't be afraid, and I won't stand against you.`
` After all, I don't believe the cruel fate that's coming is something controlled by your will.`
` We humans know nothing about fates that might come to pass in the future.`
` That's why I'll live to the fullest until the last instant, following my convictions and the fate set before me.`
` Fate is just a roll of the dice.`
` There's no malice in it.`
` Even if you claim there is, I won't believe it."`
`"...Hoh.`
` So, even though you've quit being furniture, you have no fear of death.`
` ...It seems you believe this will bore me, but you couldn't be more wrong.`
` ...The thought of seeing whether you can hold onto that view until the last moment...merely serves to intrigue me more and more.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"I can't stand this.`
` ......Why did you take the form of a human, appear in front of us, speak with human words, and ridicule us?`
` ...If you hadn't appeared in front of us, if you hadn't predicted the future, `
`......we would've been able to live life to the fullest until the last moment."`
`"That's what witches do.`
` I live off your fates, reigning as a high-order being does over low-order beings.`
` Your fates are nothing more than Fragments.`
` If I cup my hands together, I could scoop out as many of those as I want."`
`"...Just like how no matter what the beef cows I raise might babble, it doesn't change the fact that I'll be having them for dinner.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"...We are powerless, so we cannot fight against your ceremony or fate.`
` ...But I can make you unhappy right now."`
`"Hoh.`
` And how were you planning to accomplish this?"`
`"...By walking away from this place right now.`
` No matter how I respond to your words, it will only amuse you.`
` Refusing to respond to your questions is my only method of resisting you."`
`"I see, I see.`
` You might be able to take a shot at me.`
` ...But you cannot defeat me, yes?`
` ...I have the power to kill anyone for eternity."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"......I cannot wait to see whether you can keep up that resistance...in an endlessly repeating cycle of death and rebirth.`
` ...`
`~ib~Don't you forget it, okay?~ib~`
` You spoke those words yourself.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*"`
`"Well then, if you will excuse me.`
` If you need anything, please call me."`
`Shannon gave a reserved bow and faced away.`
`...With that gesture, maybe she really did take a shot back at the witch, just as Beatrice had said.`
`...Because, when the witch called out again, she sounded a little more quick-tempered than she had before.`
`"Kanon thanked me.`
` ...Can't you?`
` Can't you thank me for bringing you your day of rest?"`
`"Furniture may be happy when their day of rest comes,`
` but I am a human.`
` So I have nothing to thank you for.`
` ...Is that all you have to say?"`
`"......You plan to accept George's ring, yes?`
` Don't forget that if you do, I will abandon the promise I made with Kanon, the promise that you would not be selected as a sacrifice."`
`"If you need anything else, I'll have someone else come.`
` If you will excuse me."`
`A flat-out interruption.`
`Shannon still hadn't answered her.`
`And the sound of the door closing came instead of an answer.`
`Shannon's resistance probably struck far more deeply into the witch than Shannon herself thought.`
`...Because an expression of hatred once again rose to Beatrice's face.`
`She had made Kanon submit, even though he hadn't been ensnared until the end.`
` ...Whereas Shannon, who had been so easily ensnared before, refused to submit this time.`
`"......I see.`
` ...So, this state of affairs is amusing after all.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` ...Perhaps I really am still young.`
` This is why I haven't tired of life after one thousand years..."`
`This was most fabulous part of the family conference...`
`Dinner.`
`In the past, when Kinzo had been serious about the conference, he'd taken everyone's yearly gathering for dinner very seriously.`
`Because anything embarrassing that occurred during the dinner would cause the deepest shame for him as the host, `
`he had given Natsuhi stern orders to avoid embarrassments at all costs.`
`Because of that, she and Krauss eventually hired Gohda, who had confidence in his cooking abilities.`
`...Thanks to that, they became able serve wonderful dinners they could be confident in,`
` but by that time, Kinzo had closed himself up in his study and never appeared for dinner.`
` Maybe you could call that ironic...`
`When the main dish for tonight, calf steak, was set out, Gohda began to describe it proudly, further stimulating everyone's appetites.`
`"The sauce here is Bordelaise.`
` Of course, the red wine base I used was excellent even among those made in Bordeaux, but in addition, I prepared an original blend of this house, `
`a blend of choice alcohol from around the world to further deepen the taste.`
` This sauce is limited to this year.`
` I sincerely hope you all enjoy your meal."`
`"...Isn't that wonderful?`
` However, isn't Bordelaise sauce common to French cooking?`
` It almost seems like using alcohol from outside France with that is heresy."`
`"Krauss-sama,`
` today is the annual family conference.`
` As a dinner for those who normally live far away and who have traveled far from across the world to gather together,`
` I realized it would be most fitting to have a sauce made from a blend of fine alcohols from all over the planet that have never met each other before,`
` so I had it specially prepared."`
`"Wonderful!`
` A truly wonderful cook, that's what you are!`
` Food and medicine work twice as well if you sell it right!`
` It's already twice as delicious as normal food, and the advertisin' makes it twice as good as that.`
` The taste keeps doublin' and doublin'!`
` Wahahahahaha!"`
`"*giggle*`
` Come on, Nii-san.`
` That question of yours was obviously a plant."`
`"No doubt about it.`
` You totally set Gohda-san up to steal the show on that one."`
`"You think so?`
` I thought there might be some people here who didn't notice that today's food was in the French style."`
`"......After all, Eva just said that avoiding butter was a virtue, but that's the Spanish style.`
` ...Well, I guess they do share a border, right?"`
`"...That's not what I meant.`
` Will you please not take a part of the conversation out of context and make stuff up?"`
`"...It's a very delicious sauce.`
` Gohda-san, you certainly are amazing."`
`"It is a great honor to receive your praise.`
` And this is all thanks to Madam's habitual guidance."`
`"...No, it was all Gohda's idea.`
` I only listened to the recipe and approved of it."`
`It looked like the siblings quickly got into a loud argument about the sauce,`
` ...but for the most part, dinner proceeded peacefully.`
`...However, a certain question they desperately wanted to ask burned inside each one of them.`
`...It was about that visitor, the 19th person.`
`.........The Golden Witch.`
`In actuality, Eva and Rudolf and the rest were very much on their guards during this meal.`
`If the mystery guest was ever going to be introduced, this dinner table would be the most appropriate place to do it.`
`...However, no place was set at the dinner table for the witch.`
`The family conference would begin in earnest after the meal, and previous experiences told them that it might last until deep into the night.`
`...However, they couldn't imagine why such a person should be kept hidden until that late, if they were going to be introduced in the end anyway.`
`So, Eva and Rudolf and the rest were starting to feel a certain suspicion.`
`...Perhaps this guest was unknown even to Krauss.`
`If this wasn't an assassin called by Krauss to give him an advantage in the inheritance problem,`
` ...then maybe they should speak frankly to Krauss beforehand, creating a common front to resist anything disadvantageous to the four siblings.`
`...If she was Kinzo's assassin, `
`whose purpose was to keep the inheritance from being handed over to the four siblings, `
`the enmity between Krauss and the other siblings could only become a weak point that benefitted the enemy...`
`"Well then, please enjoy at your leisure..."`
`When he finished explaining the reasoning behind the table setting and the cooking, Gohda tried to leave the room, but Kyrie called him to a stop with a small voice.`
`"...Yes, Kyrie-sama.`
` What is it?"`
`"Umm, please excuse me.`
` ...I was under the impression we had company today, ...but can we expect to be joined at the dinner table?"`
`She had planned on saying it nonchalantly, but unfortunately, it reached the ears of Natsuhi, who was sitting in the next seat over.`
`It seemed that Natsuhi had heard it as 'Even though the guests are here, why hasn't the host come to dinner?'`
` ...In other words, that Kyrie had asked whether Kinzo was going to join them for dinner.`
`"The Family Head is not at his best, so he said he would take dinner in his study.`
` ...I believe my husband explained that in the beginning..."`
`".........I'm sorry.`
` That's not what I meant."`
`...Natsuhi's reaction instantly told Kyrie that this unknown visitor was also unknown to Krauss and his wife.`
`......Which meant...`
`...On the chessboard inside Kyrie's mind, she could hear the clattering of the pieces as they rearranged themselves...`
`"What do you mean, we have company?"`
`Battler, who had been sitting next to Natsuhi, seemed to have heard Kyrie's words without misunderstanding them.`
` Thinking it strange that someone else would be invited to today's Family Conference, he spoke up incredulously.`
`And thanks to that, the uncomfortable feeling building in the siblings' chests suddenly exploded...`
`Everyone looked at Gohda at the same time.`
`...Judging by their reactions, it was clear that no one here had invited that mystery woman.`
`For an instant, Gohda was startled to find everyone's gazes gathered on him, but because of his naturally vain personality, this actually gave him a feeling of superiority.`
`Therefore, he answered in an extremely calm and graceful manner.`
`"...That is correct.`
` Our guest wanted to eat alone in the VIP room and is being served there."`
`That extremely graceful and reasonable response of Gohda's made it obvious to everyone that a 19th person, a visitor, existed...`
`"The VIP room? A guest?`
` ...What...who are you talking about?"`
`Natsuhi's words echoed the question that everyone who didn't know about the appearance of the Golden Witch was thinking.`
`For a while, Gohda was disoriented, caught completely off guard by this sudden interrogation.`
`...This was a guest who had been treated with such deep respect.`
`He hadn't imagined that Krauss and his wife might not even know about her.`
`"The guest is...umm...Beatrice-sama."`
`"Beatrice!!`
` See, see!`
` Beatrice came, uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`Maria had been telling the other cousins over and over again that she had met Beatrice that day.`
`...The cousins had answered flippantly, but they hadn't believed.`
`So...their eyes grew wide.`
`"S-Sorry.`
` I totally thought you were joking, Maria...`
` S-So, she really was there..."`
`"......By Beatrice, ...you mean that Beatrice with the gold...?!"`
`"Uu-!!`
` I've been saying she 'exists' the whole time!`
` No one believes!!"`
`"Sorry, Maria-chan...`
` That's not how we meant it..."`
`After learning that everyone had doubted Beatrice's existence, Maria, who had been in a good mood all day, completely lost her temper.`
`...George, who sat in the next seat over, tried frantically to calm Maria.`
`"...Gohda,`
` is this some sort of dinner entertainment?`
` Heheheh, quite a performance."`
`"......Aniki,`
` quit playing dumb.`
` ...You called her here, right?"`
`"Called?`
` Called whom?`
` ...From where?!"`
`"Nii-san,`
` let's be clear about this.`
` ......Who is she?`
` Surely you aren't going to tell us it really is the Beatrice from that portrait, right?"`
`"I don't have a clue what you people are talking about!`
` Gohda, you really aren't joking, right?!"`
`"I-I, umm......`
` I was just ordered by Genji-san, umm...!"`
`"Call for Genji.`
` Immediately!!"`
`When Natsuhi yelled, Gohda sped out into the hallway.`
`The sound of the door being thrown open was the spark that suddenly set the dinner table ablaze.`
`"So, you're saying you're in the dark too, Aniki?`
` Who called her?`
` Was it Dad?!"`
`"...I don't know anything about this.`
` It seems you people think I've been pulling the strings behind the scenes, but that's a huge misunderstanding."`
`"Calm down, Krauss nii-san.`
` We've gone past the stage of skirmishing with each other.`
` If you're sayin' even you don't know this mystery person, then somethin' crazy's goin' on...!"`
`"Hideyoshi-san, can't you be a little more discreet with your words?`
` My husband would not invite unnecessary people to the family conference."`
`"Obviously.`
` What are you people talking about?`
` Are you saying the witch of the portrait has broken out of her frame and appeared?!`
` ...It's not as though anyone's actually met this witch face to face."`
`"I...met her...!"`
`Eva and Rudolf nodded at Rosa's proclamation.`
`"Uu-!`
` I met her too!!`
` Uncle Krauss, believe it!`
` Believe Mama!`
` Uu-uu-!"`
`The brief tension was broken, and Maria also started to make a ruckus.`
`...By now, the room was thoroughly wrapped in chaos.`
`"I don't have a clue what's going on...`
` So what does it mean?`
` Does it mean the witch who gave Grandfather the gold is showing up as a special guest this year...?!"`
`"But...is that really true...?`
` Aunt Rosa didn't see it wrong, did she...?"`
`"I met her too!!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"Aunt Rosa, ...are you...sure?"`
`"......Yes.`
` ......Maria and I met her, ...and we even talked to her."`
`"...I met her!!`
` That was definitely a witch...!`
` Believe me!!`
` I definitely didn't see it wrong or hallucinate or anything!`
` What on Earth......was that?!"`
`...In the instant before the typhoon arrived...`
`...Rosa definitely met a witch in the rose garden.`
`But the scene had been so hard to accept as truth.........`
`that the more she spoke of it like this, the less she understood what it was she had encountered.`
`Ironically, since she was losing her composure,`
` the more frantically she tried to cling to her claim, the more confused and hazy the thing she was describing became.`
`Because of that, it only took a single, calmly-spoken sentence to confirm the nature of what she was describing beyond doubt.`
`"......I also met with her.`
` I greeted...well, I couldn't really call it that. I exchanged a few words with her.`
` ......It's definitely not something that Rosa-san just saw wrong."`
`"Kyrie-san, are you serious...?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......But she didn't tell me her name.`
` So I can't say for certain that she was Beatrice."`
`"...However, and sorry if this is subjective, `
`......but since I met her in the entrance hall, I was able to compare her face with the portrait.`
` ...My first impression was that...this portrait has to be hers.`
` ...This is all just subjective."`
`"That isn't possible!`
` In the first place, where did that woman come from?`
` The only boat arriving today was the one that brought all of you here.`
` Was she on that boat?!"`
`".........`
`Well, it's hard to say for sure.`
` Of course, I don't remember any woman like that getting off the boat with us."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"Oh, is that all?`
` Can you prove there wasn't a boat besides the one we rode on?`
` You can't!`
` You can't prove one '`
`~ib~didn't arrive~ib~`
`'!"`
`"Makes sense.`
` ...If another boat did arrive, it might be possible to prove it.`
` If someone saw it and said they saw it, then you're done.`
` But it's impossible to prove that such a boat 'didn't arrive'.`
` Even if everyone says that no such boat arrived--that they didn't see it arrive--you can't prove that it didn't 'arrive secretly'.`
` It's that thing they call a '#fefefeDevil's Proof#ffffff'."`
`It'd be simple to prove that devils 'exist'.`
` All you have to do is meet a devil.`
`But it's impossible to prove that devils 'don't exist'.`
`Just by saying that no one has ever met a devil, you can't deny the possibility that they're hiding away somewhere humans can't go.`
`...You can't deny the existence of aliens for exactly the same reason.`
`Until humanity searches the whole of space and can show perfectly that aliens don't exist, you can't be sure that they don't exist.`
`And it's definitely impossible for us to ever check the entirety of space for the existence of aliens.`
`...Therefore, while there may be a number of ways to prove that aliens do exist, it will always be impossible to show proof that denies their existence.`
`"...So, any discussion about there being a second boat would just be a waste of our time.`
` ...She wasn't on the boat with us.`
` That much is a fact, so she must've arrived on this island through some other means."`
`"That's right.`
` There may be no need to discuss how she came here.`
` What's important is that she's actually in this mansion now and doesn't feel like having dinner with us."`
`"Okay, let's review.`
` ...Right now, there's another guest on this island, other than the 18 people with the Ushiromiya family.`
` And this is a guest even Aniki and Natsuhi-san don't know about, right?"`
`"I know nothing...!`
` I don't know what you're talking about...!"`
`"Be silent for now.`
` Your headache will get worse.`
` ...It is as my wife says.`
` I have no idea what you people have been talking about up until now."`
`"Then there can be only one answer.`
` ......Father called her here.`
` Called her here for today's family conference!"`
`"For the family conference?!`
` Again, why?!"`
`"I don't know that!`
` I'm questioning you because I thought you might know!"`
`"Eva, could you give it a rest?!`
` Krauss nii-san said he doesn't know!`
` ...So here's what we've got.`
` Father stealthily invited the witch of the portrait as a secret guest.`
` And she met with Rosa-san and Maria-chan, and then Kyrie-san."`
`"...That's all for now!`
` If she has somethin' to say to us, she could just show herself right away!`
` Now we've gotta wonder why she's shut herself up without greetin' us."`
`"Does this mean Dad, who never gave a crap about this family conference in the first place, secretly called a new mistress here?`
` And had her wear the clothes of his ideal witch?`
` .........This day's too important for that explanation to fly."`
`"There can be only one reason.`
` To join in on the family conference.`
` ...She wants to claim some right to Father's inheritance!"`
`"Ridiculous!!`
` The Family Head wouldn't have something as filthy as a mistress!"`
`"I told you to be quiet!`
` I've lived in this mansion with Father all this time, and I've never heard a thing about something like that.`
` ......If we stretch plausibility to the limit `
`and assume Father had an illegitimate child with some mistress decades ago, `
`...then maybe Father searched her out and called her here today.`
` ...Is that what you're trying to say?"`
`"Dear!`
` It's absurd to think Father has such a child!`
` To waste the noble blood of the Ushiromiya family on a mistress...!`
` This is nothing more than a few people making wild claims!`
` It's obviously a fantasy, a delusion, a daydream!`
` Or is everyone taking part in some kind of act to trick my husband?!"`
`"What act?!!`
` If anyone's acting, it's you!!"`
`"Quit it Aneki.`
` ...Natsuhi-san may be a bit over-vehement, but she's right.`
` Kyrie saw her, I didn't.`
` Neither did you, Aneki.`
` But Rosa did."`
`"...But that means she 'exists'.`
` There are people who can prove she 'exists', so we're sure right away that she does.`
` It's the opposite of a Devil's Proof."`
`"......And I want to meet her too.`
` I wanna ask her directly what kind of business she has with the Ushiromiya family."`
`"I agree with you on that.`
` I do indeed wish to enquire as to what business she has on Rokkenjima."`
`"Don't play dumb!`
` There's only one thing she could be after.`
` Father's inheritance!`
` We should work out our future plans with a lawyer who's hot on inheritance issues.`
` If the mistress claims equal rights as Mother, then our shares will be cut right in half!"`
`"......W-Wait a second, everybody!`
` Genji-san will come very soon.`
` He knows everything.`
` I'm sure he'll answer our questions!`
` Until then, let's stop talking about this!!"`
`"Hey, you, kids!`
` Sorry, but the adults have to start talking about something complicated!`
` Return to the guesthouse!!"`
`Rosa yelled at the children, slightly overcome with emotion.`
`The children didn't understand why they were suddenly being yelled at this time, but Eva and the rest realized it too late.`
`They were talking so bluntly about the filthy topic of the inheritance right in front of the children.`
`...Of course they'd wouldn't want their children to remain.`
`So they all immediately agreed with Rosa's plan.`
`"Th-That's right, just as Rosa-san says!`
` George!`
` Take all the cousins and go back to the guesthouse!`
` You all play nice together!"`
`"George, do as you're told.`
` Take all of the cousins, and leave right now!"`
`"W-Wait a second, Mother...!`
` We still haven't finished eating...!"`
`"Uu-!`
` And dessert hasn't even come yet!!`
` Uuu--!!"`
`"We will have Gohda-san take dessert to the guesthouse!`
` So leave!!"`
`"Jessica,`
` from here on, the adults will be talking together.`
` Go."`
`"......S-Sure.`
` ......Even though I'm still eating..."`
`"...Well, guess I won't be the only exception."`
`"Thanks for understanding, Battler-kun.`
` ...But you sure are lucky."`
`"Huh?`
` Why?"`
`"I'd want to leave if I could."`
`"...Ihihihi!`
` I bet.`
` I'll let you adults enjoy your happy family chat about the inheritance."`
`"......I will also leave my seat.`
` At any rate, it appears my turn will not come tonight."`
`Nanjo quietly rose to his feet.`
`...From his seat in the farthest corner, he had been calmly watching the whole discussion without butting in.`
`...Surely, that reaction of his was very adult, just what you'd expect of a calm, old gentleman.`
`When Nanjo rose from his seat, it ended up encouraging the others who were supposed to leave.`
`The children noisily rose from their seats, and as they hurried into the hallway, the servants returned.`
`"I apologize for taking so long...`
` I have called Genji..."`
`"......I was checking to see that all of the doors and windows were shut, so it took me some time.`
` My apologies."`
`"Come on! Children, to the guesthouse!`
` Gohda-san, my apologies, but could you carry the children's portion of the dessert to the guesthouse?"`
`"Hah...`
` ...Is that what you wish...?"`
`It seemed Gohda wasn't amused to see the dinner he'd worked so hard on interrupted like this.`
`...He sent Natsuhi a look as though asking her whether that was really okay.`
`"Do as Rosa-san says.`
` And, it will not be necessary to set out dessert for us.`
` Do not approach the dining hall until we call for you.`
` Tell the rest of the servants to do the same.`
` Understood?"`
`"Y-Yes.`
` As you wish..."`
`"Come, everyone.`
` Shall we go?`
` Maria-san, you mustn't trouble your Mother any more."`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` I wanna talk about Beato too!!`
` No no no, uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"Maria-chan,`
` could you tell us about Beatrice in the guesthouse?`
` ...I really want to hear about the witch.`
` Okay?"`
`"Uu-?`
` Uu-!"`
`"...You're pretty darn smooth, George nii-san.`
` I'm impressed."`
`"Are you sure you don't have kids?`
` You're too used to this, ihihi!"`
`George's words had completely restored Maria's good mood, and now she took the initiative, telling the others to head on to the guesthouse.`
`It looked like Gohda didn't like being kicked out himself, but he couldn't disobey Natsuhi, so he left the room with Battler and the rest, closing the door...`
`"...Is there some way I might be of service, everyone?"`
`"Yeah, there sure is.`
` We've got a whole bunch of questions.`
` In fact, every one of us does.`
` So much that we almost want to have a lottery to see who gets to ask first."`
`"But no matter who wins the first lottery, the first question will be the same, won't it?"`
`"That's right.`
` ......Genji-san,`
` answer me honestly.`
` ...Who is...this person called Beatrice in the VIP room right now?"`
`...Hideyoshi's claim that advertising doubled the taste was apparently right.`
`After being chased out to the guesthouse, the kids and Nanjo had gathered in the cousins' room and were eating the cake that Kumasawa had brought for dessert.`
`It was both wonderful and high-class, topped with lavish amounts of cream and decorated deliciously with fruits, `
`but delicious as it was, it didn't taste quite as good for some reason...`
`"Haha, without Gohda-san selling it, it isn't nearly as good."`
`"And if we asked Kumasawa-san to sell it, she'd just say it's made of mackerel."`
`"Uu-?!`
` Really?!`
` You can make cake from mackerel?!"`
`"Hohohohoh.`
` Absolutely, and as you can see with this very cake, if you mix the squeezed juice of mackerel with flour and eggs before cooking, it comes out all fluffy.`
` Hohohohoh."`
`"That'd be incredible if true.`
` Maybe mackerel cake will show up on the new menu at one of Father's restaurants."`
`"Wahahaha!`
` After all, mackerel's full of nutrients and sounds healthy.`
` It might get really popular with women and the elderly!`
` But I'm not gonna get anywhere near it!"`
`"Girls won't eat something that weird."`
`"Even the elderly would wish to decline."`
`"Hohohohoh!`
` But it's delicious, you know?"`
`Kumasawa was really cheering up the mood with her classic mackerel jokes.`
`...But the sound of the downpouring rain kept turning their attention towards the mystery guest.`
`In the end, they showered Maria with questions again, since she was the only person here to have met Beatrice.`
`"......I can't believe...she was actually telling the truth."`
`"You make it sound like, though you never believed it, this 'Maria meets a witch' business isn't news to you."`
`"...Yeah.`
` I thought it was just one of those fairy tales you'd expect from a dreamy kid that age."`
`"She exists!!`
` Beatrice 'exists'!`
` Every year, when we come to the family conference, I meet her and we play together!"`
`"That's right.`
` Although Beatrice-sama doesn't usually show herself, `
`I hear she sometimes unexpectedly appears before honest people with clean hearts.`
` Hohohoh."`
`'Beatrice' referred to that character in the fairy tale about the Rokkenjima witch.`
`To keep Kinzo in a good mood, the family and servants acted as though they believed in the witch of his delusions.`
` That's how Rokkenjima's fairy tale...or maybe ghost story...had come into being...`
`To the family members who knew that backstory, the fairy tale of the Golden Witch wasn't something to be taken too seriously.`
`...However, they were never able to say that out loud in front of Kinzo.`
`Because of that, the Legend of the Witch carried a lot more weight to someone like young Maria, `
`...who didn't know the story of how it had come into being.`
`That's why Maria believed in the Legend of the Witch.`
`She accepted it entirely.`
`...That was only natural for an imaginative girl who believed in witches.`
`So people had avoided saying things that would betray her dream.`
`...On the contrary, they had worked together to say and do things that would help liven up her dreams without her knowing.`
`"...So when Maria-chan was showing us that candy that supposedly came from Beatrice,`
` ...I figured someone subtly slipped it into her handbag."`
`"...I have done similar things a few times in the past, `
`secretly placing sweets somewhere.`
` ...I imagine even Kumasawa-san...or rather, all of the servants and everyone in the Ushiromiya family has done it once or twice."`
`"...So, if it'll make a small, innocent kid happy, you might place a sweet somewhere and have everyone join in on keeping the secret alive for her.`
` ...Come to think of it, I'll bet you do that kind of thing all the time, George-aniki."`
`"......Who knows."`
`It'd probably be boorish to admit to such a thing out loud.`
`George admitted it while being extremely wary that Maria didn't find out.`
`"In other words, ...it's kinda like Santa Claus.`
` To protect a kid's dreams, the parents plot together and lie, setting presents at the bedside of a child fast asleep."`
`"......After all, you wanna protect a kid's dreams, right?`
` ...Obviously, I've known Santa doesn't exist for a long time now,`
` ...but if there's no reason to wake up from a dream like that, I wish I could've believed it all my life."`
`"...Because adults know that the world is filled with terrible things,`
` ...they all want to at least protect the pure dreams of a child.`
`"Uu-!!`
` Beatrice exists!`
` 'Exiiiists'!!!"`
`"Yes, she does.`
` Beatrice-sama does exist, right?`
` Some time ago, when I was drying mackerel to make some black tea, suddenly..."`
`"......Well, it basically goes something like that.`
` ...Supposedly, at least."`
`"So, simply put, `
`...this was supposed to be a witch that no one but Maria believed in."`
`"I wouldn't phrase it quite like that.`
` ...The point isn't that we didn't believe.`
` We were all trying to give her a chance to believe."`
`So, this is about not betraying a child's innocence.`
`But Santa doesn't exist in reality.`
`If you don't want kids to be all disappointed when they learn the truth, you'd be better off not showing them that dream in the first place.`
`...Is the fact that I think like this proof that I'm still a long way from becoming a full adult?`
`The true nature of the Rokkenjima witch was finally starting taking shape in Battler's mind.`
`...However, their current situation overrode this understanding,`
` and in fact, it completely overturned its very premise...`
`"...So, we thought we knew what was going on, but now Beatrice-sama the witch has actually appeared in reality.`
` Is that it?"`
`"And, judging by how freaked our parents were, it looks like she wasn't an invited guest.`
` ...Now it's starting to get interesting."`
`"There's no reason for us to simply assume that a woman called Beatrice doesn't exist.`
` ...It's what Uncle Rudolf called a Devil's Proof.`
` ......None of us knew that a woman calling herself Beatrice existed."`
`"...But that's not the same as proving that Beatrice doesn't exist."`
`"...Doctor Nanjo, you've been friends with Grandfather for a long time, right?"`
`"............`
`...At one point during the family conference, I was questioned quite thoroughly by Krauss-san and the others.`
` ...They wanted to know if, long ago, Kinzo-san might have had a mistress called Beatrice and an illegitimate child with her."`
`"I get it.`
` Our parents have their heads full with the inheritance problem.`
` So of course, if the daughter of a mistress like that showed up, it'd be troublesome for them."`
`"Krauss-san and the rest probably asked Genji-san about it first.`
` However, Genji-san is an aide who's sworn loyalty to Kinzo-san...and is probably a friend more trusted by Kinzo-san than myself.`
` ...I doubt he told them anything.`
` ...So next, they went to ask me, as an old friend of his..."`
`"And?`
` ...Did Grandfather have a lover called Beatrice, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"......He did.`
` ...No, I have never met her.`
` ...However, I have heard from Kinzo-san that he had a relationship with a woman like that.`
` ......He said she passed away a very long time ago."`
`"...She's dead.`
` ...So, did the two of them have a kid?"`
`"That, I do not know.`
` ...But Kinzo-san always says that reviving Beatrice is the goal of his research.`
` ...Usually, if one loses a mistress but has a child left behind to remember them by, they pour all of their love onto that child.`
` ...Therefore, we naturally assumed that there was no such child between Kinzo-san and Beatrice..."`
`".........Hmm?`
` ...So, that leaves us with another Devil's Proof."`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...It's impossible to prove that a child between him and a mistress 'didn't exist'.`
` ...So, now that this child has actually appeared, we have to assume she 'did exist' after all."`
`"That's a bit of a rushed argument.`
` ...It's more realistic that someone caught wind of the trouble with the Ushiromiya family inheritance,`
` knew about Grandfather's relationship with a mistress long ago, `
`and impersonated her, trying to take a slice of the inheritance for themselves."`
`"...Sure, that is realistic.`
` ...But we can't deny the possibility that she really is an illegitimate child, `
`one who lived in isolation, forgotten by Grandfather, and who's returned for revenge, right...?"`
`"Revenge?!`
` What do you mean?!"`
`"Aaah, sorry, sorry...`
` Guys just like to dramatize stuff to make it sound interesting.`
` I've seen too many weird dramas.`
` Ihihihi!"`
`Normally, that might have come off as a light joke.`
`...But the joke had landed after an uninvited mystery guest calling herself Beatrice...`
`had marched in on the day of the family conference, where the bloody argument that the inheritance had become took center stage.`
`......There was no way Battler's joke would be welcomed with laughter.`
`So, it was a really big help when Nanjo laughed brightly to calm everyone down.`
`"Hahahaha...`
` I see, I see, that does sound quite intriguing.`
` I would love to read a novel with a plot like that."`
`"Well, I don't think it could actually work.`
` ...After all, right now, on this island, there's one, two, three...a full 18 people, right?`
` If anyone tries to do something weird, they'll immediately get caught.`
` And thanks to the typhoon, they can't even leave the island.`
` In other words, if you tried to commit some crazy crime, you'd be screwed."`
`"...I agree.`
` In a dead end, without any way to escape, and in a situation where everyone's really suspicious of her, `
`I seriously doubt she could pull off a terrifying revenge drama like that."`
`"Probably not.`
` ...In that case, it would be more realistic if she had come in secret, without making her presence known.`
` I simply cannot imagine someone appearing openly to take revenge outside of some historical drama."`
`"Well, who knows, right?`
` Revenge is based on emotion, not logic.`
` If you've got someone willing to go down along with their opponent, they might not be afraid of anything, not even the police or large numbers of people."`
`"It's okay, Jessica-chan.`
` None of the disturbing things we're imagining will happen."`
`"Ihihi!`
` Like the battle royale between our parents over the inheritance isn't disturbing."`
`"...That's right.`
` ...Dad and Uncle Rudolf are pretty tough, and Aunt Eva's even trained in the martial arts.`
` ...We'll be fine.`
` Yeah..."`
`Jessica didn't say it out loud, but she'd vaguely noticed that her own father stood in opposition to all the other siblings on the inheritance issue.`
`They usually played nice in front of the children, but when that pretense was lifted away, like it had been at dinner, the result would be a tumultuous uproar.`
`After realizing this, it was only natural for Jessica to be frightened at the thought...`
`that her parents might get caught up in some kind of trouble...`
`and become human sacrifices for something terrifying...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"Seriously.`
` George-aniki's right.`
` ...Nothing's gonna happen.`
` Even if she pretends she's a witch, `
`what can a single ~ib~human woman~ib~ who can't even use magic do?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`The sudden, creepy laugh made all of them jump.`
`...And when they realized the strange laugh was coming from Maria, they were shocked again.`
`"......I see.`
` ...So that's how you see it, Battler."`
`"...Wh-What is?`
` Don't laugh all creepy like that."`
`"You accept Beatrice's existence for now.`
` At least you accept her as the 19th person and a guest.`
` ...`
`......But that's all, right?`
` ...You don't accept that the 19th person, Beatrice, is a witch, right...?"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"Huh, of all the crazy things to say...`
` ...Of course that's what I think.`
` ~ib~Witches couldn't possibly exist~ib~.`
` The only possibility is that she's a human woman claiming to be a witch."`
`"...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` Hmmm...?`
` Isn't that odd, Battler?`
` ...That's a Devil's Proof, isn't it?`
` ...Of course witches don't exist?`
` But just because you've never met a witch, `
`that doesn't mean you've proven that witches don't exist, right...?"`
`".........`
`......That's right.`
` ...You're not wrong there.`
` I can't prove that witches don't exist.`
` ......However, even if I can't prove it, I can claim it.`
` I claim that witches don't exist."`
`"Why...?`
` How can you claim that witches don't exist, even though you can't prove it...?"`
`"Because things like that don't exist."`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!`
` So, that's QED?`
` You've finished your proof, without any evidence or basis?`
` Now there's a typical case of the ignorant willfully ignoring the shallowness of their own knowledge.`
` A reckless suspension of thought.`
` Kihihihihihihihi...!"`
`"Then there's only one way to resolve this, Maria.`
` ......The witch's side needs to show some proof themselves.`
` It's a Devil's Proof again.`
` ...If you bring me a devil, we can end this right now."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"...In this case, we can just get this woman calling herself Beatrice `
`to display some wonderful, magnificent magic like the twinkling stars.`
`~ib~ All she has to do is show us something `
`that's impossible for Humans~ib~`
`, right?"`
`"...Come now, you two.`
` Please settle down..."`
`Kumasawa noticed that the atmosphere between them was getting worse and tried to calm them.`
`...It seemed as though Battler quickly realized that he wasn't acting like an adult.`
`But Maria's expression didn't loosen.`
`...As she laughed creepily, she kept staring at Battler...`
`"You quit it too, Maria.`
` ...Let's get back in a good mood, okay?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihi, kihihihihihihihihihihihihi."`
`"............"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"...If that's what you want, Beatrice will definitely show you.`
` ~ib~Something impossible for Humans~ib~`
`.`
` When she does, you'll believe too, okay?`
` You'll believe in Beatrice."`
`".........Sure.`
` ...If she lets me have a look, I'll believe."`
`"It's a chess debate between the witch and you, Battler.`
` ......If you get checkmated, you'll believe in the witch."`
`"Ooh, I like the way you put that.`
` ...The witch shows her magic.`
` My king is put into check.`
` I quibble, saying it'd be possible to reproduce her feat using measures even a human could take, and my king escapes.`
` ...Failing to do that would be checkmate, so that's a pretty good analogy."`
`"Battler,`
` ...in chess, you and your opponent have pieces that move in the same way.`
` So you can predict your opponent's moves.`
` ......But you know what?`
` What you aren't expecting...is that your opponent's pieces might be able to move in ways far stranger than yours.`
` You've simply assumed that, since witches must not exist, the movements of Beatrice's pieces will obviously be the same as your own."`
`".................."`
`"...But you know what?`
` ......Sorry, Battler, but your chess partner isn't Human.`
` She's a witch.`
` ...She can move her pieces in ways that Humans can't.`
` ......Right now, your understanding is flawed.`
` ...Battler, you like Aunt Kyrie's chessboard thinking, right?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` I like that style of thinking, where you stand in your opponent's shoes."`
`"And that's why you'll get stuck.`
` Even though your opponent is a witch, you won't accept it.`
` ......So you can't understand the moves a witch might make, and your chessboard thinking won't work.`
` Your knowledge of your opponent is mistaken.`
` The very first premise of chessboard thinking is broken down."`
`"............Ah,`
` ...so that's your game."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"`
`~ib~You cannot win in chess against a witch~ib~`
`...!`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!"`
`"...I don't know what happened after that.`
` We servants were strictly ordered not to approach the dining room..."`
`"......I see.`
` So, Shannon, have you ever met this person called Beatrice before?"`
`"............`
`...I don't know."`
`That was a slightly odd way to say it.`
`It didn't quite sound as if she was saying her memory was hazy.`
`"...For us servants, Beatrice-sama is a second master of this mansion.`
` ...Some people say we've spread that rumor because of the Master's influence, `
`...but even when I'd just started working here, the story of Beatrice-sama was already being whispered of."`
`"I've heard about it before.`
` ...If you don't show her respect, you'll get cursed, and at least one servant actually did meet with an accident, right?"`
`"Yes, `
`.........but it's true that some people believed more than others.`
` ...I, umm, ...believe respect for that sort of thing shouldn't be forgotten, so I have never doubted that she exists.`
` ......I vaguely believed that a...`
`umm...shadowy being called the Golden Witch existed."`
`"...And then that witch, whose existence was so shadowy and obscure, actually showed herself and entered openly through the entrance hall...`
` Is that what happened?"`
`"......I don't know.`
` .........I don't know...anything."`
`".........`
`...When you brought her dinner, did you talk about anything?"`
`"...............`
`...No, nothing."`
`"I see.`
` ...Still, a witch that eats food somehow doesn't sound so realistic.`
` Maybe, after all, it's just someone who knows about the witch legend on this island, someone who's taking on Beatrice's name."`
`"......I think you've probably come to respect Beatrice and think of her as something like a guardian god of the mansion.`
` So when a person appeared actually going by that name, maybe you were a little disturbed."`
`".........`
`......That's right.`
` I guess that must be the case."`
`George was slightly at a loss at what to do about Shannon's downcast appearance.`
`...Maybe not just Genji, but even the young servants had been ruthlessly questioned as to whether they knew anything about this Beatrice person...`
`Thinking that, he tried to cheer her up somehow.`
`Surely, just like Maria and Jessica, `
`Shannon was unable to fully hide the agitation caused by the sudden visit of this person calling herself the Golden Witch.`
`He'd been so sure that was the case.`
`...But George probably had no way of looking into Shannon's heart.`
`Shannon was bitter and sad.`
`...The door to the Golden Land...would be opened.`
`...The witch had definitely told her that.`
`That meant...the demise of everything.`
`'!s0`
`......they would never be married now.`
`No, in the first place...`
`...Did furniture like her...even have the right to be married?`
`Even if the witch hadn't come to signal their demise, ...wasn't their relationship fated to fail sooner or later?`
`Had she turned her gaze to focus solely on those fun days spent with George, ...while purposefully closing her eyes to the sad reality?`
`".........What's wrong?`
` ...You really haven't looked well for a while now."`
`"George-san,`
` ......what does it mean...to be engaged?"`
`"Huh?!`
` Ah, ...err!`
` It means making a promise to marry.`
` ...But I think in that sense, it means the same thing as marriage.`
` ......To be honest, I want to take you home as my wife right away.`
` ...But right now, I'm in the middle of training, and I'm still a long way from having the capacity to create my own castle.`
` That's why I want to take you home with me with my head held high, only after I've become a full adult."`
`"I'm not talking about the distant future.`
` I just want you to wait a short three years.`
` ...But that doesn't mean I want to lie about my feelings for another three years."`
`"So, ...I decided to give you an engagement ring.`
` ...That might be a shameful reason as a man.`
` Maybe it's shameful to get engaged because I want you to wait, since I can't support my work and a wife at the same time yet.`
` ...But I will definitely-"`
`"......Thank you very much.`
` ...I understand that to you, George-san, an engagement ring means something different than one of many presents you'd give to a lover."`
`"O-Of course it's different.`
` An engagement ring isn't a simple accessory.`
` It's an oath between lovers, a noble promise left in the form of a ring."`
`"......*giggle*`
` ...So, if we were to get married right away, it'd be completely meaningless, right?"`
`"Th-Then it wouldn't be an engagement ring.`
` I'd give it to you as a wedding ring.`
` ...Either way, I'd still be giving you a ring."`
`"So it's a 'Sold' sign, like saying 'This woman is mine, nobody touch her'."`
`"Nn......no, umm, ......that's not what I......`
`......*cough*."`
`George knew that he was weak by nature.`
`When he'd been captivated by Shannon and had sworn to become an excellent man, he had also sworn to throw away that weak part of himself.`
`...So, even if he had to be blunt about it, he chose to answer a little roughly.`
`...He was sure that doing so would bolster and reassure Shannon.`
`".........No, ...that may be true.`
` .........Sayo, `
`I'll make you my wife.`
` ...I won't give you to anyone else.`
` I'll make you mine alone.`
` ...So no one will lay a hand on you.`
` ...That's what this ring is.`
` ...Without a doubt."`
`"Thank you very much, George-san.`
` .........I'm truly...happy."`
`Then, George-san.`
`...If it was decided by fate that this engagement ring...that this promise could never be fulfilled, ...would you still give it to me...?`
`...Shannon tried to ask that, ...but she swallowed her words.`
`Because George had already spoken the answer.`
`...George had said it.`
`He had said that to him, an engagement ring was infinitely similar to a wedding ring.`
`Therefore, accepting George's ring had a significance far more sacred than a promise to marry.`
`"So,`
` ...I'll stop calling this an engagement ring.`
` From now on, this isn't an engagement.`
` It's a wedding ring."`
`"I-Is that really okay...?`
` Is it okay to...umm, just proclaim that we're married without even God's blessing...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` It's enough to tell God, Father, and Mother about it afterwards.`
` We'll tell them all that we've been married.`
` .........No one will be able to undo it."`
`"......George-san..."`
`"I'm not saying this because of a momentary emotion.`
` I'm not just looking at how you are now.`
` ......I'm looking at the you of tomorrow, of the next day.`
` ...I'm even gazing at you as you'll be in old age, in the future, as I say this."`
`"...You're always talking about that, George-san.`
` ...About how you want to enjoy your old age slowly, surrounded by healthy children and grandchildren."`
`"Yeah.`
` At that time, an older you will be beside me.`
` That is what I expect...no, what I foresee.`
` ...Yes.`
` Because that day will surely come."`
`"...............Will it...`
`surely come?`
` ..............."`
`"Yes.`
` Surely.`
` Definitely.`
` ...And this ring proves it without words."`
`"............Please, `
`......show me."`
`"Huh?`
`'!s1`
`ah, `
`ah, `
`......h-h-here it is...!"`
`George, thinking he was being told to show her the ring, hurriedly took out the ring box.`
`...Even though he had practiced so much, he hadn't been able to do it cool.`
`But Shannon wasn't looking at that.`
`......In her straight and direct gaze were vague tears and a smile.`
`.........She focused her eyes on George's eyes...no, on something she could see beyond his eyes...`
`'!s1`
`......show me...`
`......that future."`
`"......Y-Yeah.`
` ...I'll show you.`
` Surely.`
` ...I promise it.`
` ......And not just until old age.`
` ...After we die too.`
` ...Even when we become spirits, we'll always, always be together."`
`Shannon wiped away her tears and took the ring box.`
`Inside was a diamond ring worthy of blessing the two of them.`
`George said the line that he'd practiced over and over again inside his head.`
`"...I-I want you to put this ring on...whatever finger you like...and have that be your answer.`
` Umm, so, by tomorrow morning..."`
`"...*giggle*."`
`Shannon smiled, took the ring, `
`...and with a completely natural movement, put it on the ring finger of her left hand.`
`It really had looked...like such a natural, ordinary movement,`
` and for a while, George was stunned...`
`"This...is my answer,`
` George-san."`
`"Shannon...`
`no, `
`......Sayo........."`
`'!s1`
`......we'll always...`
`......always...`
`be together,`
` ......George-san."`
`There was no blessing from God, no pastor to witness, nothing.`
`But the two who were married...proclaimed it.`
`...Two souls were joined here today......`
`".........Nee-san, .........you're a fool."`
`"...Is that so?"`
`"Even though you're furniture...`
` ...Even though...you're furniture...!"`
`"I'm not furniture.`
` Not anymore."`
`"...Liar!!`
` Why are you fooling yourself?!`
` Even though you know you can never become human!`
` Even though you know you can't become human unless you go to the Golden Land!!`
` ...Knowing that, why did you abandon the promise that would let you go there...?!!"`
`"Oh, right.`
` By accepting the ring, ...that promise with Beatrice-sama comes to nothing, doesn't it?`
` ...*giggle* I'm sorry."`
`"......From now on, I, you, George-sama, the Master, and everyone else...are under the same conditions.`
` 13 people will be sacrificed.`
` Only five people will be invited to the Golden Land.`
` ...And you...`
`...rejected one of those places yourself..."`
`"That's odd.`
` ...It looks like you're the one with regrets, Kanon-kun."`
`"You're the one with regrets, aren't you, Nee-san?!`
` You got engaged, right?!`
` Even though you knew it was a fate that would never be fulfilled!!"`
`"Yes.`
` I promised that we would always, always be together, for eternity.`
` ...So you know what?`
` ...In that instant, our eternity was completed.`
` Even if we become sacrifices, it's already completed.`
` So, it's okay."`
`"......Kanon, you're the one who actually has regrets.`
` ...We're furniture, right?`
` We'll be freed no matter the result.`
` ...So, it doesn't matter whether we go to Golden Land or not.`
` ...And yet you're set on going there.`
` ......You want to become human no matter what, right?`
` ...Why?"`
`"Because I want to become human!!`
` I've had enough of being furniture!!"`
`"Why?"`
`"I...wanted to fall in love too...!!!"`
`Tears were coming from Kanon's eyes.`
`...And he howled.`
`"...I...liked Milady...!!`
` And after seeing Milady that day, I started liking her even more...!`
` And when I heard that Milady also liked me, I was really happy...!!`
` But I'm furniture, ...and I can't accept Milady's feelings!!"`
`"...You're wrong.`
` ......We may be furniture.`
` We may be less than human.`
` ...But that doesn't mean that we aren't qualified to love."`
`"I thought that...if these feelings wouldn't ever come to anything, I'd be better off not having them!!`
` I just decided that eventually, I'd disappear, and that it'd definitely hurt her. ......No, that's wrong!!`
` I was just frightened!!`
` I...was just afraid, thinking that any love that couldn't be eternal was best avoided!!"`
`"...Even though their lives last only a few weeks, cicadas fall in love and then vanish.`
` ......But you'll never find a cicada that refused to fall in love simply because it'd end in a few weeks."`
`"Aaaaaaaaaaaaagggghhh!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggghhh!!"`
`It seemed that Kanon was still muttering his regrets, but by now, it was all jumbled up with his sobs...`
`"...That witch is detestable...!!`
` ...Why did she plant these feelings in me...?!`
` If only...if only she hadn't pulled that bizarre prank, I wouldn't have paid Milady any notice...!!!"`
`".........Beatrice-sama is detestable.`
` ...To make you cry bitter tears, she played games with your fate.`
` ......But I don't think things went as the witch expected.`
` ...After all-"`
`Knowing love isn't a regret that ties you to life.`
`It is the destination we're supposed to reach in our journey through life...`
`Well now, Kanon.`
`That promise you worked so hard for has now come to nothing.`
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
`Very well then.`
`With this, the conditions for all of the pieces are the same.`
`There are 18 pieces!`
` 13 will be offered as sacrifices!`
`Who will the five survivors be?`
`......Or else...`
`Will someone destroy this ceremony?`
`Who?!!`
` How?!`
`Fuhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
`This isn't a chess problem.`
`It's a game on an equal footing.`
`I won't be cornering you one-sidedly.`
`You'll be able to frantically escape my advances and force a tie, an invalid match.`
`At any rate, I doubt you can manage more than repeating that over and over.`
`And it probably won't be that difficult for you.`
`However, this invalid match will continue forever...until it eventually wears down your mind and kills it.`
`That is when you'll accept your defeat and surrender to me!!`
`There's a reason I said it was a game on an equal footing.`
`...That's because rules for my loss have also been established.`
`There's nothing as boring as a game you can't lose, right?`
`As for how to defeat me...`
`That would be...the epitaph that stands as an offering to my portrait.`
`It's both the way to open the door to the Golden Land...and the key to destroying my ceremony.`
`I'll try to complete the ceremony in accordance with the epitaph.`
`You'll try to solve the riddle of the epitaph, destroy the ceremony and overthrow me...!`
`Solve the riddle hidden in the epitaph, and expose the location of the vast sum of gold I gave Kinzo!!`
`What result will this game show us?!`
`I'm expecting a good fight, okay?`
`Entertain me, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!`
`".................."`
`".........I have no objections.`
` ...Natsuhi and I acknowledge it."`
`"......Ggh...`
` ...I can't believe it, ...and I don't want to, `
`...but this is...the truth, isn't it..."`
`"...Natsuhi,`
` choose your words more carefully.`
` ......She's this family's most honored guest."`
`"......I-I also acknowledge it.`
` ...Can't argue back."`
`"Yes.`
` ...I acknowledge it.`
` ......I have absolutely no complaints.`
` I can't believe you actually...`
` ......You have my honest respect."`
`"Me too...`
` ......Incredible.`
` I genuinely respect you.`
` ...So I have to acknowledge it."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"I acknowledge it too...`
` ......I still can't believe it.`
` ...Still, ......what can I do?`
` ~ib~You've proven devils~ib~`
`!`
` It's your victory...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!`
` The Devil's Proof was a convenient excuse you liked using to handle unprovable matters, ...but now it's become your mortal enemy, has it not?"`
`"...Don't torture me, mighty witch.`
` ......I've already acknowledged you.`
` I resign."`
`".................."`
`"...Kyrie,`
` do you still have objections...?`
` I must have everyone in agreement.`
` If you alone will not acknowledge my existence..."`
`As the witch laughed boldly, the siblings started getting frantic.`
`...They were afraid of displeasing the witch.`
`Kyrie lightly closed her eyes, ...and after keeping silent for a while, opened her mouth.`
`"...My apologies.`
` ...I resign."`
`Only Kyrie had faced the witch with stern eyes until the end.`
`...However, this had only resulted in her refusing to accept the truth for a short time.`
`The truth...the being...that was before her eyes...couldn't be denied.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~Devils had already been proven~ib~`
`...!`
`"......I also...acknowledge it.`
` ...You are Beatrice.`
` The Ushiromiya family alchemist.`
` ...And a user of great magic.`
` ......I must acknowledge the fact that you are a witch...!"`
`...What is that sound that always fills my ears?`
`Is it the sound of the rain, the sound of a waterfall, or could it be radio static?`
`If not, I want it to be the sound of blood flowing through my body.`
`...I want it to be the sound of the blood circulating throughout me, telling me that I am still alive...`
`".........Nnn...`
` ...Is it...morning...?"`
`The light entering through a crack in the curtain was faint, but it at least told him that dawn had broken.`
`Kinzo, still in the position he'd been when he woke up, ...still sitting in a chair and looking up at the ceiling, ...felt the blood slowly travel throughout his body...`
`...Judging by the clock, it was early morning, 6:00 on the dot.`
`...No matter how tired he was, no matter how deeply he slept, he always woke up at exactly this time, as though he had measured it with an hourglass.`
`He didn't think of this as something to boast about, but he told himself that, as long as he could still manage this, his health couldn't be that bad.`
`"......Morning has come, which means...`
`......hmmm.`
` ...It would appear I've avoided becoming one of the first sacrifices.`
` ...Was I merely lucky when the roulette was spun, ...or is this the fruit of my efforts?`
` How irritating that I cannot tell the difference, but I mustn't be bothered by such trivialities."`
`Kinzo was struck by a faint desire to see beyond the study door.`
`After all, he might find the traces of someone's vain struggle to break through the door, `
`a sign that someone had tried to select him as one of the first six sacrifices.`
`"...Hmph.`
` ......Humans are cheap creatures.`
` ...Even though everything is ultimately decided by God, when humans are given good fortune, they arrogantly feel it was due to their own ability."`
`That was why he wanted to check whether there was a wretched mark on the door.`
` ...The very desire was human.`
`And that was why Kinzo did not check.`
`He often rejected desires that came to him because he was human.`
`By doing that, he could be immersed in a feeling of sufficiency, as though he himself had become a being that surpassed humans...`
`He recognized human desires for what they were...and guarded against them.`
`Things that a human would want to do, he resisted.`
`...This eccentricity and rebellious nature had surely given him a rare genius, `
`making it possible for him to succeed in his exploits as he revived the Ushiromiya family in a single generation...`
`"Well then, Beatrice.`
` What were the six pieces you took?`
` ...And, what will your next move be?`
` ...Entertain me.`
` ......My defense is perfect.`
` I will not shame myself like last time.`
` ...Heh, ...heheheh."`
`The servants woke early.`
`They had to open the curtains, prepare breakfast, and complete various other tasks to welcome the guests to a new day.`
`Gohda was the most enthusiastic.`
`During the family conference, he had been told to concentrate his efforts especially on cooking,`
` and he'd been specially exempted from several tasks that servants normally must do.`
`...Gohda, who was a show off, seemed to be feeling particularly superior because of that.`
`He let Genji and the rest prepare the rest of the mansion...and worked on making breakfast in the kitchen.`
`Genji split the work with Shannon and Kanon, and they carried out various tasks.`
`Shannon headed to the dining hall and knocked.`
`...Last year, the family conference had continued into the early hours of the morning.`
`It wouldn't have been odd if this year's conference had done the same.`
`Considering the possibility that they were still having a discussion inside, she knocked.`
`But there was no response, so she opened the door and said good morning.`
`"...Good morning.`
` ......Is anyone there?"`
`The room was cold, and the conference seemed to have ended a long time before.`
`There was a tea set on the table from which they'd probably been drinking, arranged in a way that would make it easy to clean up.`
`Cleaning up the tea was a servant's job.`
`If the family members were extra generous and cleaned it up themselves, the servants would lose face.`
`So, it was a truly pleasant act of kindness for the family to do only this much.`
`As she approached the table to clean it, she noticed something like a memo that had been left near the utensils and cups.`
`Since it was right next to the tea set, Shannon picked it up, naturally thinking it was a memo for the servant doing the cleaning.`
`Written there was not a request, nor was it thanks for preparing the tea.`
` There was just a single word.`
`Shannon looked at it blankly and read it out loud...`
`"......Chapel.`
` ......?"`
`A small sound kept repeating over and over.`
`Normally, that sound would've been too trivial to be worth caring about.`
`If only I could stop hearing it soon, I could go back to sleep right away, ...she thought vaguely.`
`...But no matter how much time passed, the sound did not end.`
`It repeated over and over.`
`Aaah, shut up.`
`Who is it?`
` Banging on the door this whole time...`
`As soon as she realized that, she woke up.`
`...Someone was knocking.`
`Then, she noticed that it wasn't just a knock, but a voice as well.`
`"......Rosa-sama, ...Rosa-sama.`
` ...Good morning."`
`"...W-Wait.`
` I'm coming now."`
`It had been Genji's voice.`
`Looking at the clock, it wasn't even 7:00 yet.`
`...It was clearly too early to wake the guests.`
` ...Did something happen that was bad enough to cause this?`
`She felt her sleepiness increasingly fade thanks to this premonition of misfortune.`
`Though Genji was a servant, Rosa had known him since her childhood days, so even though she was slightly defenseless in her pajamas, she opened the door a crack and answered.`
`"Good morning.`
` I apologize for waking you this early."`
`"...Did something happen?"`
`"Yes...`
` ......Actually, at the chapel......`
` ......"`
`Genji...whispered something into Rosa's ear.`
`For a second, it seemed Rosa couldn't understand what she'd been told.`
` After having it repeated several times, she realized that apparently, something strange had happened.`
`Rosa closed her door for a second, changed her clothes quickly, and followed Genji towards the mansion...`
`The chapel requires some explanation.`
`It wasn't in the mansion, but in a grove behind it, a short walk's distance away.`
`It had been built at the same time as the mansion, `
`so though its walls had been repaired many times, making it look new from the outside, it was a very old building.`
`Rosa dashed through the rain along with Genji.`
`Just like the previous night, the rain was falling in earnest.`
`Eventually, the chapel came into sight from beyond a thin grove...`
`Just looking at it from the outside, it seemed a place of dazzling beauty, where a pair of young lovers might want to get married.`
`However, Kinzo apparently viewed it as a very sacred place, `
`so Rosa and her siblings had been given strict instructions not to approach it unnecessarily.`
`Even though they were all grown up now, approaching the chapel for any reason would still make them feel guilty...`
`and also afraid, as if their Father might get angry and hit them in the face...`
`The servants' silhouettes could be seen in front of the chapel's entrance.`
` Gohda, Shannon and Kanon.`
`...Which meant that all of the servants on the morning shift had gathered.`
`A short while ago, Genji had spoken to Rosa, telling her what the situation was.`
`However, ...without laying eyes on it directly, she definitely hadn't been able to understand...`
`It was probably the same for all the servants gathered here as well.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`...~ib~Without seeing it with their own eyes~ib~, they wouldn't have been able to understand what was going on.`
`On the door at the entrance to the chapel...`
`was something very large, ...drawn with a creepy, stringy paint that made one think of blood...`
` ...Something like a creepy magic circle.`
`'!s1`
`What is...`
`...this...?`
` When was it drawn here?!"`
`The servants looked at each other.`
`Gohda was the first to open his mouth.`
`"...M-My apologies.`
` We don't usually enter this building, so we don't know when it was made."`
`"Then who was the first person to find it?!"`
`"I-It was me.`
` ...When I went to the dining hall to clean up the tea set, ...I found a memo with 'chapel' written on it..."`
`Shannon held out the memo with a shaking hand.`
`"...Whose handwriting is it?`
` It isn't Nii-san's or Nee-san's.`
` ...So, after that, you came here and found this, right?"`
`"Yes..."`
`"...Rosa-sama, ......look at this."`
`"What?`
` <......Happy Halloween...for...>`
` ...What?!"`
`Kanon pointed at a single line of English written below the creepy magic circle.`
`Until it had been pointed out to her, she'd thought it was just another part of the magic circle.`
`There, the following words were written in English: `
`<Happy HALLOWEEN for MARIA.>`
`Happy Halloween...`
` For Maria...`
`This creepy magic circle...`
`was for Maria.`
`<Happy Halloween.>`
`Yesterday, only one person had said <Happy Halloween> to Maria...`
`The key phrase matched.`
`...It was the Golden Witch, Beatrice...!`
`"Wh-What about Maria?!`
` She should be sleeping with her cousins, right?`
` Did you check?!"`
`"...My apologies.`
` We just now realized that Maria-sama's name was written here.`
` ...We still have not checked.`
` Quickly-"`
`"What are you doing?!!`
` I'll go check on Maria and come back!`
` Tell Krauss nii-san and the rest too.`
` After that, follow their instructions!"`
`...After saying that much, Rosa finally noticed that something was odd.`
`Her own rank in this family conference was the lowest of the four siblings.`
`...Why had she been the only one called during an abnormal situation like this, when the other siblings hadn't been?`
`...Even if Maria's name had popped up.`
`"Could it be...huh?`
` ...What?!"`
`"...Y-Yes.`
` We tried to contact Krauss-sama, `
`...but we couldn't find him..."`
`"And Madam was not in her room.`
` ...Judging by the condition of the sheets, she might not have returned to her bed at all last night."`
`Rosa felt something creepy crawling slowly up her back...`
`"......D-Did you check inside the chapel?"`
`"No, not yet.`
` We tried, but..."`
`"...Actually, the lock to the chapel is special, so the master key will not work.`
` There is a single key that can open it, ...but that key is missing from the key box."`
`She didn't want to get closer to the door with the creepy magic circle if she could.`
`Rosa readied herself and approached, then tried pushing and pulling the knob.`
`...All she felt was the resistance of the sturdy lock.`
`"We searched to see if there was a window we could enter through, but...`
` I think we'd have to break one of the windows if we wanted to check inside...`
` What do you think?"`
`"...There's no way I can give you approval to do something like that.`
` This is Father's precious chapel.`
` ........."`
`At that time, the events of the previous day swirled around in the back of Rosa's mind...`
`'!s0`
`...when I met that witch in the rose garden, `
`...didn't she hand Maria an envelope?`
`Yeah, there's no mistake, she did hand it over.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`When Maria tried to open it, the witch told her not to do it yet, and then she surely said: `
`"~ib~The time to open that will come soon~ib~"...`
`Rosa was sure.`
`...There could be no mistake.`
`...The envelope Maria had received was......`
`After dashing back to the guesthouse, Rosa approached the cousins' room while hiding her footsteps, `
`softly opened the door, and peered inside...`
`From the inside, she could hear the healthy snores typical of young people.`
`There were four children.`
` And Maria was there.`
` ...Sleeping soundly.`
`After breathing a sigh of relief, she entered the room with quiet footsteps.`
`...She was after Maria's handbag, which was resting on the sofa.`
`Maria always liked carrying her treasures around with her.`
`...She was probably emulating how her mother always carried her makeup with her.`
`Of course, she was just imitating her mother, so everything on the inside was junk.`
`In Maria's case, it was full of small, creepy, occult items, notebooks describing things of that nature, and so on.`
`...Rosa had never been happy to see her daughter walking around with things like that, which weren't girlish at all.`
`However, trying to force Maria to stop had resulted in a big fight, so she'd decided to let it be.`
`".........Here.`
` ......This is it......"`
`A Western envelope with the crest of the gold eagle...`
`When she took it out of the bag, she realized there was a heavy, vaguely cylindrical object inside.`
`...She could tell by its feel and its weight.`
`...There was no doubt.`
`This was...a key.`
`After turning around and checking that Maria was still sound asleep, `
`Rosa tore open the envelope, and the contents spilled out into her palm.`
`...It was a key with an old and intricate design...`
`Rosa gripped that key and dashed out.`
`...Battler seemed to have noticed that sound, but after grumbling and turning over in his sleep, he started snoring again...`
`"...Genji-san,`
` ...could this key...be the key to the chapel?"`
`"Where did you...`
` ...Yes, this is the key to the chapel."`
`Rosa approached the creepy magic circle once again...and put the key in the keyhole.`
`...There was a strong resistance.`
`After it resisted for a short while, ...it stopped resisting with a clunk.`
`Then, squeaking with a noise that hurt one's ears, ...it slowly, slowly began to open......`
`"......Is anyone...there......?!"`
`Her voice reverberated throughout the massive room.`
`...Of course, there was no answer.`
`The chapel had a high ceiling, and the air was cold.`
`...And even on this rainy, unsettling day, it felt sacred for some reason...`
`The servants timidly followed after Rosa.`
`"...Rosa-sama, look at that."`
`Kanon noticed it immediately and pointed.`
`...Over there...was the altar.`
`In the place that would normally have a pastor preaching of God's love, there was a table that shouldn't have been there.`
`At first, it looked like a dining table.`
`...There actually were gorgeous plates and utensils placed there, making it look like a child's birthday party or something.`
`Upon closer inspection, the surrounding area had been decorated with pumpkins and black and orange ribbons.`
`They were probably...Halloween decorations.`
`And there were people seated at the table.`
`Three people on each side facing each other, seated in chairs.`
`They could be recognized at a glance.`
`Krauss and his wife, Eva and her husband, and Rudolf and his wife.`
`But if you wanted to be sure, you'd still have to go even closer and check.`
`...Because they seemed almost like dolls.`
`Rosa and the rest had opened the door, entered all at once with the sound of many footsteps, and called out, asking if anyone was there.`
`...And yet, there had been no reaction.`
`...Even if Rosa and the rest assumed they were being ignored, you'd still expect there to be some kind of reaction.`
`...And there hadn't even been that.`
`So at first, it felt like someone had set down some dolls that greatly resembled those people...`
`...By now, it wasn't just Rosa.`
`...Shannon and Kanon, and even Gohda.`
`...They were all fighting frantically with the creepy emotion that grasped their hearts.`
`"...Nii-san...?`
` ......Nee-san......?"`
`As she walked towards the altar, she called out again, but there was still no reaction.`
`...Yes, ...by now, Rosa was sure of it.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`...She was sure these weren't dolls, `
`~ib~but the people themselves~ib~...!`
`"......This is......"`
`"........."`
`They grew close enough to see clearly what lay on the table.`
`It still looked like an adorable banquet, reminiscent of a child's birthday party.`
`Plates piled up with sweets, cute pitchers with drinks.`
`All kinds of pumpkin-shaped ornaments...`
`...They were all decorated in a Halloween style, `
`...and while this probably wasn't the time to be thinking it, Maria would surely have been delighted to see all this.`
`That was the state of the table they sat in front of, apparently asleep...`
`It was an eerie scene, ...as though a small, fun-looking Halloween party had been stopped in time...`
`"...They're all...`
`...sleeping...?`
` ......?"`
`When she approached even closer to them, ...she realized that there were snacks scattered all over the floor.`
`Candies, cookies, soda and chocolates, ...all with heavily fantasy-themed packaging...`
`They were all scattered across a carpet covered with blackberry and cranberry jam...`
`'!s0`
`Rosa and the rest......finally realized what the situation was...`
`It was...a Halloween party.`
`A banquet for those not of this world...!`
`Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, and Kyrie were seated in chairs, apparently asleep, ...but all dead.`
`How could you tell that they were dead and not simply sleeping?`
`'!s0`
`they'd been...`
`v-`
`vertically...`
`...sliced open...`
`...from their chests to their stomachs......!`
`"...K-Krauss-sama......!!`
` Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii...!"`
`".........How...cruel..."`
`The six of them had sat down at a Halloween party, ...before having their stomachs split open, killing them.`
`Then the jam covering the floor...must be what overflowed from their stomachs once they'd stuffed themselves completely, right...?`
`...No!!`
`The contents of their stomachs had been scattered all over the floor!!`
` And that wasn't all.`
`Out of their stomachs, ...it was almost as though...almost as though...`
`as though they'd poured out...!!`
` A-As though snacks had overflowed from there!!`
`Candies and cookies, soda and chocolates...`
`had poured out, stained with blood, and had scattered across the floor!!`
`What could have happened to cause this?!`
`It's almost as though their stomachs were stuffed full to bursting with sweets...`
`and it all poured out when their stomachs split open!!`
`Rosa remembered a certain shocking meal, a turkey that had been served at her own birthday.`
`When it had been cut open with a knife, ...out flowed one of her favorite foods.`
` ...But since she hadn't been told what was inside, the deep, deep red ketchup omelet-rice poured out like bloody maggots...`
`pulsing, `
`dripping, `
`slimy, `
`pulpy, `
`squelching!!`
`'!s0`
` Eeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`The trauma of her youth was revived.`
`Rosa felt a monster raging inside her stomach as the acid started to rise.`
`...Unable to hold back, she threw it all up on the floor.`
`Her empty stomach had nothing but stomach acid.`
`The scene in front of her was no fun Halloween party now...!`
`The three couples were enshrined right there, their stomachs vertically wrenched open, `
`wrenched open with a gyuiiiiiiigubaaa.`
`So many snacks had been stuffed in there, `
`pulpy, `
`squishy.`
`Blood and guts and sweets were overflowing onto the floor, `
`...bloodstained, `
`sticky, `
`sticky, `
`sloppy, `
`pulpy, `
`sweet snacks that made your fingers stick together, `
`gummy, `
`gummy, `
`aaah, but stained with entrails, `
`sloppy, `
`pulpy!`
` What was that I stepped on just now, that didn't feel like a candy or a cookie or soda or a chocolate!`
`Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah, I'm scared what did I step on I can't even look at the bottom of my foot!!`
`Aaaaaawaaaakiiiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!`
`...What a...what a gruesome Halloween Party...!!!`
`From far away, it had looked truly beautiful, fantastical, and fun.`
`But from up close, it was horrible, disgusting, and yet somehow still beautiful...!!`
`'!s0`
`Rosa's wild thoughts tried as best they could to escape her throat with a loud voice that was neither a scream nor a roar...`
`"......Krauss-sama......"`
`"...This is...horrible...just horrible......"`
`"...C-Call an ambulance, `
`...call the police......!"`
`"...Th-That's right, the police...`
` Police, police police police police!!"`
`If a word so tied to reality hadn't come out of Gohda's mouth, Rosa and the rest would probably have found themselves unable to escape that nightmarish party even now.`
`...But it wasn't because they thought the police might be able to do something.`
`If they didn't keep yelling about the police, ...it felt as though another seat might be set up at this demon's party and given to them...!!`
`Their own chests felt like they were expanding unpleasantly from the inside!!`
` Rumbling, `
`churning, `
`...and it was surely because candy was about to overflow from their stomachs!!`
`Rosa, once again tortured by a desire to vomit, threw her stomach acid up on the floor.`
` And then she searched.`
` Searched to see if there was any candy in it!!`
`"...Haah, ......haah, ...haah...!!`
` Eeeeh, ...haah...`
` ...A-Anyway!!`
` *cough*, *cough*!!"`
`Rosa coughed violently again, forcefully spitting out the stomach acid that had been burning in her throat.`
`She realized that by now, her whole body had been covered in a filthy sweat...`
`"G-Genji-san, Shannon-chan, please contact Father and ask for instructions.`
` Gohda-san, go with Kanon-kun and call the police.`
` ...Then, have Doctor Nanjo come here..."`
`Why even bring Doctor Nanjo here?`
`It's a bit too late for medical care...!`
`The servants accepted their orders and dashed outside.`
`After watching them leave, ......Rosa once again stared at her siblings, with whom she'd spent good times and bad, and their partners.`
` Though there could be nothing more tragic than this scene, ...for some reason, she was tempted to describe these fantastical deaths as beautiful......`
`"...They aren't here.`
` Where'd they go?"`
`"The servant room and the kitchen are both empty.`
` ...What in the world happened?"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Mama!!`
` Where's Mama?!!`
` My letter!`
` The letter I got from Beato!`
` Give it back!`
` Give it baaaack!!`
` Waaauau!!"`
`"Perplexing.`
` ...Battler-kun, are you sure it was Aunt Rosa?"`
`"...Well, even I was half-asleep, so I'm not too sure, `
`but I get the feeling that, in the early morning, Aunt Rosa came in and fished around in Maria's handbag."`
`"...I figured there was probably a tube of toothpaste or something in there."`
`"Why would there be a tube of toothpaste in Maria's handbag?`
` Looks like you were a little more than half-asleep."`
`Battler vaguely remembered Rosa entering the cousins' room.`
`Also, when Maria woke up before the rest of them, she'd started rampaging around, saying that someone had opened the envelope she'd been keeping safe.`
`...Putting two and two together, they figured that Rosa had probably come and opened the envelope.`
`"...A letter from the Golden Witch...`
` I wonder what was inside."`
`"I don't know.`
` ...But that envelope was for Grandfather's personal use, and it had the Ushiromiya family crest on it.`
` ......Whatever was inside it must've had some connection to the family conference."`
`She hadn't let anyone touch it, but yesterday, Maria had shown that envelope off to Battler and the rest a whole lot.`
`...So they remembered it well.`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Mama, give it back!`
` Mama, give it back!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!`
` Waauuuuuuuuuuuuu!!"`
`"...Well, if you're right, it'd have to be pretty important...`
` ...Why would this mighty witch give something that important to Maria?`
` ...I don't get it."`
`Every once in a while, the refreshing morning atmosphere was completely wiped out by the sound of thunder.`
`...It was only natural.`
` Since the moment they'd woken up, they hadn't met anyone else.`
`It felt like only they were left, as if the mansion had become an empty husk.`
`"...Heeeeey!`
` Anyone there?!`
` Answer me!"`
`Jessica called out into the hallway, and eventually, an answer came back.`
` It came from the entrance hall.`
`"I can hear you.`
` ...Has something happened?"`
`"It's Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...Thank goodness.`
` It looks like everyone but us hasn't disappeared from this island after all."`
`"Doctor Nanjo, good morning.`
` ...Umm, sorry, but do you know where our parents went...?"`
`"Dear me.`
` ...I only just woke up and came here, you see.`
` I have no way of knowing for sure, but let's see..."`
`It was only natural.`
` Nanjo was a guest just like the rest of them.`
` He'd come just now to pass the time in the parlor until breakfast.`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Doctor Nanjo, Mama took it, Mama took my letter!!`
` Give it back, give it back, uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`Maria buried her face in Nanjo's plump stomach, sobbing and crying.`
`...Nanjo could do nothing but be bewildered by this ruckus so early in the morning.`
`"......Ah.`
` Someone's running this way.`
` Jessica!`
` Someone's coming!"`
`From down the hall, they could sense people running hurriedly.`
`They saw Gohda and Kanon coming towards them.`
`...Normally, it would be disgraceful for a servant to run inside the mansion.`
`And yet, Battler and the rest didn't even think to question that now.`
`Maria's sobbing had become so unmanageable, they wanted to ask someone--anyone--where Rosa was.`
`But the two servants seemed to have bigger things on their minds than Jessica, who was waving at them.`
`Gohda flew into the servant room, and when Kanon noticed that Nanjo was there, he bowed and approached the doctor at a quick pace before whispering something into his ear.`
`"......What did you say?`
` Rosa-san did?"`
`"Yes.`
` I will guide you, so please accompany me."`
`"Understood..."`
`"This way."`
`Without saying anything more than that, Kanon finally noticed Jessica and bowed to her.`
`...But he wasn't calm.`
`He dashed back down the corridor by which he had come, followed by Nanjo.`
`By looking at how hurried they were, Battler and the rest realized that yes, something bad really had happened.`
`They saw Gohda through the door to the servant room, which had been flung open.`
`...He was holding the receiver and violently pressing the hook.`
`From that, they realized that he was trying to call a hospital or the police.`
` In any event, he was trying to call someone because a serious emergency had occurred.`
`"Let's have a look...!"`
`"Yeah...!"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"Mama, give it back!!`
` Give back my letter!!`
` ~ib~It's an invitation to the Golden Land~ib~`
`!!"`
`They didn't know what, but something was happening.`
`Battler and the rest chased after Kanon and Nanjo...`
`Aaah, ...and then we realized.`
`Kanon-kun had called Doctor Nanjo, but he hadn't called us.`
`...So we shouldn't have gone with them.`
`I wonder if Alice regretted her excess curiosity when she chased after that rabbit holding a clock...`
`"No, you mustn't go in!!`
` You mustn't look!!`
` Jessica-chan!`
` No!!"`
`'!s1`
`......n-`
`noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!"`
`"Mother, Father!!`
` What...what happened!!`
` Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!"`
`"...What the hell is this...`
` ...This goes way beyond bad taste...`
` Isn't taking someone's life bad enough...?`
`'!s0`
` Going to all the trouble after they died of sitting them on chairs, slicing their stomachs and pulling their entrails out?!!`
` You went to all the trouble of stuffing their stomachs full of sweets?!!`
` Why...why the hell would you do something so fucked up?!!`
` Damn it, damn it!`
` Nice job, you bastard, just great, just great!!`
` Gyyaaaaaaaaggghh!!"`
`"......It would be best if everyone went outside...!`
` They certainly wouldn't want you all to see them like this..."`
`Nanjo told the children to go outside, but no one listened.`
`"Rosa-san, please tell them.`
` If they keep looking at something like this, ...it will do nothing but harm...!"`
`"........."`
`Rosa regretted her own carelessness.`
`...She should've realized that the children would eventually come here.`
`...She should've quickly locked up instead of standing around stunned.`
`So the children had come here.`
`They had seen it...!`
`Surely, at this very moment, they were having a sight burned into their eyes...`
`that was far more grotesque than the shocking meal Rosa had witnessed in her youth...`
`While she hugged Maria, who seemed to be too shocked to show any emotion at this gruesome scene, `
`Rosa cried for them and their parents.`
`The four groaning and crying voices, their sadness, ...continued to echo in a place that should have known God's love...`
`"You piece of crap!!`
` Again?! Another one of these murders?!!`
` And this time you made it all elaborate, killing them like it's a total joke!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` I was rather hoping you'd thank me, not cry out in grief."`
`"Thank you?!!`
` Did you say I should thank you, you old bitch?!`
` Damn it, if there's something wrong with your ears, I'll cut them both off so you can hear better!!`
` Why should I have to see that insane way of killing and say 'Oh, thank you very much Beatrice-sama'?! I'll beat your brains out!!!"`
`"In the last game, `
`you lamented the fact that you couldn't see your parents faces after they died, yes?`
` So this time, I left them.`
` Didn't touch them!!`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~Take a good look, for without a doubt, your father and the rest have been killed~ib~`
`!!"`
`"R...eally, what a nice treat, I'm so fucking happy!!`
` I swore I'd plow your face after I choked the life out of you, but I'll take that back now. I'll rip out your guts instead!!!"`
`"Don't give in to emotion, don't stop thinking.`
` My game has already begun, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` I decided to leave you neat and tidy corpses this time."`
`"Do you know why?`
` When you denied my existence in the last game, you used this line of thinking..."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"~ib~'Their faces were crushed, so the identity of the corpses can't be confirmed.'~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~'Therefore, we can't eliminate the possibility that fake corpses were prepared to create an alibi.'~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~'Unless that possibility's denied, a human culprit theory can still be built'~ib~!!"`
`"What'd you saaaaaay...?!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*kikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikiki!!`
` So, Battler, is it okay to leave the examination of the corpses to Nanjo?`
` Isn't it traditional in mystery novels for the doctor who performs such examinations to be an accomplice?"`
`"Then don't leave the examination to him. Do it yourself.`
` Make completely sure that without a doubt, the six corpses are the six people they're supposed to be, that they really, really are dead, not just pretending!!"`
`"If you wish to confirm that your Father and Mother have been killed by having their stomachs cut open and their entrails pulled out, `
`you'd better stick your hand inside their stomachs and feel around!!`
` Kuhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, ki-hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"I won't cry!!!`
` Damn it, damn it, ...I won't cry...!!"`
`Battler suddenly yelled.`
`His tears were still dripping down, but as though scolding himself for being a sissy, he slapped his face hard several times with both hands.`
`Even so, the tears still wouldn't stop.`
`...However, he felt a hot blaze in both his eyes.`
`"Whoever's responsible for this piece of work, I'll make them pay back their debt completely!!`
` So this isn't the time to cry, gotta think about what to do!!`
` Aaaah, it's useless, it's all useless!!`
` If you've got enough time to cry, then think!`
` This is no time to let yourself cry!!"`
`Rather than genuine anger, maybe it was more of an evasive anger to blot out his sadness.`
`...However, it gave a little courage to George and Jessica, who'd been crushed by the sadness.`
`"...That's right.`
` ...Even if we cry, `
`...it won't change the reality...`
`of what has happened."`
`"Damn it, ...damn it damn it damn it, ...damn it damn it damn it!!`
` Then what should we do?!`
` What should I do...for Mom and Dad's sakes?!!"`
`"...Rosa-sama...`
` I have returned..."`
`"Gohda-san, what happened with the police?`
` What did they say to do?`
` Did they say when they think they'll be able to get here?"`
`"...As to that, ...it seems the phones have broken down...`
` I also tried the emergency wireless, but...umm, maybe it's the weather, but that isn't working either..."`
`"What did you say...?!`
` So, we can't contact the police?!"`
`"It's that person!`
` They did something to the phone line, made it so we can't reach the cops!!"`
`When she heard that the phones had broken down, Jessica immediately decided that it was the work of that mysterious guest.`
`Her eyes were bright-red after so much crying, and they began to grow even redder with rage.`
`"...Gah, there's no need to talk about it, right?!`
` I understand everything, that's right, I get it!`
` Who killed Dad and Mom?!"`
`"It's obviously her!!`
` It's gotta be that witch or whatever who came yesterday!!!`
` I'll grab her by the collar!!`
` Damn it damn it damn iiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`"Jessica-chan...!`
` Wait!`
` Gohda-san, Kanon-kun, go!"`
`"Y-Yes Ma'am...!"`
`"Milady, wait...!"`
`Covering her uncontrollable sadness with anger, Jessica ran outside, torn apart by emotion.`
`...Thinking about it hastily, maybe the mystery guest who'd arrived yesterday, Beatrice, was suspicious.`
`However, in that instant, there was absolutely no proof that she was the culprit.`
`...At this moment, she's just another guest, no more, no less.`
`So Rosa, making an adult decision, was forced to stop Jessica in her rash rampage.`
`Gohda and Kanon picked up on this immediately and chased after her.`
`"...Could the guest that no one invited, Beatrice, be the culprit...?"`
`"I understand how Jessica feels.`
` ...I wish I could think that too.`
` It doesn't matter who, I want someone to be the culprit so I can bash them right in the face!!`
` ...But before that, we need a clear understanding of what's going on.`
` ...Who is this Beatrice?`
` I haven't even seen her face!!"`
`"...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` If you're looking for her face, it decorates the big portrait in the mansion.`
` You still don't remember after looking at it for so long?`
` Kihihihihihi."`
`"...Come on, Maria.`
` ...What's so funny in a situation like this?!"`
`"Beatrice is a witch.`
` And the ceremony to open the door to the Golden Land has finally begun.`
` Those six people are sacrifices.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!`
` Come, let us begin the witch's banquet.`
` Tonight is Halloween, so now the witches will gather to celebrate.`
` Ki-hihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!"`
`'!s0`
`The crisp sound of Rosa slapping Maria's cheek echoed through the high-ceilinged chapel...`
`Ever since it started raining yesterday...`
`No, ...ever since the island was swallowed by the typhoon, I've felt as though something...was wrong.`
`It was bright and sunny when I arrived on Rokkenjima, but since I'd gotten up early and was sleepy, I took a nap.`
`...When I woke up, it had already started raining.`
`And ever since that time...`
`Suddenly, a mysterious visitor calling herself the Golden Witch Beatrice arrived, and it felt like I was sinking bit by bit into a bizarre world.`
`What the heck happened while I was napping?`
` Am I supposed to believe this island was sealed off inside a different world, where common sense doesn't apply...?!`
`Who is this person called Beatrice?`
`Is some unknown person trying to involve themselves with the inheritance problem, just like our parents were freaking out about at dinner last night?`
`...Or is the culprit this witch from the Legend of the Gold, just like Maria said?!`
`Even if we set Jessica's temper aside, given the circumstances, it's probably safe to say that this visitor person is the most suspicious.`
`But we mustn't make up our minds based on that alone.`
` Aaah, it's useless, it's useless, it's all useless...!!`
`I smacked my face with both hands again, cooling off my brains before they overloaded.`
`Even though it might've been a wasted effort...`
`"...This......is one of Grandfather's envelopes."`
`On a tray piled up with sweets that decorated the table, George-aniki found a Western envelope that had the Ushiromiya family crest done on it in gold leaf.`
`And, it was unopened.`
`"Which means...it's probably meant for us, right?`
` If it was something Dad and the others read, it should be open."`
`"...It seems your reasoning is correct.`
` ...It's written right here.`
` Someone wrote 'to those who remain'."`
`"Is that...a letter the culprit left...?!`
` Wh-What's inside...?"`
`"Aniki, let's open it...!"`
`After nodding silently, George-aniki broke the seal.`
`...A folded letter came out.`
`"......I'll read it.`
` ......Welcome to Rokkenjima, members of the Ushiromiya family.`
` I am Beatrice, the alchemist for this family employed by Kinzo-sama himself..."`
`That letter really was a joke.`
`This Beatrice, who called herself the family alchemist, had announced that she was collecting the gold she'd lent Grandfather, along with interest.`
`And that interest...was everything Grandfather had created.`
`Since this tragedy was right before our eyes as this paragraph was being read aloud, it clearly wasn't referring just to the wealth that Grandfather had built up.`
`...It was literal.`
`Everything that Grandfather had created...`
` ...In other words, ...all of Grandfather's descendants were included in the interest!`
`"You bastard!!`
` What a screwed up contract!`
` Lives as interest for gold, you say?!`
` That's almost like a contract with the devil, isn't it?!`
` You think that makes you look more like a witch?!`
` Ha, don't make me laugh!!"`
`"...Special clause.`
` ......However, if someone is able to discover the hidden gold of this contract, Beatrice must abandon these rights for all time."`
`"......Hmm...`
` ...Kinzo-sama has already publicly displayed the location of the hidden gold within the epitaph under my portrait..."`
`"...In other words, it's something like this.`
` If these murders represent her collecting interest, `
`then she's telling us to try and find the gold she gave Grandfather if we want her to stop...`
` And, she's also saying that the secret pointing to the gold is hidden in the portrait epitaph."`
`"So, basically, ...this is a letter of challenge from the witch?`
` She's telling us to try and solve the code that points to the hidden gold, if we can?!`
` And if we can't, she'll keep collecting the interest as planned?"`
`"I'll beat you to death, bring it on!!!"`
`"...B-Battler-kun!`
` Look, ...look!!!"`
`The table was covered with sweets,`
` ...so even though those things were right out in the open, we just assumed they were sweets too.`
`...I mean, come on, you see them a lot, right?`
`...You know, those boxes of chocolate shaped like gold ingots...!`
`"...Th-This is no box of candy...`
` It's the real thing...!`
` This is a real gold bar...!!"`
`"...It's inscribed with the crest of the One-Winged Eagle...`
` ...I heard Mother talking about this earlier.`
` ...This is a gold bar from Grandfather's Legend of the Gold...!!"`
`Gold ingots weighing a full 10 kilograms...a whole three of them...were piled up in the very center of the table!`
` It was where a cake would be placed if it was a birthday party.`
`...In other words, this was without a doubt the birthday cake of the party known as the family conference!`
`"If these are really four nines quality ingots...`
`...nng, *gulp*.`
` I-It's worth about 60 million yen!"`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, but_2e284:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, but_2e285:`
` Don't take us for fools, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!"`
`"...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` ...So, it has begun, Beatrice.`
` ...It's not like anyone can solve this riddle anyway.`
` So Beato will definitely win."`
`"...Quickly, open the door to the Golden Land.`
` And take me with you.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!"`
`"Milady, please, calm yourself...!"`
`"We still don't know who the culprit is!`
` And Beatrice-sama is an important and honored guest of the Master's...!"`
`"So what?!!`
` If we grab her by the collar, she'll definitely confess!!`
` If I can just look her in the eye, I'll know.`
` I'll see through her!!`
` A witch?! Beatrice?!! Yeah, right!`
` I'll expose her!!"`
`Jessica never stopped moving.`
`Gohda and Kanon chased after her, doing their best to convince her to stop, but Jessica never lent them an ear.`
`Eventually, the witch's VIP room came into view.`
`This VIP room was always sealed and never used.`
`...No matter what kind of guest came, Kinzo wouldn't let them in there.`
`...And yet, the servants were always made to clean this room, so that it could be used at any time.`
`So the servants had started calling this room the witch's VIP room, after their second, shapeless master.`
`Jessica knew about this too.`
`And she couldn't forgive the arrogance of the one who called herself a witch by staying in that room.`
`...The Golden Witch was just a fairy tale.`
`Come on, a witch?!`
` To Jessica, she was nothing more or less than the murderer who had brutally killed her parents!`
`Question her, hear her pitiful excuses, make her splutter in pain, gasp in anguish.`
`...No matter how hard she pretends to be a witch, I'll teach her that she's just a stinking, sweaty Human!!`
`As Jessica yelled with all of her strength, she hit the door to the VIP room.`
`It definitely wasn't a knock.`
`...That sound was the beating of her anger's hammer, as if she was determined to break the door down if it wasn't opened.`
`"Open up, Beatrice!!`
` Come out!!`
` You hear me, right?!`
` Open up!!!"`
`There was no answer.`
`...Jessica grabbed the doorknob without any reservation, but she felt the resistance of the lock.`
`She turned around to look at the two servants and spoke.`
`"The master key'll unlock this, right?!`
` Use it!!"`
`"Milady...!`
` That would be horribly rude...!!"`
`Although Gohda was flustered, he still tried to somehow calm Jessica's anger.`
`...After hanging his head silently for a while, Kanon pulled a master key from his jacket pocket.`
`"Kanon-san...!`
` Are you sure?!"`
`"...Yes, I'm fully aware it would be rude if she happens to be in there.`
` ......At any rate,`
` ...if Beatrice had nothing to do with that incident, all she has to do is give us a satisfying explanation."`
`"...Th-That's right, exactly!!`
` Lemme borrow that!"`
`Jessica snatched the master key from Kanon's hand and violently shoved it into the keyhole.`
`...Immediately, there was a small sound, and she felt the lock click.`
`Then, without asking permission, she flung the door open.`
`"Beatrice!!`
` Where are you?!`
` Come out!!"`
`Jessica rudely stepped into the room.`
`...The witch wasn't anywhere to be seen.`
`"...That bitch!!`
` She's not here!!`
` Where the hell'd she go?!"`
`"......Y-Yes, she doesn't seem to be here..."`
`Jessica, thinking she might be hiding somewhere inside the room, peeked behind the curtains and under the bed, but she couldn't find anyone.`
`However, there definitely were signs that the bed had been used...`
`and though it was only a vague sense, the atmosphere in the room felt a little soft.`
`It wasn't the hard atmosphere of a place normally devoid of people, like the chapel.`
`You could definitely tell that someone had spent the night in this room.`
`But she could not be seen.`
`In reality, neither Jessica nor Gohda had met Beatrice.`
`...They had only been told by those who had met her that she looked like a double of the character in that portrait.`
`...So, they were doubtful about what her face really looked like.`
`...However, Kanon alone had met her.`
`He understood what kind of being that witch was, ...what kind of personality she had.`
`So, he knew that forcing their way in here in search for her...definitely wouldn't work out.`
`...She must be watching us bitterly flail about in vain from somewhere, sneering at us.`
`...She's that kind of person.`
`Because he was looking at things that way, Kanon was the first to find it.`
`...The other two were concentrating on finding the shadow of a person, so they didn't notice.`
`Near a water jug on the side table, there was a single sheet of letter paper.`
`On it was a short message, and nearby was a fountain pen, which had probably been used to write it...`
`Kanon had already come to understand the witch.`
`After finding the corpses, they'd been overcome by rage and barged in here, only to find no one, `
` so of course the witch would mock them.`
`...You can't mock someone unless they know they're being mocked.`
`So, in other words, ...that's what this must be...!`
`"...Milady, `
`......there's something written here."`
`"Something written? What?!"`
`Jessica dashed over and violently snatched the piece of paper away.`
`...She probably wasn't trying to be violent.`
`...She just couldn't control her strength right now.`
`"......What the...?!`
` D-Don't fuck with me!!!"`
`As soon as she read the message, Jessica went into a wild rage, crumpled the paper up, and threw it.`
`Then, she grabbed a light stand by the bedside and violently swung it around, mercilessly hitting the walls and furniture with it.`
`...The lightbulbs all shattered at once, and the fragments were scattered across the room.`
`"Milady, please calm down...!`
` You'll hurt yourself!!"`
`'!s0`
`@:dwave_eng 0, jes_2e513:`
` Come out, Beatrice!!`
` How could you do that to Mom and Dad?!!`
` You think you scare me?!!`
` I'll kill you, I'll kill you!!`
` I'll beat you to death, so show yourself!!!`
` I told you to let go of me, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`This was written on the paper...`
`'Did you think I'd be that senile, to just sit around here waiting for you to come barging in?`
` You're way too inelegant for this intellectual night.`
`I can only imagine what the parents who raised you to be such a moron must've looked like.`
`Oh right, I saw them, and they looked just as moronic as you.`
`Now, their bellies are full in the land of sweets!'`
`...It was the sort of thing that witch would write...`
`...It meant she'd predicted that one of the children who'd lost their parents would come running in here.`
`...If she's hiding somewhere in this room, she must be rolling around laughing now...`
`The witch was that kind of person.`
`...She sneered at people's misfortune, using it to stave off the boredom of a thousand years...!`
`"Hand it over...!`
` I'm telling you you'll hurt yourself...!`
` ......Nnnnng, ...nnnnggg!!"`
`"I told you to let go!!`
` Damn iiiiiit, damn iiiiiiit!!`
` ...Agh!"`
`Gohda snatched away the light stand Jessica had been holding.`
`...After all, if she kept swinging it around, she might end up smashing it against something, which could cause serious injury.`
`...To Gohda's eyes, Jessica probably looked mad with rage, burning herself up with the flames of anger.`
`...But Kanon's eyes saw it differently.`
`Those were probably...tears of sadness, hidden by rage...`
`So...`
`When the light stand was taken from Jessica, `
`when she started crying on the floor, scratching at the carpet almost as though she was groveling...`
`...Gohda was surprised, but Kanon was not.`
`...Of course.`
` She had lost her means of crying by lashing out in rage.`
`"Uuuuuuuuuuuuuu, waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!`
` Dad, ...Mom, ...uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuu!!"`
`...Considering that she was a daughter of the Ushiromiya Head Family, ...she was in a very shabby state.`
`...She scratched at the carpet with her fingernails, and even her feet were scratching.`
`Jessica cried very, very hard.`
`...Because if she didn't, her rage would start building up again and swallow her up.`
`But over and over again, she remembered that humiliating message...`
`...I can only imagine what the parents who raised you to be such a moron must've looked like.`
`"Don't you call them morons!!`
` Both Dad and Mom were smart!!`
` Unlike me, they were really smart!!`
` Don't you call them morons!`
` Take it back, `
`take it back!!"`
`Oh right, I saw them, and they looked just as moronic as you.`
`Now, their bellies are full in the land of sweets!!`
`"Aaaaaaaggghhh, damn iiiiiit!!`
` I'll kill her I'll kill her, I'll slice open her stomach and see how she likes it!!`
` Uuuuaaaaaaaaaaaa, waaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!!`
` Hic, *cough*cough*, *cough*cough*cough*!!!"`
`As Jessica cried and screamed, she triggered an asthma attack...`
`The servants watching over her hurriedly ran up to her and rubbed her back, but that only provoked Jessica's wrath...`
`"*cough*cough*!!`
` The hell?!!`
` If you've got the time to do that, search for that bastard!!`
` Find 'em and bring 'em here!!`
` If you won't go, I will!!`
` And I'll kill 'em with my own hands, I'll slice open her stomach!!`
` *cough*cough*cough*cough*!!`
` *cough*, *cough*!!`
` Don't touch me!!!`
` Damn it, damn it, *cough*cough*!!`
` *cough*cough*!!"`
`Jessica got up unsteadily, and as her asthma continued, she went out into the hallway...`
`"Milady, your medicine, quickly...!`
` I will call Doctor Nanjo!"`
`"......Gohda-san,`
` ......would you...leave this to me?"`
`Kanon had noticed.`
`......Gohda, who was vastly separated from her in age, ...probably couldn't sense the tears in Jessica's heart.`
`...Kanon, who had noticed, had to be the one to support her.`
`"K-Kanon-san,`
` ......are you sure...?"`
`"......I believe Milady needs some time to cry right now.`
` ......Considering that she saw her parents killed like that..."`
`"............`
`...You're right."`
`Gohda also understood.`
`...And he knew that Jessica and Kanon had shared a vague relationship with each other.`
`So he understood everything...and left it to Kanon.`
`"......Very well.`
` ...I will go back to Rosa-sama.`
` ...Please, take care of Milady."`
`"Yes.`
` ...Leave it to me."`
`Kanon's voice was frail, ...but he nodded firmly.`
`After looking at his eyes, Gohda nodded firmly as well.`
`...Gohda was a veteran with many years behind him.`
`He'd seen a great number of people in his life.`
`...So he knew the vigorous sparkle that could be found in the eyes of those who possessed self-control.`
`He had surely seen that in Kanon's eyes.`
`...So, he would leave this to Kanon.`
`...When you think about it, maybe this was the first time Gohda had ever trusted Kanon and relied on him for a job...`
`Jessica, still suffering from her asthma, ...seemed to be heading towards her room, though she kept leaning against the wall.`
`...Kanon followed her wordlessly.`
`If she had asked for a hand, he would have leapt forward and supported her.`
`...But until Jessica did ask for that, he chose to hide himself, watching over her from a distance where he could come to her rescue at any time.`
`...When people feel their hearts are about to explode from sadness and want to have someone by their sides, `
`you can bet ten billion of them would want to turn around and find someone in the place Kanon now stood,`
` as he watched over Jessica from behind...`
`Then, finally, she doubled over in front of the door to her room.`
`...The asthma attack had stolen all her strength.`
`And her thoughts had gotten hazy from the lack of oxygen, making it impossible even to stand up again.`
`...But right then, Jessica didn't think she wanted someone to lend a hand.`
`She still hadn't been able to overcome the flames of anger.`
`...Even if someone had offered her a hand with good intentions, Jessica would've wanted to tear it off right then.`
`...She knew how unfair that would be.`
`...So she definitely wouldn't ask for help until she overcame the fiery anger burning inside.`
`Jessica had probably lost the willpower even to call for help.`
`...But Kanon heard it.`
`...He definitely heard it.`
`...Kanon definitely heard that voiceless call for help, one shared by miserable grievers the world round, `
`...an endless scream that no one ever seems to hear.`
`Kanon quietly knelt by Jessica's side and wordlessly offered her a shoulder.`
`...Though Jessica kept coughing painfully, she accepted it, `
`......unlocked the door to her room, and entered...`
`"......This way.`
` ......I'll prepare your medicine right away."`
`".........*cough*cough*cough*...!`
` ......*co-, ......*cough*cough*cough*...!!"`
`Jessica often said that when her asthma got serious enough, it hurt so bad that it felt like she'd vomit up her whole stomach.`
`Her face was pale, and her gaze wavered.`
`And yet, the coughing continued...`
`...Even so, ...her sadness was probably even stronger...`
`After having her sit on the bed, Kanon took a bronchodilator from a cute little basket on a nearby side table and handed it to her.`
`...Jessica sometimes forgot to take her medicine with her.`
`Whenever this seemed to have happened, Kanon would take notice and secretly carry around the inhaler from the first-aid kit in the servant room, but he hadn't done so today.`
`...He scolded himself, as though wondering how he could call himself furniture after failing to bring it with him on a day like this.`
`......Then he remembered the day when he'd used that word and somehow betrayed Jessica's feelings.`
` ...It jarred Kanon's heart, but he felt it would be indiscreet to think about something like that, considering how Jessica felt now,`
` and he locked it up inside the depths of his heart...`
`"......Haah, ......haah...`
`............haah..."`
`When she inhaled her medicine, Jessica's wild breathing calmed down bit by bit, ...and she was finally able to regain her composure.`
`......But, she'd lost too much strength and willpower to get up from the bed.`
`".........Are you all right,`
` ...Milady?"`
`'!s1`
`...all right...`
`......I'm all messed up over Mom and Dad, `
`......but...`
`after I cry a bit more...`
`...I'll be all right......"`
`"........."`
`Kanon regretted his poor choice of words.`
`...Did he really say 'Are you all right' to her?`
`...Was he really that clueless of the pain in her heart?`
`......This was what made him furniture.`
`This was why he couldn't become human...`
`".........I will be in the corridor.`
` ...If you need anything, please call me immediately."`
`Kanon understood that she still needed some time to cry alone.`
`He told her to call him at any time, bowed, and tried to leave the room.`
`"...Ah, ........."`
`"...Do you need something?"`
`Jessica had spoken up as though she wanted him to stop, so Kanon had stopped.`
`......If she asks it, I'll do anything I can to help her.`
`...Right now, I'd become even a cane or a chair if it would help ease the pain in her heart.`
`......If by doing that, ...I could make up for the pain I dealt to her heart on that day...`
`"............"`
`...For a while, Jessica stared into Kanon's eyes.`
`...It was as though her reason for stopping him was something she couldn't put into words.`
`"............"`
`"........."`
`For a while, neither spoke.`
`......Jessica broke that silence.`
`...With a small voice.`
`"......I'm sorry.`
` ......It's nothing.`
` ......Could you tell Aunt Rosa that I want to be alone for a while...?"`
`"I won't...let you be alone."`
`"............Huh...?"`
`"I won't...let you be alone.`
` ............So, I will be in the corridor.`
` ...Please call for me...`
`at any time."`
`For just an instant, it looked like some kind of hope had flitted into Jessica's eyes.`
`...But it was very faint...and disappeared like the first snow on the surface of a river.`
`"...Thanks.`
` .........Let me cry alone...for just a bit..."`
`"......Yes.`
` ......Excuse me."`
`Kanon bowed once again and closed the door...`
`......He'd thought those words of his would give her some courage.`
`......But now, it felt as though they'd actually hurt her, for some reason.`
`...Why?`
` ......He didn't know.`
`'!s0`
`......he was furniture.`
`That was why...he couldn't grasp human sadness even now.`
`As Kanon repeatedly questioned himself, he walked down the corridor.`
`......He felt like the window at the corridor's end was cooly calling to him.`
`"............`
`...In the end, ......am I nothing more than furniture after all...?"`
`It was still pouring outside...a dark, gray world.`
`...Even on days like this, Shannon would surely see the ocean and know that it was blue.`
`...But to my eyes, even if it cleared up, I would only see gray...`
`Until I can understand the blue of the ocean, `
`...I'll be nothing but furniture imitating a person......`
`".........You really don't understand a woman's heart, do you?`
` ...At times like that, you ought to silently remain by her side.`
` ...*cackle*cackle* That's why you're furniture."`
`"......Y-You..."`
`There shouldn't have been any trace of human life in this corridor.`
`It had been an empty corridor filled with frigid air.`
`......But those scoffing words approached Kanon from behind.`
`When he turned around, ...he saw that witch.`
`That witch, who hadn't shown herself when Jessica had searched for her with a rage bordering on madness, and who had left that sneering letter to toy with Jessica...!`
`"There are three ways to hurt a woman.`
` ...Let me teach you them.`
` One is to hurt them with a blade.`
` Another is to hurt them in their heart.`
` ...The last way is the most difficult and most effective method of hurting them.`
` And yet it can hurt them without you even realizing it.`
` Do you know what I mean...?"`
`"...H-How could I know...? I don't even want to know!!"`
`"It's to betray their expectations.`
` ...No living being is more of a dreamer than a woman!`
` They make up dreams all on their own and end up hurting their own selves.`
` ...A distant man like you hurts women the most!`
` You couldn't understand.`
` You have no idea how deeply you've wounded Jessica."`
`"...After all, you're furniture!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"I-I have no intention of playing along with your nonsense!`
` ...Did you appear only to sneer at me?!!"`
`"Don't be so full of yourself, furniture.`
` You aren't worth sneering at!`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` Still, though you may not be worth my time on your own, if the two of you are gathered, that's all I need.`
` ...The pleasure that comes from laughing at the fates of young couples never tires me."`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kan_2e426:`
`You don't mean...`
`...Milady is going to be..."`
`"I need 'two who are close' for the sacrifices of the second twilight.`
` ...The two of you truly are convenient...!!"`
`"......W-Wait...!`
` Don't misunderstand...!`
` Milady and I......`
`don't have that kind of relationship...!`
` We can't become the sacrifices for the second twilight!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` That's why you hurt Jessica.`
` That's why you cannot become human...!!"`
`"Then there should be no problem. If you won't admit you have feelings for Jessica, I can accept that.`
` ...But I will kill ~ib~her~ib~!!"`
`"Why?!"`
`"You idiot!!`
` Isn't it obvious?!!`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~It'll be fun to kill her and see your face twist in pain, why else~ib~`
`?!!"`
`"Following the rules of the ceremony, 13 people will be sacrificed on my whims.`
` However, there's no rule that says I can't kill more."`
`"...If it amuses me, I can kill any number of people!!`
` So I will!!`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~Make me laugh as hard as I can~ib~`
`, Kanonnnnnnnn the furrrrrrrrnituure!!"`
`At that time, Kanon definitely heard Jessica scream.`
`When he blinked and looked down the corridor, the witch who'd supposedly been there so nonchalantly just a second ago...was gone.`
`...At that moment, he was just standing there all alone in the corridor, doing nothing.`
`...And the person he wanted to protect was asking for help...from far away in that direction.`
`It was obvious what he should do.`
`It wasn't logical.`
` It was an electric reflex.`
`Without a trace of hesitation or distraction.`
`...There was a person he wanted to protect, and she was asking for help.`
`......And, at that moment, he genuinely wanted the person by her side to be him.`
`When he flew into Jessica's room, the scene that greeted his eyes was a bizarre one.`
`The room had become a fantastical world, where a blizzard of gold-colored specks danced, almost as though gold leaf had been scattered inside a snow globe.`
`......No, that's not it.`
`I've seen this spectacle before.`
`This isn't gold leaf.`
`...It's countless golden butterflies, Beatrice's minions!!`
`Jessica was surrounded by countless butterflies, waving her hands around, trying frantically to drive them away.`
`"Milady!!!"`
`"K-Kanon-kun, `
`...h-help... `
`...*cough*cough*cough*cough*!!"`
`Kanon rushed towards Jessica and violently brushed the cloud of butterflies away.`
`...The butterflies, which were sickening despite their beauty, surrounded Jessica's face, trying to crawl in through her mouth and nose.`
`Jessica choked violently.`
`...Almost as though the butterflies were triggering an asthma attack, mocking her.`
`But when Kanon ran towards her, the butterflies stopped attacking and began to dance an elegant rondo around the pair.`
`"......Kanon-kun, ...Kanon-kun......"`
`"...It's okay.`
` ......While there's still life in me, `
`...I won't let anyone lay a finger on you.`
` ......Come out, Beatrice!!`
` Are you happy now?!!"`
`As he stood guard in front of Jessica, who was using her inhaler and seemed to be in pain, Kanon yelled into the empty air.`
`...And when he did, the empty air did indeed laugh back, satisfied.`
`...Then, she showed herself.`
`It wasn't in response to Kanon's demand.`
`It was obviously because appearing and sneering would bring them even more humiliation, and plus, it was more fun!`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle* Ahahahaha!!`
` Now everything fits to the plot.`
` Now, you're carp on the chopping board.`
` No, since we've got a pair of you, should I call it duck with green onions?`
` Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"...Y-You, `
`...B-Beatrice...!!"`
`"Please, stand back.`
` ...I'll protect you, Milady...!"`
`"When the princess and knight come together, it's inevitable that the witch will appear.`
` ...Yes, why don't you show me how much power Kinzo's furniture can muster?"`
`She snapped her fingers with a piercing sound.`
`When she did, a blizzard of gold butterflies was stirred up, and they began to form a small mountain as they whirled around in a circle.`
`...It was just like the swirling of a cold, wintry wind that builds up a mountain of leaves.`
`From that mound of gold, a hand sprouted...and ~ib~it~ib~ appeared, ...as though a resident of the world below was crawling up from beneath the ground.`
`"...Wh-What is this...?`
` What the hell is this...?!"`
`Jessica couldn't comprehend what she was seeing right now, and her mouth kept flapping open and closed...`
`It was the bite of wisdom, seen in those trying to understand something incomprehensible.`
`That thing crawling up...was probably an attendant who served the witch.`
`It appeared to be wearing a uniform suitable for one who served.`
`...But its face was...wrong.`
` It looked...strange...`
`...It was covered with pitch-black hair, ...breathed rotten breath, and its eyes were filled with the same strange subterranean glow as lava.`
`...And, ......to symbolize its nonhuman status, ...it had two horns...`
` It was the figure of a goat-faced attendant who served the witch...`
`"............!!!"`
`By now, Jessica had no idea what she should say.`
`...All this happening in front of her couldn't be explained with common sense, and she couldn't do anything except open and close her mouth.`
`...Jessica hadn't realized.`
`...She hadn't realized that this island had already been cut off from the rules of our world.`
`But there were some things even she could understand...`
`...This goat attendant served the witch...and was after her life.`
`And apparently, the witch had already given it the order.`
`She was looking at Kanon with an expectant gaze.`
`...She looked at him with an expectant and therefore challenging gaze, as though asking him how he intended to protect this maiden!`
`Though the attendant had looked especially bestial while crawling to its feet, `
`you could see in the way it carried itself that it possessed more than enough grace to be worthy of serving the Golden Witch.`
`...And you could tell that it was overflowing with the joy of furniture wanting to meet its master's expectations.`
`"......Well then, why don't you show me?`
` Let's see the power of Kinzo's furniture!`
` This time, don't get the wrong idea, okay?`
` ...Don't forget that you're furniture, got it?`
` If you try to continue playing the human even now, this won't be settled by your death alone.`
` Hihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!"`
`The goat attendant made what seemed to be a silent, respectful bow.`
`Was it directed at its master, ...or was it offered to Kanon, its opponent?`
`Then, on the attendant's hand, ...a blade of wicked malice appeared...`
`'!s1`
`What the hell...`
`...is that......?"`
`Jessica had been unable to understand what was happening before her eyes for a while now.`
`...All she understood...was that this glow in front of her existed for the purpose of ending her life.`
`And right now, that was enough.`
`Kanon spoke quietly to Jessica, who was hiding behind his back.`
`"...Milady,`
` ...please stay back against the wall.`
` ...Never let your back leave the wall."`
`"Wha...?!"`
`"...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` It's only right for the maiden to obediently hide behind the great knight's back.`
` I do hope you enjoy the pleasure of having your life protected by a man.`
` ...Now!`
` Kanon, let's have a look at your blade!!"`
`"............"`
`"...Beautiful.`
` ...At least when it comes to giving birth to furniture, Kinzo might even reach up as far as my feet."`
`"...A thing like this...can't even be used to trim the roses."`
`".........K-Kanon-kun, `
`.........what's......"`
`"......I didn't want...to show you."`
`"So, you've taken it out.`
` ......How does it feel to expose your subhumanity in front of the girl you care for?"`
`".........Be silent."`
`"...Hmph.`
` ...So, you'll act composed, even though you're really burning with wrath?`
` ...Yes, they do say that truly hot flames burn a cool blue.`
` Is that how you are now?"`
`"There's no way I can kill you with my power.`
` ...You are the moon.`
` I could never smash the moon by throwing a rock.`
` ...However, in order to manifest yourself, you've had to reflect your image off the surface of the water."`
`If you throw a rock at the surface of the water, you might be able to disturb the moon's image for some time.`
`...But that doesn't mean the moon has been smashed.`
`"So.`
` ...Until this life of mine is over, `
`...I'll keep on striking your reflection...!"`
`"I like it, Kanon!!`
` Begin, furniture!!"`
`"......Hoh.`
` .........What a beautiful curve."`
`The witch's words of admiration broke the silence, and for just an instant, they broke Jessica's paralysis.`
`'!s1`
`A`
`-Am I...`
`dreaming......?"`
`"......Come,`
` furniture of the witch.`
` ......I'll beat you down to the hell you came from."`
`"............"`
`A strand of red had been left on Kanon's cheek.`
`...The witch saw this and grinned broadly...`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` ...Feel free to mutter excuses about how your instincts still haven't returned quite yet."`
`"............"`
`"...K-Kanon-kun, ......stay strong...!"`
`"......It's okay.`
` ......I...won't die just yet."`
`The curve drawn by the goat attendant's blade...drew a large arc in empty space.`
`...Kanon...wasn't there.`
`...He was behind it.`
`"......Go back and await your master's return.`
` ...Die."`
`If this battle of drawing sparkling curves was chess...`
`...Then Kanon coming from behind was check.`
`And press, and press, and press, and press.`
`Use seven moves, and make it mate...!`
`...Perhaps the goat attendant hadn't even been granted the ability to go into death throes.`
`...As its knees buckled and it fell over, it broke into a bunch of gold butterflies with a pop...`
`So there was no sound of it hitting the ground.`
`Even those unable to understand this battle...would surely realize that Kanon had been magnificent.`
`"...Hmph.`
` So, it couldn't win against a handmade piece.`
` ...It seems you aren't quite that pathetic."`
`"You're next, ......Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiice!!"`
`The instant Kanon's blade sliced diagonally through the witch's form like a knife through butter, she turned gold and burst.`
`...She scattered into several thousand gold butterflies, and for just an instant, the room was filled with the color of twilight.`
`...It was just as Kanon himself had said.`
`Slicing Beatrice was just the same as slicing the surface of the water where the moon was reflected.`
`...The witch's form, with an ordinary expression on its face, as though she'd been there the whole time, ...was right behind Kanon.`
`"Hahahahahahaha...!!`
` You've provided quite an entertaining show.`
` Out of respect for that, I thought about letting you off the hook, but your rudeness now has made me change my mind..."`
`"Don't lie!`
` I won't let you kill Milady!!`
` ...Even if that's impossible, ...I won't let you kill her while I still live!"`
`"You can't even do that much.`
` Do not speak, furniture.`
` Be silent, furniture.`
` Know your place, furniture!!"`
`"...K-Kanon-kun isn't furniture...!"`
`"...Hoh.`
` ...And what makes you think that?"`
`"I don't need a reason.`
` ...Kanon-kun is Kanon-kun.`
` No, his real name's different, ...but a name doesn't make him furniture!`
` Kanon-kun has his own way of living.`
` That's a noble thing, and it's something he gets to decide for himself."`
`"...You say he can't have an opinion because he's furniture, that he can't live his own life because he's furniture?! That's wrong!!"`
`"Milady, ...you mustn't provoke her."`
`"No, I've gotta make this clear.`
` ......Kanon-kun isn't furniture.`
` He's human.`
` ...Why?`
` Kanon-kun rushed to save me of his own free will.`
` And he stood in the path of a fearsome witch like you.`
` He had so many chances to just let me go, but he didn't."`
`"......Self-sacrifice is part of the noble spirit that only humans have!!`
` That means Kanon-kun's human!!`
` So take it back!`
` Don't you call Kanon-kun furniture again!!"`
`"......Mila...dy......"`
`"Hmph.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` ...Kuhahahahahahahahahahahahaha.`
` Wahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"Be silent, human!!`
` Let's end this quickly, since this is still just the second twilight, after all.`
` Now, I shall sacrifice 'the two who are close', who have acknowledged each other's dignity."`
`"Well then, arise, forgive the sin, ...one of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, Lust!!!"`
`The witch summoned her furniture with a mixture of laughter and anger on her face.`
`"...Asmodeus of Lust, `
`right here."`
`"I've had enough of this farce.`
` Quickly, execute the second twilight.`
` ...Don't keep me waiting, got it?"`
`"...As you command."`
`"...A-Another weirdo's shown up..."`
`"............Ngg..."`
`It took Kanon less than an instant to understand.`
`...That goat-face from a second ago had been nothing more than a pawn to the witch.`
`However, this newly summoned furniture was a game piece with a vastly different value.`
`"...Wow, I must be lucky to be given such wonderful prey.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*giggle* You scared?`
` How cuuute.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`".........Come,`
` furniture of the witch...`
` I won't be killed by you...!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*!`
` You're acting pretty smart for a dunce who can't even follow me with his eyes."`
`"...Here I go, 'kay?`
` ...Hey hey, where do you want it?`
` Where do you want me to pierce you?`
` Answer me, cutie.`
` I'll pierce you good wherever you want...!!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle* Come on, answer me, cutie...!"`
`"D-Don't call me cute!!!"`
`"Kyahahahahaha!!`
` Here I go, you dunce!!`
` Come on, try and follow me, you blind idiot!!`
` Kya-hahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"......M-Milady......"`
`"Heh, ......I couldn't follow it with my eyes...`
` But my guess...was spot on......`
` Serves you...right......"`
`Kanon's back had been the target.`
`...But Jessica had predicted it.`
`She'd predicted that the witch's target would be the complete opposite of fair and honest: his back.`
`But she had no way to block it.`
`...She hadn't planned on it being some act of self-sacrifice.`
` She just couldn't think of any other way to protect Kanon's back.`
`......So, she could do nothing but block it with her own back.`
`The furniture of the witch, which had changed its form into a demon's stake, was buried deep into Jessica's back.`
`...It was an obviously fatal wound that reached as far as her lungs.`
`When she saw this, the witch let out a loud, evil laugh.`
`Because it had hit 'where the witch had predicted'.`
` ...Everything, everything...was as the witch had predicted!`
`"What's wrong Kanonnn...?`
` 'Milady Jessica' just got killed while you still live, didn't she??"`
`"Hihihihihihihi, yes, yes, that's it, that's it, that face, that look on your face is what I wanted to see!!`
` Hihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!`
` How truly enjoyable!!`
` That's enough, die, die, make me laugh!!"`
`'!s1`
`one of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, `
`Wrath!!"`
`"...Satan of Wrath,`
` right here."`
`"This prey is yours.`
` Eat him up right now, and close the curtain on his stage."`
`"...If you were a human, I'd say it's time for you to step down, but since you're furniture, maybe I should say it's time for the stage manager to carry you behind the stage!"`
`".........I am not...furniture anymore.`
` I won't...doubt that again!"`
`"...*giggle*giggle* Oh, what's this?`
` You wanna be killed by me again?"`
`"Your chest... It's so warm, and it feels so good to pierce it...`
` Come on, let me have another taste, okay...?`
` Won't you make me feel really good with that hot fresh blood in that warm chest of yours...?"`
`"...Kyahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"`
`There was no way to block it.`
`'!s0`
`...and before he could blink, `
`...it was already right in the center of his chest...`
`When you take a piece in chess, the rules say that it's impossible for your opponent's piece to defend itself.`
`So this was an obvious result, in accordance with the rules.`
`Kanon landed on his knees...`
`And, he apologized.`
`...Not to the witch.`
`...And not to 'Milady'.`
`......He apologized...to Jessica.`
`"...I'm sorry......`
` ...I couldn't...protect you......"`
`"......Don't worry about it...`
` ...You were really...cool..."`
`Kanon finally fell over.`
`...He landed next to Jessica, and the two lay there like the constellation Gemini.`
`"...You know, Kanon-kun, `
`......you aren't...furniture anymore..."`
`"...Yes.`
` ......I was...`
`...too late...`
`...in realizing that..."`
`"I wanted to ask you...`
`...what your real name was..."`
`'!s1`
`...real name is...`
`...`
` ...Ah, `
`......aaaaaaaaah...ah..."`
`In his last moments, Kanon wanted to tell her his real name.`
`...But...Jessica had already fallen into a sleep from which she would never wake...`
`So, Kanon's real name, which he had protected until today...`
` ......In the end, `
`...he couldn't...tell it to Jessica...`
`'!s1`
`......became...`
`...hu...ma......"`
`Those...were the last words Kanon left behind.`
`"Wahahahahahahahahaha, hihihihihahahahahahahahahahahahahh!!`
` Don't make me laugh, furniture!!`
` Even after a hundred years, furniture will still be furniture!`
` Have you ever heard of anyone stupid enough to dig a grave for their furniture when they throw it away?`
` You smash furniture to pieces and make firewood, so all that's left is ashes!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle That's how it is: furniture gets no tombstone!`
` ...It seems you believe death means an end to your humiliation, but that's naive...`
` I'll show you what it really means to disgrace the dead.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!!"`
`After taking a puff from her pipe, the witch breathed the smoke at Kanon's corpse...`
`...When she did, Kanon's corpse softly floated up into the air...and disappeared as though it had been eaten by a mouth in empty space.`
`The witch played dirty until the very end.`
`...The corpses of the pair who managed to understand each other in the end...were not even permitted to be close...`
`If someone had been watching, they would probably say mournfully 'So this is what you meant by disgracing the dead.'`
`...However, Beatrice was far crueler than that...`
`...The reason for that would soon become apparent...`
`"......I see.`
` So it has begun."`
`"...Yes."`
`"............"`
`Even though Kinzo had received news of six deaths, his emotions did not waver.`
`The expression on his face as he gazed out the window...was a smile, as though his opponent in a chess game had just made a spectacular move.`
`...It was hard to imagine that such an expression could ever appear on a father who had lost so many children at once.`
`"...Gohda and Kanon followed Rosa-sama's orders and went to call the police.`
` After that, she ordered us to follow your orders, Master...`
` ...What shall we do?"`
`"......This island has already been cut off from the real world.`
` Mere phones will serve no purpose."`
`"Should I have them stop?"`
`"...Until the roulette is finished, what they do to pass the time is up to them.`
` Let them do as they please."`
`"......Yes sir."`
`"...Umm, `
`...what we should tell Rosa-sama?"`
`"Didn't I say they should pass the time as they pleased?!!`
` They can sing if they want, dance if they want!`
` They're even free to hang themselves by the neck or jump into a boiling kettle!!`
` Until 13 people die, they can spend their time as they like.`
` If that's too boring, then they can wonder about whether#fefefe 6x9=42#ffffff, or something!!`
` That's the answer to the mystery of humanity and the universe!!"`
`"Y-Yes...!`
` M-My apologies...!"`
`Shannon cowered in fright at this sudden rage.`
`...Genji made a gesture as though telling her not to speak out of turn.`
`Shannon couldn't help but regret saying too much...`
`"However, `
`...you two are also free to do as you wish.`
` ...Genji.`
` And Shannon too.`
` You have done well serving me until today."`
`"Y-Your words are too good for me, `
`...but, umm......"`
`"......We are furniture who have sworn to serve the Master.`
` ...We stand ready to serve you no matter the time.`
` ...Until the very end."`
`"......`
`'!s1`
`about everything.`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, kin_2e153:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kin_2e154:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kin_2e155:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kin_2e156:`
`"Huh...?`
` ......Y-Yes sir...!"`
`Nanjo often recommended that Kinzo write a will because of his health, but each time he had, Kinzo had gone mad with rage.`
`...Ever since then, you'd think 'will' would've been the word Kinzo hated most.`
`After hearing such a word come from his lips, Shannon couldn't help doubting her ears for an instant.`
`Shannon hurriedly prepared the side table and some writing paper.`
`Genji followed his orders and began preparing that usual green, evil drink...`
`"I'm ready."`
`"......Hmm.`
` ......Where should I begin?`
` ...Shall I also speak of my life?`
` ...It would be fun to leave behind a record of my most memorable games.`
` ......It can be truly amusing to read the records of old games from centuries past, ...to journey in search of those players' thoughts.`
` ......So, should the game record of my life lead those in the future to go on a journey in search for my thoughts?`
` ...Hmph."`
`For a while, Kinzo pondered over where he should begin, strutting all over the room with his hands behind his back...`
`"Master,`
` ......here."`
`"Ah, yes.`
` Thank you, my friend.`
` ......Well then.`
` If I am to speak of my life, I must begin by writing of my meeting with that witch.`
` ...Shannon, begin writing.`
` ...My first meeting with Beatrice took place a long way back.`
` What year of the Showa era was it...?`
` ...It must have been...at the end of the war, so..."`
`We took enough time to regain our calm, `
`......and we each swore to our parents that we'd catch the culprit.`
`It would be a lie to say we weren't still torn up.`
`...Even now, if we let our guards down just a little, we'd probably start going on a rampage just like Jessica, letting our emotions show with some kind of violence.`
`According to what Gohda-san said after he got back, right now, Kanon-kun was looking after Jessica.`
`...Apparently, she was still very emotionally high-strung.`
`"...I see.`
` Thank you.`
` ...Maybe a young kid would be better at understanding a young kid's feelings.`
` ...It would probably be better if we left them alone for now."`
`"Rosa-san, `
`...there is nothing more to be gained by remaining here.`
` ...The phones may not be working, but tomorrow, the boat will come, and we should be able to reach the police.`
` We should leave this place as it is for the police's investigation."`
`"...I agree with Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...Staying in a place like this for too long will be bad for your health.`
` ...Let us return and make some black tea..."`
`"......Yeah.`
` ...I agree with that.`
` ...Battler-kun, George-kun, are you ready...?`
` Let's lock up here.`
` We ought to leave this place as it is anyway, for when the police come."`
`"You're right.`
` ......Battler-kun, ...are you okay...?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...I've cried all I can.`
` ...I'm fine now."`
`The police would surely find some evidence during their thorough investigation.`
`...But we weren't adult enough to wait for that.`
`...I'd investigated the chapel in my own way, trying to grab the culprit before the police arrived.`
`...And what I figured out was...absolutely nothing, frustratingly.`
`...I wasn't able to find a single hint.`
`"Come on, ...let's go out.`
` ...Maria, we're going.`
` ...Don't keep staring at it...!"`
`"...Uu-."`
`"Come, come, Maria-sama.`
` Let us return...`
` It's cold here."`
`"......Father, Mother.`
` ...Thank you for everything.`
` I will...definitely become a man who doesn't betray your expectations..."`
`George spoke his last words of farewell to his parents.`
`...After seeing that, Battler followed suit.`
`"...Dad, Kyrie-san."`
`Just looking at their faces, ...it looked like they were sleeping, ...but that just made it even more painful...`
`"......Forgive me for leaving you in a cold place like this...`
` ......I'll definitely get whoever did this...`
` No matter what..."`
`"...What is...this?`
` What a repulsive scribble...`
` Did the culprit draw it?"`
`"This is worse than vulgar...`
` ...How horrible..."`
`When the door to the chapel was closed, we learned about that creepy scribble for the first time.`
`"When we first found this, it was already drawn here.`
` ...It must have been made by the culprit..."`
`"...So supposedly, the culprit was a witch, and this is a magic circle to summon a demon or something...?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihi...`
` This is the seventh magic circle of the sun.`
` Don't you even know that...?`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` Ouch."`
`"Hey!!`
` Don't I always tell you not to make that creepy laugh?!!"`
`"Maria, go on.`
` ...What does it mean?"`
`"It's a magic circle to escape from physical or mental bonds.`
` ...And the part written around the circumference says, 'The Lord has freed me from my chains.`
` I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call on the name of the Lord', in Hebrew."`
`"...Sacrifice of thanksgiving...?`
` So, they killed Father and the rest to use them as human sacrifices for this magic circle...?!"`
`"Calm down, George-kun...!`
` This is the culprit trying to provoke us.`
` ...I'm sure it doesn't mean anything.`
` Thinking about it will only poison the heart."`
`"...And, looks like there's some English written here.`
` ...<Happy Halloween for...Maria>.`
` ...I get it.`
` And the key to open this door was handed over to Maria... ...Is that what's going on?"`
`"...Well, this is the chapel, after all.`
` Maybe Maria doesn't mean Maria-chan, but the Virgin Mary.`
` ...In that case, you could read this as a blasphemy against God, in the name of Halloween.`
` They say witches who make contracts with demons swear to defile God's name at all times.`
` ...In that sense, this really is a witch-like crime."`
`"...Sounds like you know a lot about it.`
` ...Did you get that from Maria?"`
`"...Yeah, something like that."`
`"The chapel, huh?`
` ...They went to all the trouble of calling them out here and killing them...`
` ......Aunt Rosa,`
` does this chapel have some special meaning...?"`
`"What do you mean, ...a special meaning?"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"Well, umm, `
`......someone carried six human corpses all the way over here and set up these elaborate decorations.`
` ...We can't tell if she called the six of them over here before killing them, or if she killed them before carrying them over here, `
`...but either way, it'd take a lot of effort...`
` Why did the culprit `
`~ib~want six people to die here~ib~`
`...?"`
`"...True.`
` By doing something that elaborate, there would be an extremely high chance of some disadvantageous evidence being found when the police arrive.`
` ...It is inconceivable that the culprit would fail to realize this.`
` ...The issue now...`
`is why the culprit went to all that effort..."`
`"And that leads us to just one question.`
` ...What meaning is there to this place, where we found the six corpses?"`
`"...This chapel...was important to Father.`
` ...Ever since I was a kid, I was given strict instructions never to enter it."`
`"Uu-.`
` ...I came here once too, got in lots of trouble...`
` Uu-..."`
`"An important chapel...?`
` ...Does it have some connection to the Ushiromiya Head Family...?"`
`"I don't know.`
` ...Father viewed this chapel as very sacred, and he treasured it so much that he had it redecorated several times.`
` ...But as everyone knows, `
`Father wasn't a devout believer, as his passion for black magic demonstrates.`
` ...I've never heard of him coming here to offer his prayers to God."`
`"...As far as I know, the Master has never come here.`
` We even call this 'the sealed chapel', ...and, umm,`
` I found it eerie, like a haunted house."`
`"Even though Father even never approached it himself, for some reason, he made the servants give it a major cleaning several times a year.`
` It felt like he kept it clean all the time so that it could be used at any moment."`
`"And even so, it's called the 'sealed chapel'...`
` ...Ihihi!`
` Maybe it's indiscreet to say this, but doesn't that sound pretty cool?`
` Doctor Nanjo, you're an old friend of Grandfather's, right?`
` Have you heard anything about it?"`
`"......I did ask about it once long ago, but I forget exactly how he dodged my question.`
` ...That's right, I believe he said something like...`
`...someday, perhaps I too will be able to receive a blessing there.`
` But unless a miracle occurs, that day will never come."`
`"What does that mean?`
` ......What would he do in a chapel?`
` He couldn't mean his own funeral, right?"`
`"I wouldn't believe that of Kinzo-san.`
` ...He was a man much more focused on the living now than matters occuring after death.`
` ......Though, this does seem to be root cause of the current inheritance problem."`
`"Then what would he do in a chapel?`
` ......Pray?`
` Aren't confessions done in a chapel too?`
` .........Anyway, it sounds suspicious."`
`"...I don't know the reason, `
`...but just as Doctor Nanjo said, in Grandfather's eyes, `
`...all this about not being blessed unless a miracle occurred... was set in stone as far back as this chapel's construction."`
`"How do you know that...?"`
`"See, ...it's clearly written over there.`
` ...Look, right there."`
`George-aniki pointed to a relief with rusted gold letters on the arch above the door.`
`It looked like some message had been written there in English.`
`...The rust made it clear that the message had been there ever since the chapel's construction.`
`"......I'm not that good with English.`
` ...What is it...?`
` ...<This door is...opened...only at...probability of>??`
` Sorry, my English sucks."`
`I gave up after failing to finish even the first of the two lines.`
`...It looked like the others could read it properly.`
`"...Umm, I think it went 'm', 'b', 't', 'q', so, `
`...umm, umm...how many did that mean, I think...umm...hmmm...`
`......`
` ...Anyway, this is incredible.`
` Adding up all the fingers on both hands doesn't even get you close.`
` It really would be impossible unless a miracle occurred."`
`"...Certainly.`
` It's quite reminiscent of the old Kinzo-san, who loved using gambling as a metaphor whenever he got the chance."`
`"Hey, come on, can everyone read it?`
` Someone tell me what it means too."`
`"Kihihihihihihi.`
` ...You've gotta at least learn English.`
` How did you get into high school without even being able to read this much?`
` Kihihihihihihihihihi, `
`ouch.`
` Ouch`
`ouch`
`ouch."`
`"Mind your own business.`
` So, what's written there?"`
`"...Simply put, it means something like this:`
` 'Unless a miracle occurs, this door will never be opened.`
` Unless a miracle occurs, you will never be blessed'."`
`"...Grandfather's magic is based on astronomically low probabilities.`
` ...In other words, a miracle for opening this door...would probably require an incredibly vast amount of magical power.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` Ouch."`
`"Nice job, you can shut up now.`
` Rosa-san, did you have Maria take English classes?`
` Looks like it's useless to try and learn English unless you start when you're young after all."`
`"......The sealed chapel, huh?`
` ...Setting aside whether she was a witch or not, it's rumored that Beatrice actually existed several decades ago...`
`and was Grandfather's mistress."`
`"This is, umm, just my imagination, `
`...but perhaps the Master truly did love Beatrice-sama.`
` However, he was already married, so they couldn't be united."`
`"...I see.`
` ......If Beatrice was dead and could be revived with the magic of a miracle, then now that Grandmother's dead, he could marry her openly.`
` And if they married in this chapel, ......you might end up with a pretty fairy tale-like story, right?"`
`"...I don't think that story is so preposterous.`
` ...It's a well-known fact that Father still loves Beatrice deeply.`
` ...Also, even though I said I found it creepy,`
` I seem to remember that the interior of the chapel was quite magnificent.`
` ......The thought that Father built this chapel in the hopes of having a wedding with his dead mistress...might not be that unlikely."`
`"...By the time he built this chapel, Grandfather probably knew that he would never use it as a church as long as he lived.`
` ...But, he prayed for the witch to be revived by some miracle.`
` And he thought that if that miracle occurred, they could be married here..."`
`"...I see.`
` ...If you think of it that way, this would be a place of utmost significance to Beatrice-sama as well...`
` Even though he knew the chapel would never be opened.`
` ...It's a story of tragic love."`
`Even though Gohda-san was even bigger than me, his words were touching.`
`...Everyone was silent, but it seemed that they agreed with that view.`
`"Even though he knew it was a chapel never to be opened,`
` ...he still probably dreamed of the day that a miracle would occur.`
` ......Kinzo-san was quite the romantic in his younger days.`
` I think I understand how he felt."`
`"Ihihi.`
` I wonder.`
` ...Then again, everyone went in it four times a year to clean, right?`
` So much for it being 'the sealed chapel'.`
` Didn't we just go in ourselves?`
` That wasn't a miracle or anything.`
` We brought the key, click, and we're in.`
` That's all. This is ridiculous."`
`".........Huh?`
` ......What?!`
` .........Then, ......what does that mean?"`
`"Wh-What are you talking about...?"`
`As far as I could tell, I'd just been joking around, finding myself a bit irritated by the sob story this was turning into.`
`...But then Aunt Rosa suddenly jumped on me, with a really serious face.`
`Aunt Rosa's face grew increasingly pale.`
`...She looked at the magic circle on the door, and then at her hand, back and forth, back and forth.`
`"...Wh-What is the matter, Rosa-sama...?"`
`"Hey, Gohda-san!`
` The key to this chapel!`
` Didn't Genji-san say it?`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~He said there was only one~ib~`
`!"`
`".........Huh?`
` ........."`
`"...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` ...It took you all way too long to figure it out.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`...When a kid pulls a prank, it sometimes goes unnoticed by the adults, and the kid who did it gets all disappointed.`
`...If such a prank then gets sprung on someone much later, it can really make a kid's day.`
`...Maria's celebration just now looked a lot like that...`
`"...U-Um, yes, that's right.`
` There is only one of those keys.`
` It's the key to the Master's treasured chapel, so there is only one, with no duplicates.`
` ...It is normally kept safe in the key box in the servant room, but..."`
`"That's right.`
` And Genji-san said it had gone missing.`
` ...So, someone stole it, ...put it in an envelope, and handed it to Maria?!`
` And they did it yesterday!"`
`"......What the...?`
` So in other words, `
`......isn't that strange?"`
`"...That's absurd.`
` ......This is getting bizarre."`
`"Wh-What do you mean...?`
` I don't have a clue what you're talking about..."`
`"Me neither.`
` ...Would you explain it for us...?"`
`...Gohda and Nanjo's failure to understand definitely wasn't because they were stupid.`
`...They didn't know.`
`...They didn't know how long the only key to the chapel had been in Maria's possession.`
`"There's no mistake!`
` It was locked up!!`
` I unlocked it!!`
` There's no doubt!!"`
`Aunt Rosa kept closing the door, locking it, pulling on it to check the lock, and opening it again.`
`Her face was becoming pale again...`
`"Until I took the key out of Maria's envelope and opened this door,`
` it was definitely locked!!`
` But this key was in an envelope placed in Maria's care!`
` And that happened yesterday before noon!!!"`
`"......What did you say......?"`
`"But that...doesn't make any sense...!"`
`"You're right.`
` ......Maria received a one-of-a-kind key from a woman calling herself a witch midday yesterday.`
` In other words, from midday yesterday until this morning, when Rosa-san unlocked the door, this chapel was a closed room."`
`"......How did they get those six people in here, and then how did they kill them?!"`
`The deaths of six people had shaken us badly.`
`When we learned about that weird magic circle and the history of the chapel, we felt as though we'd figured at least part of this puzzle out.`
`...But that was all absolutely trivial!`
`From midday yesterday until this morning, this chapel was a closed room.`
`But our parents were with us until last night.`
`How did the culprit get into this building?!`
`And how did they lock it up again?!`
`"...What are you trying to pull?`
` ...Again?`
` A closed room again?!`
` Are you trying to say you unlocked it with the power of magic?!!`
` Don't take me for a fool!!"`
`"If you're demanding that I show you how to open locks with my power, I wouldn't mind.`
` ...But that wouldn't be the same as me forcing you to surrender."`
`"You keep trying to 'explain it all with humans'!`
` Only when I've cornered all your theories completely...will I have my victory!!`
` Come now, how will you undermine my defenses?`
` What trick could a human have used to defeat them, hmm?"`
`"It's just like the closed rooms last time.`
` ...Not enough information!!`
` It's impossible to reason like this!`
` Any excuse could be made, any trick could work!!`
` There's no way to reason it out!"`
`"Ha!`
` That again?`
` There's not enough information, so you'll wait and see?`
` Your information is uncertain, so it's impossible to use your reasoning...?`
` Ha, this is always the excuse you humans use to let yourselves stop thinking.`
` Who do you think you are, lowly human?!"`
`"Are you saying you can't even think unless you're like Laplace's demon, you incompetent fool?!!`
` ...Besides, you make it seem like a lack of information works against you, but it's the other way around, you see?"`
`"The more information you're given, the more it will make you suffer!`
` It'll only increase the strength of the compressor that's squeezing you!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"Oh, in that case, let me say this.`
` It's impossible to verify that this is a closed room in the first place!!`
` If we're already talking about demons, I can play that game too."`
`"...It'd be possible to prove that this ~ib~isn't~ib~ a closed room.`
` Just show how someone could've gone in or out, and you're done!"`
`"But it's impossible to prove that this ~ib~is~ib~ a closed room!!`
` You could never deny the endless set of possible methods for getting in.`
` In other words, this is one of those Devil's Proofs!!`
` This concept of a closed room is actually something that can never be proved!!"`
`"So, first you stop thinking, with a lack of information as an excuse, and now this.`
` ...Very well.`
` If that is your move, then I will accept it.`
` Continue."`
`"First off, it looks like you're trying to claim that the chapel's a closed room.`
` ...Just a short while ago, I spent some time looking around in there, and I couldn't find any way in or out except for the door."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"...But that ~ib~just means I couldn't find one~ib~.`
` It doesn't prove it was a closed room!!"`
`"If there's a 'hidden door' or something that I wasn't able to find, your premise would be blown away completely!!`
` In other words, whether I managed to find a hidden door or not, you'll never be able to deny that there existed some method X that'd let you into the closed room!"`
`"And this method X would be something that could be carried out without magic.`
` After all, it's a 'hidden door'!`
` I'm sure that in this chapel, there's some hidden door that's impossible to find.`
` That's why there's no reason for me to reason it out, and magic is still impossible!!"`
`"......Hohoh, so you'll use that logic.`
` *cackle*cackle* How naive.`
` An expected move.`
` Let me make my move in response.`
` ...These 'closed rooms' used in detective novels made by mere humans always seem utterly ridiculous to me."`
`"Why?`
` Because they're used the wrong way.`
` ...When a closed room appears in a detective novel, do you really think it's a closed room?`
` You don't, do you?!"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"~ib~What trick did they use to make this look like a closed room~ib~`
`?!`
` That's what you think."`
`"In other words, there hasn't been a completed closed room in the any of closed room murders that humans have built over the last century!!"`
`"Oooh!!`
` Better not say that, unless you wanna face the wrath of the mystery fans!`
` Christie's probably grinding her teeth in her grave!"`
`"Hmph!!`
` But I am different.`
` I have given birth to a true closed room!`
` And I can demonstrate it.`
` Why?`
` Because I am a witch!!"`
`"For the Devil's Proof, you only had to bring someone a demon to prove that they exist, correct?`
` Well, I conveniently happen to be a witch, meaning that demons are my good friends, and I can bring you as many of them as you like!!"`
`"Sounds great!!`
` 'Dad and the rest used a hidden door to enter the chapel or were carried in through it'!`
` How do you plan to beat that move?!"`
`"With this.`
` Regardless of whether they were alive or dead, `
`'the six definitely entered through the door'!!"`
`"Huh?!?!`
` Dumbass!!`
` The door was locked, so how'd they do it?!!"`
`"I opened it with magic and invited them inside!!"`
`"That can't be true!!`
` Since I can't accept magic, there's no way I'll accept that!!`
` You're lying!!`
` That door can be opened with some trick.`
` Or maybe there's a hidden door, but I won't accept any other way!!"`
`"...Perpetual check!!`
` That's what we call an endless repetition of moves in chess.`
` It's the same endless repetition as a discussion that won't advance because both sides deny the basis of each other's claims, like our game.`
` ...In most games, this would be resolved as a draw, but that would put a terrible damper on our fun!!`
` We will have no draws.`
` You will either accept me and submit to me, or you will deny me!!"`
`"At least I agree with you there!!`
` We'll settle this without fail, just as you wish!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` I like that attitude!`
` ......So, I had a thought.`
` I think I'll add a new rule to this game between the two of us."`
`"A new rule?!`
` ...I'll bet it's something that'll give you an advantage, right?!"`
`"Of course not.`
` I'll give you the thing people like you always demand.`
` The reason you always stop thinking and then moan about it...is 'a lack of information'!`
` And if you are then given information, you start doubting whether the information is true or not by 'rejecting the source'!"`
`"Isn't that convenient?`
` What clever little words to hide your own incompetence.`
` I'm offering to eliminate that convenient excuse of yours.`
` You should thank me, *cackle*!"`
`"You said they entered through the door, and I said that couldn't happen.`
` ...Are you calling that an evasive answer?"`
`"Exactly.`
` So from now on, `
`when I speak the truth, I will use red`
`."`
`"Wh-What is this...?!`
` Keep explaining!"`
`"No matter what magical move I use, `
`you can always keep running away by chanting 'lack of information' and by 'rejecting the source'."`
`"...Even though I would still win in the end that way, it would be extremely boring.`
` ...Because of that, I'd be happy to I give you the 'information' and 'sources' you so desire."`
`"However, you'll probably doubt each word I say.`
` That isn't bad in itself.`
` I also will use every possible move to make you submit.`
` I don't dislike our posture of searching out our best moves for our own goals."`
`"...But that won't make a game.`
` So I set up this rule."`
`"#ff0000Everything I speak in red is the truth#ffffff!`
` There's absolutely no need to doubt it!"`
`"Are you telling me to believe that...?!"`
`"This is a game between you and me.`
` In a game, the rules are sacred!!`
` Those who take that lightly are not qualified to play!!"`
`"Okay, I get you, I'll accept that rule!!`
` Even an elementary school kid can get into an endless argument and find fault with everything.`
` Then let's start it up again, continuing where we left off.`
` I'll say it one more time.`
` 'Dad and the rest used a hidden door to enter the chapel or were carried in through it'!"`
`"Then I shall repeat what I said.`
` '#ff0000Regardless of whether they were alive or dead, `
`the six definitely entered through the door#ffffff'!"`
`"......I-Is there any proof?!"`
`"Stop!!`
` I will supplement the rule."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"...When I speak the truth, I will use red,`
` ~ib~and when I do, I will not bear the responsibility of establishing that claim by showing proof~ib~!`
` They will simply be facts and the truth!!"`
`"My reason is simple.`
` I carried out all the crimes with magic.`
` So for any impossible crime, all I have to do is wave my magic staff and show you how it's done."`
`"But that wouldn't make a game!`
` It would be as barbaric as ignoring victory and defeat in a chess match and punching your opponent in the face!"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"...W-Well, that makes sense.`
` ...Since you're a witch, `
`~ib~there's no need for you to show evidence for what happened~ib~.`
` ...Since you can do anything with magic, dammit...`
` Talk about an unfair game...!"`
`"So, shall we resume once more?`
` The six definitely entered through the door.`
` I unlocked it with magic.`
` ...How will you get around this magic, this closed room?!"`
`"...Th-The key!`
` Genji-san and the others said there was only one key, but that's impossible to prove!`
` The culprit secretly made a duplicate key...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` #ff0000Only one key to the chapel exists#ffffff!"`
`"Arg...`
` Th-Then what about this.`
` The culprit made something other than a legitimate key and opened it!`
` I don't know what, but maybe a wire!`
` A tool for picking locks!!"`
`"What is this naive move?`
` #ff0000It is impossible to unlock the lock to the chapel with any thing but the chapel's key#ffffff!!`
` Although it can be opened with the power of magic, right...?"`
`"Then what about this!!`
` There's something wrong with the door itself!`
` There was some way to pass through it even while it was locked...!`
` As to what that is, I can think of a few ways!`
` Maybe it's like those big doors on a castle that have a smaller door in them!`
` It's also possible that they removed the hinges, and then removed the whole door before entering!!"`
`"Wahahahahahahahahahaha!`
` Is ~ib~this~ib~ the best a century of human wisdom can manage, Battleeeeeeer?!`
` #ff0000When the door to the chapel is locked, it prevents any and all methods of entry or exit#ffffff!!`
` Assuming you can't use magic, right...?`
` *cackle*!`
` Is it about time for checkmate?!"`
`"Not even close!!`
` You said those six people entered through a door, but you didn't say it was the front door!`
` They might've entered through another door, a secret one!!"`
`"You talk too much, you incompetent fool.`
` Then let me expand on my earlier move.`
` #ff0000The six definitely entered through 'this front door'#ffffff!!"`
`"That's screwed up!!`
` The door was locked, it was impossible to unlock without using that single key, and yet six people entered through it?!?!`
` How?!!`
` With magic, you say?!`
` Damn it, dammit dammit dammit dammit dammit!!!"`
`"Wahahahahahahaaah!!`
` Are we already seeing the limits of what humanity can manage?"`
`"Then shout that you resign!!`
` When one admits defeat, it's customary to shout it out and knock over their own king.`
` So, do you resign?!`
` Then announce your surrender and knock your king over by kneeling!!`
` Then you may kiss my shoes!`
` There could be no greater joy than forcing a man like you to lick my shoes, *cackle*cackle*cackle*kakakakakakakaka!!"`
`......Damn iiiiiiiiit...`
`It's useless, useless, useless...`
`So I can't win against the witch...?!`
`This isn't chess at all, I've just been made to take the losing side in a chess puzzle...!`
` Is quibbling about details and getting a draw the best I can manage...?`
`"That's the one thing that'll never happen...!`
` Either I will surrender, or you will!!`
` There can be no other resolution!!`
` What happened to that bravery you displayed when you said this would be torture for us both?!"`
`"Hey, hey, hey, what a disappointment, what a total let doooooown,`
` wouldn't you say, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeer...????"`
`Damn iiiiiiiiiiiit, what should I do, what should I do?!!`
` I can see it, I can see the place where I'll face checkmate...!!`
`Aaaaaaaaah, it's useless it's useless, all my hard-fought moves have been nothing more than me desperately moving my king around, running away from check.`
`...No matter how many times I move, I can't escape from check.`
` So even without waiting for the next several moves, I can see checkmate in my future!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit......!!`
`......After a few more moves, ...I can see where I'll face...checkmate...?`
`............`
`...Don't give up, Ushiromiya Battler.`
`If I can see myself getting closed in upon...`
`...Then if I spin the chessboard around, ...I should be able to anticipate her next move, right...?`
`Remember what Kyrie-san said...`
`When you're thinking about something, then the closer you get to the very, very end, ...the easier it becomes to anticipate.`
`Spin it around.`
`...Spin the chessboard around...!!`
`".................."`
`"...What happened?`
` You fell silent all of a sudden.`
` Fear not.`
` Surrender is but a momentary shame.`
` After that, all that remains is the joy of entrusting your fate entirely to the hands of your new master...`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Come on, cry out in resignation.`
` ......I can't hear you.`
` Speak up and say it clearly."`
`"......Enough babbling.`
` You're just refusing to listen.`
` ...So I'll say it once more.`
` ...I won't resign.`
` ...Continue.`
` Resume the game."`
`"......Hoh.`
` Very well.`
` It is your turn, after all.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*"`
`"I made the mistake of thinking this rule you made was your own weapon.`
` ...However, I've realized that it can also become a weapon for me.`
` ......It all comes down to this."`
`"Please do give it a try."`
`"I've been focusing all this time on how they entered the closed room of the chapel...`
` ......That approach was useless.`
` ...Aaah, it's useless, it's all useless.`
` ...Spin the chessboard around."`
`"......That's right.`
` I was thinking about it backwards.`
` ...This is how I should approach it.`
` ......How was the chapel, which wasn't a closed room in the first place, made to look like a closed room?"`
`"Here it comes.`
` ...That thinking technique humans gave birth to over the course of a century.`
` Give it a try, *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"...Say this in red for me.`
` If you can't, then refuse.`
` ...Here I go."`
`...Does this man...intend to reverse his defensive posture?`
`Impudence...`
`"I get that the only way to enter the chapel is through the door...and that there's only one key.`
` ...But wait.`
` ...The question is whether that key really was handed over to Maria yesterday before noon."`
`"......My, but you're dragging this on.`
` Do try and get to the point."`
`"It's something like this.`
` ...We've been under the impression that the key's been unusable since midday yesterday.`
` So, we've assumed that this was a closed room from midday yesterday until this morning!"`
`"I want to hear you say that this impression of ours is a solid fact."`
`"Interesting.`
` ...So you turn your reasoning not to the door, but to the key."`
`"Yesterday, Maria received an envelope from you.`
` She didn't open it, but she might've felt it and known there was key inside.`
` ...But it's not like she'd have been able to confirm absolutely that it was the key to the chapel."`
`"......Here's what I'm getting at: `
`...the thing inside the envelope given to Maria was a fake."`
`"...If you think about what you're saying, it's ridiculous.`
` #ff0000This morning, Rosa definitely took an envelope out of Maria's handbag...`
`and from that obtained the genuine key to the chapel#ffffff.`
` ...It wasn't a fake, as you suggest."`
`"Heheh...`
` I know that much.`
` I'll continue.`
` ...In that case, when Maria first received the envelope, the thing inside it was definitely that same key to the chapel, right?"`
`"............`
`......Hoh."`
`"See what I'm getting at?`
` ...Midday yesterday, you gave Maria an envelope with a key inside.`
` And you told her that she mustn't open it.`
` ......Maria probably realized it had a key inside."`
`"Later on, Aunt Rosa used the thing inside the envelope to open the door to the chapel, `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~and that's why we assumed it was the key to the chapel all along~ib~.`
` This is the suspicious part!"`
`".........So is this what you're trying to say?`
` That when I entrusted Maria with a key, that key was a fake?`
` And then, by the time Rosa obtained it, it had been switched with the real thing...?"`
`"Yeah, that's it.`
` ...What's wrong, Beatrice-sama?`
` You've been looking a bit pale for a while now, huh...?"`
`"...Those close to me sometimes call me Beato (bay-ah-tow).`
` Beato will do."`
`"It's your turn, Beato.`
`The Turn of the Golden Witch!`
` ...Let's see you dodge this."`
`"......Very well.`
` ...#ff0000The key to the chapel truly was the object inside the envelope I gave Maria#ffffff."`
`"I'll move forward.`
` ...Can you repeat it in red?`
` ...'That envelope was completely under Maria's supervision until Aunt Rosa opened it'."`
`"............"`
`"...If you can't say it, then say you refuse.`
` Check."`
`"......Nng, .........I refuse."`
`"I've spun it all around with just one move.`
` ...Now it's your king on the run, Beato."`
`"...Hmph, I have a reason for refusing.`
` It regards the definition of the phrase 'under her supervision'.`
` ...In its purest meaning, Maria would need to have her eyes on it around the clock for that to be true."`
`"...But Maria didn't go that far.`
` It may have been completely under her supervision when she took it out of her handbag, but after she put it inside, it disappeared from her field of vision.`
` In that sense, the phrase 'under her supervision' would be inappropriate, so I couldn't use the red, nothing more.`
` ............Nng..."`
`"...I'll bet that move hurt.`
` And your face tells me you've guessed the next one.`
` .........Sorry.`
` I'm kind to women.`
` I don't hurt them.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~ And I never betray a woman's expectations~ib~!`
` ......It's time for you to repeat it in red, if you think you can.`
` 'No one was able to touch Maria's handbag until Aunt Rosa took out the envelope'."`
`".........I will also...refuse this one.`
` ...I won't explain the reason."`
`"That's wrong.`
` ...It's not that you won't explain it, `
`it's that you can't explain it.`
` ......That move gives us checkmate, doesn't it...?"`
`"............Nng..."`
`"If you can't do it, then I'll explain.`
` ......The key to the chapel really was in the envelope you handed to Maria.`
` ...Then Maria put it in her handbag, and the next morning, Aunt Rosa took it out and opened the lock."`
`"......However!`
` Maria didn't have the handbag under her complete supervision!`
` There's no need for magic.`
` It's a closed room trick that's possible for a human!"`
`"The Human culprit handed Maria the key, `
`and by making Aunt Rosa use it the next morning, they created the illusion that there was a closed room during that time."`
`"You can't deny the possibility that during that time, the culprit took the key from Maria's handbag, used it, `
`and returned it by morning!!"`
`"Can you say it in red?!`
` Repeat it! If you can say it, then say it!!`
` It's check again!!!"`
`"...N-Not yet.`
` I remove the check...`
` ...The envelope with the key in it should have been sealed with wax...!`
` Rosa took it from an unopened envelope..."`
`"Really? Then try saying it!!`
` Repeat it!!`
` 'The envelope handed over midday yesterday and one Aunt Rosa opened are the same thing'."`
`"Th-That I can repeat.`
` #ff0000The envelope I handed over to Maria and the one Rosa opened are the same thing#ffffff!!"`
`"...Hah...!`
` ...Aaaaah, it's useless, it's all useless.`
` That doesn't even matter anymore.`
` ...I expected more from you.`
` ...I figured that if you were a bit better at reading between the lines, you'd resign right there.`
` ...So I'm disappointed.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ......~ib~You've betrayed my expectations~ib~."`
`"......Wh-Wha...aat......!!"`
`"Who cares if the envelopes were the same?`
` ...Envelopes can be sealed with wax over and over!`
` The key inside is what's important."`
`"...Nngg, .........nnnnnnggg......"`
`"This time, it's all over, Golden Witch.`
` It's a real checkmate.`
` ...I'll say it one more time, repeat it!!`
` If you can say it, try saying it!"`
`"'The key to the chapel inside the envelope Maria received wasn't used even once until Aunt Rosa opened the envelope'!!"`
`'!s1`
`......Nnggg, `
`......how...`
`......!`
` How......`
`c-`
`could I...`
` ...Against a lowly human......!!"`
`"I'll keep on saying it, Beatrice!!!`
` Repeat it!!`
` 'The key to the chapel inside the envelope Maria received wasn't used even once until Aunt Rosa opened the envelope'!!"`
`"...Nnngaaah, ...ooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhh!!!"`
`"If you're gonna yell, then say you resign!`
` This settles it!!`
` This is the truth."`
`"Before Aunt Rosa obtained Maria's key this morning, at one point, it passed to someone else's hands."`
`"Then they used it, resealed it, and returned it to Maria's handbag, making it look like it hadn't been used!"`
`"This is a trick with a cheap loophole, the assumption that the key wasn't used because the sealing wax wasn't opened!!"`
`"Checkmate!!`
` There's no magic, and it's nothing more than a trick that's possible for humans!!"`
`"I-In that case, ...who do you say stole the key?!`
` Try answering!`
` This time, you try repeating it...!!"`
`"That's right, I'm making you repeat things all the time.`
` I probably have to answer every once in a while..."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"`
`~ib~But I refuse~ib~`
`!!`
` My condition for victory is denying a witch's existence.`
` I'll prove that this impossible crime done with your magic was actually possible by human hands!!"`
`"I've smashed your closed room with something possible even for humans.`
` However, I won't specifically investigate who the culprit is."`
`"Because I believe in humans!!`
` Because I definitely won't accept that there's a person among us who would steal the key from Maria, use it, and do something so horrible!!"`
`"Heh, hehehehehhahahahahahahaha!!!`
` I give up, I resign!`
` Just once, for this skirmish, I'll give up.`
` ...But, you really are naive, Battler."`
`"Parting remarks are a loser's privilege.`
` Say as many as you like."`
`"...Nngg...!`
` Since you continue to deny my existence, you will eventually be cornered..."`
`"After all, since you deny me, you will have to suspect those relatives that you can't stop loving...!`
` In the last moment, when you have to suspect one who is beloved to you, then you will surely accept my existence...!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle* True, you have defeated me in this skirmish alone.`
` ...However, that naive logic will definitely destroy you...`
` ...You can't win against me after all!!`
` Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!"`
`...Rosa and the rest returned from the chapel to the parlor in the mansion.`
`So many things had happened since early in the morning.`
`Of course they were high-strung...`
`Battler and George, who had cried, raged, and let their emotions explode after seeing their parents' tragic bodies,`
` returned to the parlor and sat in the sofas, dazed, as though everything up until then had been a lie...`
`Only Maria was completely unchanged and looked just like normal.`
`...When she wasn't playing pranks, she was basically a kid who played wordlessly by herself,`
` so even if she was dazed, she would probably look just as she did.`
`...But as she turned on the TV and flipped through the channels, it looked as though nothing about her had changed from normal.`
`Did Rosa think anything in particular about this attitude, which was clearly different from normal people?`
`...She stared at Maria's back as though looking at something that wasn't quite heartwarming.`
`Eventually, Kumasawa came to say good morning.`
`...Her cheerful manner was clearly out of place, and she couldn't help but be bewildered by the strange atmosphere in the room.`
`...Then, when she heard the details from Gohda, she reacted loudly with shock.`
`"O-O-O-Of course you've contacted the police, right...?!`
` What should we do in a time like this, oooh, what should we do...?!"`
`"......Please calm down and listen.`
` ...It seems a machine somewhere was somehow done in by lightning last night.`
` Because of that, we haven't been able to use the phones..."`
`"Whaaaat?!!`
` Th-Then, until the typhoon passes, we can't even contact the police?!"`
`Maybe Kumasawa's exaggerated surprise was a little comical.`
`Even in this kind of situation, Rosa giggled.`
`...Because of that, the fog of confusion that had covered her head cleared up a little.`
`"......I've got to stay strong.`
` ...It's not just Maria.`
` I'm acting as a parent for George-kun and Battler-kun too, so I have to stay strong..."`
`Rosa had been the youngest sibling, with a large difference in age between her and the others.`
`So, she had always been treated as a child.`
`Every time she learned something new, it was something obvious to her siblings,`
` and she had built up a complex, becoming convinced of her own incompetence.`
`So, she had developed a passive personality, asking her siblings for advice every time something happened...`
`......But she no longer had any brothers or sisters.`
`Now, Rosa was the only one of the four Ushiromiya siblings left.`
`...Furthermore, if Kinzo continued to shut himself away even in this extraordinary situation,`
` ...Rosa would have to surpass this crisis as the Head's representative.`
`"......I'm not a child anymore, not a child.`
` ............"`
`...Rosa slapped her knees lightly and stood up.`
`She must not wait for orders now.`
`...She had to start moving herself.`
`She picked up the receiver of the extension phone on the side table.`
`...Then she immediately remembered that the phones were down.`
`Genji and Shannon, whom she had sent to see Kinzo, hadn't returned yet.`
`...She had a good guess at what was going on.`
`He was probably yelling something nonsensical again and becoming unmanagable.`
`...His precious chapel had been defiled with blood.`
`That was easy to imagine.`
`She had planned on using the extension phone to call the study, but unfortunately, the phones were down.`
`Rosa decided to go to the study directly, with her own two feet.`
`Her old self would've been too frightened to go see Kinzo.`
`...And in fact, if she did meet him, she would probably be blamed somehow and insulted.`
`But this was no time to be frightened.`
`......As his true daughter, she had to make him aware of the current situation.`
`"...Kumasawa-san, `
`I'm going to see Father.`
` ...Take special care of George-kun and Battler-kun.`
` ...I'm sure they're on edge right now."`
`"Yes, yes...`
` That may be true...`
` ...It is truly pitiable...`
` I shall make them something warm to drink."`
`"Thank you."`
`Rosa went out into the hallway and headed towards Kinzo's study.`
`The atmosphere in this mansion, which she'd spent her younger days in and should've been full of memories, seemed somehow different...`
`She began to climb the stairs in the entrance hall...`
`...Just then.`
`In the faint darkness down the stairs behind Rosa's back, ...something glowed.`
`It was a single, fluttering gold butterfly.`
`...It fluttered around and sparkled.`
`That butterfly danced about without a sound.`
`...It was only natural.`
`No one can hear the sound of a butterfly's wings beating.`
`......And then, ...it came to a rest on Rosa's back as she slowly climbed the stairs.`
`Rosa didn't notice it.`
`If someone not in-the-know saw it, they'd probably assume it was just single sheet of gold leaf in the shape of a butterfly that had been stuck there.`
`Without noticing a thing, Rosa continued heading towards Kinzo's study...`
`"......So, how will you entertain me with this next one?`
` ...There are still many, many pieces left.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`In the parlor, which had fallen silent again, the only sound was that of the TV that Maria was watching alone.`
`If there was anything audible besides that, it was the sound of the rain, which had continued on and on since the previous night.`
`Every one of those who had witnessed that unearthly and horrible scene stayed silent, as though praying that the events of that morning had all been a dream.`
`Because Kumasawa alone hadn't seen it, her reaction was slightly different.`
`...The silence itself seemed more unbearable to her, and she was anxious to encourage everyone somehow.`
`...However, she was aware that she must avoid saying anything careless, and she seemed to be pondering how she could be most helpful...`
`Normally, it would be time for breakfast.`
`...However, possibly because something so outrageous had happened, Gohda seemed to have forgotten to prepare a meal.`
`...Or maybe everyone was so beaten up that they'd forgotten their hunger.`
`Kumasawa wanted to bring up the subject of what they should do for breakfast, but it didn't seem like the right atmosphere, so she really couldn't.`
`But she really was hungry.`
`...So, she casually made a proposal.`
`"...It seems everyone is tired after all that has happened.`
` ...In times like this, I think the best thing is to heat yourself with some warm black tea."`
`"...Indeed, that is an excellent plan.`
` I agree as well."`
`"Hohohoh.`
` How about some delicious black tea with biscuits and jam?`
` Ah, yes, I hear Halloween will be here soon, and we have some delicious-looking pumpkin-shaped cookies on the shelf..."`
`"...Ah, Kumasawa-san, that's......"`
`Of course, she had said the wrong thing.`
`...She had reminded Battler and the rest about that horrible and tragic Halloween party in the chapel...`
`Nanjo hurriedly whispered into Kumasawa's ear.`
`"............"`
`"...Battler-san, I am so sorry!`
` ...I didn't mean to upset you, truly I didn't..."`
`"No, don't worry about it.`
` ......I'll definitely turn this boiling anger back on the culprit."`
`"......I wonder if that culprit is still on the island."`
`"Probably.`
` At least, until the typhoon passes, no boat will come."`
`"Y-Yes, that is true!`
` After all, the boats stop coming even when it's just a little windy.`
` They certainly wouldn't come during a typhoon, yes!"`
`"...It creeps me out."`
`"You think so, Aniki?`
` Me too.`
` ......And that's even putting aside whether the culprit's that mystery guest or not."`
`"Indeed.`
` ...We've naturally suspected the mysterious guest who calls herself Beatrice, `
`but we still cannot be certain she is the culprit.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ...There is still the possibility she's a ~ib~victim whose corpse still hasn't been found~ib~`
`."`
`"...When I think of it that way, there's something I just can't understand."`
`"What...do you mean by that...?"`
`"It's simple.`
` It's just like Kumasawa baa-chan said a short while ago.`
` Right now, this island is right in the middle of a typhoon, and escape is impossible.`
` The same thing goes for the culprit.`
` ......In that case, having the crime come to light should've been the thing the culprit wanted to avoid most."`
`"...I see.`
` ...So, there was no need to draw that creepy magic circle on the entrance to the chapel and show off the fact that the corpses were there."`
`"Yeah, that's it.`
` And, if they were able to take the time and effort to do something so horrible to those six people, `
`it should've been possible for them to hide the six corpses where they'd be impossible to find."`
`"I agree. That brutal Halloween party probably wasn't directed at those who died.`
` ...It was directed at the people who would eventually discover it, us.`
` It's probably safe to say that the magic circle was there to help us find it."`
`"...The culprit knows they won't be able to escape from this island for a while.`
` ...And yet, they acted as though they wanted to make us find the corpses in the middle of this typhoon.`
` ...What does it mean?`
` ...If I were the culprit, I definitely wouldn't play around and make us find the bodies."`
`"......Beatrice-sama was not in her room.`
` ...And the room did not seem particularly disturbed.`
` ...Ah, no, Milady did disturb it quite a lot though..."`
`"...Come to think of it, what happened to Jessica?"`
`"Kanon-san is looking after her.`
` ...They are probably in Milady's room."`
`"......That isn't good.`
` ...The culprit is definitely still on the island.`
` ...In this situation, I don't believe it's a very good idea to isolate ourselves in small numbers."`
`"Wh-What do you mean by that...?`
` Y-Y-You don't mean to say that the culprit plans to kill all of us...?!`
` Awawawawawawawawa..."`
`"Let us remain calm...`
` That is not yet certain..."`
`"But unfortunately, we can't deny that the possibility exists. Ihihi.`
` ...This letter was in the chapel.`
` According to this, the culprit is the witch, `
`and if we don't solve the riddle of Grandfather's epitaph and find the gold, they'll massacre the whole family, ...or something like that."`
`"Is that true...?!`
` Umm, would you allow me to read it as well...?"`
`"E-E-E-Eeeeeeeeeeeekk... Eeeeeeeeeeekk......!"`
`"...Umumumumumumumu..."`
`As they read the witch's letter, Gohda, Kumasawa, and Nanjo's faces grew even paler than they had been...`
`Kumasawa could no longer hide her shaking.`
`"......If you don't want to die, try finding Grandfather's hidden gold... Is that it?`
` ...Screwing around with us.`
` I'll bet she can't solve the riddle, so she's trying to make us solve it...!"`
`"However, ...I wonder what the truth is.`
` Madam always stated that the Legend of the Gold was nothing more than an illusion created by the Master.`
` ...It is doubtful whether it actually existed..."`
`"True...`
` Supposedly, they thought it would be nice if it did exist, but only half-believed it.`
` ...The relatives started believing in the Legend of the Gold only after Kinzo's health worsened and the inheritance problem came up.`
` Until then, hardly anyone believed in it, I understand."`
`"...Oh, so maybe that's why...`
` Do you remember?`
` On the table in the chapel,`
` ...there were three gold ingots.`
` That alone would be worth quite a lot.`
` Doesn't that prove that the Legend of the Gold was real?"`
`"E-Excuse me, ...please wait.`
` Just now, did you say there were three gold bars...?"`
`"...Yeah, there were definitely three of them piled up.`
` So what?"`
`"Umm, uh, I......happened to hear Krauss-sama say something once.`
` ...Yes, I just happened to hear it, you see!`
` It's not like I was trying to listen in on secret discussions, no indeed!"`
`"Don't worry about that now.`
` So then what?`
` Is there something wrong with there being three of those gold bars?"`
`"...Y-Yes.`
` According to Krauss-sama, ...there was only one bar ever found to support the Legend of the Gold."`
`"...That is correct.`
` I believe Kinzo-san showed the president of Marusoo a mountain of gold and let him take one bar back with him, or so the story goes."`
`"That one bar came to be in Krauss-sama's possession.`
` And, he said that `
`no other gold supporting the Master's Legend of the Gold existed..."`
`"You're talking about Uncle Krauss here?`
` So what does that mean?`
` ...No wait, ...three?!`
` Wait, wait, where did they come from, that's too many, right?!"`
`"Perhaps there is another explanation.`
` Maybe the other relatives also found one each, and they each brought one of them there..."`
`"No, I cannot believe that.`
` When all of the relatives came to the mansion, I was entrusted with their luggage.`
` I did not feel a suspicious weight back then."`
`"...I think those would weigh about 10kg.`
` If that much weight was in their bags, even I would notice.`
` But it didn't seem that way."`
`"Same here.`
` At the most, there were some changes of clothes, a first-aid kid, Kyrie-san's makeup.`
` Stuff like that, I think.`
` Aunt Rosa's luggage also looked pretty light."`
`"...In that case, those three piled-up gold bars were being shown to them...or maybe to us.`
` ...The Legend of the Gold is definitely real.`
` It isn't an illusion.`
` They're telling us to try and find out the secret if we can."`
`"Could they be scheming...to have us solve the epitaph, which points to where the gold is hidden, and then try to snatch it away?"`
`"......Yeah, that does make some sense.`
` ...But there are a couple parts that don't fit.`
` To start, our parents, who should've been the most likely to solve the epitaph, were killed first.`
` That seems to create a contradiction right off the bat to me."`
`"......And something else makes even less sense.`
` ...If the Legend of the Gold is actually true,`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~ then how were they able to pile up all that gold~ib~?`
` ...It's almost like the culprit's already found the gold...`
`and is telling us to try and find it too."`
`"Maybe the culprit found those three like Uncle Krauss did. Maybe that convinced them that the legend is true, and they're trying to make us search for the rest...`
` I think that way fits the best."`
`".........`
`...The pieces on the chessboard aren't lined up at all.`
` ......We don't have a clue what the culprit is planning, what they want, or what they want to make us do.`
` ......Is there any point?`
` No matter what we think, is there anything we can figure out right now...?`
` ........."`
`"...Kihihi.`
` It was written down.`
` What she wanted to make us do.`
` Couldn't anyone read it? Kihihihihihihihihihi."`
`Maria suddenly laughed in a creepy voice.`
`...I'd thought she'd been concentrating on the TV, but apparently, she'd been listening in too.`
`Without turning away from the TV, ...she very simply told us what we were forgetting.`
`"Beatrice hasn't said once that she wants the gold.`
` ...All she's asking is whether you're all capable of solving the epitaph's riddle or not.`
` ...Though I'll bet she's pretty sure you could never do it.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi."`
`"...So, are you saying you ~ib~can~ib~ solve it, Maria?"`
`"...I don't care.`
` After all, she'll take me to the Golden Land.`
` So I won't get in Beatrice's way.`
`'!s0`
`"In any case, it looks like we'll have to ask Maria if we want to learn anything more.`
` ...Maria, tell us.`
` ......Who is this Beatrice?`
` What is she planning?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!`
` You know, Beatrice is a witch!`
` She can do anything with her strange powers.`
` The power of magic can do anything.`
` It can even create gold or bread.`
` And of course, it can create sweets too, right?`
` You saw, didn't you?`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!"`
`At that time, everyone jumped at the sound of a door being slammed shut.`
`When we turned around, we saw that Rosa had suddenly returned, bringing Genji and Shannon.`
`...Then, she rapidly approached Maria, her heels squeaking, and hit her on the cheek.`
`"...Stop talking about that.`
` Battler-kun and the rest will take it badly."`
`".........Uu-..."`
`Without waiting for a response, she hit Maria's cheek once more.`
`Everyone could only stand there, stunned.`
`"I don't know what uu- means.`
` What about yes?"`
`"......Uu-."`
`She mercilessly hit Maria's cheek again.`
`...Maybe Maria didn't feel like resisting after being hit twice.`
`She weakly said yes.`
`"...R-Rosa-san, there's no reason to be so harsh..."`
`"...This is my daughter's education.`
` Do not interrupt."`
`The atmosphere around Rosa, with Genji and Shannon standing at attention behind her, was somehow cold, and yet dignified,`
` ...completely different from how she had seemed before she left.`
`She was holding something that looked like a gun.`
`...I couldn't imagine that she'd be holding a toy in this situation.`
`"Aunt Rosa, what is...?"`
`"...This is Father's.`
` Because of the current situation, I borrowed it specially.`
` ......Everyone should understand.`
` The culprit is still nearby.`
` We don't know what might happen."`
`"......I agree.`
` ...Rather than trying to figure out what the culprit is planning, it might be better to first think about our own safety."`
`"............"`
`"Father was fine, but he was considerably shaken by these sudden events.`
` ...Fortunately, he said he won't leave his room, so he should be safe.`
` For now, we should all try to stay together as much as possible."`
`"...I agree.`
` We don't even know where the culprit's hiding, and...after all, there's no proof that there's only one of them.`
` ......"`
`Even though I'd said it myself, I shivered.`
`That's right.`
` Could a single person kill six people and set up such a horrible scene all alone?`
`...Isn't it natural to assume that this crime was carried out by multiple culprits?`
`"...I agree with Rosa-san.`
` It probably is good for us to stay together."`
`"Yes, yes, I think it's good too, yes, yes!"`
`"......Maybe it's about time we called for Milady and Kanon-san."`
`"That's right.`
` ...Let's have them come down."`
`George-aniki tried to grab the extension phone, but Gohda-san shook his head.`
`...That's right, the phones are down right now, aren't they?`
`"...I'll go with a couple people.`
` If George-aniki and Gohda-san come too, that should be enough."`
`"......No.`
` Let's all go together.`
` ...It's a 'Wolves and Sheep Puzzle'.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~ If we're in balance while gathered together like this~ib~, then maintaining this situation will be safest."`
`"...A 'Wolves and Sheep Puzzle'?"`
`"...Uu-.`
` I've got it.`
` I'll show you."`
`"Maria, turn off the television.`
` ...Genji-san,`
` please tell me where Jessica-chan's room is.`
` Let's all go together."`
`"...Yes.`
` I will guide you."`
`"Come on, everyone.`
` We'll move together.`
` Follow my instructions."`
`We stood up.`
`Maria alone looked like she had some regrets about the TV, but she decided to go along with everyone for now and got up.`
`"...Shannon, thank goodness.`
` I was a bit worried when you took so long to get back."`
`"I am sorry to have worried you.`
` The Master ordered me to transcribe something for him..."`
`"Transcribe?"`
`"......Shannon."`
`"...I-I am sorry, excuse me..."`
`We headed for Jessica's room, with the armed Aunt Rosa and Genji-san in the lead.`
`Jessica and Kanon-kun were a boy and a girl of about the same age.`
`It'd sure be a shame if we barged in on them at a bad time...or at least that's what we'd be joking about normally.`
`However, Aunt Rosa was on edge, constantly exuding a sense of tension.`
`...So it definitely wasn't the sort of atmosphere for careless remarks like that.`
`"Hey, don't fall behind!!`
` Everyone move together!`
` We don't know when or where the culprit might leap out at us, right?!"`
`...No, maybe Aunt Rosa's attitude was more appropriate.`
`...Since Grandfather hadn't come down, Aunt Rosa was our leader.`
`This wasn't a situation where she could smile like she always did.`
`...And Aunt Rosa was a mother too.`
`She probably also thought that, if she didn't get ahold of herself, some harm might befall her beloved daughter.`
`The culprit had killed six of our parents at once.`
`...The method they had used was unknown, but there was a good chance this opponent could take down a large number of people in a flash.`
`Would that be with weapons, or with numbers?`
`...Or with the magic of a witch?`
`In any case, I couldn't think of any reason why it'd be okay to let our guards down...`
`The rest of us had better take much, much greater care, just like Aunt Rosa...`
`"......Everyone, stop!"`
`Aunt Rosa spoke in a sharp voice.`
`Wondering what this was all about, we peered forwards...`
`...and immediately realized the reason...`
`"......Wh-What is this..."`
`"Eeep......!"`
`"Everyone, get back...!"`
`Gohda-san and Genji-san approached the door...`
`Beyond this door...was probably Jessica's room.`
`"This...seems to be the same paint that was scribbled on the door to the chapel."`
`"...It appears so.`
` It seems not much time has passed since it was drawn."`
`"What the heck...?`
` ...Is that...another magic circle?!"`
`"...It's the first magic circle of the moon.`
` ...It has the power to open unopening doors."`
`Drawn on the door to Jessica's room...was the same kind of creepy scribble that had been drawn on the door to the chapel.`
`...That strange pattern must've had some occult meaning.`
`But it didn't matter what that meaning was.`
`We were worried about whether those two were okay.`
`"Th-That doesn't matter!`
` Are Jessica-chan and Kanon-kun safe?!"`
`"...This does not bode well...`
` We should quickly bring those two downstairs."`
`"Milady!`
` Milady!!`
` Are you there?`
` Please answer!!"`
`Gohda-san knocked violently and yelled, ...but there was no answer.`
`He gripped the doorknob with a clatter, but the lock just resisted him.`
`"...Rosa-sama, it seems to be locked."`
`"There's no helping it.`
` Please open it up."`
`Genji nodded, and Gohda quickly unlocked the door with the master key.`
`...In the back of my mind, horrible images floated up and disappeared, one after another.`
`...A magic circle had been drawn on the door to the chapel.`
`Behind that lay six coprses.`
`...So, if there's a magic circle drawn on the door to Jessica's room, ...then beyond it must be......`
`"...J-Jessica-sama!!"`
`"Wh-What happened?`
` Is she there?!"`
`"Jessica!!`
` What happened?!!"`
`...It was truly heartless.`
`...The expression on Gohda-san's face and his cry as he opened the door...`
`prepared us for the brutal fate that Jessica had met even before we saw her...`
`Everyone rushed into Jessica's room at once.`
`...That scene told everyone that their worst fears were spot on...`
`'!s0`
`"......How...horrible...`
` ...D-Doctor Nanjo!!"`
`Inside the room, which seemed elegant for the bedroom of one so young, Jessica lay crumpled on the ground.`
`There was a large pool of blood on the floor.`
`...And there was a knife or something sticking deep into her back...`
`...Was it a knife?`
`There was a design on the handle that just had to symbolize something demonic.`
`It had to be a weapon (?) with some kind of occult meaning.`
`"...This is......horrible.`
` ...She has passed away.`
` ...This probably reached her lungs...`
` ...Not much time has passed since she died."`
`"Jessicaaaaaaaaaaaa!!`
`'!s0`
`"...B-Battler-sama..."`
`'!s0`
` I knew it!!`
` Since the culprit couldn't escape the island, they were definitely close by!`
` So why didn't I get cautious sooner?!!`
` ...I was naive!!`
` I just assumed that a culprit would commit their crime and then just sneak away and hide!"`
`"...We were stunned then.`
` We thought Jessica-chan giving in to rage and running off was just something that couldn't be helped.`
` ...But we were naive.`
` We should have stopped her...!"`
`"...Gohda-san, why did you leave those two alone?!`
` If only you had been with them, something like this...!!"`
`"N-No, ...th-that is...umm!!`
` I said it was dangerous, so we should return!`
` It's just that, Milady said that she wanted to be alone!`
` Kanon-san told me to leave it to him, and...!`
` ...Speaking of which, where is Kanon-san...?!"`
`"That's right!`
` What in the world happened to Kanon-kun?!"`
`"...K-Kanon-kun...`
` Where......"`
`"Kanon-san should have been with Milady...`
` Where in the world did he go...?!"`
`"You don't think...they got him...?!"`
`"............`
`Quiet.`
` ......Someone might be hiding in this room.`
` Search under the bed and in the closet!"`
`There was a chance that Kanon-kun's corpse had been pushed away somewhere.`
`At Rosa-san's order, everyone searched throughout the room together.`
`...But there wasn't a single human hiding anywhere.`
`"...He's nowhere!!`
` Could the culprit have taken him out of the room?!`
` Then we'll have to search for him quickly and save him!`
` ...If we're slow, something awful might happen!!`
` Aunt Rosa, let's search all over the mansion!`
` Let's search for the culprit!`
` Let's save Kanon-kun!!"`
`".........`
`......Quiet!!!"`
`When Aunt Rosa yelled at us, we fell instantly silent.`
`She was probably contemplating something.`
`...However, what in the world could that be...?`
`...Aunt Rosa walked around the room as though looking for something, or as though she was collecting her thoughts.`
`......Then, she found something on the side table by the bed and picked it up.`
`"......If anyone knows, tell me.`
` ...Which key is this?"`
`Aunt Rosa showed everyone a key with a cute mascot attached to it.`
`...Judging from its cute appearance, I didn't doubt that it was Jessica's key, but I had no way of knowing for sure.`
`"...It is probably the key to this room, ...to Milady's room."`
`After hearing that, Aunt Rosa made a point of going outside the door and checking.`
`......Without a doubt, it was the key to this room.`
`"......I wonder why it was set in a place like this.`
` Wouldn't you normally keep such an important key in your pocket?"`
`"...Umm, ......Milady wasn't in the habit of locking her room.`
` It seems she would only do it when she went to school,`
` because she didn't want someone like Krauss-sama to look inside her room..."`
`"......I see.`
` She wasn't at school, so it's natural that Jessica-chan would set the key down here.`
` How many keys can open this door?"`
`"J-Just the one Milady had..."`
`"Can't it be opened with your master keys?"`
`"...They can open it."`
`"How many master keys are there?`
` Are all of the servants holding them?`
` Are there extras?"`
`"Yes.`
` We all have one.`
` ......As for extras, ...I wonder."`
`"There used to be several, ...but Madam scolded us harshly, saying that was careless, so they should have been dealt with."`
`"...That is correct.`
` There is only one held by each servant.`
` There are no more."`
`"...Hmm?`
` Wait a sec.`
` ...I think we talked about extra master keys in the last game, right?"`
`"Indeed.`
` Well, regarding that,`
` I have noticed that having several master keys whose locations are unknown is quite disadvantageous for me."`
`"...That's probably right.`
` Since you wanna make me believe in magic using closed rooms, it'd really hurt you if there were more master keys than we thought.`
` ...After all, every time a trick involving locks shows up,`
` I planned to resist by arguing that the culprit had a master key that someone lost in the past or a duplicate."`
`"Yes, that's correct.`
` So I've decided to make a move to defeat that.`
` ...I'll update our setting."`
`"#ff0000The only master keys are the ones held by the servants, one key each#ffffff.`
` *cackle*cackle*"`
`"...Messing with me.`
` ...More importantly,`
` what kind of move is this?`
` ...What's Aunt Rosa talking about?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` Who knows?`
` You should try listening in."`
`"......Thank you.`
` I have the situation sorted out.`
` ...And, I've been able to pinpoint the culprit who assaulted Jessica-chan, or at least one of their accomplices."`
`"Wh-What did you say...?!`
` Who is it?!"`
`"...Aunt Rosa, you don't mean Kanon-kun, do you...?"`
`"...Huh, ...what?!`
` Wh-Why Kanon-kun?!"`
`"This room was locked.`
` And the only keys that can unlock it are the master keys, held by each servant, and the key Jessica had.`
` ...But Jessica-chan's key was closed up in here.`
` ...Which means it's only possible that one of the master keys locked this room up."`
`"......It is as you say."`
`"In that case, someone killed Jessica, then locked the door!`
` That person had a master key.`
` And there are only five people with master keys!"`
`"O-Oh my!!`
` It wasn't me, not me!`
` No, I could never do such a thing!"`
`"...Kumasawa-san got up late.`
` After we returned from the chapel to the parlor, we did meet you there, `
`but it's impossible to prove where you were and what you were doing until that time.`
` You watched us from the shadows, chased after Jessica-chan and Kanon-kun when they were isolated, and stealthily attacked them."`
`'!s1`
`and did something so horrible?!`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, kum_2e92:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kum_2e93:`
`"What about you, Gohda-san?`
` You said you left Jessica-chan in Kanon-kun's care and returned.`
` ...But I wonder if that's true?`
` ...Maybe you actually killed the two of them, hid Kanon-kun's corpse,`
` and then came back with an innocent look on your face!!"`
`"Nothing of the sort happened!`
` I, Gohda, swear that I did not do anything like that!!"`
`"...I-It wasn't us...!!`
` We were following the Master's orders and..."`
`"Yes.`
` You and Genji-san alone are clean.`
` That's backed up by what I heard from Father.`
` The two of you were in Father's room the whole time, transcribing and witnessing for him.`
` Father and I can guarantee that."`
`"......Thank you very much."`
`"In that case, the argument becomes who is more suspicious, Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san?`
` ...I thought that myself right after entering this room.`
` ......But still, I found it strange.`
` Look at the state of Jessica-chan's body.`
` Doesn't everyone think it's strange?"`
`"...Strange, ...you say...?"`
`"Jessica-chan was struck in the back.`
` ......Come on, they say it all the time, right?`
` That in crimes where the victim is struck in the back, there's a high likelihood that the culprit was someone whose face was known to the victim.`
` She definitely wouldn't invite a person she didn't trust into her room...and defenselessly expose her back."`
`"...R-Rosa-sama, you don't mean...`
`...to say that was Kanon-kun, do you...?"`
`"I do.`
` We're all fully aware of the state Jessica-chan was in right before she was killed.`
` ...After seeing her parents' tragic bodies, Jessica-chan was very panicked.`
` It's easy to imagine that, after she regained her composure, she'd be in a horrible slump."`
`"...It would be very understandable if Jessica's frame of mind led her to shut herself up alone in her room.`
` And those particulars match with Gohda-san's story."`
`"...Jessica-chan said to leave her alone.`
` ...Then, Kanon-kun, who is of a similar age and who may have some adolescent relationship with her, said to leave this matter in his hands.`
` That feeling is also very understandable."`
`"......So, for that reason, I think Jessica-chan welcomed Kanon-kun into her room."`
`"But what if it had been Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san?`
` Would she have let them into her room?"`
`"...I-I believe that I have gained Milady's trust.`
` But even so, err..."`
`"Oh, then I guess you're still a suspect after all, Gohda-san.`
` I assumed Jessica-chan probably didn't like you very much, so I didn't think she would've let you into her room.`
` I was convinced that you couldn't possibly be the culprit, but maybe I was mistaken?"`
`"No, umm...!`
` ......I am sad to say that I may not have been accepted by Milady.`
` ...Wh-What about you, Kumasawa-san?"`
`"H-Hohohohohoho!`
` We are far too separated by age to understand the feelings of a young person like Milady very well...`
` And for the same reason, perhaps Milady never opened up her heart to us.`
` Right, Gohda-san?!"`
`"Yes, that's right!`
` It would have been quite difficult for her to open her heart to the likes of us!`
` And it would be inconceivable for Milady to let us into her room when she was grieving!"`
`Gohda-san and Kumasawa baa-chan each rubbed their hands together, affirming each other with forced smiles on their faces.`
`It was a truly unpleasant rondo.`
`"So, it was a person who might be allowed to enter Jessica-chan's room while she was grieving.`
` A person who might have been given access to her defenseless back,`
` and who had a master key.`
` That only points to one suspect.`
` ...It was impossible for anyone except Kanon-kun."`
`"...P-Please, wait...!`
` Kanon-kun definitely wouldn't do something like-"`
`"Oh, then is there someone else?`
` Is Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san suspicious after all?`
` Who do you think is more suspicious, Shannon-chan...? Come on."`
`"I...I...could never......"`
`"It wasn't me, Shannon-san!`
` Yes, it was not me!"`
`"Of course, it wasn't me either!`
` The ones who had close relationships with Milady were Kanon-san...and after him, you, right?!"`
`"......Yeah, isn't that right?`
` ...Jessica-chan might also let Shannon-chan into her room.`
` You were supposedly with Father.`
` ......But in reality, `
`...could you be the culprit......?"`
`"...Sh-Shannon couldn't be the culprit!`
` Didn't you just say she was doing some important work with Grandfather?!"`
`"Yes, I know.`
` Neither Shannon-chan nor Genji-san is the culprit.`
` Father confirmed that they were together the whole time.`
` ......Well then, what do you think, everyone...?"`
`After being told that, no one could respond...`
`Even if someone did manage to argue back, they'd then have to offer the name of a different suspect.`
`...And no matter who that suspect was, it would have to be someone right here.`
`...No one could do something like that.`
`Aunt Rosa glanced at everyone in turn, fingering the gun like it was a toy...`
`......She seemed so different from the kind Aunt Rosa I knew.`
`...No, it's probably because I'm not fully aware of danger we're in.`
`...Maybe Aunt Rosa's attitude would seem natural if I could truly sense the peril surrounding us...`
`"It looks like no one has an opinion.`
` Then I'll give you mine."`
`"Of course, I can't deny the possibility that Kanon-kun's a victim without a corpse.`
` But until we find that corpse, I certainly can't rule Kanon-kun out as a suspect.`
` ...There's a chance he'll suddenly appear again, `
`claiming to have been attacked by the culprit and confined somewhere."`
`"But take care.`
` Most likely...no, there's no doubt about it.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ......`
`~ib~Kanon-kun killed Jessica-chan~ib~`
`."`
`"............N-No way......"`
`"...I-I can't believe it...`
` Kanon did that...`
`......to Milady?`
` ...That's too much!!"`
`"I feel the same as Shannon.`
` I'm opposed to labeling Kanon-kun as the culprit."`
`"Then is the culprit Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san?`
` Tell me who's more suspicious."`
`""I-I-I-It wasn't us!!""`
`"If it wasn't Kanon-kun, then who could've locked this door?`
` How about it, Shannon-chan?`
` George-kun?`
` ...Huh?`
` Huh huh huh...?"`
`Aunt Rosa closed in on Shannon-chan and George-aniki, laughing unpleasantly.`
`...Of course, they couldn't say anything back.`
`They wanted to believe in Kanon-kun.`
`...But if they did, they'd have to suspect the other servants.`
`The simplest culprit was the mystery guest, Beatrice.`
`...But she was nothing more than a guest and didn't have a master key.`
`......So, if Beatrice is the culprit, despite lacking a master key...`
`...Then do we have to accept the argument that she really is a witch, who locked the door with the power of magic...?`
`"......That's a dirty argument...`
` ...Dirty, ...so dirty..."`
`"What are you worried about?`
` Make it my fault.`
` You can just make it the fault of the 19th person, the mystery guest, right?`
` If you do, you won't have to watch this ugly battle of humans blaming each other, right...?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"So then what?`
` The culprit is the 19th person, the guest Beatrice.`
` ...She's a witch, so she could lock the door without a key, using magic.`
` Are you telling me to accept that?`
` Damn it...!`
` ...Damn it, damn it...!!"`
`"...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` In the last game, I learned all your weak points.`
` So, what will you do, what will you do...?`
` You said you definitely wouldn't accept me, right?`
` Then, ......you can use Kanon as the perfect sacrifice he is."`
`"Kanon killed Jessica!`
` If you support Rosa's theory, everything is settled here, right?`
` Kanon is already dead.`
` There should be no need to show concern for the dead.`
` And, you won't have to suspect anyone in this room!`
` *cackle*hahahahahahahahahahaha!"`
`"Damn it!!`
` I won't accept you!!!`
` But...Kanon-kun being the culprit...is impossible!!"`
`"......I don't want to suspect anyone.`
` ...However, at times, 'there's no smoke without fire' turns out to be true.`
` ...Anyway, you can never be too cautious..."`
`"D-Doctor Nanjo,`
` ...what do you mean by that...?"`
`"...Umm, please do not misunderstand.`
` ...I do not wish to label Kanon-san as the culprit.`
` ...However, until we understand the situation, there is a possibility that he's the culprit,`
` and I believe thinking that way is safer."`
`"...H-Hohohoh...`
` Yes, that's right, ...you cannot be too cautious."`
`The general concensus certainly didn't seem to find fault with Nanjo for what he said.`
`True, no one actually thought Kanon was the culprit.`
`...But unless they suspected him, they'd have to suspect one of the servants here.`
`...We didn't want to do that.`
`We didn't want to suspect.`
`We didn't want to be suspected.`
`"That's correct.`
` ...We cannot be too vigilant.`
` I take it no one objects to that, right?"`
`"Understand?`
` ...There's a very high likelihood that these murders are connected to Father's Legend of the Gold.`
` That means the crime must have been plotted by someone who wants to keep a vast amount of gold--worth several ten billion yen--all for themselves.`
` ...With that kind of money, you could play around for the rest of your life in any country.`
` ...And with a motivation like that, they might even intend to kill all of us."`
`"........."`
`"Because she didn't have a master key, the 19th person, `
`the guest Beatrice, is removed from suspicion for the murder of Jessica-chan alone.`
` But we cannot conclude that she's unrelated to the crime.`
` ...After all, it's a vast amount of gold we're talking about.`
` We can't deny the possibility that there are multiple culprits.`
` ...Right now, one of the people here among us might have been bought by the culprit!!"`
`As Aunt Rosa yelled, she looked all around, her gun still raised.`
`...Don't believe anyone, suspect the person next to you, ...that's what she was saying.`
`But no one wanted to suspect.`
`...They didn't want to suspect anyone here.`
`That weakness in their hearts demanded an answer from those not present...`
`"There are only two ways you can be sure someone isn't a suspect.`
` ......If it's yourself, or if they're already no more than a corpse.`
` ......The same goes for Kanon-kun."`
`"Until we catch sight of his corpse, he is the most likely suspect in Jessica-chan's murder!!`
` So take care.`
` Even if he's still alive, even if he smoothes things over with some explanation, you definitely mustn't trust him!`
` Got it?!"`
`No one gave an answer of their own initiative.`
`...However, those who met Aunt Rosa's eyes had to nod their heads...`
`Humans are beings who live by molding themselves to fit society.`
`...In other words, from the time they're born, trusting each other is genetically imprinted on them.`
`...It's...unpleasant to go against that.`
`They never want to suspect someone.`
`...But if they're forced to suspect someone, `
`...they find it safest to choose someone who isn't present at that moment.`
`For the purpose of safety and nothing more, they half-heartedly chose Kanon to be the sacrifice.`
`That's ridiculous......`
`I definitely don't want to believe that Kanon-kun is the culprit!`
`I'd heard it from George-aniki just now, but not only were those two close in age, `
`they also had that kind of adolescent relationship Aunt Rosa had mentioned.`
`...It may be a little late now, but yes, they really did have that kind of air about them.`
`After seeing her parents' tragic corpses, Jessica, bearing deep wounds in her heart, would only have trusted Kanon-kun.`
`...It was very easy to imagine.`
`And that's why I don't like it...!!`
`Kanon-kun was the only one she trusted.`
`So, she wouldn't have let anyone but Kanon-kun in.`
`So, Kanon-kun was the only one who could've killed Jessica?`
` ...I just can't accept that kind of argument...!!!`
`"...Understand?!`
` Even if Kanon-kun appears, don't let your guards down!`
` As long as we cannot prove Kanon-kun's innocence, we will assume that Kanon-kun is the culprit who killed Jessica-chan!!"`
`That was Aunt Rosa's claim.`
`By using the vague word 'assume', ...she managed to convince everyone in the end.`
`Everyone nodded weakly, `
`......and, with the excuse that they were just assuming it for the time being, `
`......they 'concluded' that Kanon was the culprit who had killed Jessica...`
`......I wonder what the dead Jessica and Kanon would think if they could hear this exchange.`
`Jessica...was crying.`
`...She was crying into the chest of the person who had put his life on the line to fight for her, Kanon.`
`It was frustrating.`
`So frustrating that it felt like her chest would explode...`
`She grieved and resented how far the dignity of the dead had been trampled...`
`"...How can...those guys treat Kanon-kun like the culprit?!!"`
`".........Because there's...no corpse."`
`"How can they treat you like the culprit just because there's no corpse?!`
` You risked your life to fight for me, right...?!`
` Then, ...that witch erased the corpse for fun...!`
` For them to call you the culprit after that...it's horrible, it's too horrible!!"`
`"...It's okay.`
` ...I wasn't able to protect you in the end, `
`......but I was able to be of use to you in our final minutes..."`
`"...Why doesn't everyone understand that?!`
` Stop it, Aunt Rosa!!`
` Don't call Kanon-kun the culprit with that messed up logic!!"`
`"......She isn't saying I'm the culprit.`
` ...She's just saying I'm suspicious...`
`no, `
`...she's saying to be careful."`
`"She ~ib~is~ib~ saying it!!`
` These people are saying you're the culprit so they can stop thinking!`
` They aren't thinking about who the culprit who killed me is anymore!!`
` They aren't thinking of the possibility that you aren't the culprit!!`
` And after this, every time something happens, they'll use the excuse that Kanon-kun did it, since we don't know where he is!!`
` ...I can't stand that!!"`
`"......It's okay.`
` ...At least you know the truth."`
`"If only I know the truth, that's pointless!!`
` I know it after dying.`
` Truth belongs to living humans!!`
` If the truth doesn't remain, the dead won't be rewarded!!`
` They won't know what Kanon-kun risked his life for!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* Hahahahahahahahahahahaha!`
` Truly a splendid sight.`
` You hardly ever find a sweeter honey than the laments of the dead."`
`"Lament, lament.`
` No matter how much you lament, the voices of the dead never reach the living."`
`"Damn it, damn iiiiiiit!!`
` It doesn't matter who!!`
` Hear my voice!!`
` Kanon-kun isn't the culprit!!`
` Kanon-kun's corpse was just erased!`
` Why, why don't you understand that?!!"`
`"......Milady."`
`"...I can't stand this!!`
` It's too sad!`
` I hate it!!`
` This way...it's like Kanon-kun died for nothing, right?!!`
` The honor of the dead means nothing unless it's acknowledged by the living!`
` It doesn't matter who!`
` Notice it!`
` Notice it, please!!`
` Kanon-kun isn't the culprit!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahh, don't go, don't go, everyone!!`
` Please, don't let it end like this...!`
` Don't go, ...don't goooooooooooooo!!!"`
`Rosa announced that this room would be sealed until the police came.`
`...The rest didn't want to suspect each other, so they happily accepted that.`
`...For now, they accepted that Kanon was the culprit.`
`...Without even imagining how much disgrace that gave to the dead, they accepted it.`
`"...Milady, ...you've done enough...`
` ...Thank you..."`
`"Don't go!!`
` Don't go, everyone!!`
` I'm begging you, come back!!`
` Don't leave us behind like this!!"`
`"Don't...keep treating Kanon-kun...as the culpriiiiiiiit!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`"It won't reach!!`
` The laments of the dead never reach!"`
`"You make me laugh, yes, that face of yours makes me laugh!!`
` Did you think your voice would reach them?`
` It won't reach, will it, Jessicaaaaaaa???`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, wahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"It's all useless."`
`"Huh?`
` ......Battler-kun, did you say something?"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"Yeah, it's useless.`
` ...~ib~It's all useless~ib~."`
`Just as everyone was about to leave the room...`
`...Battler stood alone with his back to them, still looking down at Jessica's corpse.`
`"What do you mean, ...it's all useless?`
` Do you have some objection...?"`
`"I agree that we've gotta stay on our guards,`
` ...but sorry, I'm not buying all that about Kanon-kun being the culprit."`
`"...Hoh.`
` So you're speaking up at a time like this.`
` If Kanon wasn't the culprit, and it wasn't my doing, how do you explain this closed room that Jessica's room has become...?"`
`"......To be honest, I don't even have a clue on that point.`
` ...Seriously, why'd I have to go and say it's all useless?"`
`"...Guess I'd better take responsibility for my own words.`
` Ihihihihi...!`
` ......I'm empty-handed with zero weapons to argue with.`
` ...But I'm not gonna sit around on the sidelines anymore, Beatrice!!"`
`"...B-Battler-sama..."`
`"...I-Is there some proof that Kanon-kun isn't the culprit...?"`
`The expression that rose to those two faces was definitely one of anticipation.`
`...They didn't want to believe that Kanon was the culprit.`
`They really believed in Kanon.`
`So, they were expectant because they wanted me to strengthen their belief in him even more!`
`"Then, Battler-kun, which of the other servants do you suspect?`
` Gohda-san?`
` Or is it Kumasawa-san?"`
`"Quit it, Aunt Rosa.`
` ...I know the person called Kumasawa baa-chan well.`
` ...She'll sometimes slack off while on the job, but she always makes things fun for people.`
` ...Even if her eyes were dazzled by money, she isn't the kind of person who'd kill for it."`
`"...B-Battler-sama......"`
`"And I just met Gohda-san yesterday.`
` ...Honestly, I still don't really understand him.`
` ...But there is something I do understand."`
`".........I-I......"`
`"...I've never seen anyone who cooks as happily as he does.`
` ...He's the same.`
` The same as Kumasawa baa-chan.`
` ...Gohda-san likes to make people happy."`
`"As if a person like that could kill those who praised his own food as delicious, ...even if money was piled up in front of him!!"`
`"...Then, who do you think killed Jessica-chan, Battler-kun?`
` Who do you think shut Jessica up in a room that could only be locked by a master key?"`
`"Wait.`
` ...Before I argue about that, there's something I wanna make clear.`
` I don't want to talk about, if so-and-so is not the culprit, then so-and-so must be the culprit.`
` ...I just want to talk about how it's completely impossible for Kanon-kun to be guilty."`
`"You say you can prove that Kanon isn't the culprit?`
` *cackle* How?!"`
`"It's actually simple.`
` ...And it's something I almost overlooked.`
` ...Beato!"`
`"Repeat it!!`
` If you can say it, try saying it: 'Kanon-kun had a master key on him'!!"`
`"............Hoh...!"`
`"...Kanon-kun doesn't have a master key on him?!`
` How could you possibly know that?!"`
`"A short while ago, I heard from Gohda-san about what happened.`
` ...About how Jessica went to raid the VIP room,`
` right before she and Kanon-kun went off on their own."`
`"......Gohda-san, you did a good job remembering it.`
` You protected Kanon's honor."`
`"...I-`
`I...`
`...did...?!"`
`"I heard him say the same thing.`
` But I don't really understand!`
` Could you explain it, Battler-kun?!"`
`"...That's right.`
` When Jessica unlocked the VIP room, she borrowed the key from Kanon-kun,`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~but didn't give it back~ib~`
`!`
` So Kanon-kun doesn't have a master key on him!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Is that really so?`
` True, Gohda has no recollection of the master key being returned to Kanon.`
` However, she might have returned it when Gohda wasn't looking!`
` How does that prove that it definitely didn't happen?!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle* If you could just search the pocket of Kanon's corpse, you'd be able to say for sure, but you can't!!`
` It's impossible to prove!!"`
`"It's all useless.`
` It's actually pretty simple, isn't it?"`
`"...No way...!`
` So, you're saying that's why Kanon-kun didn't have a key on him?!"`
`"Yeah.`
` And to prove it, all you have to do is search Jessica.`
` ...Kanon-kun's master key should be in Jessica's pocket.`
` Doctor Nanjo, would you check for us?"`
`"...I-Indeed."`
`Nanjo dashed up to Jessica and searched in her jacket pocket...`
`Everyone...was expectant......!`
`"...Mu..."`
`...Please.`
` Be there......!!`
`"...Here it is!`
` Is this it?"`
`"......Yes.`
` That is a master key.`
` Without a doubt."`
`At Genji's statement, there was a small 'oooh' of joyful voices.`
`"That's Kanon-kun's master key.`
` ......I'll say it again."`
`"'Kanon-kun doesn't have a master key on him.'`
` So there's no way he could've locked the door!!"`
`"...It certainly does...appear that way.`
` ...But Kanon-kun was the last person to meet Jessica-chan.`
` The fact that he's suspicious hasn't changed."`
`"Let's...give that stuff a rest."`
`"...Huh?"`
`"Fundamentally, humans are supposed to be creatures that trust each other.`
` ...But because we live in a tough world, we learn how to be deeply suspicious.`
` ...So we suspect everything.`
` We're sad creatures.`
` ...I won't deny that's our nature."`
`"......But the one thing I won't let you do is reach conclusions without proof!!`
` If someone looks suspicious, that doesn't make them guilty, it makes them innocent!!`
` Of course, the world is filled with wolves.`
` I'm not saying you should carelessly believe everyone!"`
`"But if you're gonna conclude that someone's guilty, you'd better have some perfect evidence!`
` Unless you do, don't go around accusing them based on speculation!!!"`
`"......Nnn...`
` That's......"`
`"...I was the one who brought up 'there's no smoke without fire'.`
` ......That was careless of me.`
` I apologize."`
`"......Battler-sama......"`
`"...W-Wonderful reasoning, Battler-kun!`
` Thank you too, Gohda-san.`
` Because of what you remembered, Kanon-kun's been cleared from suspicion!"`
`"N-No, I...hahahaha..."`
`Clap clap clap...`
` ...It was the crisp sound of the witch applauding.`
`"Well done, well done.`
` ...Not a bad job."`
`"......Crap.`
` Did I fall for that bait piece just like you wanted...?"`
`"You magnificently proved that Kanon at least couldn't lock the door to this room.`
` The servants should all have had master keys.`
` With that as proof, Kanon was treated as the culprit, but you've at least managed to clear away that suspicion.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`"...In that case,`
` ...how did the culprit who killed Jessica lock the door?`
` So that's the problem we have now.`
` Tch.`
` ...I got drawn into exactly the flow you wanted..."`
`"I got you, didn't I...?`
` Furthermore, you said something outrageous about not doubting any of the other servants.`
` Well then, I can't wait to see how you try to smooth that over..."`
`"Shut up.`
` ...Let's start right away.`
` You'll probably just deny it anyway, ...but first let's check the definition of this room as a closed room."`
`"Very well.`
` First, #ff0000there are absolutely no types of hidden doors#ffffff.`
` #ff0000This door is the only way in or out#ffffff.`
` #ff0000The only way to lock this door is with Jessica's single key or the master keys, only one of which is held by each servant#ffffff.`
` It is on the second floor, but it is probably possible to enter or leave through the window.`
` However, #ff0000the window is locked from the inside#ffffff."`
`"...I can spin the chessboard around already.`
` ...If I start by arguing about the door and the lock, I'll probably be stuck dancing on the palm of your hand."`
`"Do as you like.`
` Well then, what should I repeat?"`
`"......Repeat it.`
` 'Kanon-kun was killed in this room'."`
`"Very well.`
` '#ff0000Kanon was killed in this room#ffffff'.`
` But I erased his corpse with magic, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Again, repeat it.`
` 'Kanon-kun's corpse is in this room'."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I refuse.`
` I can't repeat it.`
` ...Because I erased the corpse with magic.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"Yeah, figures you wouldn't say that.`
` ...There's got to be a secret hidden in there somewhere.`
` ...Damn, where's the mysterious point I've gotta find?`
` ......Did they lock it without the master key?`
` Or did they somehow kill those two while they were inside the room and it was locked?`
` Or did they kill those two, and then somehow escape?"`
`"...I hate to say it, but I'll have to cover up the moat first.`
` ...Repeat it.`
` ...'The last time it was locked was due to a master key'."`
`"I also refuse that.`
` *cackle*cackle*."`
`"...This refusing thing is really vague.`
` I don't know if you refuse because it's impossible to repeat, or whether you can repeat it and you're refusing on purpose..."`
`"Back when discussing the lock to the chapel, you completely turned the tables on me.`
` When I have an advantage, there's no need to go out of my way to use red when it might be risky.`
` That's all it is."`
`"......I guess that makes sense.`
` ...Originally, the point of the red was to counter my strange theories."`
`"Naturally, I'll use it in a way that works to my advantage.`
` Now that I know I've got to worry about you twisting it around, I won't use it pointlessly."`
`"...*cackle*cackle*`
` Well then, what move will you use next?`
` I imagine a move placing suspicion on Gohda or Kumasawa will be easiest, yes...?"`
`"...Damn.`
` It feels like you're leading me by the nose, and it pisses me off...`
` Stay quiet a bit, I'm thinking...!"`
`"Of course, this door is the same as the chapel.`
` #ff0000When locked, it does not permit any form of entry#ffffff.`
` I'll say more. #ff0000No trick could have the effect of locking the door from the outside without using a key#ffffff.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"Tch.`
` Damn you for always using red when I don't ask for it..."`
`......Time to step back to square one.`
`...For now, I've just gotta think.`
`I'll lay out everything I know.`
`First, there are two victims.`
`Jessica and Kanon-kun.`
`...Kanon-kun's corpse isn't here, but Beatrice admitted in red that Kanon-kun was killed.`
`So even without a corpse, he's included as a victim.`
`There are a few questionable points.`
`And depending on which I focus on, my line of thought changes a lot.`
`First, after the culprit committed murder in this room, how did they lock it?`
`If we assume the culprit's someone with a master key, it's extremely simple.`
`...But I'd like to avoid that if I can.`
`Because I'd have to suspect Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san...or maybe even Shannon-chan and Genji-san.`
`Here, I noticed something.`
`...I was contradicting myself.`
`I was strangling my own neck.`
`I want to deny Beatrice no matter what.`
`I want to erase the existence of that brutal, fickle, ridiculous witch!`
`So, I have to explain everything with humans, not magic.`
`...But that also means suspecting some human.`
`I don't want to suspect anyone.`
`...Of course, if there's some clear proof, I'll have to believe that the person in question is the culprit,`
` ...but until that happens, I don't want to suspect people.`
`Am I just naive...?`
`Am I just a kid who doesn't want to have my feelings betrayed, when those feelings tell me that this person at least could never commit murder...?`
`I want to deny that a witch did it, and I also want to deny that a human did it.`
`......I don't even know what I'm doing right now...`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` In the first place, the only victory condition in our game was whether or not you could deny my existence.`
` ...Even though that alone put you at a disadvantage, you've increased the number of victory conditions all by yourself, making your own victory harder...!"`
`...It's just as she says.`
`...If I just argue that someone with a master key did it, this closed room can be broken easily.`
`...However, the number of keys that can open this door is limited,`
` and since it's clearly known who has them,`
` using that argument means I'd be suspecting someone I know well...`
`...In fact, ...have I just been averting my eyes from the truth?`
`Even while attacking that closed room trick in the chapel, which was exhilarating to destroy,`
` I proposed that 'someone stole the key from Maria's handbag and returned it'.`
` If that theory's right, then the question becomes who could've stolen the key from her handbag.`
`...Maria's handbag was probably most unguarded while she slept.`
`'!s0`
`......in addition to me, `
`...George-aniki and Jessica are also suspects.`
`So George-aniki or Jessica is the culprit?`
`Or maybe an accomplice?!`
`...All of our parents have been killed, right?!`
`And yet, ...and yet, ...one of us consented to that and assisted with the crime?!`
`We all lamented, mourned, shed tears together in the chapel.`
`...And yet, one among us...was lying?!`
`"...*cackle*cackle*`
` That theory of yours about taking the key out of the handbag and putting it back cast a pronounced suspicion on the cousins, did it not...?`
` And despite that, you acted like you didn't even notice, `
`announcing a theory like that so happily...!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*"`
`"......D-Damn it...`
` That doesn't guarantee that one of the family or the servants is the culprit!`
` If you snuck up on us while hiding in a cardboard box, for example, `
`there's a good chance you could've slunk into our room when we were fast asleep and stolen the key, right?!"`
`"Hmmmmmm.`
` Perhaps that will do for that situation.`
` By suspecting the guest, the 19th person, you won't have to suspect the others."`
`"......In that case, how was Jessica's room locked?`
` It's no trouble at all for me to open the lock with magic, but of course, I don't have a master key.`
` If you deny my magic, you also have to deny that I'm a suspect, correct...?"`
`"So, in other words, that means suspecting one of the 18...!!"`
`"...O-Oh, yeah, thanks for the help.`
` ...I've managed to sort things out a bit.`
` ...My goal is to figure out how the 19th person, the Human guest Beatrice, committed the crimes.`
` If I do that, I won't have to suspect anyone!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` If you can do that?`
` Foolish man.`
` ...This wasn't a closed room from the beginning.`
` After all, there are a total of six keys that can open it."`
`"And several people possessed such keys!`
` You can suspect any of them!`
` Suspect as much as you like!!`
` But you went to all the trouble of denying all of them, making it a closed room yourself."`
`"......Understand?`
` This is a closed room born from your mental contradiction.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` You, and no one else, sealed that door."`
`"...So you're trying to say that I've got two options: `
`...accept that a witch opened it with magic, or accept that someone I know is the culprit.`
` Damn, are you trying to fork the rook?!"`
`"I just wanted to show you that moves such as this can exist as well."`
`"...*cackle*`
` So, what will you do, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeer?`
` Isn't it actually simple...?`
` Don't you just have to make sacrifices of that overly self-confident cook and that hag who wouldn't be a loss if she died?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`'!s0`
` If I suspect Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san, everything will be fine?!`
` That's useless!`
` ......I can't think of Gohda-san as the culprit!`
` I can't think of Kumasawa-san as the culprit!!`
` But I won't accept you!!`
` No matter what!!"`
`"In that case, they'd have to enter the room without using magic or a master key, `
`kill Jessica and Kanon, and even erase Kanon's corpse without using magic."`
`"...How could it be done?!`
` How could it be done so that you can deny me, while still not suspecting anyone else?!!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......I resign."`
`"Huh?`
` Battler-kun, what did you say?"`
`"...I give up.`
` I was able to prove that Kanon-kun couldn't have locked this door.`
` ...But that doesn't mean I've managed to figure out who killed Jessica."`
`"...N-No, ...that's more than enough...`
` Umm, ...for Kanon-kun's sake, `
`...thank you very much...!"`
`"...No need to thank me.`
` After all, ...this means you're under suspicion too, Shannon-chan."`
`"........."`
`"...And sorry, Aunt Rosa.`
` ...It's not like I wanted to resist you.`
` I don't wanna die, and I want to find Dad and the rest's true enemy.`
` ...Sorry for saying something that wasn't cooperative."`
`"...No, it's okay.`
` I was also a little rash.`
` Let's make up.`
` As an aunt and nephew, we have to stay on good terms.`
` ......Right?"`
`Aunt Rosa shifted the gun to one hand and held out her other.`
`...I reached out, and for the time being, we shook hands.`
`Aunt Rosa's gaze was sharp.`
`...In order to deny the witch, she would sacrifice anyone.`
` ...That's what her eyes told me.`
`And me...?`
`I denied the witch.`
`...But I wasn't prepared to lose anything.`
`I was probably the one who seemed to be fighting the most, ...and yet, the one who was most separated from reality.`
`With Jessica's death, it became certain that that the culprit was hiding somewhere nearby, and that they'd come for our lives if they had a chance.`
`According to Genji-san, when tomorrow morning comes, the boat should arrive.`
`The boat had a radio.`
`We'd probably be able to contact the police directly with that.`
`All of us gathered in the parlor and decided to wait quietly until tomorrow.`
`I proposed that we should search throughout the mansion for clues about the culprit,`
` but Aunt Rosa rejected that, saying that if we managed to corner the culprit, or maybe provoke them,`
` it might lead to a third murder.`
`...That was probably the right thing to do.`
`If a bunch of amateurs like us investigated, there's no way we'd find anything.`
`It would be wisest to focus on protecting ourselves without doing anything unnecessary and leave it to the police starting tomorrow.`
`We'd been tense at the beginning, but other than Aunt Rosa,`
` most of us had spent all morning watching TV and getting bored, so our sense of danger had faded considerably.`
`When we thought about it...yes, six adults certainly had been killed together in the first murder,`
` but that made it seem like some back-handed method like poison had been used.`
`And for the second murder, we figured those two became sacrifices because they'd been unfortunately isolated from the rest of us.`
`From this, it was possible to imagine that the culprit wasn't a large number of adults, `
`and that they wouldn't be capable of killing this large group gathered in the parlor all at once.`
`Right now, in this parlor, there's George-aniki and me.`
` Maria.`
` Aunt Rosa.`
` Genji-san, Gohda-san, Shannon-san, Kumasawa-san, ...and then, Doctor Nanjo, for a total of nine people.`
`Furthermore, Aunt Rosa was even armed with a gun.`
`Surely, with this many people staying in this room, they wouldn't be able to touch us easily.`
`That feeling of security, along with the passage of time, allowed us to recover from the shock of that morning bit by bit...`
`By the way, lunchtime had just ended for us.`
`However, it had been a canned food lunch, a far cry from the dinner last night that Gohda-san had skillfully made for us.`
`...Aunt Rosa also suspected that poison may have been used in the first murder.`
`...So, we probably couldn't deny the possibility that the culprit had snuck into the kitchen during all that confusion in the morning...and mixed poison in with the ingredients there.`
`...Aunt Rosa gave orders to all of us saying that, until the police came, we mustn't put anything into our mouths except safe things like canned food.`
`As a cook, Gohda-san must've felt very let down.`
`Apparently eager to display his skill anyway, he said he at least wanted to grab some plates and arrange the canned food on them.`
`At first, Aunt Rosa had been reluctant, examining each one of the plates that were brought, but she hadn't been able to find anything to complain about,`
` and Gohda's 'Chef's Pick Canned Food Lunch Combo' was born.`
`Gohda-san said something about taste being savored not just with the tongue, but with the eyes as well.`
`...I see, it's the same canned food we ate for breakfast, but it feels like something completely different...`
`"Uu-, Battler.`
` Look, look.`
` This is the 'Wolves and Sheep Puzzle'.`
` Uu-."`
`As I was sitting lazily on the sofa, with no desire to watch TV, `
`Maria came over, pulled a picture book out of her handbag, and held it out to me.`
`"...What's that book?`
` 'Wolves and Sheep Puzzle'?`
` .........Let's see."`
`'Wolves and Sheep Puzzle'.`
`It was a phrase that Aunt Rosa had said this morning when we'd gone to call on Jessica.`
`...At the time, I hadn't known what it meant, and right after that was that uproar when Jessica's corpse was found, so I'd forgotten about it completely.`
`The book that Maria held out to me looked like a foreign picture book or something that had been translated.`
`When I opened it, I realized that it was a book stuffed with riddles.`
`"Uu-.`
` So, you have a few wolves and a few sheep, okay?`
` The puzzle is how you take them to the other side using one boat."`
`"...Hmmmm?`
` I've heard of games with rules like that.`
` So this is a version with wolves and sheep?"`
`It was a very simple puzzle, passed on from long ago.`
`Let's try posing a question.`
`On the right bank, there are two wolves and two sheep.`
`There's a boat that as many as two animals can ride on, and using it, you have to move all four of them to the opposite left bank.`
` That's the puzzle.`
`There are two rules.`
`The first is regarding the boat.`
`Even a single wolf or a single sheep can paddle it.`
`But it can only hold two animals.`
`The second rule is regarding the wolves.`
`When they are greater in number than the sheep in any location, they attack the sheep and it's game over.`
`For example, at the start of the game...`
`Let's say the two sheep get in the boat and go to the other side.`
`Then one sheep gets off and the other goes back to the first bank.`
`...When it does, there are two wolves on the first bank. And a single sheep returns there.`
`When that happens, the number of wolves is greater, so the sheep is attacked and it's game over.`
`On either bank or even the boat, there must never be more wolves than sheep.`
`And you've got to shuttle them all across under these conditions.`
`By the way, the right answer is to move both wolves to the opposite bank in the first turn.`
`Then one wolf comes back.`
`On the second turn, you move two sheep to the opposite bank.`
`Then one wolf comes back.`
`Then on the third turn, you put that last wolf that was on the right bank on the boat and cross to the opposite bank, and congratulations, transport successful.`
`Partway, there may be the same number of wolves and sheep in the boat or on either side, but that isn't a problem.`
`You only lose when the number of wolves is greater.`
`This book uses wolves and sheep as an example, but lots of people probably know of this game using different characters...`
`It looked like Maria wanted to test whether I too could solve the puzzles she knew how to solve,`
` and she kept showing me different pages, saying 'solve this one' and 'this one's hard'.`
`So, what was happening when Aunt Rosa first mentioned this puzzle...?`
`That's right.`
`...When we decided to go and get Jessica, we talked about how many men should go, `
`and Aunt Rosa mentioned the 'Wolves and Sheep Puzzle', saying we should all go together...`
`"............Wait a sec..."`
`That could only mean one thing.`
`...Aunt Rosa was saying that there was a wolf among us.`
`So was she thinking...that we'd be safe if the number of wolves and sheep was in balance, but that the wolves would bear their fangs if the situation changed...?`
`At the time we found our parents' corpses, Aunt Rosa already suspected that the servants might be 'wolves'.`
`She'd sniffed out the possibility that, while she didn't know whether it was all of them or some of them, there were 'wolves' hiding among them.`
`...That's no surprise.`
`That murder scene was very elaborate.`
`It's easy to imagine that there were multiple culprits.`
`And because she'd reached that conclusion, when we went to Jessica's room...`
`and learned that Jessica had been killed after being alone with a servant, Kanon, `
`......it isn't hard to imagine why Aunt Rosa suspected the servants so persistently...`
`"You servants,`
` Gohda-san is going to the kitchen to clean the dishes.`
` Just in case, would you please all go with him?"`
`"My apologies, everyone.`
` Let us go as a group."`
`"...Shannon, Kumasawa,`
` we are going."`
`"Yes, yes, coming.`
` Hohohoh."`
`"Well then, George-san, excuse me for now."`
`"Yes.`
` ......Take care.`
` Ah, Aunt Rosa, could I go as well?"`
`"I'm sorry, but would you remain here, George-kun?`
` There's something I want to talk to you about."`
`"...Is that so?`
` Sorry, Shannon.`
` Anyway, take care.`
` ...Don't be alone."`
`"...Yes..."`
`"I'm sorry, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...I wanted to consult you about something."`
`"Yes, ...what could that be?`
` ........."`
`The servants put the dishes and empty cans on the serving cart and started to head out into the corridor.`
`Behind them, Aunt Rosa was talking to Doctor Nanjo about something in a small voice.`
`"...Understood.`
` I will go."`
`"Yes, I'm counting on you."`
`Doctor Nanjo closed the book he had been reading, rose from the sofa, and followed after the servants...`
`Aunt Rosa stuck her head out into the hallway, and after seeing that they were completely out of sight, she closed the door and spoke.`
`"Listen up, everyone.`
` With that, everyone here is an Ushiromiya."`
`"...Hmm?`
` Yes, that's true..."`
`"So you're saying that you've chased out all of the 'wolves',`
` ...Aunt Rosa?"`
`With that one sentence, Aunt Rosa's gaze grew sharp.`
` ...Apparently, she had picked up on the sarcasm.`
`...She laughed lightly.`
`"...Your mind sure works fast, Battler-kun.`
` I like clever kids.`
` It means there's less to explain."`
`"Uu-.`
` Battler's smart...?`
` Can you solve this?`
` Page 64 is hard.`
` Uu-!"`
`"Maria, go watch TV for a bit.`
` Mama wants to talk with Battler-kun and George-kun."`
`".........Uu-."`
`"Aunt Rosa,`
` ...I heard about the puzzle from Battler-kun.`
` ...I don't think it's wrong to be on our guards, but I also think there's such a thing as being too suspicious."`
`"Whether the real culprit is Beatrice or not, `
`there is reason for us to suspect that the servants are in on it.`
` ...In the first murder, where Nii-san and the others were killed,`
` they were treated very brutally, right?`
` Did that look like something that could've been done alone?"`
`"......Maybe the mystery guest, Beatrice-sama, worked all night and did it all."`
`"And what about the master key and the door to Jessica's room?`
` Isn't that proof that one of the servants was involved?"`
`"...Nn........."`
`Only the master key could've locked the door to Jessica's room.`
`...So we can only suppose that one of the servants did it...`
`......No, `
`...wait.`
`"Spin the chessboard around.`
` ...That's strange, Aunt Rosa."`
`"After killing Jessica, why would the culprit go to all the trouble of locking the door?`
` The fact that it was locked made it inevitable that the owners of the master keys would be suspected.`
` ...There was no reason for them to go to all the trouble of locking the door."`
`"...Th-That's right.`
` It's just as Battler-kun says!`
` There was no need for them to go to all the trouble of making themselves look suspicious."`
`"Yes.`
` That's an interesting thought.`
` Of course, I also thought that.`
` ...If that's the case, then the person who locked it wanted to cast suspicion on the servants...and locked it without a master key.`
` But that's impossible.`
` Right?"`
`...That's right.`
`If there existed some trick that could lock that door without a master key, that would make this a great disguise for casting doubt on the servants.`
`...If the culprit's goal was for us to isolate ourselves from the group so they could attack us one by one,`
` this trick would also be effective at giving rise to paranoia.`
`But there was no way to lock that door without using a master key...`
`"How can you be sure there's no way to lock that door without a master key?`
` Isn't that a Devil's Proof, like Rudolf nii-san was talking about earlier?`
` Maybe it `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~was locked by some method we can't think of~ib~."`
`"Even if we can't think of a way, we can't deny the possibility of some unknown trick being used."`
`"......That's true too, I guess.`
` So is that it?`
` No smoke without fire again...?"`
`"I don't know the practical details of the trick, but I have a general idea.`
` My apologies, but if we make the assumption that Kanon-kun was the culprit, it can be explained extremely easily.`
` Even as to why there was no corpse."`
`"Huh...?`
` But Kanon-kun didn't have a master key, right?!`
` Putting aside the other servants, at least Kanon-kun shouldn't have been able to lock the door!"`
`"...I see.`
` ...So that's why you told us to search in the closet and everywhere else right after we entered Jessica's room.`
` ...Aunt Rosa, ...your mind works faster than I would've guessed from how you normally act."`
`"The brain speed of a little sister is always the big sister's minus 1.`
` ...Right now, there's no one I need to worry about offending, which is certainly a relief."`
`George-aniki realized she was referring to Aunt Eva......`
`and seemed a little uncertain about how he should take that sarcasm...`
`"...I-I'm sorry.`
` Could you explain it so even I can understand?`
` Kanon-kun's master key was in Jessica-chan's pocket, closed up inside a closed room.`
` After the door was locked, it should've been impossible to put it in her pocket from outside the room no matter what trick he used...!"`
`"That's not it, Aniki.`
` ...If it was done the way Aunt Rosa's thinking of, ...this trick could only be used by Kanon-kun.`
` ...Plus, the door could be locked without using a key, while the master key was still in Jessica's pocket.`
` ...And, it would also result in his corpse disappearing."`
`"...H-How?!`
` How could he lock the door without a key?!"`
`"It's simple.`
` George-kun, when you return home, you lock the door, right?`
` You twist the knob, *click*, and you're done, right?"`
`"Huh...?!`
`'!s1`
`Could it be...`
`no, but...`
`Kanon-kun was nowhere to be found..."`
`"...It looks like you've got it, Aniki.`
` ......That's what Aunt Rosa was searching the room for.`
` ...She was searching for Kanon-kun, who had locked the door from the inside and stuck the key in Jessica's pocket...`
`before hiding somewhere, waiting for us to walk right past him."`
`It was the simplest kind of closed room trick.`
`...It meant him hiding inside the closed room after the murder was committed.`
`...Then, all he had to do was get out after those who discovered the body left, and the closed room murder would work perfectly...`
`"When we searched that room, we didn't find anything.`
` ...But for all we know, that room might have had a hidden passage that only the servants know about."`
`"We don't know where such a thing might have been hidden, `
`but if we assume there was such a passage, we can conclude that it was impossible for everyone but him."`
`".........Well, about that line of reasoning...`
` ...I thought of that too at the very beginning.`
` ...It's the kind of reasoning I hate most, so I wanted to destroy it right at the start..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...`
` '#ff0000Kanon was killed in this room#ffffff', right?"`
`"You apparently suspected that Kanon was the culprit, so you made me repeat this to destroy that possibility right off the bat.`
` Yes, yes, I understand.`
` *cackle*..."`
`"...So this is what I thought next.`
` I made a theory where there were actually three people in that room.`
` Jessica and Kanon-kun were victims.`
` And the culprit, the guest Beatrice, was also there with them."`
`"You wanted to make it 'the human me' who committed the crime without using magic.`
` I see, a bizarre theory that suits you perfectly.`
` *giggle*giggle*."`
`"...I guessed that you killed those two, then locked the door from the inside.`
` And that you carried Kanon-kun's corpse away using some secret method that normal people wouldn't notice.`
` ...In other words, you used a secret door to escape."`
`"But you told me it in red.`
` ...You said no kind of hidden door existed in that room."`
`"Indeed.`
` There can exist no secret passages that you all are not aware of.`
` Was it Knox who said it, or was it Van Dine?`
` It seems that in mystery novels, there must never be hidden passages.`
` I simply followed that etiquette."`
`"So even without having to thoroughly search the room, a famous detective could conclude that no secret passages exist.`
` ......*cackle*cackle* Humans playing detective have it so easy."`
`"Damn you, talking so big...`
` Thanks.`
` Thanks to the mighty witch being so diplomatic, I get to conclude that the room has no hidden doors without searching the whole thing."`
`"Indeed.`
` #ff0000There are no hidden doors in this room#ffffff.`
` #ff0000There is no way to get in or out other than the door and the windows#ffffff."`
`"...Which means...`
`...that the theory Aunt Rosa's so confident in...`
`is wrong.`
` ...Also, annoyingly, it's impossible to disprove her theory.`
` If you, the witch, say '`
`#ff0000there are no hidden doors#ffffff' in red, then it's settled."`
`"...However, no matter how much a human like me tries to argue against her, Aunt Rosa probably won't accept it.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~Humans can't prove there's no hidden door~ib~`
`.`
` It's a Devil's Proof.`
` ......Damn.`
` It sure is convenient being a witch..."`
`"...No way!`
` To call Kanon-kun the culprit because of a hidden door we don't even know exists...`
` I...can't accept that."`
`"If you can't accept it, then find me a different theory that's more convincing.`
` ......There is none.`
` I've been thinking this whole time.`
` There's no other option!"`
`"............"`
`"George-kun, you and Shannon-chan are close, right?`
` I imagine that's why you find it so hard to accept that all the servants are culprits.`
` Even I don't want to believe that Shannon-chan is in league with the culprit.`
` ......But whether they're all in it together or not, there's definitely a culprit, or maybe an accomplice, in that group.`
` That point alone is something you absolutely need to understand!"`
`"...If you guessed there were wolves besides Kanon-kun, `
`...does that mean the uproar you caused by accusing Kanon-kun in Jessica's room was to gauge the reactions of the other servants...?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` And as a result, I began to suspect them even more.`
` ...There certainly is a wolf among the servants.`
` Certainly.`
` And, just like in the 'Wolves and Sheep Puzzle', while they may be docile most of the time, they'll surely attack if they get the chance."`
`"...Jessica-chan was a lone sheep on the boat.`
` ...In Maria's version of the puzzle, they may not attack when there's an equal number of wolves and sheep, but our puzzle is different.`
` Depending on the situation and the number of people, they'll attack even if there is a balance.`
` Just like when Jessica-chan was killed!"`
`"......Th-Then there's something that makes me mad!`
` If that's true, then when you made Shannon go to the kitchen, you put her in a dangerous situation, didn't you?!!`
` We should go to the kitchen right now too!`
` No matter who may or may not be a wolf!`
` If staying together means we remain in balance, I think we should keep it that way!!"`
`"...Shannon-chan went to see Father along with Genji-san.`
` At that time, she was supposedly isolated, but she wasn't killed.`
` Was it because Genji-san wasn't a wolf either?"`
`"...Wrong!`
` It's because they were both wolves!!"`
`"Shannon isn't the kind of person who would take part in a crime!!`
` I can't let a comment like that slide, not even from you, Aunt Rosa.`
` I demand that you take back what you just said...!"`
`"...I hate saying this in front of Aniki, but the way you're arguing...`
`feels just like something Aunt Eva might say.`
` It's like you're automatically assuming that you're right, unless we can counter your argument.`
` ...Looks like you can't fight against your own blood after all, Aunt Rosa."`
`"......Even I can't think of myself as very praiseworthy right now.`
` But guess what? I'm a mother!`
` I'd become even a demon to protect Maria's safety.`
` I really wish I could shut myself away somewhere alone with her."`
`"...But I also plan to act as a mother to you two.`
` Right now, you're practically my children.`
` ...Even if you aren't my own, ...I won't forsake you.`
` ......No matter what."`
`"...Well, thanks for that."`
`"I just wanted to warn you not to be careless, as your mother.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~ Stay where I can see you at all times~ib~.`
` I will protect you."`
`"And at the same time, you'll be observing us to make sure we aren't 'wolves'.`
` ...Yeah, thanks a lot for that.`
` Can you, Aunt Rosa, prove that you aren't a 'wolf' yourself?"`
`"Yes, I can."`
`"That's a quick answer.`
` How?"`
`"With this.`
` ...This is my proof."`
`Aunt Rosa lifted her gun and pointed the barrel at me.`
`But it was only for an instant.`
`She immediately lowered the gun, laughing impishly.`
`...But to me, the time I spent staring down the barrel of that gun felt like an eternity.`
`"...How does that gun prove that you aren't the culprit, Aunt Rosa?"`
`"Think about it.`
` What if I were the culprit?`
` Would I really give up the once-in-a-lifetime chance I got when the servants left?`
` I could just shoot you, *bang*, and think of a fitting excuse later.`
` Something like, Beatrice appeared outside the window and started shooting at us.`
` I'd just need to leave two empty cartridges on the ground and say I fired back at her twice."`
`"Well, that's a crazily violent way to argue it, but it does make sense. Ihihihi!"`
`"There's something Krauss nii-san used to say all the time, long ago.`
` Might is right.`
` ......Maybe that really is true."`
`"......I'm sorry, you two.`
` I've somewhat lost my composure after all the crimes since this morning.`
` You know how I normally am, so I must seem desperate and a bit short-tempered right now.`
` ...But please understand.`
` I want to protect you from a malicious culprit.`
` I will become a demon to do that.`
` That's all there is to it.`
` ...I'm sorry for saying something that's angered you.`
` Battler-kun, George-kun,`
` ...let's make up."`
`An unsatisfied expression rose to George-aniki's face.`
`...He probably couldn't forgive the damage done to Shannon's honor.`
`...What about me...?`
`Several bits of circumstantial evidence hinted at the servants' participation.`
`...I didn't want to believe that one of them was the culprit, or possibly colluding with the culprit,`
` ...but in our current situation, that was little more than wishful thinking.`
`Whom should I believe?`
`In the first place, who is the culprit?`
`Are there accomplices?`
`And if so, how many?!`
`...It seems I've only been suspecting the people we know.`
`...I quickly forgot that 19th person, `
`the guest, Beatrice, who arrived yesterday and boldly claimed to be the Golden Witch.`
`In fact, I still haven't seen her face.`
`I heard she greatly resembled the witch in that portrait,`
` but since I haven't seen her directly, no matter how hard I try, it doesn't really feel to me like a 19th person is on this island.`
`...So, I've been subconsciously hallucinating that the culprit's one of the 18...`
`Damn it...`
` Come out, Beatrice.`
`If you're the bad guy, then act like the bad guy and show yourself, laughing in a high-pitched voice and mocking us.`
`Just like a bad guy in one of those dramas who, even when they're exposed as the culprit, `
`aggressively says 'where's your proof?'`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` Where's your proof?"`
`"Shut up, no more talking..."`
`There were five humans in the kitchen, but it was very quiet, filled only with the sound of the rain.`
`It was only accented by the sound of Shannon and Kumasawa washing the dishes.`
`Gohda was using the leftovers from breakfast and lunch as ingredients for a soup.`
`...Rosa had suspected that poison might've been added to the food, so they'd decided to eat canned goods, but it hadn't been too satisfying.`
`But Gohda thought she was being too cautious.`
`So, he was spontaneously creating a soup to be served only to those who wanted some.`
`Shannon and Kumasawa were washing the dishes that the food had been arranged on.`
`On the inside, they thought maybe Gohda should wash them, since he'd been the one who'd wanted the food arranged on plates in the first place,`
` but they left their complaints unsaid for the time being.`
`Genji and Nanjo were facing each other across a crude chess set that had many years of experience.`
`...The game had still only just begun.`
`And, because the opening game of these experienced players had been honed to perfection,`
` it looked like a ceremony where they just moved specified pieces in a specified order.`
`"That's a nice aroma...`
` You wouldn't get this from canned food."`
`"It was made only from sealed ingredients, so there won't be any poison mixed in.`
` I am making enough for everybody, so please, eat.`
` Of course, I will also taste for poison.`
` Please feel secure and eat."`
`"That really is a nice aroma.`
` Gohda-san, the food you cook really is delicious."`
`"Being able to create delicious food when you buy delicious ingredients is hardly special.`
` ...My master taught me that a true cook needs to perfect their ability to make delicious food from whatever is on hand."`
`"That was a good master.`
` Thanks to him, it looks like we'll get to enjoy some truly delicious soup."`
`"...Although it is a shame that it was made from ingredients intended for all of the family members to eat."`
`"I'm sure Rosa-san is tired after everything that happened this morning.`
` It is only natural."`
`"But thanks to that, we get to drink some soup made from delicious ingredients, hohohoh."`
`Rosa had fervently warned everyone that they didn't understand the danger they were in, and that they must assume that poison was mixed in with the food.`
`The mood at the time had led them to agree, `
`but hunger wasn't something that could be swayed by a momentary emotion like that.`
`"Ironically, we've ended up with a soup that we normally wouldn't be able to savor.`
` If possible, I would like to serve it to everyone in the parlor, but..."`
`"...Seeing that it would violate Rosa-sama's instructions, you had best give up on that idea.`
` ...It's enough that only those who want to eat it do so."`
`"Hohohohoh.`
` Skillfully taking a breather when no one's looking is also an important skill for a servant, isn't it?"`
`When Kumasawa cackled, Shannon and Gohda laughed too.`
`It seemed that, in this space where only their fellow servants were gathered, they could relax quite a bit.`
`Shannon didn't like Gohda's occasional dishonesty,`
` but she knew that there was no falsehood in his childish smile when he cooked, `
`nor in his desire for people to enjoy his food.`
`So even though it was a little aggravating to be made to wash the dishes, `
`she couldn't really hate him.`
`However, they couldn't have dreamed that Rosa was calling them wolves in the parlor at exactly the same moment they were spending their time peacefully like this...`
`At that time, several of the servants heard a sound like something being dragged, and then a *thump*.`
`It seemed like the sound made by a servant outside the back door when they were carrying a mountain of trash bags on a rainy day,`
` or maybe when a servant was returning from work wearing a raincoat.`
`So at first, that sound didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary to any of them...`
`But they soon realized.`
`......Right now, everyone was either in the kitchen or in the parlor, so who could possibly be at the back door...?!`
`As the servants all looked at each other, they checked to make sure that each one of them knew what that sound meant.`
`"...Wh-Who could it be...?"`
`The servants knew the mansion's layout well.`
`So they understood how incomprehensible it would be for someone from the parlor to actually go outside in this typhoon,`
` go all the way around, and come up to this back door.`
`Then was it Kinzo?`
` ...They couldn't imagine that Kinzo, who never left his study, `
`would dash out into the middle of this typhoon and come to the back of the house, where only low-class people ever entered or exited.`
`'!s1`
`That wasn't...`
`our imagination, was it...?"`
`"......Awawawawawawawawa..."`
`Shannon and Kumasawa drew close together, fearfully looking at the back door...`
`"...Wh-Who is it...?"`
`As Gohda fearfully approached the back door, he called out.`
`...And his eyes flashed towards the butcher's knife that sat in a nearby sink.`
`...He didn't pick it up yet.`
`Because there was still a possibility that this was a member of the family.`
`However, that possibility was impossible...`
`There was no response from across the door to Gohda's initial question.`
`...Maybe his voice had been so quiet that it hadn't reached through all the wind and rain outside.`
`"......Genji-san."`
`"...Yes.`
` ......Stand back, Doctor Nanjo and the women."`
`"...Wh-Who in the world could it be..."`
`Genji took a knife with a classical design from a stationary box placed near the chess set.`
`...It was something to be used instead of a paper knife to open envelopes for statements of delivery and bills.`
`But it was still a knife.`
`So the blade on it could injure someone...`
`Genji hid it in his sleeve with a well-practiced motion.`
`Then, he approached the back door himself, giving Gohda a silent nod.`
`Gohda cautiously approached the back door......and slowly started to open it...`
`'!s0`
`The shadow of a person suddenly shuffled into sight, landed on its knees, and fell over.`
`Gohda fell backwards onto his backside and couldn't get up.`
`That human shadow was soaked with rain, smeared with mud, and drenched with blood...`
`"...K-Kanon-kun?!`
` Kanon-kun!!"`
`"......Kanon,`
` are you all right...?`
` Doctor Nanjo...!"`
`It was Kanon.`
`...His breath was feeble, ...and the puddles of mud he left were quickly drenched bright red.`
`When Nanjo held him and turned him face up, there was a deep, gruesome wound right in the center of his chest, as though he'd been stabbed there by a spear or something.`
`Even now, deep-red blood poured out from there...!`
`"...Th-Th-Th-This is horrible...`
` Wh-What shall we do, get a first aid kit? A first aid kit?!"`
`"Kanon-kun, place your hand against the wound!`
` Please, push firmly!`
` Let's carry him to the bed in the servant room!!`
` Everyone, please, lend a hand."`
`"C-Come now, Kanon-san!`
` Please, hang in there a little longer...!"`
`"Hang in there!!`
` It'll be okay!!`
` So don't take your hand from the wound...!!"`
`"At any rate, let us carry him to the servant room.`
` ...Kumasawa, inform Rosa-sama that we have found Kanon."`
`"......W-Wait......`
` ...Not...`
`...Rosa-sama......"`
`"...Please wait!`
` Kanon-san said...not Rosa-sama..."`
`"...Wh-What do you mean, Kanon-kun...?!"`
`"......This is no time for that.`
` Let us quickly carry him to the servant room.`
` Kumasawa, do not tell Rosa-sama yet.`
` ...We will do it after we hear the situation from Kanon."`
`"...Y-Yes, `
`...eeeeekk..."`
`He had told them not to tell Rosa...right after appearing in this state.`
`...This could only mean something very disquieting.`
`...An eerie anxiety rose to their faces...`
`"C-Come now, everyone!`
` Let's hurry and carry him...!`
` Quickly, quickly...!"`
`Kanon's wound was unbelievably deep,`
` ...and judging from Nanjo's pale face, it was a miracle that he was still conscious...`
`"...This is...horrible...`
` He appears to have been stabbed by something like a spear.`
` I-If it hasn't reached the lungs, I might be able to do something...`
` At any rate, we must stop the bleeding...!"`
`'!s0`
`No matter how much Nanjo tried to wipe off that gushing, deep-red blood, ...he couldn't do it he couldn't do it he couldn't wipe it all away...!`
` And each time, the wound was aggravated, causing Kanon to cry in anguish...`
`"Kanon-kun, Kanon-kun, Kanon-kun!`
` Hang in there, ...hang in there...!!"`
`"Doctor Nanjo!`
` Here's a new towel...!`
` ...How...horrible...!!"`
`"What is his condition...?"`
`"......In all honesty, ...this is so severe that I cannot believe he is alive...`
` Maybe the location of the wound was fortunate...`
` But the blood loss is too horrible...!`
` A blood transfusion is necessary, but that will be impossible until tomorrow...!"`
`'!s1`
`...*cough*cough*!!`
` ...R-`
`Rosa-sama...`
`......to us...`
`ugaaaaaa!!"`
`"D-Don't talk, Kanon-kun!`
` Your wound will open...!"`
`'!s1`
`...t...`
`...to Milady...`
`and me...and..."`
`"...Wh-What did you say...?"`
`"Rosa-sama...did...?`
` Ooooooh, ...could that mean, could that mean..."`
`"...Are you certain?"`
`"Yes......`
` ...I'm certain...it was Rosa-sama......"`
`"Come now, don't speak any more...!`
` Kumasawa-san, please grab another first aid kit!"`
`"......Genji-san,`
` ...is it possible Rosa-sama...did such a thing?"`
`"......I do not know."`
`Disregarding Nanjo and Kumasawa, who were struggling hard and stained with blood as they tried to stop the bleeding, Genji and Gohda faced each other...`
`...Because if what Kanon had said was the truth, `
`...Rosa was the culprit who killed Jessica.`
`"Curse you, Rosa...`
` How could you do that to Milady...`
` ...I'll kill you, ...I WILL KILL YOU...UGGGGGGGHHH...!"`
`Kanon screamed even more hatefully...`
`...His hate-filled voice made it seem like he was seeing Jessica being harmed right before his eyes.`
`"...C-Certainly, Rosa-sama may have had a reason to kill Milady.`
` If everyone in the Ushiromiya family were destroyed, the inheritance would all go to Rosa-sama..."`
`"If so, Battler-sama and George-sama are in danger...!`
` Not only is Rosa-sama holding a gun, but right now, they are the only ones in the lounge...!`
` Genji-san, isn't this situation quite perilous...?!"`
`"............"`
`"............"`
`Shannon suddenly ran out into the corridor.`
`...Her expression was complex and tragic, as though she didn't know what to believe...`
`Shannon ran.`
` To where?`
`...The inside of the mansion had been scrupulously cleaned, so it probably wouldn't be easy to find.`
`She might find it if she searched the rose garden, but they'd probably all been lost in this wind and rain...`
`That's right, ...the boiler room isn't cleaned very often.`
`...If she went there, ...she might be able to find it...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`Shannon ran downstairs to find `
`~ib~that~ib~`
` in the underground boiler room...`
`Did some medicine take effect at the brink of death, `
`or was Kanon finally beyond feeling pain?`
`...For the time being, at least Kanon's painful gasping had subsided.`
`Nanjo apparently didn't view this as a very good sign, ...and he didn't let his eyes off Kanon for a second.`
`Kumasawa firmly gripped Kanon's hand and kept encouraging him, so that the willpower keeping him alive didn't fade away.`
`Genji and Gohda seemed uncertain how to respond to the truth Kanon had risked his life to deliver...`
`"......Rosa-sama's gun surely has four or five shots loaded."`
`"That is no small number.`
` ...But loading cartridges into a Winchester should require quite a lot of practice.`
` She might be able to get one shot off, but if everyone attacks her at once, we should be able to take the gun from her before she shoots again..."`
`"......We may have a doctor on this island, but we have no access to medicine and no hospital.`
` ...If the location of the shot is bad, that person will die."`
`"I understand that, `
`...but more importantly, if we don't move quickly, there's a chance another crime will occur...!`
` It seems to me that Rosa-sama managed to cleverly chase us out.`
` Maybe George-sama and Battler-sama are being killed right now...!"`
`"............"`
`"...Hoh, ...hohohohoho.`
` If our foe is so dangerous, wouldn't it be better if we didn't provoke them too much...?"`
`"But tomorrow is still a long way off...!`
` We can't even imagine what strategies she might use!`
` Genji-san, we should take action first.`
` If we can at least steal the gun under some pretext, it might work out...!"`
`"There are four or five cartridges, are there not?`
` That means there aren't enough to kill all of us...`
` As long as we don't carelessly provoke her, surely even Rosa-sama wouldn't be that rash..."`
`"......No, she said it.`
` She said she'll massacre all of us."`
`Kanon, who they'd thought was sleeping quietly, suddenly started talking brightly.`
`Almost as though he'd been awake this whole time and had suddenly opened his mouth.`
`Kanon looked firm and steady, which relieved Nanjo a bit, but considering the depth of that wound, he couldn't wipe away a certain creepy feeling.`
`...He knew because he was a doctor.`
`After losing so much blood, Kanon might easily have lost consciousness.`
`And yet, somehow, he was still intensely aware of his surroundings.`
`...Was it youth?`
` Or was it tenacity?`
`...Sometimes, the power of human life surpassed common knowledge...`
`While stopping the bleeding, Nanjo had groped around a bit inside the bleeding hole with tweezers, making sure there were no foreign objects inside the affected area, `
`and the great depth of the wound had shocked him.`
`...It had certainly reached as far as his lungs.`
`...And yet, ...and yet...`
`...No, but...the fact that he's still alive is wonderful...`
`...But Kanon had spoken clearly.`
`...He'd hatefully stated that the one named Rosa made this wound, cursing and raging, over and over and over.`
`"...She wants to kill everyone by any means necessary before the typhoon passes, so that she can have the Master's wealth all to herself.`
` She told me that clearly."`
`"......Damn...!`
` What a person...`
` Genji-san, what should we do?!`
` Are there any weapons we can..."`
`"...I find it hard to believe.`
` ...To think that Rosa-sama would say something like that..."`
`"Genji-sama, it isn't a question of whether you believe or not.`
` She told me.`
` I heard it.`
` WHY won't you believe me?"`
`"D-Don't get up...`
` You'll harm your wound..."`
`Kanon sat up on the bed, speaking to Genji, who didn't seem to be willing to believe Kanon's story.`
`"She'll definitely kill all of us.`
` She must've killed everyone in the parlor by now.`
` If we don't kill her first, we'll definitely be killed first.`
` Just like how I was killed first, everyone else will also be killed first.`
` Kill or be killed.`
` Kill or be killed or kill or be killed."`
`"...K-Kanon-san, ...does that...`
`...really not hurt...?"`
`"...Oh, this?`
` This is nothing."`
`"Wh-What do you mean, it's nothing? ...You're..."`
`"It really isn't a big deal.`
` It doesn't even hurt anymore. It's really nothing."`
`As Kanon said that, he began to untie the bandages that had been painstakingly wrapped...`
`The gruesome hole in his chest was immediately exposed...`
`"K-Kanon-san...!`
` You mustn't do that!`
` Lie down, quickly...!"`
`"I said it's fine.`
` ...Hey.`
` See...?`
` This is...nothing, right...?"`
`Kanon showed off his gaping wound, which was still slowly spitting out foamy blood.`
`...Everyone averted their eyes reflexively.`
`"Look, I told you it wasn't a serious wound at all..."`
`"...St-Stop, ...you mustn't play with the wound..."`
`"...Come on, see?`
` ...It isn't...a deep wound at all.`
` ......Look.`
` ......Look."`
`Kanon held up two fingers, showed them to everyone, and slowly started to stick them into the gruesome wound right in the center of his chest...`
`...Plunging, slimy, squishy, wet.`
`The fingers...went in deep...all the way to their bases...`
`...*squish*, *gloop*, *bloop*...`
`"Eeeeeeeeeeeeek...!!`
` K-K-K-Kanon-san, stop it, stop it...!!"`
`Those fingers were sticking all the way into his chest, ...up to their bases,`
` ...and then he slowly pulled them out in exactly the same way...`
`The fingers he pulled out...were stained a sticky, solid, deep-red color, and there was even a thread hanging...`
`...The fingers were...covered...up to their bases...in deep-red...`
`'!s1`
`You...`
` ...Wh-Wh-Wh-What in the world.........?"`
`"......See?`
` It is...not a serious wound...at all, see?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`At that moment, the door was slammed open, and Shannon appeared.`
`...Even after she saw Kanon, stained with fresh blood, her impregnable expression didn't falter.`
`"...Hey, Nee-san.`
` Where'd you go?`
` I'm on the verge of death here, so where'd you go?"`
`"That's right.`
` I went to the boiler room.`
` There was something I had to find.`
` ...More importantly, there's something I need to ask you.`
` Are you...really Kanon-kun?"`
`"...Huh, ...what...?"`
`It was only natural.`
` Everyone believed he was Kanon.`
`So they couldn't understand the meaning of Shannon's question.`
`When they looked, they noticed that Shannon was holding a handkerchief in her hand.`
`It was filthy and looked like it had been used to wipe up some trash or dust.`
`And while holding that, she approached Kanon, ......drawing closer to his feet.`
`"What is that...?"`
`"It's a handkerchief with a spider's web wiped onto it."`
`".........`
`...Why would you bring something like that?"`
`"If you're Kanon-kun, you should be fine.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` But `
`~ib~if spiders are your natural enemy~ib~`
`, I thought you might not like it."`
`".........`
`Hahaha, are you kidding?`
` Why would I hate spiders?"`
`"Sorry, I'll try it."`
`"...Sh-Shannon-san."`
`When Shannon brought that handkerchief close to Kanon's thigh, ...something happened in an instant.`
`It happened all at once.`
`The human eye couldn't have followed it.`
`Kanon jumped like a wild goat, ...fleeing from the thing Shannon was holding.`
`Then, from his arm, some kind of afterglow flashed purple and drew a curve through space.`
`That arc, which drew three beautiful purple curves, traced across the throats of Nanjo and Kumasawa, who had been tending to him.`
`And, in an instant, Nanjo's and Kumasawa's throats...opened like gaping mouths, ...and then the blood really started spewing out.`
`The third purple curve should have traced across Shannon's throat.`
`But Shannon wasn't there.`
`Because Genji, who had been behind her, had wrapped his own arm around Shannon's neck and pulled her back.`
`This all happened in an instant.`
`".........!!!"`
`In the instant it took Gohda to think fast in an attempt to understand this scene, the frozen moment in time shattered.`
`Blood was gushing from Nanjo and Kumasawa's torn-open necks.`
`Kanon jumped and kicked off a picture frame that had been hanging from the wall behind him, springing forward just like a cat and aiming for Shannon's throat again.`
`But Kanon's target once again disappeared from in front of him.`
`Because Genji had pulled Shannon again, and the two of them had fallen to the ground in a defensive crouch.`
`"Nice reflexes, you senile old furniture!!"`
`"...Gohda!"`
`"O-Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhh!!"`
`Even Gohda was no fool.`
`Even if he couldn't fully understand what was going on, he at least realized that if this 'Kanon' wasn't seized, his own life would also be in peril.`
`He sprung at Kanon with his huge body, pushing him up against the wall with all his weight and physical strength.`
`"Ooooooooooooooooooohhh...! Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"L...et...go, fatass!!"`
`Another purple curve was drawn from the tips of the fingers on Kanon's right hand.`
`And when he raised that hand like a sword, aiming for Gohda's back, there was a loud *thunk*.`
`Because Kanon's raised hand had been pinned to the wall.`
`He couldn't tear his palm away from the wall.`
`Sticking out from it...was the knife Genji had thrown.`
`Under normal circumstances, it would've been surprising to see someone as old as Genji handle a knife so skillfully,`
` but in this abnormal space, no one paid it much mind.`
`"Genji-sama, take this...!"`
`"...Indeed."`
`Genji took the handkerchief with the spiderweb stuck to it from Shannon.`
`And he approached Kanon, who was pinned to the wall by Gohda's massive body and the knife.`
`"St...op it...!!`
`'!s0`
` Stop it, st...op!!`
`'!s0`
`When Genji pushed the handkerchief up against Kanon's face, `
`...there was a sound just like setting meat on a red-hot iron plate.`
`Of course, the smell was the same too.`
`As he was horribly burned, festering in filthy red and black and crying out in his death throes, Kanon's body burst open and scattered.`
`It was almost as though a balloon filled with gold leaf had popped.`
`The entire servant room was completely buried under a storm of gold leaf...no, a cloud of gold butterflies...`
`Those butterflies began to softly fade, as though into water...or rather, into the empty air itself,`
` ...and afterwards, all that was left was the three survivors sitting on their butts, stained with blood.`
`However, not everyone was merely stained with blood.`
`Some of them were lying on the ground, spurting out blood themselves.`
`"...Kumasawa...!`
` ...Doctor Nanjo...!`
` ........."`
`Slits so sharp they looked like they'd cut your finger if you touched them opened wide...and large amounts of blood kept pouring out...`
`"What ~ib~was~ib~ that, ......j-just now......"`
`"............"`
`"......Gohda,`
` have you been injured?"`
`"I-I am fine...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` But, ......what did we just see?!`
` What happened?!`
` ...I-I-I-I know I pushed that thing against this wall with my own hand, but...`
`even I ~ib~cannot understand what happened~ib~...!!"`
`Gohda looked at his own hand.`
`The bright-red blood left from his scuffle with Kanon...definitely remained.`
`...And yet, Kanon was nowhere to be seen.`
`Because he had disappeared.`
`He had transformed into gold butterflies and scattered.`
`Gohda kept screaming alone, without a clue about what was going on.`
`Shannon sobbed in front of Nanjo's and Kumasawa's remains...`
`as Genji watched over her, silent as always...`
`"Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa-san were?!`
` What on earth are you talking about?!"`
`"Aaah, Shannon!`
` Thank goodness you're safe...!`
` If something had happened to you, I...!"`
`"...George-sama, `
`...uuuuu......"`
`"George-kun, be quiet for a second!`
` A murder occurred before your very eyes, right?!`
` Did you see the culprit?!`
` Or not?!!"`
`"...Th-That is, umm, `
`...how should I explain...?!`
` G-Genji-san."`
`"......Even we cannot adequately explain what happened in front of us."`
`"It certainly, umm, ...happened right before our eyes!`
` ~ib~It~ib~ was right in front of my eyes!`
` However, `
`...it was, umm, `
`......what was it...?`
` Even I don't understand!"`
`"What are you saying?!`
` You couldn't have met anyone except the witch, Beatrice, whose location has been unknown since yesterday,`
` or Kanon-kun, who's gone missing!`
` Was it a man or a woman?!`
` You should be able to tell me at least that much, right?!"`
`"Aunt Rosa, calm down a bit...!`
` Anyone would be confused if two people were taken out right in front of them!`
` Gohda-san, Genji-san,`
` there's no need to rush.`
` Tell us what happened, one thing at a time."`
`"......As to that, ...how should I say it..."`
`"............"`
`Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa-san had been killed.`
`We understood that much.`
`...And it seemed that it had occurred in front of these people's eyes.`
`But even so, they spoke awkwardly.`
`They admitted that they had definitely seen the crime with their own eyes.`
`But when asked to explain what they had seen, their mouths went suddenly shut.`
`I could understand why Aunt Rosa was irritated and flaring up...`
`"...Shannon,`
` did you see it?`
` When Doctor Nanjo was attacked?"`
`"...Y-Yes."`
`"Tell me.`
` ...Just what you understand.`
` What in the world happened?"`
`"......Someone came......`
`...to the back door."`
`"...Th-That's right.`
` Someone came up to the back door.`
` Then, wondering who it was, I opened the door..."`
`"Someone at the back door?`
` Who was it?!"`
`"Let them finish!`
` And after that?!"`
`"......That person was...stained with blood...and had a large wound.`
` ...We carried that person to the servant room, and Doctor Nanjo immediately began first aid.`
` ...It was...a very deep wound."`
`"Like I said, who are you talking about?!"`
`"...I don't know!`
` Certainly, ...in the beginning, I thought that was the case.`
` No, I still think that!`
` But......what in the world was that!!`
` ...I don't know, ...I don't know!!"`
`In a manner that didn't match his large body, Gohda held his head and scratched at it...`
`I didn't have a clue if he was confused because he couldn't remember...`
`or because he'd seen something terrifying and couldn't accept it.`
`And Shannon looked the same way.`
`If she let her guard down, what she'd seen just a short while ago would quickly melt away like a daydream, `
`and she wouldn't be able to remember anything.`
`...That's what she looked like.`
`Only Genji looked composed as usual.`
`...So the questions were naturally directed at him.`
`However, even Genji took quite some time before he spoke, and he had to gather his thoughts.`
`"Genji-san,`
` you saw it, right?`
` Who came in through the back door?!"`
`"......At first, ...we believed that person...was Kanon."`
`"You see!!`
` He was alive after all!`
` My theory was correct!!"`
`"...By 'at first', you mean that your impression changed later, right...?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......I cannot explain with words what happened after that.`
` ...He killed Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa, ...then disappeared.`
` At that time, he was definitely not Kanon..."`
`"Yes!`
` That's right!`
` It's just as Genji-san says!!`
` You really couldn't explain it with words!"`
`"...Do you have the same opinion?"`
`"...Yes......`
` I...can only say the same thing..."`
`"............"`
`...If we give their claims the benefit of the doubt,`
` ...it means that Aunt Rosa's first conclusion was correct.`
`Kanon had appeared near the back door to the kitchen with a serious injury.`
`Then, he had been taken to the servant room and cared for.`
`...And after that, something terrifying had happened.`
`So, were these people so convinced that Kanon-kun couldn't possibly have done such a thing...`
`that they'd started to suspect whether it had even been Kanon-kun at all?`
`In other words, that means...Kanon-kun did appear.`
`No matter how confused they are, no matter how they muddle their words, that's what it means in the end.`
`So, does that mean that, after all, Kanon-kun used some trick to escape that room even though it was locked?!`
` No, that doesn't matter anymore.`
`The real problem is that Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa-san were killed.`
`Aunt Rosa has claimed that Kanon-kun was behind this from the very beginning.`
`No matter how confused these people are, no matter how much they try to deny it, ...they're halfway confirming that she was right.`
`...But even so, for some reason, I felt like their awkwardness couldn't be explained by confusion alone...`
`...What did they see?`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`Like they said, did they really ~ib~see something that couldn't be explained with words~ib~...?`
`Aunt Rosa, who'd decided that further talk wouldn't get us anywhere, `
`concluded her questioning and said she wanted to check the two bodies.`
`That was something I'd been wanting to do too.`
`The witnesses had been unable to figure anything out, but they'd been shaken.`
` ...If those of us who hadn't been at the scene calmly looked at the corpses, we might find something.`
`......But it was a little surprising to learn that Aunt Rosa was also concerned about the bodies.`
`Even at this point, I still wanted to use any clues I could find to expose the culprit and the truth myself.`
`But it should've been different in Aunt Rosa's case.`
`...Hasn't Aunt Rosa prioritized staying safe over finding the culprit?`
`I couldn't really see why she would go to all the trouble of leaving our barricade in the parlor, just because she wanted to check the bodies.`
`"We will all go to the servant room together.`
` If we all move together, it'll be safe.`
` Maria, stop playing with scribbles!"`
`"Uu-.`
` Not scribbles.`
` I'm solving Beatrice's puzzle.`
` Uu-..."`
`"Beatrice's puzzle?`
` What's that? Show me too."`
`"...Aunt Rosa, are you, ...umm, bringing Maria-chan too?"`
`It seemed that George-aniki was against the idea of bringing Maria to the bloody crime scene.`
`...But considering that Maria would be all alone if left here, it'd surely be much safer to take Maria with us.`
`...In the end, it was just Aniki's irresponsible humanism.`
`We decided that all of us, including Maria, would go to the servant room.`
`The bed in the servant room was stained with bright-red blood.`
`...No, not just the bed.`
`The whole room was covered with a gruesome paint from countless blood stains.`
`That dreadful scene alone was enough to give us an idea of the repulsive sight they'd been trying to describe...`
`"...Uu-.`
` I wanna look too!"`
`"Maria-chan, wait here with me."`
`George-aniki was standing by the entrance, covering Maria's eyes, with his back to the room.`
`...He probably didn't want to dirty an innocent girl's retinas with the repulsive blood in this room.`
`That was surely the correct decision.`
`...I was acting tough right now, so I didn't mind, `
`...but for the rest of my life, whenever I see red paint scattered around, `
`I'll probably remember this room and start to vomit.`
`...My retinas have already had this room burned into them.`
`...In other words, it's already too late for me...`
`"......Huh..."`
`"Wh-Where did they...?!"`
`Right after they entered the servant room, Gohda-san and Shannon-chan trembled.`
`...We shook, wondering what horrible new situation had arisen to make them tremble again.`
`"What happened?`
` What is it?"`
`Aunt Rosa also shuddered, raised her gun high, and searched for whatever it was that had made them shudder.`
`...But she couldn't find it.`
`...It was only natural.`
`...They were trembling because they couldn't find it.`
`"Hey, what in the world's going on...?"`
`"......The two bodies...aren't here."`
`"What does this mean?"`
`"...Th-That can't be...!`
` Those two were definitely...here...!"`
`"...Wait, wait, wait.`
` What the hell, are you saying the corpses just walked off somewhere?`
` That couldn't happen, right?`
` I mean, wasn't the servant room locked?`
` Didn't you unlock the door when you came in just now, Gohda-san?!"`
`"...So what does that mean?`
` ...Isn't this the same as Jessica's room?!`
` Someone's disappeared from inside a closed room again?!`
` That's ridiculous!!"`
`"I don't have a clue what happened either!!`
` When we left this room, we definitely locked it, ......!!`
` I don't have a clue what's going on anymore...!!"`
`There was a timid, pitiful smile on Gohda-san's face that he definitely wouldn't have let show normally.`
`Shannon was the same.`
`"Two corpses disappeared!`
` And furthermore, they disappeared while the door was locked!`
` Even if Kanon-kun was the culprit, he shouldn't have a master key anymore!!"`
`"That's wrong...!`
` Kanon-kun isn't the culprit...!!"`
`"...Shannon...`
` I believe Shannon.`
` Kanon-kun is not the culprit.`
` This must be the doing of someone who looks a lot like him."`
`"No.`
` Kanon-kun could have gotten a master key.`
` ...After all, his master key was found in the pocket of Jessica-chan's corpse.`
` ...And who took that key?"`
`"!!`
` Th-That's right!`
` It was Doctor Nanjo...!!"`
`That's right.`
` Back then, it definitely was Doctor Nanjo who searched through Jessica's clothes and found the master key...!`
`So, if someone had the opportunity to search Doctor Nanjo's corpse, it would've been easy for them to take the master key back...`
`Aunt Rosa searched under the bed and in the locker.`
`...By now, I also understood what that meant.`
`If you assume there are two culprits, this can be easily explained.`
`The first person was Kanon-kun, or maybe an impostor who looked like him.`
`He finished off Doctor Nanjo and ran off somewhere.`
`The second person was...probably the 19th person, Beatrice, whose location was unknown.`
`That person hid under the bed in the servant room beforehand, and while Doctor Nanjo's body was enshrined here, they waited for Genji-san and the rest to leave.`
`Then later, they crawled out, took the master key back from Doctor Nanjo's pocket, and carried the two corpses away for some reason.`
`If they then locked the door with the master key, you'd end up with this closed room.`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` You constructed that one pretty fast, basing it off your reasoning from Jessica's room.`
` With that method, you could create a closed room even without magic.`
` Should I give you passing marks?`
` However, interestingly enough, ...there's one thing you mustn't forget."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"...If the culprit took back the master key as you suggest,`
` they ~ib~must have known that Nanjo `
`took the master key from Jessica's body~ib~."`
`"...You don't have to tell me that...`
` You're probably trying to say that it's information only the people in that place, at that time, could know..."`
`"...Hah!`
` This third closed room was crushed so fast that you're stuck trying to make hurtful remarks like that.`
` There's no art in repeating the same content over and over..."`
`I may have managed to bluff, but that move of the witch's hurts bad...`
`...I can tell that I'm cracking under the thing I want to deny the most.`
`This person's trying to close in on me from two directions.`
`On the one hand, there's the frontal attack, where she tries to force me to believe there's a witch using closed room tricks that only a witch could do.`
`...And on the other hand, there's the rear attack, where she tries to lure me into wanting a witch to exist...`
`by strengthening my suspicions of those close to me.`
`In the first closed room, the chapel, she used the frontal attack, but it didn't work on me.`
`So by the second closed room, and now on the third closed room, she's definitely changing the direction of her attack...`
`However, the fact that she ~ib~is~ib~ changing the direction of her attack proves that my resistance is having some effect.`
`...And she must've given up on the frontal attack because she clearly can't win with it...`
`......I tried to settle my unease by thinking these things.`
`But apparently, the witch had seen through me long ago.`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` I will not abandon my frontal attack.`
` ...A rear attack only has meaning because it advances at the same time as the front.`
` If I were to degenerate into only using the rear attack, it would merely result in a foolish plan where my means have became my goal."`
`"...Ihihi, really?`
` Well then, won't you repeat 'someone was hiding in the servant room' using that red you're so proud of?"`
`"There is no need.`
` The premise of your theory is about to be destroyed."`
`"Oh, really?!`
` You refuse?!`
` So someone really is hiding?!"`
`"Rosa will destroy your premise right now.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*!`
` Come, let's listen in."`
`"Please believe us, Rosa-sama...!!`
` The two corpses were definitely lying here!`
` The bright-red blood on the floor is theirs...!!"`
`Aunt Rosa began to search through various objects around the room, her back to Gohda-san as he cried out in supplication.`
`...Eventually, she found something, and for a while, stopped moving.`
`"Rosa-sama, we definitely aren't lying...!!`
` The two corpses were definitely here!!"`
`"Be quiet.`
` ......The person who hid the corpses has confessed that they took them to another place.`
` ......With this."`
`Rosa showed them a single sheet of paper over her shoulder.`
`"What on Earth is that?!`
` Could it be...a letter in a sealed envelope, just like in the chapel?!"`
`"...Yes, that's right.`
` It was set here, out in the open.`
` I'll read it."`
`'Members of the Ushiromiya Family and its household.`
`Have you now reached the climax of the riddle of the gold's epitaph?`
`There is only one way you all can stop me: by solving the epitaph's riddle.`
`There are no other options left to you that will result in the suspension of my ceremony.`
`I humbly ask that you take care not to misunderstand your current situation.`
`Searching for me will prove useless.`
`Attempting to escape will prove useless.`
`Trying to deny me will prove useless`
`--Beatrice the Golden.'`
`"...P.S.`
` I borrowed those two corpses for my ceremony.`
` They will be returned to you in due time, so I crave your indulgence.`
` ...Also, these keys belong to you, so I return them to you now.."`
`As Rosa read that aloud, the contents of the envelope lay exposed on the palm of her hand.`
`They were two master keys.`
`The master key that Nanjo had found in Jessica's pocket, which had originally been Kanon's, and Kumasawa's master key.`
`"What the heeeeeell...?`
` So what does that mean...?`
` Damn you, again?!`
` You're saying I can only suspect the servants with keys again?!"`
`"I won't say it in red, okay...?`
` I won't deny the possibility that after they locked the door and left, someone was hiding in this room, okay...?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"...If they hid under the bed, it still would've been possible for them to carry the corpses somewhere.`
` But they wouldn't have been able to lock the door!`
` The master key they went to all that trouble to get was left right here!`
` ...That's right, I'd forgotten.`
` What about the keys specifically for this room, the 'servant room keys'?!"`
`"Indeed.`
` Those are#ff0000 kept in the key box in the center of the servant room#ffffff.`
` There are several servant room keys, but #ff0000all of those are inside the key box#ffffff."`
`"Which means the situation is exactly the same as Jessica's room...`
` It's not like the servants would walk around with an unnecessary key when they have those convenient master keys.`
` I can accept that they're all kept in the key box..."`
`"And the other conditions remain unchanged as well.`
` #ff0000Entry and exit are impossible except for the single door and the single window#ffffff.`
` Therefore, hidden doors and irregular methods of entry cannot exist.`
` Rejoice, great detectives.`
` *cackle*!"`
`"#ff0000And those were both locked#ffffff.`
` #ff0000The door and the window do not permit any kind of entry or exit when they are locked#ffffff.`
` So it wouldn't work to remove the door and make a crack to slide in through or anything like that while the lock is still set.`
` And obviously, #ff0000it is impossible to unlock the door without a servant room key or the master key#ffffff."`
`"...It's a pain having to read all these aloud every time.`
` Sooner or later, I should think of a word to put this all together and abbreviate it."`
`"But you can't repeat that someone was hiding in this room!`
` ...However, that alone won't break open the door of a closed room...`
` Aaah, damn it, damn it!!`
` It's useless, it's useless, it's all useless...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` What happened to that spinning the chessboard around thing that you're so proud of...?`
` Please, announce your boastful strange theory."`
`"...Spin...the chessboard around.`
` ......What would I do if I were the culprit?`
` I carry the corpses off somewhere.`
` ...I leave a letter.`
` ......I lock the door from the inside.`
` ...Then I just have to escape this room by some means.`
` ......Damn it, is that even possible?!`
` I was told in red that you can't get outside except through the door or the window...!`
` .........Ah-"`
`...At that moment, ...I got it.`
` That's right.`
`...The culprit carried away the corpses, left the letter...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`...And since they didn't use a 'hidden door', ~ib~they weren't able to escape~ib~...`
`...That's it.`
` This isn't a question, it's an answer...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"Beato,`
` ...before I ask you to repeat anything, I want to check ~ib~the definition of hidden doors~ib~ that you're using."`
`"What have you thought of?`
` Very well, I'll explain.`
` A hidden door refers to an entrance or exit that cannot be recognized as such by those who don't know of it beforehand, of course.`
` Even children know that."`
`"...So in other words, if you can't get outside the room with it, it isn't a hidden door?"`
`"Hoh.`
` ......So that's your game."`
`"I kept thinking there needed to be some way for the culprit to escape from the closed room.`
` ...That's wrong.`
` The culprit couldn't escape!`
` So they decided to hide until we all left!"`
`During the second closed room, I tried applying this theory to Kanon-kun.`
`...But after hearing 'Kanon-kun was killed' in red, I gave it up.`
`After that, I proposed that a third person might've been in the room, before escaping through a hidden door.`
`And then, for the first time, I was faced with the red claim that 'no hidden doors exist'.`
`Now move from there to what I've just learned.`
`That term, 'hidden door', refers to things that make it possible to enter or leave a room.`
`...In other words, that category doesn't cover things that don't actually lead in or out of the room, even if these things could never be recognized by people who didn't know about them beforehand.`
`So, if we had something like a 'hidden shelf' or a 'secret closet', for example, that wouldn't count as a 'hidden door'!`
`That means the third person from Jessica's room is hiding here, waiting for us to leave!`
`Heh, how pathetic, it was all just a bit of wordplay!`
`Looks like that technique should be enough to handle even this third closed room.`
`If there's a hidden shelf under the bed or anything like that, that'd be enough.`
`The culprit's hiding somewhere, waiting for us to leave.`
`......The culprit is also trapped in this closed room even now!!`
`Which means...at this very moment!`
`The culprit is still hiding in the servant room, holding their breath...!!!`
`And that means......what the hell...`
`Even though we've been tortured by closed rooms three times, `
`...at this very moment, we've actually gotten the culprit in checkmate!!`
`"I'm finally starting to see it.`
` ...Eat this, Beato!!`
` Repeat it!`
` 'There is no one in this room other than us'!`
` By us, I mean me, George-aniki, Maria, Aunt Rosa, Genji-san, Gohda-san, and Shannon-chan, got it?!`
` What do you think?!! You can't say it, right?!"`
`"......Hoh...`
`......hoh...!"`
`"I'll bet that hit you where it hurts!!`
` If you refuse, then say it, dammit!!`
` Here comes the next one!!`
` Repeat it!!"`
`I don't know how they're hiding in this room.`
`But if they are, then this solves the second closed room, Jessica's room, at the same time!!`
`I've finally caught her by the tail!`
`With this, I can explain everything!`
`Witches don't exist, and I don't have to suspect anyone!!`
`All right, starting now, I'll spin it all around!`
` Now I'll have her repeat that-`
`"#ff0000No one exists in this room except your group.`
` 'Your group' refers to Battler, George, Maria, Rosa, Genji, Gohda, and Shannon#ffffff."`
`"...Wha......"`
`"Let's go back to Jessica's room.`
` #ff0000When Jessica's corpse was discovered, `
`only Battler, George, Maria, Rosa, Genji, Gohda, Shannon, Kumasawa, and Nanjo were in Jessica's room#ffffff.`
` Whoops, the corpse of #ff0000Jessica is also included#ffffff.`
` #ff0000Therefore, both in the case involving Jessica's room and the one involving this servant room, no humans exist that you were not aware of#ffffff.`
` #ff0000No one is hiding#ffffff."`
`"And I'll say more.`
` #ff0000No method exists by which the door can be locked from the outside without using a key#ffffff.`
` #ff0000Regarding the window, no method exists by which it could somehow be locked from the outside#ffffff."`
`"And let me also say this.`
` #ff0000You are incompetent#ffffff!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, #ff0000hiiihhihihhihihihihihihihihihihi#ffffff!!"`
`"...D-Dumbaaaaass...`
` So, ......it's really...a closed room, isn't it......?`
` A-And just when I'd finally managed to think of a way out.`
` If you were hiding, ...that would fit everything.`
` Just when I thought I'd broken through to your trick, ......damn iiit..."`
`"......N-Nnngyaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!"`
`It's useless it's useless it's useless it's all useless!!`
` For a second, I thought I had it!`
` It was all useless!!`
`Dammit,`
`, I was so sure that I'd finally seen through her, `
`that I'd seen how she distracted me with her clever red wordplay and fooled me.`
`'!s0`
`......it disappeared...`
`just disappeared...`
`swallowed up......`
`by a blood-red sea......!`
`Red, `
`...`
`...`
`red `
`red `
`red `
`red!!`
`No one is hiding!`
` And there's no hidden door, and no way to get past the door or the window while they're locked!!`
`Have you just proven that it's all impossible?!`
`Has the Devil's Proof...`
`been fulfilled...`
`with a frontal attack?!`
`Impossible, `
`...that's impossible!!`
`"What's wrong, Ushiromiya Battleer?`
` Weren't you so confident in your ability to deny witches?`
` Why are you groveling and wringing out bitter tears in a place like that?"`
`"Yes, what a truly splendid tactic.`
` Truly splendid how you're trying to make me fall over and drown in a sea of tears from my own laughter.`
` That ~ib~is~ib~ what you're trying to do, right?`
` You're trying to make me laugh and laugh and laugh myself to death, right, `
`'!s1`
`shiro`
`miya `
`Batt`
`le`
`e`
`er`
`???"`
`"What are you calling magic?! I'll definitely prove that witches don't exist!!`
` I definitely won't believe in you!!`
` You used the power of magic...`
`and bullied and killed everyone for fun?`
` ...I definitely won't accept thaaaaaaaat!!"`
`"Hey, Battler?`
` Sorry for bullying you so much.`
` I'll 'spin the chessboard around' from my side.`
` I'll stand in your place and show you the best possible move you could make.`
` Want to heeeeeaar??"`
`"Don't screw with me, I don't want to hear, I don't want to hear!!"`
`"Consider Jessica's room.`
` You were off to a good start, you know that...?`
` All that about hiding and waiting for everyone else to leave.`
` That truly was well spotted."`
`"...But why did you only think of Kanon and me, the 19th person...?`
` I see, so the 'hide' part of hiding and waiting got in the way, which prevented you from getting any further."`
`"...Come on, you see what I'm getting at, don't you?`
` It's Jessica.`
` Jeeeessicaaaaaa!!"`
`If Jessica were the culprit, ...a farce like this could be easily constructed!!`
`She killed Kanon-kun and carried him off somewhere!`
` Then, she played dead and let us walk by!`
`But that's ridiculous!!`
` Doctor Nanjo definitely confirmed that she was dead!`
` So was Doctor Nanjo an accomplice too?!`
`That's wrong!!`
` I also confirmed that Jessica was dead!`
` Of course, I've never examined a corpse before, but she was definitely dead!`
`I think she was dead!!`
` No, that's probably surely definitely what I thought but certainly wait...`
`...she was dead!!`
` She was dead!!!`
`"Jessica was in on it.`
` And Nanjo, who examined her corpse, was in on it too.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` And that makes the third closed room a farce, doesn't it?"`
`Yeah, then it's simple.`
`Doctor Nanjo was in on it, so in other words, he's on the culprit's side, ...which means...which means...`
`he was never dead in the first place?!`
`We thought his body disappeared after he was killed, but what if he was never in the servant room to begin with?!`
`So, if Kumasawa baa-chan disappeared with him, does that mean she's in on it too?!`
`...That's not all, that's not all!`
`The servants who all agreed to keep to that story, Genji-san and Gohda-san, and even Shannon-chan, were also in on it!`
`Then, the one who stole the key from Maria's handbag was Jessica...`
`no, it could even have been George-aniki!`
`After all, if Shannon-chan is on the culprit's side, that automatically makes George-aniki on the culprit's side!!`
`Wait a second, just wait a second, they're all wolves...`
` They're all wolves!!`
`Not only am I drowning in an ocean of bright-red blood,`
` there are packs of wolves clamoring on the banks, whose blazing eyes tell me that they'll eat me if I crawl out!!`
`Which way should I die?!`
`Should I deny everything and drown in a bright-red sea?!`
`Or should I learn the truth and have my whole body chewed to bits by the wolves?!`
`It's either one hell or the other!!`
` I can't choose!`
`Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!`
`"That's why I'm here...!!`
` #ff0000Come, Ushiromiya Battler, and kneel#ffffff.`
` Swear your eternal loyalty and lick my shoes...!!`
` #ff0000If you accept me, all of the riddles will be resolved#ffffff.`
` #ff0000With my power, any kind of closed room can be created or destroyed#ffffff!!"`
`"Battler, don't you want to abandon yourself to the joy of surrendering to one with poweeeer??`
` #ff0000I'll make you my favorite furniture#ffffff.`
` #ff0000I'll love you so much and make you my toy until you turn to ashes#ffffff..."`
`"#ff0000*cackle*cackle*cackle*hihihihihihihihihihihyahyahyahhahhahahahahhahahahhahhahhahhahhahhahha#ffffff!!!"`
`"......Now, it's clear.`
` There's no longer any reason to doubt."`
`"Huh...?`
` ...What are you saying...?"`
`"You kept saying those two were dead, but they aren't here.`
` ...And now we have this letter from Beatrice, where she's been kind enough to confess that she carried the corpses off."`
`"...It's as simple as that.`
` I've had enough of this farce!!"`
`As Aunt Rosa yelled this, she looked at all of us with a fierce expression.`
`'!s1`
`What do you mean...`
`by farce...?!"`
`"I said it in Jessica-chan's room.`
` ...You can't trust anyone but yourself and those whose corpses have been found.`
` And since we can't find the corpses of those two people, we must not accept that they've been killed."`
`"...P-Please wait, Aunt Rosa.`
` What do you mean by that...?!"`
`"Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa-san aren't dead, they're alive!`
` We're supposed to believe that they've been killed, but they're definitely hiding somewhere in this mansion.`
` So that they can attack us!!"`
`"How could you know that?!`
` Are you saying that Gohda-san and the rest are lying?!"`
`"...Rosa-sama!!`
` I, Gohda...no, all of the Ushiromiya family servants!`
` We all swear that nothing of the sort happened!!"`
`"You all say that those two were killed.`
` But since there are no corpses, we mustn't believe you.`
` There's a chance that you worked out a story beforehand, that you're lying!!"`
`"There's a good way to prove your innocence, isn't there?`
` Find Doctor Nanjo's and Kumasawa-san's bodies!!"`
`"If you can find them, then maybe I'll start listening to your story.`
` But until you do, you cannot deny that you are all wolves!!"`
`"You!`
` And you!!`
` I'll bet you were all bought by that witch, that your eyes were blinded by gold!!`
` Do you really want money that much?!`
` That's right, isn't it?!`
` You want to live the easy life for as long as you live?!`
` What value could a life like that possibly have?!!"`
`"Rosa-sama...!!`
` We...couldn't have!"`
`"Be silent!`
` And Shannon, don't get any closer!!`
` To think you'd repay a ten-year-long debt of gratitude with betrayal!!`
`  I'll pull the trigger without mercy!!"`
`'!s1`
`......how could you...?`
` ...It's too...`
`cruel..."`
`"...A-Aunt Rosa!!`
` That's horrible!!`
` A murder occurred in this room!`
` And then the culprit carried the corpses away!`
` All they're doing is honestly reporting what they saw!!"`
`"......Aaah, aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!"`
`Shannon had finally broken down in tears...`
`She had sacrificed 10 years to the Ushiromiya family.`
`She had sacrificed 10 of the most brilliant years of her life.`
`......She'd believed that she'd built up a friendly relationship with Rosa.`
`...And this was what she got in return!!`
` You can kill a person without using a knife...`
`I didn't have to be George-aniki...`
`to realize that Shannon-chan had been stabbed deep in the heart, that she was shedding tears like blood...`
`"Shannon-san, stay back...`
` ...Rosa-sama, it is true that I, Gohda, have not served for many years, and I understand that I have not earned your trust..."`
`"...However...could you not believe in Shannon-san at least...?!`
` She has sacrificed a full 10 years in service to the Ushiromiya family...!`
` I'm not telling you to believe me...!`
` At the very least, can't you believe in Shannon-san...?!!"`
`...But...even I don't understand anymore!!`
` I don't understand!!`
`We can't search for an answer without suspecting them!!!`
`Yeah, bit by bit, I'm starting to understand...`
`...It's ~ib~because~ib~ we've been searching an answer, ...that's why everything keeps going wrong...`
`We don't need...an answer.`
`These are all...strange murders, committed with bizarre magic by the 19th person, the witch Beatrice, in accordance with some creepy ceremony.`
`......Isn't that...enough......?`
`I don't...want to suspect...anyone anymore......`
`Shannon-chan and Gohda-san were protesting their innocence, half-crying.`
`Genji-san quietly put a stop to that.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"......Enough.`
` ...What Rosa-sama says is quite sensible.`
` ...Until we find the corpses, ~ib~we cannot prove `
`Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa's innocence~ib~."`
`That's right.`
` ...By Rosa-san's argument, if their corpses can be found, then the innocence of those people alone can be proven.`
`But that only counted for the corpses.`
`Even if the survivors searched the mansion and found the corpses, in the end, their own innocence would never be proven.`
`'They kidnapped Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa-san, killed them in another place, and locked the closed room with their own master keys.'`
`Unless the closed room could be broken by a method other than that one, `
`...it would be impossible to prove their innocence...`
`...But......that couldn't be done!!`
`They only have one chance to prove their innocence.`
`...That can only happen if they meet with the culprit, become corpses, and are then reunited with Aunt Rosa.`
`Isn't that strange?!!`
` They're innocent if they die, but guilty as long as they're alive, just like a witch trial!`
`...Oh, right, the enemy's a witch.`
`So everything's cool, is that it...?`
`"...Rosa-sama,`
` we are furniture in service to the Ushiromiya family.`
` ...Whether you trust us or not is no business of ours.`
` No matter what assessment you give us, we will merely continue to serve until our final hour."`
`"You really are a model servant.`
` ...I deeply understand why Father trusts you.`
` It really is heartrending that I must suspect even you."`
`"............"`
`Genji-san stuck his hand into his pocket and pulled out a master key.`
`...Then, he set it on a nearby table.`
`"...I believe I was given this as a sign of the trust placed in me.`
` If that trust has been lost, I think it only natural that I return it."`
`".........`
`...That's a good decision.`
` Those master keys are the main reason you've been suspected several times today.`
` It may seem elementary that letting go of those might clear away that suspicion,`
` but I don't think it's a bad thing."`
`"......You two."`
`Genji-san looked at Gohda-san and Shannon-chan.`
`...The two of them nodded and set their own master keys on the table.`
`Aunt Rosa lay the two master keys that had come out of the envelope on top.`
`With that, all five master keys were gathered in this place.`
`In other words, this was proof that all of the servants' service until today had been negated,`
` with even the final honor they should have been permitted stripped from them...`
`"Maria, give me that handbag."`
`"...Uu-!`
` Give it back!!"`
`Aunt Rosa snatched Maria's handbag, tossed the master keys in there, and held up one of them for all to see.`
`She was showing us that she now had all the master keys.`
`"...A-Are you satisfied now, Aunt Rosa?`
` ...Now you have all the master keys.`
` ...Doesn't that satisfy you?!!"`
`"Yes, I'm satisfied.`
` Even if I can't trust anyone else, I can at least trust myself!"`
`"I've been able get the gun and all the master keys for myself!`
` Now, I don't have to suspect anyone.`
` You all are happy too, I take it?`
` Now you don't have to be suspected anymore!`
` Ahahahahahahahahaha, hahahahahahahah!"`
`"......Kiihihihihi."`
`At that time, Maria, who alone seemed to be watching this as though it were a show, sneered at her mother.`
`...Aunt Rosa reacted nervously to that laugh and turned around.`
`"...Keys don't have anything to do with this.`
` ...Beatrice can open doors with magic.`
` She doesn't need keys.`
` ...It doesn't matter who has or doesn't have something like that.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihi...!"`
`"Don't I always tell you to stop laughing like that?!!`
` ...?`
` What is it, Battler-kun?"`
`...I had just cut in between the two of them.`
`...No, that's not it.`
`...I was on my knees...and hugging Maria's head.`
`...I was...crying.`
`"Just...stop it already, Aunt Rosa...`
` ...Maria was...right..."`
`"...Wh-What are you talking about...?"`
`"......Maria,`
` I'm sorry...`
`...for doubting.`
` ...I'm sorry...`
`...for not believing."`
`"......Battler."`
`'!s1`
`the witch's doing...`
` ...The witch's...`
`doing...`
` ...All that stuff about tricks and closed rooms didn't matter...`
` ......It's just, it's just...`
`...that the witch Beatrice actually exists, `
`......and she's really a witch...`
` ...And because I didn't believe, `
`......it's been so painful...`
`...and so sad......"`
`"......You...believe in Beatrice...?"`
`"Yes...!`
` I believe.`
` ...Beatrice 'exists'.`
` And she's a witch, who uses strange magic...!"`
`"Battler..."`
`Maria let go of my hand, ...and then she was the one holding my head.`
`"...That's enough, Battler.`
` ......Beatrice 'existed'.`
` ...You had so much trouble believing, so you couldn't see her.`
` ......Witches 'exist'.`
` They 'exist'.`
` And will 'come' soon."`
`"......You believed in Beato, so you'll surely be invited to the Golden Land.`
` ...Very soon now.`
` ...It will happen very soon.`
` So there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.`
` ......There's no need to be afraid, okay?`
` Stay with me, hands joined, ...okay...?`
` Let's think about the riddle of the epitaph together.`
` Let's think about Beato's puzzle.`
` ......Beato has been saying it from the beginning.`
` She hasn't said anything other than 'let's play and solve this puzzle'."`
`"Right, ...she did...`
` Searching for the culprit was just a waste of time...`
` ......If only we had...`
`...just believed in......`
`...the witch......"`
`After gently brushing my cheek as my tears kept dripping down, `
`...Maria kissed my forehead, as soft as a feather.`
`For just that instant, ...Maria's smile, which had once seemed creepy to me, looked like that of an angel...`
`"We have returned the master keys, ...but our loyalty to the Ushiromiya family will not change.`
` ......From now on, we will not enter the parlor without permission.`
` Rosa-sama, please lock the parlor from the inside."`
`"...You truly are an admirable person.`
` When the typhoon passes, ...if the cries of the seagulls return to this island again,`
` ......I wonder if we'll be able to trust each other once more."`
`"...If you were to grant us your trust once again, there could be no greater pleasure."`
`"I see.`
` ...We'll definitely be able to understand each other.`
` ...When the seagulls cry."`
`"......It would probably be best if we left this room as it is until the police come.`
` Rosa-sama, if you would please lock it.`
` ...We will return to the kitchen.`
` If you need anything, please command us at any time."`
`"Thank you.`
` ......If you are a wolf, `
`how shamelessly you speak.`
` ...And if you are a sheep,`
` ......then I'm sorry for throwing you into the cage of wolves."`
`"...Furniture entrusts its fate to the family.`
` ...If I could regain your trust by giving up this life of mine,`
` I would consider it a great honor."`
`"............`
`I hope you all manage to remain safe until the typhoon passes, if such a thing is possible.`
` This is all a rhapsody of blowing winds and pouring rain performed by the typhoon.`
` ...When the performance ends...and the curtain closes, `
`...we will surely be able to grasp hands together again."`
`"...When the seagulls...cry."`
`Aunt Rosa nodded in response...`
`Genji-san turned on his heels.`
`He left the servant room.`
`Gohda-san's face was still streaked with tears,`
` ...but maybe he'd managed to sort out his feelings as he listened to Genji-san's words.`
`...His face had been truly shameful, `
`...but it had returned to the face of the Gohda-san we knew well.`
`"......I will also be waiting in the kitchen.`
` ...If you need anything, please command me at any time.`
` ......If you wish for some warm food, I, Gohda, will have the very best prepared for you."`
`"......Thank you.`
` I can't wait for your breakfast tomorrow.`
` ...And the boat will probably come by midday tomorrow.`
` ...Thanks for everything up until now.`
` Your cooking was my only pleasure on Rokkenjima."`
`"...Certainly.`
` I, Gohda, will prepare a supreme breakfast.`
` Please, look forward to tomorrow morning."`
`"Thank you.`
` ......And Shannon-chan.`
` Tomorrow morning, ...let's make up and have some delicious coffee."`
`"...?`
` George-kun?"`
`"...I'm...going with them."`
`"...It's all right, George-sama...`
` Please, return to the parlor.`
` There are no more master keys.`
` So, if you're with Rosa-sama in the parlor, you won't be threatened by anyone."`
`"You're right.`
` ...That's how things have sorted themselves out, isn't it?`
` ...Objectively speaking, I'd say you'll be safest staying with me in the parlor."`
`"...But I won't force you to stay with us.`
` George-kun, you may stay in any place you feel is safe.`
` ......You're already an adult.`
` It's up to you where and with whom you spend the time until tomorrow morning."`
`"......Yes.`
` I will decide...`
`with whom I'll spend this night."`
`"...A-Aniki..."`
`"Battler-kun, stay with Aunt Rosa in the parlor.`
` I'm sure you'll be safest there.`
` ...Everywhere outside the parlor is dangerous in comparison.`
` ...So, I can't leave her in a place like that alone."`
`"...It's...not like I suspect Shannon-chan and the other servants`
`...or anyone at all...`
` I don't want to suspect anyone...`
` The inheritance?`
` The gold?`
` ...That's all nothing...`
` ...There's no way people are killing each other over things like that..."`
`"Yes.`
` I know better than anyone how pure your heart is, Battler-kun.`
` ...No one will blame you.`
` No one."`
`".........Anikiii..."`
`"...It's all right.`
` I'll protect you, Battler.`
` ...If you're with me, even Beatrice won't be able to lay a hand on you.`
` I may be small, but I'm still a witch."`
`"Yes.`
` ......Maria-chan, `
`I'm leaving Battler in your care.`
` ......All right, Shannon.`
` Let's go."`
`"Yes...`
` ...Rosa-sama, if you would excuse me.`
` If you have an order, please call me at any time."`
`"......I'm sorry for saying something so cruel just now.`
` ......I don't expect you to forgive me until tomorrow morning.`
` But when tomorrow morning comes, let me apologize again."`
`"Yes...`
` ......Thank you very much."`
`George-aniki and Shannon-chan left the servant room together.`
`......Now, only Maria, Aunt Rosa and I were left in this disgusting, bloodstained room.`
`Until Genji-san disappeared, until Gohda-san disappeared, until George-aniki and Shannon-chan disappeared, we stood there, shocked...`
`After their presence and their footsteps had completely disappeared, Aunt Rosa giggled, as though she'd just remembered something pleasant.`
`"......You can't trust them for a moment.`
` That damned furniture."`
`That one sentence...`
`made me choke.`
`'!s1`
`Why are you...`
`...saying...`
`...something like that...?"`
`"There are five master keys in all?`
` Who would believe that?`
` It's obvious that some duplicate keys exist.`
` ...As if we could trust them just because they pulled keys out of their pockets...!!"`
`"Y-You don't mean that, right...?`
` B-By setting down those keys, ...they weren't just letting go of them... `
`...You've...made all their hard work count for nothing, disgraced it, trampled it, `
`......and in the end, you made them give up their keys...`
` What's with that parting line...?`
` They've shown that they're willing to go this far, and you still can't trust them?!`
` Too much, ...that's just too much...!"`
`"It's a Devil's Proof!`
` There are five master keys in all?!`
` It's impossible to prove something like that!!`
` You can show that there are five master keys by placing them here!`
` But you can't prove that no more than five exist!!`
` Only a demon or a witch could prove something like that, right?!"`
`"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!!`
` Stop it already, stop it already...!!`
` Please, Beatrice, show yourself right now,`
` and tell Aunt Rosa in red that 'there are only five master keys'!!`
` Please, I'm begging you, this can only be proved by devils, by a witch like you!`
` Please, Beato, show yourself here and tell Rosa that those are all the master keys, `
`and that there's no need to suspect anyone anymore...!!!"`
`"#ff0000There are only five master keys#ffffff.`
` #ff0000There are only five master keys#ffffff.`
` ...*cackle* How's that?`
` No matter how often I say it, it won't reach Rosa's ears.`
` After all, it seems there's still someone who denies that I exist, right?`
` Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeer???"`
`"I accept it!!`
` I accept it, you exist you exist you definitely exist!`
` So I'm begging you, stop this already!!`
` Stop it already! Stop it already!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaagggghhh!!"`
`"Words alone are not enough, show it with your actions.`
` Swear from your heart that you will become my furniture."`
`"Can you do it?`
` Take off your clothes, be naked, then put your hands on the ground and crawl.`
` Clothing is proof of one's humanity.`
` From now on, you will become furniture, so it's only natural that you will lose that right!!"`
`"Then kneel, make your tongue crawl on my shoes.`
` Can you do it?`
` You can do it, riiiiiiiight??`
` When you do, I'll appear and say it in red!`
` I'll tell Rosa that #ff0000there are only five master keys#ffffff!!"`
`"Oh, but of course, you'll never abandon that lordly pride of yours.`
` But you've done well, you've done more than enough, and you're starting to get that tingly feeling, aren't you?`
` For just an instant, you thought maybe licking my shoes wouldn't be so bad, didn't you?`
` And you immediately denied that and felt ashamed, riiiiight??`
` Just looking at your expression feels just heavenly!!"`
`"That face of yours is so pathetic, so go look in a mirror,`
` you'll see how low you are, naked and licking my shoes, riiiiiiiiiight?`
` Can you see it, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer???"`
`"......I can't believe it.`
` ...Are you...saying that's the truth?"`
`"...Yes.`
` ...We've told you everything as we saw it."`
`George folded his arms and started mumbling again.`
`...And the kitchen was once again wrapped in a long silence.`
`"George-sama, I'm fully aware how hard it must be for you to believe all that so suddenly.`
` ...After all, ...even though I saw it with my own eyes, I grow less and less sure what it was I actually saw...`
` I'm sure I saw it.`
` And I'm sure I got into a fight too!`
` And yet, ...I almost feel like it was all an illusion..."`
`"...I see.`
` ...So that's why you couldn't go into the details in front of Aunt Rosa.`
` ...If you actually told her what you've just told me, you'd probably be in even more trouble.`
` ...Yeah, Genji-san really did handle that one composedly, didn't he?"`
`"......If only I had the power to explain it myself."`
`George had not actually seen it, and even when pressed to believe, he just couldn't imagine it.`
`...It was only natural.`
`Because even the people who had actually seen it had given up asking themselves what it was...`
`"...Let's rewind the story a bit.`
` ...Shannon, you said that when you thought Kanon-kun was an impostor, you picked up some spiderwebs and came back, right?`
` Why did you do that?"`
`"...That's right, I was thinking about that as well.`
` Why spiderwebs?"`
`"I happened to hear it from Kumasawa-san once.`
` ...A long time ago, evil spirits lived on Rokkenjima and they, umm, feared spiderwebs.`
` And they say there's a legend that people treasured spiderwebs as amulets.`
` ...And, umm, ...right at that moment,`
` I-I think I was also a bit confused..."`
`"......When it comes to those old stories,`
` ...Kumasawa was very knowledgeable."`
`"Well, spiders are very useful bugs, after all.`
` ...Yes, it wouldn't be at all strange for a belief system like that to come into being."`
`"......I'm sure...`
`that the torii shrine was suppressing the power of those evil spirits.`
` ...And because the spirit mirror was broken, that power came back...`
` ...That power must be what allowed Beatrice-sama to revive...`
` ......If I, `
`...weak-hearted as I am, `
`......hadn't done such an outrageous thing......`
` Aaaaaaaahhhhhhh...!!"`
`"...Shannon, `
`you don't have to worry about that anymore.`
` ...I don't blame you for it."`
`Since long ago, Shannon had often suggested that there was some kind of occult cause for her meeting with George.`
`After listening to her, George had grown to think that she was being a typical girl, associating love with fate, chance, and miracles.`
`...He did think that smashing the spirit mirror offered at the torii shrine was taking it a bit far,`
` but he'd laughed it off and forgiven her, thinking of it as just a prank that showed how serious she was about her relationship with him.`
`...Just breaking a mirror in some musty shrine wouldn't have changed the fate of our meeting.`
`And it would never cause any curse.`
`He'd tried to cheer her up, saying it was only a musty mirror covered in dust.`
`"...Ever since I started working on this island, I've heard the story of a spirit called Beatrice-sama from several coworkers."`
`"In the beginning, I thought it was ridiculous, `
`but since it would appear indiscreet to say anything out loud, `
`...outwardly, I conducted myself as though I also believed it.`
` ...But, could it really-"`
`"She existed.`
` ...Beatrice-sama was in this mansion all along.`
` ...But she'd lost her powers...and wasn't able to appear before us.`
` She did 'exist' all this time.`
` It's just that we couldn't 'see' her."`
`"......I'd like to hear Genji-san's opinion."`
`"...I have no opinion.`
` ......All I want to say is that...at that time, there were five of us in this room.`
` ...Then, I thought that Kanon had returned through the back door.`
` After that, we carried him to the servant room, `
`......something happened, and now Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa will never come back to us."`
`"...That is all.`
` ...We have already explained everything we saw.`
` ...I understand how unreasonable it would be to try and force belief from one who didn't witness those events, such as yourself."`
`"How could he believe it?`
` ......I was sure it was Kanon-san.`
` ...But it got up from the bed...`
`and, that's right, `
`when it started to grope about that wound in its chest in that manner, `
`...I felt sure that it wasn't Kanon-san, but something else."`
`"......I doubt you'll be able to understand, George-sama.`
` ...The terror of that moment, when the person I thought I knew well exposed that it was in fact, someone else entirely...`
` ......I can't explain.`
` ...I can't explain it at all..."`
`"I understand.`
` ...I can tell that whatever happened, it was terrifying enough to give you such a shock."`
`"...Thank you very much,`
` ...George-sama."`
`And they all fell silent again.`
`Shannon kept crying no matter how many times she was consoled, `
`thinking that listening to the witch's sweet whispers and breaking the spirit mirror on that day had been the mistake that ruined everything...`
`"......The witch who whispered these things to you...loses her powers if that mirror exists, right?"`
`"...I think she explained it to me a little, but I don't really remember.`
` ...I think she said something about how she couldn't release her power as long as that mirror existed."`
`"...What happened to this mirror that you broke?"`
`"I don't remember.`
` ...I left it behind when I broke it, ...so it's probably just how I left it."`
`"...So when, as they say, the reef was struck by lightning and disappeared, it must've sank to the bottom of the ocean...`
`  Well, I doubt picking it up and taping it together would make it start working again.`
` Hahahahaha."`
`"...What...have...I done..."`
`"...Sorry.`
` I shouldn't have said that."`
`He didn't know if Shannon breaking the mirror really had started all this off.`
`Though the servants didn't blame Shannon, they all seemed to believe that her actions had been the root cause.`
`...But even now, George wasn't able to go that far.`
`...All this talk about witches and evil spirits just sounded fake to him, even though he was trying to be open-minded.`
`Even so, he listened seriously to Shannon's story, trying find a hint that might relieve at least a little of the pain in her heart.`
`"Come to think of it, ......though it's surely different from the one in the torii, `
`...I have heard that Madam keeps a spirit mirror as a charm."`
`"...Really?`
` Aunt Natsuhi?"`
`"Yes.`
` I believe she received it as a memento from her grandfather or something...and that it functioned as a powerful ward against magic.`
` A spirit mirror of high pedigree, I think...?"`
`"......I have also heard the same story.`
` ...Something about the mirror having the power to reflect that which is not good and send it back."`
`"If we had that spirit mirror, ...could we resist Beatrice, since she's a witch?"`
`"Huh...?"`
`When George proposed this, the servants looked up.`
`"...The shrine and the torii where it was kept are gone now, but the important thing is that there's still another spirit mirror.`
` ......I've heard that Aunt Natsuhi's family is descended from Shinto priests.`
` Maybe that isn't just a simple mirror."`
`"I-I'm sure I've heard Madam say she keeps it in a treasure box.`
` ...It might not be very large."`
`"......I don't think its size is a problem.`
` Even the mirror I broke was just a small, insignificant-looking thing."`
`"......If our opponent is occult, then we'll have to use the occult to fight back.`
` ...Sitting around here won't solve anything.`
` It's worth trying, if only for some peace of mind."`
`Of course, this didn't mean George had accepted the witch.`
`...However, he thought it'd be necessary to have some kind of purification ceremony to heal the wounds in Shannon's heart.`
`...So this story about Natsuhi's spirit mirror was really convenient.`
`"Let's go.`
` ...I won't say anything crazy, like 'let's go get it and finish off the witch'.`
` ...However, I think it'd be useful to have some sort of charm that can protect us from her."`
`"...Maria-chan told me about it earlier, but the door to Grandfather's room was supposed to be able to repel magic, right?`
` ...That's our Grandfather for you.`
` It means he was pretty good on defense when it comes to the occult.`
` ......Let's go.`
` To Aunt Natsuhi's room!"`
`"B-But I think Madam's room is locked...!`
` We returned the master keys to Rosa-sama,`
` ...and even the key box in the servant room is now locked away..."`
`"...In that case, Aunt Natsuhi should've had a key on her person.`
` ...Aunt Natsuhi's corpse should still be in the chapel.`
` We probably shouldn't be disturbing it before the police come, but we can give a full explaination later."`
`"However, ...the entrance to the chapel is also locked..."`
`"Hahaha, Gohda-san, can't you break a single glass window with your physical strength?`
` You could smash it with a nearby rock."`
`"W-Would it, umm, really be okay to break the window of that important chapel...?"`
`"When Grandfather gets mad at us, I'll take responsibility.`
` ...From the beginning, I've been ready to fight the whole Ushiromiya family today.`
` I've got to get them to accept my engagement to you.`
` ...So, I've been prepared from the start."`
`"Let's break the glass.`
` Then, let's borrow the key from Aunt Natsuhi's corpse."`
`George's announcement that he'd take responsibility seemed to have given the servants a great deal of courage.`
`...Shannon and Gohda looked at each other, then looked at George's face again.`
`"Grandfather knows everything about the occult.`
` I'm sure he'll understand if it's the power of Aunt Natsuhi's spirit mirror we're talking about.`
` Don't worry, he won't get mad at you."`
`"...I wonder if Madam's mirror...`
`will really be able to seal...`
`Beatrice-sama once again."`
`"I don't know.`
` But I think it's worth trying.`
` ...So let's go.`
` It's getting darker and darker outside.`
` Quickly!"`
`"Shannon, get a flashlight!`
` Gohda-san, find something that looks like it can break the glass!`
` Sorry Genji, but can you be on umbrella duty?"`
`"""Yes sir!"""`
`The servants, who had been rejected by Rosa, gained a new master and started to move.`
`George, who was normally calm and gentle, was now radiating dignity.`
`Shannon checked the emergency flashlight.`
`Just in case, she changed the batteries.`
`Gohda was testing several heavy-looking cooking tools.`
`...Normally, a highly-praised chef like him wouldn't want to use them for something other than their intended purpose.`
`But now, he was frantic to fulfill the orders of the one he accepted as his master.`
`After some worrying, he took a large, thick-feeling frying pan.`
`Genji removed several umbrellas from the umbrella stand set in the corner near the kitchen door.`
` ...He took three of them.`
`"Genji-san...?"`
`"......I cannot go with you.`
` ...It would be embarrassing for me, as the head servant of the Ushiromiya family, if we were all gone when an order is given."`
`"B-But Genji-san!`
` Even you must understand how dangerous it is to be alone in this mansion now...!"`
`"...I cannot go.`
` ...I must remain here, so that the Master can call for me at any time."`
`"Genji-sama..."`
`"...Go, and obey George-sama.`
` Be careful not to make any blunders.`
` Gohda, I am counting on you to set an example."`
`"...Y-Yes.`
` ...Leave it to me."`
`"I will surely fulfill my duty..."`
`"You're sure about this, right, ...Genji-san?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......I am already at this age.`
` All the days of my life until now have been spent repaying the debt I owe the Master.`
` ...The roulette will decide the fate of a senile old man like myself.`
` I will sit here...and see what the result will be with my own eyes."`
`As Genji said that, he sat down.`
`As though saying that he didn't intend to discuss this anymore, ...his gaze fell to the chessboard that he'd played Nanjo on.`
`When George saw this, he decided to leave Genji there.`
`"Let's go, everyone.`
` It looks like the wind has died down a bit for now!"`
`When George took an umbrella and dashed down the hallway, Shannon and Gohda chased after him, each holding a tool.`
`...After they flew out of the room, Genji quietly stretched his hand out to the side of the chessboard.`
`......He softly pulled something there towards himself, covering it with his palm.`
`Genji killed his breathing even more than before.`
`......As he did, ......something flashed gold.`
`From inside an ice pail set on the counter, ...a small gold butterfly appeared, softly and silently.`
`It was almost as though it had seen George and the rest off...and was trying to secretly chase after them...`
`It happened in an instant.`
`...The elegant gold butterfly, flapping its wings, was pinned against the wall by the knife Genji threw, just like a butterfly in a bug collection.`
`After the gold butterfly beat its wings several times, looking like it was in pain, it accepted the fact that it couldn't break free, became fine gold powder and smoke, and disappeared as though it had melted into water...`
`Genji still gazed down at the chessboard as though nothing had happened.`
`...Maybe he would think up a brilliant move very soon.`
`But no matter what move he made, his opponent would not be able to respond for all eternity.`
`Even though he knew that, Genji searched for a brilliant move.`
`...It must have been the perfect way to kill time...during the short period before some fate would be given to him...`
`...He didn't know what result the roulette would bring about.`
`But that decision would be made very soon.`
`......No one could interfere with the tumbling roulette ball...`
`The door to the parlor was not only locked, but blocked with a barricade made of sofas and the like.`
`Because of that, Aunt Rosa seemed to suspect that any suspicious person approaching would break in through the window.`
`Sitting on a one-person sofa, her back to the door, she continued to hold onto her gun.`
`I didn't know what was what anymore, and even though my body and mind were worn out, I played with Maria, as she wanted.`
`Maria had said it.`
` ...Beatrice was testing us to see if we could solve the epitaph of the gold, so we had to try and figure out this riddle.`
`In the beginning, I was a little interested and tried to solve it, but I didn't even have a clue where to start in this weird text.`
`...I didn't doubt that there was some riddle hidden there, but I seriously doubted I'd be able to suddenly leap to an answer.`
`In the middle part of the epitaph, there were the lines going from the first to the tenth twilight, telling us to journey to the Golden Land.`
`On the first twilight, offer the six chosen by the key as sacrifices.`
`On the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close.`
`It was obvious that this hinted at the first six murders that had already occurred in the chapel, and Jessica and Kanon-kun's murders.`
`If this was being followed, we still had to be prepared for five more people to be killed.`
`On the fourth twilight, gouge the head and kill.`
`On the fifth twilight, gouge the chest and kill.`
`On the sixth twilight, gouge the stomach and kill.`
`On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill.`
`On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill.`
`Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa baa-chan's corpses still haven't been found.`
`...However, if this follows the pattern and they're the sacrifices for the fourth and fifth twilights,`
` ...they'll surely be found in a pitiful state, with their head and chest gouged.`
`So, can we expect that three more of us will be gouged in the stomach, knee, and leg and killed?`
`...Who will it be?`
`...I looked around the room, noticing that there were three people here, but...`
` How should I put it...my emotions seemed paralyzed.`
`...Strangely, I didn't feel frightened.`
`As I leaned against the sofa with the top part of my body, gazing up at the ceiling, Maria noticed.`
`...Apparently, she felt I was slacking off in my riddle-solving.`
`She got mad at me for not taking this seriously enough.`
`"...Hey, Maria."`
`"Uu-...?"`
`"What was it again...that Beatrice said she'd do if we solved this?"`
`I'm sure the witch wrote in her letter that she'd give up on collecting interest, or something abstract like that.`
`...I optimistically took that to mean she'd give up on killing the whole family, `
`...but was it really written with that meaning?`
`For some reason, I couldn't convince myself that solving the riddle would really save me.`
`......I feel like maybe, even if we do solve it, we'll just be doing what the culprit wants, and it'll all be a wasted effort...`
`"No, that's not true.`
` ...If you solve the epitaph, Beato's ceremony will end.`
` So, after that, no more people will die."`
`"...Really?`
` Isn't that rule just something she made up...?`
` Whoever solves this riddle...will probably learn the location of Grandfather's hidden gold.`
` ...Then she'll definitely go after it and-"`
`"Uu-.`
` She won't go after it."`
`"...How...can you be so sure?"`
`"The gold has been Beatrice's from the beginning.`
` She wouldn't go after something that's hers."`
`"...Then, ...then why is Beatrice giving us all these big hints?`
` ...Not just that, why did she even set up this game-like thing?"`
`"Risk is essential for magic."`
`"...Risk.`
` ...I don't really know what you mean."`
`"For example, in a marathon,`
` ...do you think a medal anyone can get by running the whole thing is worth the same as the medal given only to the person who gets first...?"`
`"No, I don't...`
` ...So what does this mean? In the end, she's just playing with us?`
` Purposefully giving us a chance-"`
`"Wroooong.`
` That's how magic works.`
` No matter how great a work of magic is, it'll always have risks and weak points.`
` No, it must have them."`
`"...I don't get this stuff you call magic, ...but if I think about it as a gamble, I can understand a little.`
` If you aren't prepared to lose big, then you can't win big.`
` And the slimmer the chances of winning, the bigger the payoff."`
`"That's right.`
` And Beato really did explain the risk of the ceremony to everyone.`
` So, if this riddle is solved, the ceremony will be suspended.`
` After all, if she breaks her promises, there wouldn't be any risk."`
`"If we solve this, ...will she really keep her promise?"`
`"Why are flowers beautiful, even though they wither?`
` Why is it that an artificial flower isn't beautiful, no matter how elaborate it is, even when you can't tell the difference by looking?`
` Humans can bring about miracles by gambling on their deaths.`
` If an undying human existed, they'd have no way of bringing about a miracle.`
` ......That goes for us, life, the witch and the ceremony too.`
` If we don't bear a risk, we can't succeed in anything."`
`"...What do we do if we solve the riddle?`
` Should we raise a hand and cry 'I got it!', tell the witch our answer, and see what she says?"`
`"Uu-.`
` I don't know about that.`
` But if we solve it, the ceremony will surely end automatically."`
`".........`
`...You sure know a lot, Maria.`
` ...Did you learn all of that...from Beatrice?"`
`"Uu-."`
`So, ...if you don't bear a risk, nothing can be gained, is that it?`
`That definitely is the way of the world, ...but it's sort of in conflict with the chessboard thinking I like so much.`
`At least when making moves in chess, players grope for the best move, always trying to avoid risk and hoping for an advantageous turn of events.`
`They don't trust to chance, like in gambling.`
`...That's right, there's no room for gambling in an intellectual game.`
`And yet, this person called Beatrice has created such an outrageous crime,`
` ...or maybe a ceremony, `
`...while purposefully imposing conditions for her own loss and announcing them to us.`
`In chess, you always play your best move.`
`So, by putting yourself in your opponent's position, you can predict their next move.`
`...However, we can't be sure that Beatrice's moves are always the best moves possible.`
`I thought she was probably making us focus on the epitaph to fool us in some way, speaking in riddles.`
`...But according to Maria, that alone was impossible.`
`She said this was a genuine risk that the witch had taken, and therefore proof that this was a formal ceremony for magic.`
`......I can't understand this witch called Beatrice.`
`If she's committing this chain of murders with some goal in mind,`
` ...why did she go to all the trouble of exposing the conditions for her defeat?`
`...No matter how I spin the chessboard around and think from my opponent's perspective, ...I can't understand why she'd give up if this riddle is solved.`
`Isn't it almost as though Beatrice doesn't care whether she wins or loses?`
`Of course chessboard reasoning won't work against an opponent like that...`
`...I don't understand, I don't understand.`
`...What is Beatrice after that's making her carry out this crime?`
`If she just wanted to massacre us all, she could've done it quietly, without this whole crazy setup.`
`There was no need for that kindhearted advance notice, all this self-aware closed room stuff, or any of the rest.`
`...It's all over-acting.`
`I've got no clue what it means.`
`Will I be unable to understand everything...as long as I keep thinking of Beatrice as a greedy human culprit?`
`...If I don't accept her as a witch, will my chessboard thinking be stuck before I've even lined up the pieces...?`
`...If she really is a witch and everything Maria said is true,`
` then there's only one thing for us to do.`
`...The theory-building and discord and searching for the culprit has all been pointless.`
`We should've all gathered in the dining hall, combining our knowledge to solve the riddle.`
`By combining the knowledge of that many people, we might've been able to grasp at least a thread of the answer...`
`The greedy humans, each desiring to gain something over their opponents, ...were getting offered up as sacrifices one by one, without gathering their knowledge together.`
`......In the end, did the humans get what they deserved?`
`They thought they were using their brains, ...but they were actually thinking only of their greedy selves.`
`In the end, chessboard theory is a thinking technique where you project yourself on your opponent.`
`...So greedy people see their greedy selves inside their opponents...`
`I looked lazily at Aunt Rosa.`
`She was probably tired from being under all this tension the whole time.`
`She couldn't sleep, but she kept staring vaguely at some point off in space.`
`Aunt Rosa had announced that we couldn't trust anyone who hadn't been killed.`
`...Aunt Rosa's chessboard thinking...saw herself inside her opponent.`
`...In other words, maybe Aunt Rosa...`
`was an isolated woman, unable to trust anyone and unable to let her guard down.`
`...Long ago, I think I heard a bit about it from my dad.`
`Aunt Rosa was originally a very obedient child.`
`...But her age was too far separated from the other siblings...`
`and they often made conflicting demands of her during their confrontations.`
` Thanks to this, she'd undergone a lot of psychologically harsh experiences in her youth.`
`Often, when she copied one of her siblings, another sibling would give her a hard time.`
`True, Aunt Rosa said many things today that could be taken as abusive.`
`......But that means those words were once showered upon her, which is why they were engraved in her vocabulary.`
`The many abusive words that she'd spoken...were also words that she'd been showered with in the past...`
`...Now that I think about it, I've had the feeling that her style of speech sometimes has traces of Uncle Krauss or Aunt Eva in it.`
`...I'd understood it as them being similar because they were siblings, ...but maybe it wasn't just that...`
`For the first time, I truly sympathized with Aunt Rosa, whom I'd always assumed was just quiet and gentle...`
`Then what about Maria...?`
`Maria's been making a certain claim for a while now.`
`If we can solve the riddle the witch displayed to us, the ceremony will be halted, and we'll definitely be saved.`
`And I think she also said that Beatrice will never break a promise.`
`...But this is Maria we're talking about.`
`She herself never breaks promises, and she has the most innocent heart...`
`So she believes Beatrice also won't break her promises.`
` She's able to believe that.`
`But isn't that just an image of Beatrice in Maria's mind...?`
` There's no proof that the real Beatrice always keeps her promises, right...?`
`"`
`I keep my promises`
`.`
` If you solve the riddle of the epitaph, you should be able to reach the Golden Land.`
` When you do, the ceremony will end.`
` No more people will die."`
`"...So you're saying a complete monster like you follows the rules?"`
`"I won't deny that I am brutal and unjust and a monster.`
` ...However, I am a witch.`
` I use magic.`
` In order to use magic, there are some rules that must be followed.`
` ...Because I am a witch, I cannot neglect those.`
` You should believe at least that much."`
`".........`
`...So even after all the crazy stuff you've done, you're still telling me to believe at least in the rules?"`
`"...I do play tricks.`
` Of course, I also deceive people.`
` I'm no different from humans in that regard.`
` ...But not once have I disregarded a promise I've spoken.`
` What about humans?`
` Do you always keep your promises?"`
`"......Since we have catch phrases like 'Keep your promises', `
`...it's hard to imagine that we always follow them properly."`
`"From my perspective, humans are the truly selfish monsters.`
` ...There's nothing as dubious as a human's promise.`
` Even I sometimes make contracts with humans, but you wouldn't imagine how strict an agreement must be made just to grant a single foolish wish."`
`"...If there's even a small loophole, they'll immediately say something like 'increase the number of wishes to one hundred', or 'go turn yourself into a bean'."`
`"...There's this thing Dad always says.`
` He says there's nothing as scary as contracts.`
` ...According to him, it's only natural that people who sign without reading them thoroughly will get chewed to the bone.`
` ...He's made a killing through vice."`
`"......Imagine it.`
` When people are born, they know nothing of fraud.`
` ...They get it from somewhere.`
` And so they learn it."`
`"........."`
`"Yes, the crimes of the human world, where people must press up against each other.`
` ...Let me see, I've heard that from a witch somewhere.`
` Oh well.`
` ...I'm not as heartless as you think, you see?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Liar!!`
` You killed so many people!!`
` And you did it in such horrible ways too! How could you not be heartless?!!`
` You say you keep your promises?!`
` Don't say stuff like that!!`
` I won't accept you.`
` Ever.`
` I believe my only way to resist you is never giving up on that!"`
`"......I see.`
` So you're saying this eternal torture will be the same for me.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` ...Perhaps.`
` One thousand years is a long time...`
` Maybe a witch's true strength is decided not by their magical power, but by the strength of their endurance.`
` ...Yes, I can accept how terrifying Lady Bern is."`
`"Damn you, babbling on and on about this incomprehensible stuff.`
` ......Let's quickly get back to this eternal torture.`
` I'm prepared to stick around for one thousand years or even ten thousand years."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Good, good.`
` It looks like you've regained some of your will to fight.`
` It would be boring otherwise."`
`"Come now, don't you often see it in competitive games?`
` Sometimes one player intrudes on their opponent's territory, but the opponent is so weak that it's a bit of an anticlimax, so the first player loses on purpose to extend the game until the last round,`
` during which they get serious and shower their opponent with blows, right?"`
`"...I don't get what that means."`
`"It's the same as wine.`
` If you don't let it age well, it won't sparkle.`
` ...You're the same as that wine.`
` I'll carefully make you age.`
` ...I'll raise you to be the best alcohol to adorn my elegant time..."`
`"So don't give up after only this much.`
` Keep on denying me.`
` After all, as long as you don't accept me, I'm nothing more than a fleeting illusion.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"......No matter how many times I see it, ...it's awful."`
`"...I truly sympathize.`
` ...Shannon-san, please get the key.`
` ...Even though she is dead, Madam is a lady.`
` I cannot touch her."`
`"......Of course."`
`Shannon nodded sharply, her expression filled with a sense of duty.`
`George, Gohda and Shannon had broken a suitable window and were inside the chapel.`
`...Since they really hadn't wanted to break one, they'd searched for another way in, just in case.`
`...But in the end, after proving once again that there was nowhere they could slip in through, `
`it only became more obvious that this chapel was a mysterious closed room...`
`Inside the chapel, time had stopped ever since the last time they'd left it.`
`Even George wasn't able to approach that gruesome Halloween party again.`
`It was only natural.`
` It reminded him again of the sadness of losing both parents at once.`
`...And Gohda, thinking of the possibility that those corpses might have changed in some horrible way now that half a day had passed, didn't want to let George get near them.`
`Shannon followed Gohda's instructions...and approached the party table...`
`...Normally, Shannon might have resented having another dirty job forced on her.`
` ...But now, she could truly understand Gohda's mental state.`
`Even though Gohda had prodigious skill, he'd gotten dragged into trouble, losing his job and ending up left out in the streets, ...before Natsuhi gave him a new life.`
`...Though it had been just a casual employment decision for Natsuhi, Gohda must've thought it a turning point in his fate.`
`...Those around Gohda could see that he felt a special kind of loyalty to Natsuhi.`
`...So he probably didn't want to lose that feeling, even after her death.`
`...Now that half a day had passed, the bodies of Natsuhi and the rest had changed completely.`
`Small bugs sniffing out the smell of death had started to gather.`
`...It really wasn't something you'd want to look at directly...`
`"...Madam, ......excuse me..."`
`Because of her long experience as a servant, Shannon had an idea of which pocket Natsuhi kept the key to her room in.`
`......It would probably be...this pocket...`
`Her guess didn't fail her.`
`Just by touching the outside of the pocket, she was immediately able to feel it...`
`"It's here.`
` ...The key to Madam's room."`
`Shannon held the key up high, showing the others that it had been found.`
`As George and Gohda watched her, their eyes opened wide...`
`That wasn't the expression Shannon was expecting, so it startled her.`
`After all, Shannon hadn't noticed.`
`George and Gohda, watching from afar, noticed it first.`
`After all, when Shannon had held the key up high, ...a blizzard of gold leaf had seeped up from around the table.`
`They were...countless gold butterflies.`
`It was the first time George had seen them, so it might've looked like some kind of illusion.`
`...But Gohda already knew.`
`...He knew that those gold butterflies were far from beautiful, and that they would bring about some kind of misfortune.`
`And that gold swelled, trying to suck Shannon in......`
`"Sh-Shannon-san!!`
` Run!!"`
`"Huh?!`
` Kyaa!!!"`
`Shannon also realized that gold butterflies were trying to swallow her up.`
`She ran unsteadily, her expression still shocked.`
`As she did, the gold butterflies danced around her all at once.`
`They grouped together.`
` They tried to swallow her up!`
`"Shannonnnnn!!`
` Damn it, what is this?!`
` Are these...the gold butterflies you guys were talking about?!"`
`"Outside, quickly!!`
` You bastards!`
` Damn it, damn it!!"`
`George and Gohda rushed up to Shannon, driving off the cloud of butterflies.`
`And while the butterflies were scattered, they ran towards the broken window!`
`However, they needed a good footing to get out the window, which was surrounded by shards of broken glass.`
`When they'd entered, there had been enough time to prepare for that, but now there was none.`
`"Let's go out through the door!!`
` There's no time to look for a footing!"`
`'!s1`
`It won't open...!`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, sha_2e803:`
`"Give it to me!!`
`'!s0`
`...nnnnnn!!"`
`"George-sama, quickly!!`
` Damn it, don't take me lightly, wooooooooooooooohhh!!"`
`Gohda took off his jacket, swinging it around and scattering the group of butterflies.`
`But saying he was outnumbered would be a real understatement.`
`It was doubtful that it even bought them a short amount of time.`
`George struggled with the broken handle.`
`Its age showed, and it didn't turn well.`
`I can't leave it to strength, it needs the right angle, or there's some trick to it...`
`"George-sama!!`
` Damn iiiiiiiiiiiit!!`
` You monsteeers!!"`
`...At that moment, Gohda saw it.`
`...He was seen by it.`
`In other words, their eyes met.`
`On top of the party table...`
`no, with the stained glass behind it, floating, laughing, was the figure of the witch.`
`He saw the figure of the laughing witch in the center of the golden whirlwind, with the gold butterflies fluttering about at the ready.`
`'!s1`
`B-`
`Beatrice......"`
`It should have been Gohda's first meeting with her.`
`...But he knew her at a glance.`
`Just like the other servants had said, this was certainly, certainly...the witch of the portrait herself...!`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` It's almost time for dinner, is it not?`
` ...I am the host of this mansion now.`
` So I must give you a warm reception before your wonderful dinner.`
` ...And look, we even have 'three people', fit to order.`
` ...My, my, how truly, truly convenient!!"`
`"U-Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"I-It's open!!"`
`"Gohda-san, quickly...!!`
` ......!`
` Beatrice...sama..."`
`"Huh?!`
` ......?!?!"`
`"Are you sure it's a good idea to just stand there...?`
` If you think this place will make a fitting cemetery for yourselves, then be my guests.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!`
` I must praise your spirit for wanting to stay by your former masters' sides and serve them even after death!"`
`The golden whirlwind that wrapped around the witch burst.`
`It was like an evil hand had literally spread its fingers and was trying to attack them!`
`The cloud of gold butterflies attacked with a fluttering sound.`
`"Hurry!!`
` We can't stay here!!"`
`George's voice brought Shannon and Gohda back to their senses.`
`Standing here now would make them like frogs getting stared down by a snake.`
`They had to resist.`
`...They had to fight this incarnation of the new, brutal, and frightening order in which Rokkenjima had been enveloped...!`
`There was no time to take out their umbrellas.`
`The three of them dashed out into the pouring rain.`
`The three of them never realized because they didn't turn around, `
` but the gold butterflies apparently couldn't handle the rain too well, `
`and this hampered their ability to chase after the humans.`
`The three people ran from their golden pursuers and flew into the mansion...`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` How nice, how nice.`
` It wouldn't be as fun any other way!"`
`They unlocked the door and dashed into the room.`
`A bit of the scent from Natsuhi's favorite gentle incense remained in there.`
`...However, there was no time to let that calm them now.`
`"Where is it?!`
` You said it was in a treasure box, right...?!"`
`"It's just a story I heard...!`
` I never heard exactly where it was...!"`
`"......I-I think it'll probably be in her dresser or next to the bed!"`
`Shannon's womanly sensibilities led her to conclude that.`
`But next to the bed, there was only an incense burner, a half-read novel, and glasses.`
`However, the dresser was elegant and had many drawers, and it would be understandable if she'd kept some of her valuables there.`
`"Aunt Natsuhi, sorry...!!"`
`He began to violently open each one of the drawers.`
`He had to hurry.`
`He couldn't actually hear footsteps, ...but he had the feeling that the witch was approaching...`
`He had the feeling that her laugh was approaching...!!`
`He emptied the drawers one by one and examined their contents.`
`...Every small box for makeup looked like a treasure box, `
`and the amount of effort it would take to inspect all of them made him feel a little dizzy.`
`"M-Maybe it's this box...`
` It's locked, and I can't open it...!"`
`At a glance, it looked slightly larger than a music box.`
`When shaken, it rustled, as though various small objects were inside.`
`But it was locked and didn't open!`
`"N-Normally, you'd hide the key somewhere nearby.`
` ...Though some people would always carry it on their person...`
` I don't know, ...I don't know...!!"`
`"There's no choice, ...break it!`
` But we can't do it with force, right? We might break the mirror inside.`
` Could there be a tool to pry it open...?!`
` Damn it...!!"`
`Gohda looked all over the room, trying to see if there was some tool that they could use.`
`And he noticed the door, which had been left open ever since they'd entered.`
`He approached the door to close it...and saw the abominable shadows of people approaching from beyond the darkness in the hall...`
`No, it wasn't shadows of 'people'.`
`...Because they weren't Human at all!!`
`'!s1`
`George-sama!!!`
` H-`
`Hurry..."`
`Gohda's voice trailed off...`
`It was the shock...of seeing a procession of those not of this world.`
`He was a servant.`
`So he knew all the servants working for the Ushiromiya family.`
`...But he didn't know about these.`
`However, they were definitely servants...!!`
`And not servants working for Ushiromiya Kinzo or Ushiromiya Krauss.`
`...These new servants, who worked for the new master of the mansion, the Golden Witch Beatrice, `
`had goat heads and bright-red, boiled eyes of lava!!`
`As the new master laughed loudly and trimly directed six of the new servants,`
` he saw them approach, piercing the darkness as they came.`
`...Of course, she was clad in the gold butterflies that were her symbol.`
`Gohda hurriedly closed the door and locked it!`
`However, just as he locked it, it returned to normal, just as though a spring or something had knocked it back!`
`It gave the illusion that some prankster beyond the door was unlocking it every time he locked it.`
`...They couldn't have reached the other side of the door yet!!`
`So who was doing it, and how...?!`
`It almost felt like playing with a broken toy.`
`*click*, *boing*.`
`*click*, *boing*.`
`"U-Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!`
` I-It won't lock!!`
` Even if I lock it, it unlocks!`
` What's going on, dammitdammitdammitdammit!!"`
`"Hehhahahahahahahaha...!!`
` Did you think a lock would stop me?`
` Did you think the door to that room could hold back that room's new master?!"`
`It was like the witch could see Gohda's frantic effort through the door.`
`Even now, the footsteps continued to approach...`
`And when not just their footsteps, but even their breath could be heard, `
`Gohda gave up on the lock and slammed into the door, locking it using his own large body.`
`"...George-sama, quickly quickly quickly!!!"`
`"George-sama, what about this?!"`
`"A letter opener?!`
` That's better, let me have it!`
` The fountain pen isn't working!"`
`George took it and once again dug into the crack under the lid of the treasure box.`
`...It looks like it's working...!`
`"Quickly, quickly!!`
` Eeeeeeeeepp, `
`GWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!"`
`The pressure from across the door grew even stronger.`
`...Gohda screamed.`
`This wasn't a war cry during a test of strength.`
`...He was terrified.`
`He was simply terrified that nothing but a single wooden door was stopping him from touching something not of this world.`
`But he was still lucky.`
`He wasn't touching the things directly.`
`Because they were on the other side of the door.`
`So, if he were to touch them directly,`
` ...Gohda's cry would surely turn from something brave into a pathetic, piercing scream, ...and therefore one that was more real.`
`Gohda couldn't believe what was happening right before his eyes.`
`'!s0`
`...an arm was...`
`an arm was...`
`slipping straight through the wood like it was water, `
`as though doing this was the most natural thing in the world, `
`and it rubbed the back of Gohda's hand as he frantically tried to hold the door shut.`
`'!s0`
`slid up his arm...`
`to his chest...`
`and then...`
`...up to his chin.`
`By now, Gohda's scream wasn't even audible anymore.`
`He could hear a sweet whispering voice from across the door.`
`...It wasn't coming from the witch, but it sounded like a young woman.`
`...However, that didn't change the fact that came from someone not of this world.`
`"...*giggle*giggle*`
` So cuuute.`
` ...Hey, you see it, right? Your life flashing before your eyes.`
` ...Let me know when it's over, 'kay?"`
`"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPPPP!!"`
`"Thanks.`
` It's over already, isn't it?`
` ...*giggle*giggle*!"`
`That lewd arm burst.`
`Then they heard the sound of something jumping around the room at an incredible speed.`
`They didn't know what it was.`
`Incredibly fast, small, like steel or maybe a beetle...!`
`'!s0`
`......they realized for the first time......`
`that its true form...`
`...was something like a stake with a strange design on it...`
`'!s0`
`bent backwards, `
`...and fell over.`
`As it did, the door opened softly, even though no one was pushing it, `
`...welcoming in the new master of this room.`
`It looked almost as though the door itself had accepted her.`
`The goat attendants came in one after another, six of them...!!`
`Then that witch came in, and the gold butterflies came in!!`
`The room was wrapped in a blizzard of gold leaf, which fell and piled up, turning it more and more into a world of gold...!!`
`"......Shannon,`
` the roulette has chosen you and George.`
` Thank me for your day of release.`
` Do you have any regrets?"`
`"You don't, do you?`
` Receiving an engagement ring from the man you fell for, and then being killed before spending your first night together? That hardly counts as a regret at all, riiiiiiiiiiiiight???`
` You wanted him to hold you, didn't yooooooooooou?`
` You wanted him to teach you a woman's joy, riiiiight?`
` Kuhihihyahyahyahyahyahyahyahya!!`
` Ahh, no, no, Shannon, you're dribbling, see? Your regret is dripping down from your mouth.`
` I can see it dribbling down from your moooooouth, Shannonnnnnnnnn!`
` Hihhyahyahahahahahahahahaha`
`hihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihhi!!!"`
`*crack*`
`It was the sound of the lid to the treasure box breaking open.`
`When George turned it over, accessories, charms, `
`...various small objects that Natsuhi had treasured when she was a girl fell out.`
`...Mixed in with that...was a pouch that stood out from the rest.`
`He picked it up and was immediately sure.`
`......This was it.`
`"I found it, ...this is it......"`
`"So close, and yet so far.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Die!"`
`"...D-Damn it!!"`
`All at once, the gold butterflies attacked George, who was hurriedly trying to remove the contents of the pouch.`
`At that time, a bright red flash seemed to light up the room for an instant...`
`That red flash seemed to cut a hole in the cloud of gold butterflies raging around the room, ...drawing a circle with Shannon at the center...`
`...So, the resulting scene looked truly divine.`
`...Almost as though a single streak of light had cut through the clouds in this world of gold...`
`George, who was curled in a ball, trying to protect himself from the group of butterflies, didn't have a clue what was going on.`
`...Then he noticed that Shannon was standing guard in front of him, shielding him,`
` as she glared at the witch and the rest with a serious face she'd never shown him before...`
`"......I'd forgotten.`
` You're another sample of Kinzo's outstanding furniture.`
` And you've matured much more than Kanon..."`
`"......How could you...do that to Kanon-kun?`
` ......I don't mean killing him.`
` ...How could you...erase his remains...`
`and even try to disgrace his honor...?"`
`"Come now, Shannonnnnn, is that why you're maaad?`
` If you're lonely because Kanon hasn't been around, just let me know, and I'll let you see him whenever you liiiike!!"`
`When the witch snapped her fingers, ...one of the six goat attendants...glittered gold and changed into Kanon.`
`It was definitely a sight to make one doubt their eyes.`
`...It was definitely Kanon's face.`
`...However, in those eyes, the glint of Kanon's integrity was nowhere to be seen.`
`...They were the hazy eyes of furniture that only obeyed the orders of the witch.`
`...George couldn't understand the scene right before his eyes.`
`...And he finally understood why Gohda and the rest had been unable to talk about what they'd seen in the servant room.`
`"......Are you enjoying this?"`
`"Yes, I am.`
` It's always fun to reunite a pair that have been torn apart by death.`
` After all, I get to enjoy tearing them apart by death, reuniting them, and then tearing them apart again."`
`"So, Kanonnn, go and play with your sister.`
` If she knocks you about, let her see you suffer with all the anguish you can manage.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*"`
`...From the impostor Kanon's arm, ...a strangely shining curve extended.`
`......He planned to tear Shannon apart with that.`
`...With a single stroke, he would attack Shannon, who still hadn't prepared her heart, and...`
`"...I won't forgive you.`
` ...I'll never forgive you...for dishonoring the dead not just once, ...but twice."`
`"Enough babbling, go get killed by your brother, Shannonnnnn!`
` I'm sure you'll bear witness to a wonderful dreeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaam!!!"`
`The impostor Kanon certainly seemed to lunge at Shannon, drawing several purple curves...`
`But when he flew at her, ...it was as though some kind of invisible wall had been placed in front of her.`
`...The wall repelled the imposter, leaving a bright red ripple on its surface.`
`...No, it didn't repel him, it smashed him.`
`...It knocked him back, turning him into golden dust, into little bits, scattering him...!`
`That foolish furniture, who had taken Kanon's form and even disgraced his honor after death, broke into countless gold butterflies,`
` and then those butterflies themselves broke into pieces, and those pieces were broken into pieces,`
` until they were no longer butterflies, but a golden splash that faded away.`
`"......Sh-Shannon........."`
`"......George-san, please don't move from that spot.`
` I don't want to shift the central axis."`
`"Well this is......certainly a surprise!!`
` So, though your face makes it look as though you wouldn't hurt a fly, ......you can display such power?!!"`
`"I see, so that spirit mirror is lending you strength...`
` But you don't have the tools or the time to draw out its true power."`
`"I won't let you have either of those.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The spirit mirror George gripped had let out a divine glow, displaying a strength powerful enough not to submit to wicked forces.`
`But that glow was no match for the witch's sinister nature...`
`"This is why furniture can be frightening!`
` That feeling, like unexpectedly stubbing your little toe on the corner of a cabinet.`
` ...Yes, this is why furniture can be frightening!!`
` You furniture, furniture, furnituuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure!!"`
`"......I am not furniture.`
` ...And right now, you seem very pitiful to me."`
`"Whaat...?`
` Hoh.`
` ...What did this furniture, who hasn't lived even a hundred years, just say to a thousand-year-old witch...?"`
`"...You're a very pitiful person.`
` ......Of course two people in love will have regrets when they're separated.`
` But they'll feel none of the kind of regret you're hoping for."`
`"You dare to speak, furniture...?!!`
` Have you forgotten the days when you were so desperate to be tied to George that you licked my shoes?!!"`
`"Living with love and crawling through the muck is what humans do.`
` If you sneer and look down on them for that, then you're far inferior to them.`
` Especially now, I pity you.`
` ...How precious is it for a loving couple when they bring their love to fruition by sleeping together on their first night?"`
`"...It does have meaning, it definitely does.`
` ...But it's completely different from what you're saying.`
` It means something so sacred that one such as you has no right to speak of it wickedly."`
`"So I no longer have any regrets.`
` George-san and I have sworn our love to each other.`
` As proof, I accepted his ring.`
` ...With that, our eternal vows were completed!`
` No matter how you torture us with your wicked magic and your malice, you cannot disgrace eternity!!"`
`"...Ha!`
` Don't speak in cheap ideals, like some poet!!`
` Love is lust, totally meaningless unless you're sleeping together.`
` Men are mere flies and maggots that get drawn to your female scent and crowd around you.`
` Do you still not understand that at your aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaage?"`
`"You'll despair, the very first time you witness the dark lust of that glasses man behind you, `
`you'll be crushed, shocked, dumbfounded, stupefied, and it's all useless, Shannoooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!`
` Hiiiihaaaaaaahahahahahaaahaaaaaah!!"`
`"Yeah, that's enough talk out of you, you furniture furniture furniture, `
`who the hell do you think you are, talking like that, no matter how beautiful you try to make love sound, in the end it's a fraud because love is filthy filth, `
`don't people become adults when they realize thaaaaaaaaaat, die you trash, furniture furniture scrap, `
`I'll turn you into a filthy maggot, then we'll see whether that glasses guy still loves you, `
`I'll show you that this guy's only had his eyes on your fleeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh, `
`die you piece of craaaaaaaaaaaaap, don't you tell me about looooooooooooooooooove!!"`
`The invisible column of light with Shannon at the center...started to have bright red ripples drawn all over it at once.`
`...The wall did its best to withstand the unseeable malice that tried to corrode in on them from all directions.`
`"What, do you actually think you're resisting?!`
` You're insignificant you're frail, just like your cheap ideals, just a frail pretense, `
`you're just hiding what you don't want to see by covering it with a veil do you stiiill not understand that's why you're furniture you furniture, `
`see see see see see it's being eraaaaaaased crackcrunchsmacksnap how thin how shameful, `
`Parmigiano-Reggiano would be harder to cut through than your frail resistaaaaaaaaaaaance`
`hiiyahhaaahahaah!!"`
`The golden windstorm that covered the room gradually began to shave the walls off the column that protected Shannon and George.`
`The bright-red ripples frantically drew a resisting pattern, but that just turned it into a red wall of despair that began to wrap the two of them up...`
`"......George-san, I'm sorry...`
` ......It was too much...`
`...for me...`
`after all......"`
`"...Yeah, thank you.`
` ...You fought for my sake.`
` ...That alone makes me happy."`
`...The round wall that had once protected them was assaulted and covered with a curve of bright red ripples as it seemed to scream,`
` ...and it began to suck the two of them up instead.`
`"George-san, can I ask a favor?"`
`Shannon grasped George's hand behind her.`
`So George hugged her shoulders just as strongly.`
`"What is it?"`
`"In the end, ...please let me hear you say 'I love you'."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...Sayo, I will forever`
`After Genji finished his late meal, he went out to do the nighttime rounds inside the mansion.`
`He'd eaten some reheated soup that Gohda had made, along with some random leftovers from the refrigerator.`
`Those were all things Gohda had made himself, and were, of course, delicious.`
`He had half-heartedly gone to ask Rosa and the others what they would do for dinner, `
`but he'd been yelled at by a voice telling him that the canned food they had would be enough, and the door wasn't even opened for him.`
`...So, ironically, the servant Genji was able to eat a more delicious meal...`
`...But why was it that Genji wasn't afraid to do the rounds all by himself, `
`even though all of those crimes had been committed and many people had already met a brutal end?`
`...Judging by his appearance as he carried out his usual tasks without a trace of fear, as though everything was normal, `
`you might think all of the horrible events that day had been no more than a dream or an illusion.`
`Was he taking a philosophic view, or had he just accepted his fate?`
`Genji must have considered it a virtue that, when the fate that awaited him was unavoidable, `
`he carry out his duty systematically until the last moment.`
`The depths of his heart would probably remain hidden for all eternity, unless he spoke of them himself...`
`He had returned his master key to Rosa, so the places he could reach were extremely limited.`
`All he could do was walk around the hallways, checking to make sure all the windows were closed.`
`That probably made his rounds go a lot faster than usual.`
`"............`
`...Hmm."`
`At the sound of a reserved knock, `
`Aunt Rosa, who had been falling into a doze, jumped and woke up, pointing the barrel of the gun at the door as she yelled.`
`"Who is it?!"`
`I was napping on a sofa...and that voice also brought me back to reality.`
`"...Rosa-sama,`
` it is I, Genji."`
`"Do you have some business?`
` Don't worry about opening the door.`
` Tell us from there."`
`"......Yes Ma'am.`
` In that case, forgive me for speaking in this fashion.`
` ...I have found Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa's corpses."`
`"Wh-What did you say...?!!"`
`"......I see.`
` Very well, let's go and check them.`
` ...Until I see the corpses, I won't believe anyone."`
`"........."`
`"...Uu-.`
` It's okay, Battler.`
` If you stay with me, it'll definitely be okay."`
`Maybe my face seemed to be darkened with anxiety.`
`...Maria grasped my hand with her small hand and spoke softly, trying to give me courage.`
`Since it was Aunt Rosa's job to ready the gun and stand guard, it fell to me to remove the barricade of sofas.`
`When I finished, I took a backwards glance at Aunt Rosa, who was pointing the barrel of the gun over my shoulder, and opened the door.`
`"Genji-san, where are their corpses...?"`
`"......In the courtyard.`
` I shall guide you."`
`"Battler-kun, wait!`
` Just in case, let's check the doors and windows of this room.`
` Wait a second."`
`Aunt Rosa called me to a halt to prevent me from going on ahead and began to carefully check the locks on each of the windows.`
`...But those locks had already been checked once.`
`...It felt kind of unpleasant, as though she suspected that I might've secretly unlocked them when she wasn't looking.`
`...No, maybe Aunt Rosa was right to be this cautious...`
`Though it was called a courtyard, it wasn't really a pretty place you could take a walk in, like the rose garden.`
`On the contrary, since it was surrounded by the mansion on all sides, `
`it made you feel a little uncomfortable, as though it was telling you that there would be no escape from this mansion no matter where you tried to run.`
`On the other hand, that meant that even though we could still hear the violent winds, the wind itself was blocked.`
`Genji-san held out an umbrella, but Aunt Rosa ignored him.`
`...She was probably hinting that the gun took two hands, and it would be dangerous if she took the umbrella.`
`We didn't need Genji-san pointing for us to notice.`
`Right in the center of the courtyard, ...we could see where Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa-san lay...`
`Aunt Rosa entered the courtyard without even opening an umbrella.`
`...So Genji and I also entered the courtyard without opening one.`
`Only Maria opened hers.`
`".........Maria, `
`...is this...you know what?"`
`"...Uu-.`
` ...It's the seventh and the eighth twilights."`
`"...I-I see.`
` Certainly, just as Genji-san and the others said, there are horrible wounds on their necks.`
` ...The cuts are quite sharp.`
` Almost as though they were sliced with a katana or something..."`
`Those gaping wounds on their necks definitely made me want to avert my eyes,`
` but after seeing that Halloween party in the chapel, even though they looked horrible, they were no longer enough to make me feel sick.`
`More importantly, our gazes fell to their legs.`
`To Doctor Nanjo's knee.`
`To Kumasawa-san's ankle.`
`...Driven into each of them was something like a knife or a stake with a demonic design.`
`...They must have been the same as the thing that had pierced Jessica's back.`
`"...What is this?`
` ...It's just like what happened to Jessica-chan.`
` Is this supposed to be some kind of occult ceremony, I wonder?"`
`"......I do not know.`
` The last time I saw their bodies, there was nothing like these.`
` Maybe it was done after they were carried out of the servant room."`
`The one stuck into Doctor Nanjo's knee was still standing erect, `
`but the one that had been thrust into Kumasawa-san's ankle might have been a little shallower.`
` It had come out and fallen over.`
`So, by looking at the one that had fallen over, for the first time, I realized that it wasn't a knife, `
`but something like a stake.`
`Its full length was probably about 30 centimeters.`
`It was probably made out of bronze or iron or something of the sort.`
`Even without touching it, I could tell it had some weight to it.`
`It was composed of a grip and a cone-shaped part, and it was obviously made to be a piercing weapon.`
`Maybe it was like a miniature version of those lances western knights used on horseback.`
`The spiral-shaped ditches in it made it also look like a small drill.`
`...However, the grip had an occult design modeled off a demon or something,`
` so instead of a weapon used in war, `
`it felt like something that would be used in a ceremony to offer up living sacrifices.`
`"...There's no mistake.`
` ...They're meant to be...sacrifices."`
`"...On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill.`
` On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill."`
`"Wait a sec.`
` That means they've left out the fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights.`
` ...C-Could it be..."`
`Of course.`
`Why is Genji-san alone?!`
`If something like this has happened, why aren't George-aniki, Gohda-san, and Shannon-chan here?!`
` Why was Genji-san alone?!`
`"What's going on?`
` Where did George-kun and the other two go?!"`
`"......They said they wanted to search for something in Madam Natsuhi's room, and they left.`
` They have not returned yet."`
`"What did you say...?`
` Umm, you say they left, but when was that?!"`
`"Two or three hours ago, I believe."`
`"N-No way...!!`
` Why didn't you tell us something that...wait, no, ...why didn't you think that was suspicious?!"`
`"...There must be at least one servant on standby at all times.`
` It was my duty to wait for orders until they returned."`
`Was Genji-san really this much of a robot?!`
`This is bad, this is bad, it's really bad...!!`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa-san were ~ib~killed like this~ib~, which means that three people have already been killed...!!`
`We ran towards Aunt Natsuhi's room.`
`......With a touch of anxiety, and just as much resignation.`
`Before we even saw the inside of Aunt Natsuhi's room, `
`...we were forced to resign ourselves to a certain fact.`
`'!s0`
`scribble...`
`no, filth...?`
`Anyway, the room wasn't in an ordinary state, and without even opening the door, we could imagine what we'd find inside.`
`On the face of the door......how should I say it?`
`...Handprints, done heavily with the same red paint as the magic circles from before, `
`...had banged on the door, scratched at it, dirtied it.`
`...It looked like the aftermath of a kindergartner playing in the mud.`
`I didn't know what it could mean.`
`...The bright-red paint that had been slathered on was dripping down, and even though no one said it, it made us think of blood.`
`"...G-Genji-san, please open it."`
`Aunt Rosa held her gun up high and ordered Genji-san to open the door.`
`Genji-san approached it without seeming particularly troubled by that stuff on it...and turned the knob, `
`but immediately turned around, shaking his head.`
`It was locked.`
`At that moment, there was only one person in this mansion who could lock and unlock doors at will, Aunt Rosa.`
`This time, Genji-san asked Aunt Rosa to unlock the door, instead of the other way around.`
`After frowning slightly for a second, Aunt Rosa handed me a master key and told me to open the door.`
`"...Battler-kun, would you open it for me with this?"`
`"Just trusting Genji-san with something like that wouldn't..."`
`Aunt Rosa glared at me intensely.`
`...Getting into a fight here would only make the mood turn even more sour.`
`Without talking back any more, I approached that creepy door and tried the knob.`
` ...It didn't open.`
`It was definitely the resistance of the lock.`
`I stuck the master key into the keyhole.`
`*clunk*`
` There was a slight resistance.`
`Aunt Rosa told me to be on my guard, and I opened the door without really guarding myself in any way.`
`And then, ......there was a scene laid out before us that didn't betray my expectations at all.`
`"............!`
` H-Horrible..."`
`"........."`
`"As I thought, ...it's a reproduction of the fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights."`
`"......Uu-."`
`The inside of the room looked as though a robber had just broken in.`
`Drawers had been flung open, pulled out, and had their contents thrown about all over the place, `
`leaving the room so cluttered you'd never believe it belonged to the methodical Aunt Natsuhi.`
`But the very first thing that caught our eyes...`
`...was Gohda-san's corpse lying facedown right in front of the door...`
`Right in the center of his chest, almost as though it had been stuck there to finish off a vampire, was one of those demon stakes from before.`
`...Exactly how far could it have reached after being stuck that deeply into his chest?`
`...Just imagining it would make anyone's chest hurt.`
`"...Wasn't gouging the chest...the fifth twilight?"`
`"......Uu-."`
`Maria grabbed my hand.`
`...Her expression looked just like normal, `
`...but maybe she really was afraid of the aura in this room where three corpses lay.`
`And, along the wall farthest into the room, George-aniki lay dead.`
`...This time, one of those stakes had been rammed right into the center of his stomach.`
`...Wasn't gouging the stomach...the sixth twilight?`
`Shannon-chan's corpse was face down in front of the dresser, lying in a sea of blood.`
`Had she seen her own face at the end...in that horribly broken mirror stained with blood?`
`...Because she was lying that way, I couldn't see her face, but I could guess even without seeing it.`
`Nearby, in the sea of blood she lay in, a demon's stake had fallen...`
`...Only the fourth twilight was left.`
`Gouge the head and kill...`
`Maybe my heart was totally worn out and dead...`
`Even though I knew it was wrong, ...I lifted her head...and checked.`
`...And, I confirmed that my guess had been right on the mark.`
`There was a gaping hole in Shannon-chan's head, and the insides were dripping out.`
`Not only that, ...but you could even see...inside her.`
`After seeing that, I finally realized I was doing something wrong.`
`I immediately averted my eyes, but by now, it was probably pointless.`
`"Hey, Battler-kun!!`
` You mustn't touch anything until the police come!!`
` What do you think you're doing, touching it?!`
` What will you do if our precious evidence on the scene gets disturbed?!!"`
`Aunt Rosa got violently mad at me and even tugged at the back of my collar.`
`I tottered limply and fell on my butt, ...gazing dimly up at the ceiling...`
`"...Maria."`
`"Uu-...?"`
`"...With this, even the eighth twilight is over.`
` ...What was the ninth twilight again?"`
`".........`
`...On the ninth twilight, the witch shall revive, and none shall be left alive."`
`"I see.`
` ...After this, the Golden Witch Beatrice will be revived.`
` ...What then?`
` ...On the final tenth twilight?"`
`"...On the tenth twilight, at journey's end, you shall attain to the power of the Golden Land's treasures, once and for the last time.`
` ...Very soon, the door to the Golden Land will be opened.`
` ...Very soon."`
`"......The witch shall be revived and none shall be left alive, huh?`
` ......We're gonna die now?`
` Or does this mean the ceremony of sacrifices is over, ...and that now, at journey's end, we'll reach the Golden Land...?"`
`"............"`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, but_2e1091:`
`...and we haven't gotten anywhere.`
` It's like they say, thinking stupid is no better than sleeping."`
`"That's right, we've spent the whole day burning ourselves up with hatred and paranoia.`
` ...We were so sure we could only trust the dead...`
`...that we came all the way here just to confirm these three deaths with our own eyes...`
` ...If we're like this, `
`...why...`
`...should we be able to make it to the Golden Land...?"`
`That's right, ...if we couldn't resolve any of our problems anyway, `
`it would've been so much better if we'd locked ourselves up the whole time without thinking at all.`
`Grandfather's the wisest of us.`
`He's been shut up in his room since yesterday, without any contact with anyone.`
`...That was the right decision.`
`Grandfather was the most correct of us all...`
`"...It's okay, Battler.`
` ...If you're with me, you'll be okay.`
` ......The witch is very fickle, and she's a terrifying being who might kill humans partly for fun sometimes."`
`"...However, if you're with me, you'll be okay.`
` So don't be afraid."`
`"......Thank you.`
` ...Even if you're just saying it to console me, I'm glad."`
`After Aunt Rosa finished investigating their corpses, she announced that she'd seal this room again,`
` chased the rest of us out, stole back the master key she'd lent me, and locked the door again.`
`Apparently, George-aniki had been holding the key to Aunt Natsuhi's room.`
` She also collected that.`
`......Wait a sec.`
`She's got all of the master keys on her person.`
`If Natsuhi's own key was locked up inside this room, `
`...doesn't that make it another closed room?`
`So what, is this the fourth closed room...?`
`Now that the suspicion surrounding those three had been cleared, ...we returned to the parlor once more.`
`I don't have a clue what's going on anymore.`
`...If only the dead are innocent, and everyone alive is a wolf, `
`...that leaves only me, Aunt Rosa, Maria, and Genji-san.`
`...And, besides us, there's only Grandfather and that 19th person, the guest we've seen no trace of, Beatrice.`
`13 people have died, and six are left.`
`...How would a wolves and sheep puzzle with only six people end...?`
`Even though a puzzle that started with 19 people has been reduced to six, `
`...I can't think of an answer...`
`We returned to the parlor.`
`...I was a bit worried that, while we were gone, `
`a creepy magic circle or something might've been drawn on the parlor door, `
`but thankfully, we didn't find anything like that...`
`"Thank you, Genji-san.`
` This is far enough.`
` Please rest for the day."`
`"...Certainly.`
` ...Then, please excuse me."`
`"H-Hey, Aunt Rosa, `
`...are you saying you'll leave Genji-san all alone in a situation like this...?"`
`"...That's right.`
` I do think it's quite dangerous.`
` ...But in that case, why is he safe?`
` After those three headed to Natsuhi nee-san's room, he was alone the whole time.`
` And yet he's safe."`
`"...It's a wolves and sheep puzzle.`
` Why would a sheep be safe if it was all alone, and therefore in its weakest possible position?"`
`"...P-Probably because, by coincidence, there weren't any wolves around..."`
`"Wrong.`
` It's because it wasn't a sheep."`
`"Are you saying Genji-san's...a wolf...?"`
`"He said he was alone in the kitchen, but that's impossible to prove.`
` The only ones who could have carried Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa-san's corpses, who could have killed George and the rest, ...were him and Beatrice, right?"`
`"W-Wait, with that argument, anyone-"`
`"...Battler-sama,`
` thank you for your concern."`
`"...I believe trust is won not with a hundred excuses, but with simple faithfulness.`
` ...Even if I am not able to gain your trust, I wish to be faithful until the end."`
`"............Genji-san..."`
`"...Then we're decided.`
` If you truly are innocent, the police will prove that for us when they come tomorrow.`
` So, until then, we cannot remove you from suspicion."`
`"......After your long years of service, I find it truly painful to treat you so poorly.`
` ...But please understand about tonight.`
` ...And, when tomorrow comes, please let us make up again."`
`Genji-san gave his head a small shake.`
`"...Today and tomorrow,`
` I will continue to be a servant of the Ushiromiya family.`
` ...If you need anything, please say so at any time.`
` Then, if you will excuse me."`
`After hearing all that, there was nothing left to say.`
`Genji-san bowed deeply and left down the hall...`
`Then, we entered the room.`
`...Even though Aunt Rosa still held all of the master keys herself, she thoroughly checked the inside of the parlor again.`
`She opened the curtains and checked again to make sure the windows were locked.`
`As I watched...how should I say it, I felt like it didn't really matter anymore.`
`If I said anything careless, it would turn into another fight.`
`For a while, I gazed at her from the corridor, figured I'd waited just about long enough, and entered the parlor behind her.`
`...If she doesn't trust anyone but the dead, why doesn't she just go around killing everyone with the gun she's got in her hand?`
`And then, in the end, she'll realize that she herself is the wolf.`
`...Then she can just blast through the head of the final wolf and close the curtain on this insane murder drama...`
`As I thought that bitterly, I returned to the sofa where I'd been encamped before, `
`rudely resting both of my feet on the table...`
`...When I tried to do that, I found something there and stopped moving my feet.`
`"............`
`......What is...this...?"`
`Right there, almost as though it had been addressed to me, ...was a Western envelope.`
`It was that envelope from before, with the seal of the One-Winged Eagle.`
`...And it was unopened.`
`...W-`
`Wait wait wait wait...`
`...What is...this......?`
`Who put it in a place like this, and when...?`
`Until I went with everyone to check the corpses, I was sitting here the whole time.`
`And there wasn't anything there then.`
`'!s0`
`it was...`
`here.`
`"...It's okay.`
` Everything's still locked up securely.`
` This room is safe."`
`I heard Rosa muttering that...`
`...Wait wait wait wait.`
`...Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait.`
`We made sure this room was safe when we left it.`
`We checked that the windows were all perfectly locked.`
`...Then we locked it up, came back, and the windows were still locked.`
`...Then...wait, who put this letter here, and how...?`
`I opened the letter.`
`Two pieces of stationary came out.`
`The first page...had a magic circle drawn on it with something like blood.`
`If I asked Maria, she'd probably know what it meant.`
`And there was writing on the other page.`
`'Have you made progress in solving the epitaph?`
`In just a short while, your time will be up in a flash.`
`The ninth twilight will begin quite soon.'`
`...There was no mistake.`
`...It was a letter...from Beatrice...`
`"...Uu-?`
` ...Battler, `
`...what is that?"`
`"Ah, ...aaah, `
`when we came here just now, `
`...i-it was sitting right here."`
`"What happened, Maria?`
` ......Huh?!`
` Battler-kun, that letter?!"`
`"W-Wait, err!`
` It was sitting right here.`
` Why?!`
` Even though we checked to make sure this room was locked!!`
` Why?!`
` Why?!!"`
`"...............`
`...Maria, come here."`
`Aunt Rosa closed her eyes just a little, and after thinking silently for a moment, told Maria to come.`
`Maria obeyed her mother's words.`
`As she did, something unbelievable happened.`
`Aunt Rosa pointed the barrel of that gun at me...`
`"Battler-kun, I've concluded that you are a wolf."`
`"Wh......Why?!?!"`
`"When I came into the room just now, I saw that there was nothing at all on the table.`
` ...And I know that Maria did not approach that table.`
` ...We're talking about a short stretch of time.`
` But the only one who claims to have approached the table and found the letter...is you."`
`"How can you...`
`...wait, th-that's all screwed up!!`
` Why would I put something like this here?!`
` Wait, wait, I just found something suspicious and reported it, right?!`
` Why are you suspecting me?!"`
`"Because only you could've set that letter there!!`
` That's right, this is all a charade!!`
` You pulled an envelope from your pocket, and then acted as though you'd just found it.`
` To create the illusion that the witch entered a closed room, set down a letter, and left!!"`
`"......Dumbass, `
`...a-are you thinking like that again...?`
` Are you going to suspect me...`
`...because of something like that?!`
` Cut it out!!`
` My dad and everyone else were killed!!`
` Why would I take part in the culprit's scheme?!!"`
`"True.`
` Even if you were offered a large sum of money, I don't want to believe in the existence of the sort of demon who could sell out their own parents."`
`"Then again, ...maybe such a demon does exist.`
` No, that's a bad way to say it.`
` ...What if you didn't view Rudolf nii-san and Kyrie-san as your parents?"`
`"...Wh-Whaaat?!?!`
` Think about what you're saying!!`
` Dad is Dad, right?!`
` Of course, I'm not related to Kyrie-san by blood, but she's like a big sister to me!!`
` No way in hell I'll let a comment like that slide, you bastard!!"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Stoooop iiit!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Stop saying uu-uu-!!`
` ...I'm sorry, that was a bad way to put it.`
` True, Ushiromiya Battler-kun may be Rudolf nii-san's child!"`
`"...But are you really that Battler-kun?!"`
`"What the hell are you talking about?!!`
` If I'm not Battler, who else do I look like?!"`
`"All of us, including Rudolf nii-san, are seeing you for the first time in six years.`
` No one can prove that you really are Ushiromiya Battler, right?!"`
`"Maybe you aren't Battler, but someone who's snuck in, making a skillful bid to steal the wealth of the Ushiromiya family!!`
` Can you clearly prove that you're Ushiromiya Battler?!`
` Right here, right now?!!!"`
`"Cut it out, dammit!!`
` I'm me!`
` Ushiromiya Battler!!`
` If we're gonna suspect even things like that, are you really Ushiromiya Rosa?!`
` I'm myself, no one else!!`
` Yeah, that's right, it's just as you say, you can't trust anyone but corpses and yourself!!!`
`If you're gonna go that far, let me make an objection!`
`George-aniki and the others were found dead, and Aunt Natsuhi's room was locked!`
` George-aniki had the key to that room, right?!`
` And by now, the only one with a master key is you, Aunt Rosa, right?!`
` Aren't you the only one who could've unlocked that room?!?!"`
`"My theory goes like this.`
` You're in contact with the real culprit,`
` and while I wasn't looking, you lent them one of the five master keys!!"`
`"I didn't do something like that!!`
` See, there are five of them here, right?!"`
`"As if that matters!!`
` You could've had them set it in a pre-arranged spot and collected it, right?!!`
` And weren't you the one who doubted whether there really were five master keys?!"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"So, how do you suggest that someone other than yourself placed that letter there?!!`
` ~ib~Until you find proof someone else did it~ib~, you're a wolf!!"`
`"Shut uuuuuup!!`
` Then why don't you show me some proof?`
` How do you claim the culprit killed George-aniki and the rest in that closed room?!`
` How did they lock it?!!"`
`"That's exactly right!`
` Natsuhi's room was exactly the same, just like usual`
`!`
` The door and windows were locked from the inside`
`.`
` There were no frauds or tricks, no means of secret passage nor places in which to hide`
`!`
` Natsuhi's own key was in George's pocket, and the inside of the room was sealed off`
`.`
` Only the five master keys were left, and 'Rosa' was holding all of them`
`!`
` And let me say this: the parlor's the same`
`.`
` The key to the parlor itself is sealed away in the servant room`
`.`
` So unlocking it without a master key is impossible! The definition of a closed room remains the same as always!`
`"`
`"Come on, now there's only one suspeeeeect, `
`or are you still playing innocent, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer?!"`
`'!s0`
` You shut up tooooooooooooooooooooo!!!"`
`"You're the one who should shut up! How do you claim the letter was placed here by anyone other than you?!`
` Unless you can prove such a thing happened, you're a wolf!!"`
`"If we can suspect me, then we can suspect you too, so try showing me some proof yourself, `
`and anyway, weren't you the first person to enter this room and start checking the windows, Aunt Rosa?!"`
`"Then, you guessed that I'd go back to where I'd been sitting and secretly put the letter there.`
` It's possible for us to suspect that this is a trap of yours, right?!"`
`"Why would I use a trap like that?!!`
` If I was a wolf, I'd shoot you with this gun without question!!"`
`"That proves nothing!!`
` Maybe you chose the roundabout way of setting a clever trap because you couldn't commit murder in front of Maria!!"`
`"All the master keys are in your hands!`
` So what happened, both here and in the last room, was all your doing, right?!!`
` If you think you can talk your way out of this, then let's hear your excuses!!"`
`"That's right, you've been suspicious from the start, Aunt Rosa!`
` Why is it that even though six adults in the family conference were killed, you were the only exception?`
` Why were you the only one not in that chapel?!"`
`"There can only be one reason. You invited Dad and the rest there and killed them!!`
` Damn it, damn it, `
`that explains everything, doesn't it, don't fuck with me don't fuck with me, `
`stop saying things that don't make seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeense!!"`
`"Uuuuu----!!`
` Stoooooop iiiiiiiiit!!`
` You mustn't fiiiight!!`
` Mama too, Battler too, stop iiiiiiiiiiit, stop iiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!`
` It's no one's fault!`
` It's not Battler's or Mama's fault!!`
` The witch did all of this!`
` It was done with magic!!`
` It's no one's faaaaaaaaaault!!`
` Uu-uuuu---!!"`
`Maria thrust herself in between Aunt Rosa and me as the blood started rising to our heads.`
`I was taken aback by Maria's crying voice and returned to my senses.`
`...I had acted shamefully just now.`
`My eyes filled with tears.`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, but_2e1179:`
`...the witch's fault, isn't it...?!!`
` All this about keys and tricks and alibis...`
`all of it, all of it was stupid!!`
` Even though it's the work of the witch, we weren't even able to trust each other as humans...!!`
` Right, Aunt Rosa? From the beginning, there wasn't a Human culprit, it was all the work of the witch."`
`"So there's no way you're the culprit,`
` and there's no way Maria, Genji-san or I am either!!`
` Why has it come to this?!!`
` Why am I screaming at Aunt Rosa...who I loved?!`
` Why am I having this fight...`
`with the kind aunt I loved so much?!"`
`"Why, why does everyone have to suspect each other?!?!`
` I'm not gonna suspect my aunt, I'm not gonna suspect anyone,`
` it's all the work of the witch, it's all the work of Beatrice, `
`it's all...all a crime that Beatrice committed with magic!!"`
`"Beatriiiiiiiice, please, show yourself here, `
`and confess to us that you did everything, `
`I'm sorry already, I'm sorry we've been suspecting each other like this!!"`
`"So forgive us, `
`release us, `
`release us from this hell of suspecting each other until we see each other die!!`
` Give me my kind relatives and cousins back!!`
` I hate it, I hate it, I hate it all!!`
` You definitely exist, it's your victory!!"`
`"Show yourself, ooooooooooooooooooohhh, Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice!`
` Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiceeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`"......Am I......still...alive?"`
`Apparently, some time ago, Kinzo had fallen into a doze.`
`He searched for his spectacles and looked at the clock.`
`...It was 10:00 P.M.`
`"...That person's ceremony...let's see, how far has it progressed?`
` ......It must have come quite far by this time."`
`Kinzo lifted his heavy body from the chair...and approached the portrait of the witch that he had gazed at every day.`
`"......Beatrice,`
` very soon, ...I will have a chance to be reunited with your smile.`
` ......I care not if I die!`
` If I can just see your smile one more time, I will not regret this life!`
` So, `
`...for heaven's sake, let me...`
`meet with you one more tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiime...`
` Then, let me swear my love to you, let me apologize for my crimes, uuuoooooooooooohh...`
`'!s0`
` You are mine!!`
` From your hair to your toenails, to the dirt under your toenails, you are mine!!`
` Every fragment of your flesh is mine, even the broth of your corpse is mine!!`
` I won't let you escape, this time you won't slip from my hands!!`
` I'll make you mine for all eternity!!!`
` I will never let you escape a second time,`
` I will never let you escape a second time!!"`
`Kinzo howled in rage, then suddenly fell to his knees...as he shook and scraped at the wall...`
`...In an instant, he had started sobbing.`
`'!s1`
` That's wrong, `
`I didn't want to say something like thiiiiis, Beatriiiiiiiiice...`
` Please, `
`...let me see you one more time...`
` Even if you only let me apologize...`
` Aaaaaaahh, Beatriiiiiiiiiice, `
`...hic, ...hic...! Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggghhh...!!"`
`"You are beloved, yearned for...! I was mistaken...!`
` If you would just smile, I wouldn't need anything else...`
` I made a mistake, I made a mistake back then, `
`...I did something that cannot be taken back...!"`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kin_2e204:`
`......I offered...`
`everything......`
` ...Please, even if it must happen as I die...`
`......At least...`
`...let me...`
`apologize...`
`just once,`
` Beatriiiiiiiiice...`
` Aaaaagghh, hic, aaaaaaaah, aaaaaaaagggghghhh!"`
`...As Kinzo shook and cried, a butterfly appeared out of nowhere behind his small back like a flake of gold leaf...and softly descended...`
`...You fool, Kinzo.`
`Did you think any woman out there would fall for a man's tears......?`
`Well, ...even if it wouldn't make a Human woman fall for you, ...it might do the trick for a woman who is not Human.`
`Kinzo,`
` do you remember...?`
`That game of chess you played with me, which is still ongoing...?`
`Kinzo, as though he had suddenly remembered something, approached the chess set.`
`It was as it had been during the game he'd played with Nanjo until yesterday.`
`...After knocking all the pieces off the chessboard, he began to line them up again one by one.`
`...It was a setup for an ongoing game.`
`"......That's right. Like this.`
` ......I advanced my queen.`
` ...That was quite a spectacular move.`
` Perhaps it was a little too intense for you.`
` ......I worried whether you'd abandon your piece or not, `
`...worried for so long......"`
`Kinzo waited, with the opposite seat empty.`
`...Surely, very soon, his opponent would appear there, `
`...and he would be able to restart this game again...`
`...You fool, Kinzo.`
`You want to apologize?`
` You want to see my face again?`
` You want to make my smile an eternal thing?`
`Why can't you say a much, much simpler word?`
`Even though that is the sole element of this world......?`
`At that time, Kinzo muttered.`
`...Was it a prayer?`
` An entreaty?`
` ......It was probably best to just call it muttering.`
`"...I......love you, `
`...Beatrice......"`
`They were pure words, like something an innocent child would say, without any evil intent...`
`...You really are a fool, Kinzo.`
`If you ever have the chance to do your life over again...`
`Know that those words will never cause a woman to fall for you.`
`That's right, ...not unless a miracle happens.`
`That's what makes this......`
`At that moment,`
` ......Kinzo definitely heard a small knock, one with a tempo that differed from those of the servants......`
`"......Who is it?"`
`The woman beyond the door...didn't answer.`
`"...I'm asking who you are!!`
` Will you not answer?!!"`
`The woman beyond the door...`
`...didn't answer.`
`'!s1`
`...oooooh, `
`...could it be...`
` ...B-`
`Beatrice?`
`......Beatrice, `
`......Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice!!"`
`The woman beyond the door...answered.`
`On the ninth twilight, the witch shall revive, and none shall be left alive.`
`Battler's figure was in the dining hall.`
`He didn't feel like going back to the guesthouse in the middle of all this rain...`
`and wandered halfheartedly around the mansion in search for any place where he could sit, ...before setting up camp in the dining hall.`
`He didn't even lock the door.`
`He thought the shapeless murderer, or maybe the Golden Witch, might come to kill him now that he was isolated, `
`but he no longer had any desire to resist.`
`He didn't even feel like using a locked door to hold off the culprit.`
`He wanted that person to come at him openly, from the front.`
`...If it was the killer, he wanted to ask them about some of those wonderful closed room tricks as a parting gift.`
`If it was the witch, he hoped she'd at least take his life with some spectacular magic.`
`...However, ironically, neither of these two came to meet him...`
`Battler opened the liquor cabinet on his own and enjoyed the liquor to his heart's content.`
`No longer was there anyone to scold him for drinking alcohol.`
`He boldly rested his legs on the extravagant tablecloth and savored the high-quality liquor, which probably had a mind-boggling price, drinking it down straight from the bottle...`
`Then, ...someone knocked.`
`Battler realized that someone had finally come to greet him...`
`"Hey, it's not locked.`
` Whoever you are, please come in.`
` And go ahead and introduce yourself.`
` If you're human, please gimme your name.`
` If you're Beatrice, please tell me your bust size."`
`"I may not look it, but I'm well known as a breast-sommelier, you see?`
` ...Hic."`
`"......It is Genji, Battler-sama."`
`"...Genji-san, huh?`
` ...Sorry, but I've got no interest in your bust size.`
` Please, come in. It's unlocked."`
`"......Excuse me."`
`Genji-san opened the door and bowed.`
`......So, is Genji-san the criminal after all, ...or maybe an accomplice?`
`...That theory would probably explain most of the tricks...`
`"Did you come to give me my last rites?"`
`"......Nothing of the sort.`
` ...I apologize if I am disturbing you."`
`"...Hey, hey, saying I'm sorry without even telling me what you want is actually pretty creepy.`
` ...What do you want?`
` ...Are you gonna tell me that drinking alcohol is forbidden for minors?`
` I'll just die anyway.`
` ...Please, let me do what I want, now that it's all about to end."`
`"......Battler-sama, do you love alcohol so much...`
`that you would spend the little time you have left drinking?"`
`Those words...pierced me...`
`...That wasn't true.`
`"...............`
`I just...can't cope if I don't drink.`
` ...I can't even taste the alcohol at all..."`
`"...You are just like the Master.`
` Indeed, you inherited the Master's blood strongly..."`
`"You mean Grandfather, the heavy drinker, was drinking to drown his sorrows the whole time...?`
` First I've heard of it."`
`'!s1`
`the Master's life...`
`was reduced to one of atonement alone."`
`"...What is it you know?"`
`"......Beatrice's ceremony was completed when the eighth twilight ended.`
` ...I believe I can tell you everything now."`
`"...Wh-What did you say...?"`
`My drunkenness was completely blown away.`
`I lowered my feet from the table and listened carefully to hear what Genji would say next...`
`"Battler-sama, `
`...I shall guide you to the Master's study.`
` ...It would probably be best to hear it directly from both the Master and..."`
`"From both Grandfather...and...?`
` H-Hey, what in the world do you mean by that...?!!"`
`"...Come, this way.`
` I shall guide you,`
` Battler-sama."`
`After Genji-san told me to follow him, he started to walk down the corridor.`
`I threw my drunkenness off completely and went after him...`
`We climbed a big staircase......towards the third floor.`
`Genji-san stopped walking halfway.`
`He then turned back and spoke.`
`"......Battler-sama, `
`...from here on, `
`......you will probably see things you will not be able to understand."`
`"Don't think that'll scare me.`
` ......I've already seen enough incomprehensible things today to make me sick."`
`"......Please, accept what you see as you see it...`
`and accept what you hear as you hear it."`
`"Why?`
` What?`
` ...There is no need for questions like that.`
` ...You will learn the truth, and that is all.`
` I will leave it completely up to you, Battler-sama,`
` whether to accept it, believe it, or deny it."`
`".................."`
`Genji-san checked one last time to see whether I was prepared to know the truth.`
`The eighth twilight had already ended.`
`And on the ninth twilight, the witch would revive, ...and nobody would be left alive.`
`It meant that Beatrice had already been revived.`
`...And, it probably also meant that none of us would be allowed to return alive.`
`If I was going lose my life anyway, ...I wanted to know the truth in the end.`
`...It didn't matter how hard it might be to accept.`
`".........Yeah.`
` ...Even if a demon or a witch shows up, ...I'm prepared."`
`"......Indeed, you are just like the Master in his youth.`
` ...Battler-sama, please be diligent in your studies.`
` In the future, you will surely have great aspirations.`
` And when that time comes, see to it that you are never forced to regret a lack of study and training."`
`"......I'd be happy to, assuming I ever get a chance to work hard in my studies."`
`"..............."`
`Genji-san's silence felt like it was further confirming a certain resigned feeling I had...`
`And then, ......the door to Grandfather's study, surrounded by a sweet smell, came into sight.`
`Genji-san took a gold key with an elegant design out from his pocket.`
`The master keys had been confiscated by Aunt Rosa, but he'd kept the key to this study alone on his person.`
`He put it in the keyhole, ......and it made a heavy clunking sound.`
`"......Master, `
`it is I, Genji.`
` I have brought Battler-sama with me."`
`There was no reply, but it seemed that permission to go inside had been given...`
`"Come, Battler-sama.`
` ...Please, go in."`
`".........Okay.`
` ...I'll go in."`
`I readied myself...and threw the door open...`
`At that moment, ...I got slightly disoriented by the dazzling golden glow......`
`It was......unbelievably...`
`...a swarm of butterflies that shone gold.`
`The gold butterflies that completely filled the inside of the study poured out all at once...`
`" Wha-......`
` ...What is...`
`...this......?"`
`It was almost like golden leaf confetti.`
`The interior of Grandfather's study was filled with a golden glow...`
`And, ...on a sofa like a reception chair in front of the study desk, `
`......I could see Grandfather's back.`
`There was someone on the side opposite from Grandfather.`
`...It was in shadow, so I couldn't see it well...`
`"...Master, `
`I've brought Battler-sama."`
`"......Battler, is it?`
` I'm busy thinking now...`
` Be silent for a while..."`
`Kinzo declared that unhappily, his back still turned.`
`It seemed he was enjoying a chess game with a visitor...`
`Apparently, the opponent had counterattacked with a superb move.`
`Kinzo seemed to be enjoying himself as he thought deeply, while occasionally laughing and groaning...`
`"I have thought for 30 years.`
` ...I have thought for 30 years about how to counter this move...`
` Have fun, have fun with the move I have fermented for 30 years."`
`"...Heheheheheheheh.`
` Indeed, this is a deeply matured move.`
` ...What fun, what fun, ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hahahahahahaha...!!`
` I see I'm no match for you."`
`"...Wh...`
`...What is...`
`...this......?!"`
`"So you came, Battler.`
` I've been waiting for a while.`
` Be silent for Kinzo's sake.`
` ...Isn't it too early to resign, Kinzo?`
` I could've countered that move in several ways already.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`'!s0`
`my first meeting with that witch.`
`However, ...I knew this witch.`
`Even though it was our first meeting, `
`.........I knew her......`
`from the portrait...!`
`"Genji, `
`serve some alcohol for Battler.`
` What would be an appropriate liquor for this man...?"`
`"...That which the Master has loved since the days of his youth."`
`"Good, good, serve it.`
` ...You did well coming here, Ushiromiya Battler.`
` First, sit down.`
` ......You called my name many times, did you not?`
` In deference to that, I allowed you to meet me.`
` ...So, what will you ask me?`
` What will you inquire?`
` ...The door of the Golden Land will soon be opened.`
` Soon, we will have a banquet to celebrate my revival, at which I will be welcoming in the witches.`
` ...In the meantime, I'll answer your questions, as many as you like."`
`"...I-I've got a bunch of things I wanna ask!!`
` What happened on this island?!`
` And why did incidents like these occur?!`
` I want to ask about the closed rooms too!!`
` What about the chapel?!`
` What about Jessica's room?!`
` And the servant room?!`
` And Aunt Natsuhi's room?!`
` And the parlor?!"`
`"There's so much more I wanna ask!!`
` About the witch's true nature!!`
` Is Beatrice really a witch?!!`
` What's your goal, what do you want to make us do and why did you call me here?!!`
` Answer me, about everything!!!"`
`"Aaaaahh, be quiet!!`
` You think you'll get answers if you ask?!?!"`
`"Don't say that, Kinzo.`
` A fragile and fleeting spider web did offer protection from King Herod once.`
` ...Just like there are no useless things in this world, there are also no useless questions."`
`"Veeery well, I'll answer all your questions.`
` ...But, only on one condition."`
`"What is it?"`
`"If you hear everything and are able to accept my existence,`
` ......then you will kneel and kiss my shoes.`
` I called you here because I wanted to make you surrender to me."`
`"...Kinzo and I made a bet.`
` We bet on which would come first, Kinzo thinking of a new move, or me making you surrender.`
` I don't think I'll lose.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"...D-Damn you, talking so tough!!`
` Yeah, all right.`
` Try and convince me.`
` ...Try and convince me that you're a witch who can use weird, awesome, powerful magic!!"`
`"If I surrender, I'll kiss you or do anything else!!!"`
`The witch cackled gloatingly.`
`Then, she glared at him unpleasantly with eyes that said a man can't go back on his word...`
`"Well said!!`
` So, from what question shall I begin?!`
` I'll answer everything!!`
` Come, what will the first one be?!?!"`
`"Where are you, Beatrice?!!`
` Show yourself!!`
` Beatriiiiiice!!"`
`Rosa finally arrived at the chapel.`
`She pointed her gun around her, screaming the witch's name, but there was no way she would receive an answer.`
`After grimacing slightly, she noisily approached the table where her siblings' corpses still lay exposed...and stretched out her arm towards a gold ingot.`
`It was very heavy, but Rosa didn't mind.`
` She wrapped that one up in a blanket and threw it over her shoulder.`
`"At least...just this one...`
` This alone should be worth over 10 million..."`
`Without letting go of her gun, Rosa picked up the gold as well.`
`...Her shoulders were screaming. but Rosa didn't mind.`
`"...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` It will happen very soon.`
` ...Very soon, the door to the Golden Land...will open."`
`"Stop laughing with that creepy voice!!`
` Where is Beatrice?!`
` Yeah, I know, she's around here somewhere, right?!`
` You know where, right?!`
` Where is she?!"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` I don't know.`
` Even if you don't search for her, you'll be able to see her in the Golden Land.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi, ouch."`
`"Stop laughing like that!!`
` ...Aaah, it almost makes me want to laugh!!`
` That's right, that was definitely a witch, definitely a witch!!`
` I didn't understand, I thought she was a human calling herself a witch, but I was wrong!!!"`
`"...That really was a witch!!`
` I won't be fooled by something like that!!`
` You're there, right?!`
` Come out, show yourself!!`
` Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice!!!"`
`"I told you, she'll appear very soon.`
` The door to the Golden Land will be opened.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`"......That's right.`
` Isn't that splendid!`
` I care not, I abandon that rook!`
` You, woman, are a king that cannot be reached without the resolve to lose everything one has.`
` I'll corner you, Beatriiiiice.`
` Hihahahahahahahahahaha!"`
`"At least call me a queen.`
` Hoh, what a brilliant move.`
` So your blood...no, the Ushiromiya blood is bad at giving up."`
`"...How pleasant!`
` What an truly elegant night.`
` Hehahahahahahaha...!!"`
`"......Master, Beatrice-sama.`
` It will soon be time for the banquet."`
`"Already?`
` ...That was fast.`
` Every night I pass with you goes by swiftly,`
` the moon falls like an apple, and the sun leaps out of the river like a small fish."`
`"It is time, so let us go.`
` ...Rise, Battler.`
` The banquet to celebrate my revival will now begin."`
`"I'll introduce you as my new furniture...no, as my toy.`
` To the dignitaries among witches."`
`The witch was relaxing elegantly, her feet thrown out from the sofa and resting on top of a footrest.`
`...However, the footrest wasn't a part of the sofa, ...but a Human.`
` A Human down on all fours...`
`"...Beatrice-sama, your silk dress."`
`"You are the guest of honor, but I am the host.`
` I will go out first.`
` It would have been nice if Shannon were here to help dress you, but, unfortunately, it seems she no longer remains."`
`"...She's never around when I want to use her.`
` An entirely useless person.`
` ......However, you did well to remain here.`
` ...I'm happy, my friend."`
`"...I am grateful for your words."`
`"Good.`
` Wait downstairs, you two.`
` Genji, good work, set the dress down over there."`
`"...Certainly.`
` ......Well then, Master."`
`"We will go first.`
` ...Beatrice, I will see you later."`
`"Indeed."`
`Kinzo and Genji left the study.`
`After that, the witch and the dress and the furniture remained.`
`"......Do you know why I am not embarrassed to show myself to you naked...?"`
`"............"`
`"It's because you're furniture.`
` Fuuurniture.`
` Understand?`
` Furniture, just fuuurniture!`
` Who would feel shame at exposing their body to furniture?`
` So there's no reason for me to feel shame in front of you.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch rose and her jacket slipped off, just from her shoulders.`
`...After that, the jacket fell to the ground with a thump.`
`When the furniture respectfully approached to pick up those clothes, the witch gave it a small kick, and it fell over.`
`...The furniture was afraid of what misconduct it might have shown...`
`"Do you, as furniture, plan to force me to unbutton myself?`
` ...Stand.`
` And undo the buttons.`
` ...One by one, with care.`
` Quickly.`
` Gracefully.`
` With no mistakes.`
` The guests are being kept waiting, so change my clothes quickly."`
`".........Yes..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, kakakaka, hahahahahahaha!!`
` Undo them with care.`
` Those buttons are each worth more than one of your eyeballs.`
` ...If you make a mistake and break them, I'll sow your eyeballs in instead...`
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`The entrance hall was bustling with a crowd of shadowy people.`
`And it sparkled gold with the gold butterflies flying about.`
`The gentlemen in suits and tuxedos and the ladies in dresses looked like they were having a great number of friendly chats.`
` At a glance, it might have looked like a fabulous medieval ball.`
`But they all had one thing in common, and that thing was exceedingly bizarre.`
`...Because all of them...had goat heads.`
`Was it a goat mask masquerade, `
`......or did they really have goat heads?`
`...It probably couldn't be the latter, but in this bizarre world, I really didn't know which was true...`
`Kinzo was amongst those goat nobles, greeting them.`
`Kinzo's greetings were more respectful than would have been expected, as though these were all honored guests.`
`At that time, Genji's voice rang out through the hall.`
`It was a voice calling for silence.`
`That voice stopped the idle chatter, and everyone turned to face Genji.`
`"......Tonight, we celebrate the appearance of our Golden Witch, who has achieved her revival, `
`the Lady Beatrice.`
` Everyone, please welcome her with your applause."`
`When Genji began to applaud, it quickly spread through the guests and became a roaring ovation.`
`Then, ......the Golden Witch appeared from the top of the large staircase...`
`As she gracefully waved her hand, ...followed by a piece of furniture she was fond of, she slowly descended the staircase...`
`The goat nobles offered unanimous words of celebration in some long-forgotten language.`
`And those who were deeply intimate embraced, filled with joy at their reunion.`
`As the witch offered greetings of reunion, ...the witch's furniture followed behind her the whole time.`
`......There was a chain around its neck.`
`The other end was gripped in the witch's hand, like it was a trained dog.`
`It wasn't there to restrain him.`
`...Those chains were a restraining device whose only purpose was to wound the furniture's dignity...`
`He wasn't permitted to wear anything else on his body.`
`One of the young women goats mixed in with the goat nobles...`
`quietly removed her goat mask as the furniture passed in front of her, and she spoke with eyes that had no light in them.`
`That face...seemed to belong to a long-haired young girl...`
`"......How pitiful."`
`"Ooh, Lady Bernkastel.`
` Welcome.`
` Do you like my furniture?"`
`"......That's a nice hobby."`
`After saying only that, the witch called Bernkastel once again put on her goat mask...`
`and was swallowed up by the shadows of the other tall goats...`
`"Ahahahahahahaha...`
` Sore loser.`
` She's ticked off, isn't she?"`
`"You're not wrong.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The young women goats giggled, and the witch once again let out a high-pitched laugh.`
`"Thank you for gathering here for my sake!!`
` Why don't we enjoy to the fullest this 'banquet of the witch', where old friends have gathered from past and present, east and west...!"`
`"Come, we will eat all night, `
`drink all night, `
`slurp all night, `
`and chew to bits all night as we enjoy ourselves!!`
` Look at the clock as it marks when the ending hour and the beginning hour melt together, ...come!!`
` Let us begin the banquet of the witch!!!"`
`When the witch announced the beginning of the banquet, the large clock pointed to 24:00, and the sound of a bell began to ring out...`
`"Come, ...now is the time!!`
` Open the golden door......!!!"`
`All at once, the butterflies leafed in gold flew all around the inside of the room.`
`Amidst the golden storm and the brilliant gold-colored light, the barrier between this world and another...was cut open...`
`Surrounded by the goats' delighted voices, the mansion of the human world and the mansion of those not human overlapped, `
`...and the members of the household who praised the resurrection of the Golden Witch scattered into gold butterflies...`
`and poured out of the depths of hell...`
`It was...a golden...tornado.`
`...A rondo of golden demons.`
`Come, tonight we will put aside rank.`
`'!s0`
`drop the snake's head into the liquor pot, `
`throw cows and chickens into the furnace alive, `
`drink and eat and sing and dance, `
`sneer and kill and desecrate and degrade!!`
`"Aaaaaahh, Beatrice!!`
` Take me to the Golden Land now!`
` To the Golden Laaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!!`
` Ooooooohhhhhhhhh, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!"`
`The goat nobles were suddenly crushing in around Kinzo.`
`...Almost like they were kids demanding the signature of some famous movie star.`
`There were only two differences.`
`First, these were witches, not kids.`
`And second, what these witches demanded was not a signature.`
`The sea of goat nobles began to drown Kinzo.`
`Only Kinzo's laughing voice echoed throughout the area.`
`It was a grand mixture of laughter and his death throes.`
`And Kinzo became wine and meat and bread.`
`An aroma if slurped, a rich taste if gnawed, and pleasant to tear to bits!`
`The sound of his death throes lingered on sweetly, `
`and if adorned with melted chocolate and golden argent, it would make a wonderful dessert!`
`If you took the bones home, you could also use them in a soup, `
`and the remains could even become toys for the children to play with, `
`and they could also become splendid tools for fortune-telling that always brought misfortune!`
`That entire scene...was watched by the furniture.`
`It was all fantastical.`
` ...It was all demonic.`
`...Was the quaking of its supposedly paralyzed heart...proof that it could still feel fear?`
`At that time, its knees buckled, and the furniture's body fell down in the middle of the carpet.`
`After all, the witch had kicked those knees from behind.`
`"Kneel and show your respect.`
` Rub your forehead against the carpet and show how vulgar you are.`
` Put your hands behind your back and swear that you will offer all your flesh and blood to me."`
`".........Nngg, ......ah......"`
`The furniture let out a painful voice.`
`...Fear is the most basic emotion Humans have.`
`...Was that emotion reviving his sense of self, which should already have been slain?`
`"......Hmph.`
` So, you are still far from suitable for my furniture.`
` Very well!`
` I will carefully finish you, making you into the kind of furniture I like, the kind fitting only for me.`
` ...As you are now, I doubt you can offer more than entertainment for our guests!"`
`The goat nobles were surrounding the crouching furniture...`
`It seemed their blazing, blood-red eyes couldn't hide their ecstasy at this new young food they'd been given.`
`And from the ugly teeth that stuck out of countless mouths, saliva, `
`...or maybe the traces of meat and wine that they had just eaten, ...dribbled down...`
`"......Eee......eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!!"`
`As the furniture let out a wild scream, it retreated, still sitting on its backside.`
`...But the circle of goat nobles was closing in...`
`Then, the furniture looked at the witch's face.`
`...It had surrendered to the witch, so, believing that the witch would show some compassion, it stared at her face in the end.`
`But there was nothing but scorn on the witch's face, and she wasn't even facing the furniture anymore.`
`The witch went off to greet an honored guest with whom she had crossed gazes...`
`The goat nobles looked down upon the furniture.`
`Actually, they had been waiting.`
`Just like how one must remove the cork in order to drink champagne, `
`they had to wait for one thing before partaking of the offering served at this banquet.`
`Of course, the furniture didn't know about this thing.`
`...But it came out of his mouth all by itself.`
`Just like the unavoidable pop of a cork, it inevitably came out of his mouth.`
`'!s1`
`...yaa, `
`...ahiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!"`
`--It was a scream.`
`It was a sign that marked the beginning...of the modest banquet at which he was to be served.`
`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`
`gebukikyakyakaku`
`oooogaageoe`
`ooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`
`aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`
`aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah...!!!"`
`Gabubogyagukigukiboryu.`
`By now, the garden was one of both roses and gold.`
`A gold-colored garden where gold butterflies, gold fairies, and gold lizards rampaged and flew about wildly.`
`"Maria, quickly!!`
` Run!!`
` Quickly quickly quickly quickly!!"`
`Rosa grasped her gun and the blanket wrapped around the ingot...`
`and ran at a speed Maria couldn't match, sometimes pausing to call out at Maria to run faster.`
`So she saw it every time.`
`...She saw the golden pursuers chasing them from the mansion!`
`The mass of gold butterflies was chasing after them like a massive crawling hand!!`
`And strange-looking shadows with goat heads were chasing after them...!!`
`There was no need for her to strain her eyes.`
`Because those blazing pupils told her what would happen if she was captured.`
`'!s1`
`Mama, wait, `
`...uu-uu-, `
`...ow!!"`
`Maria fell down.`
`For just an instant, Rosa was ashamed by thoughts of abandoning her daughter and running away, and at the instant her feet touched ground, she ran back.`
`The goat head that had sprinted over to get the first bite...`
`grabbed hold of the back of Rosa's own child's hair and pulled...!!`
`'!s0`
`noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!"`
`Rosa rammed into the goat head with her shoulder, `
`spun, `
`bashed the back of her elbow into the goat's jaw, `
`and buried her knee into its protruding chest!!`
`And she thrust the barrel of the gun inside the goat head's mouth as it doubled over from the pain in its gut!`
`"...Just try laying one finger on Maria in front of me.`
` I'll show you just how lukewarm the hell you came from is."`
`The blast from the Winchester's 45 caliber Long Colt bullet exploded inside the goat head's throat...`
`and its medulla oblongata was instantly pulverized.`
`The goat head hadn't understood.`
`It had thought women were like pre-opened wine bottles!`
` It had thought that turning them upside down would immediately make their deep-red contents come out!`
`"Mama!!`
` Mamaaaaaa!!"`
`Maria, who had been released, hugged Rosa.`
`But the pursuers were still coming!`
` They could see the giant goat heads, who had given up pretending to be Human, running towards them from across the rose bushes.`
`Rosa spilled several extra bullets, which had been in the pocket of her coat, all over the place, and told Maria to pick them up.`
`"Y-Yes...!`
` Pick up, pick up...!!"`
`"Maria,`
` if Mama falls down, `
`run.`
` Go to the shore.`
` And swim, and swim, and swim!`
` There's nowhere for us to survive on this island!!"`
`"N-No!!`
` I'll stay with Mama!!`
` Uuu--!!"`
`Rosa's gun roared four times.`
`But even though four shots really did hit the massive, approaching goats in the chest, they didn't even flinch!!`
`The goats ran with a violent vigor, as though they planned to crush Rosa and Maria with those massive bodies!!`
`"Put the bullet in!!`
` Quickly!!"`
`"U-Uu-!!"`
`Rosa grasped the blanket with the ingot in both hands, `
`and she herself sprinted, pulling it along!!`
` Without even an ounce of fear of those strange-looking giants!!`
`If it's to protect my daughter, I'll overcome even hell!!`
`"I'll show you...`
`this golden dreeeeeeeeeeam!!!"`
`Rosa roared.`
` The goat heads roared.`
`That terribly heavy ingot, after picking up a fearsome centrifugal force and speed, slammed into the head of the goat head.`
`Rosa pulled a fountain pen from her pocket.`
`But she held it crooked.`
`She placed it in her palm, `
`in the gap between her middle finger and her ring finger so that it stuck out when she made a fist, almost like a stinger was growing out of it.`
`That stinger sliced into the left eye of the goat head as it fell over.`
` Was the goat head's roar a scream?`
`But Rosa's roar was different.`
`She pulled back her fist and slammed it into the fountain pen that was still sticking into the goat head's eye.`
`The pointed tip was gouged into the depths of its head...!`
`"Mama, the bullet went in!!"`
`"Good job!!"`
`'!s0`
`However, at the same time, I saw the goat head pursuers on the other side of the rose bushes increase in number.`
`I've gained enough distance for now!`
`I held onto the blanket wrapped around the ingot and the gun...and once again ran with Maria.`
`...Why am I running with a gun in my right hand and the gold in my left?`
`Why don't I let go with one hand and grasp Maria's hand...?!!`
`I can't let go of the gun that protects my body.`
`I can't let go of the gold that protects my future.`
`But even so, I've let go of the hand of my daughter, the one who is my future...?!`
`Run.`
` Run. Run.`
`She got out of the rose garden and began to run down a staircase through a grove of trees.`
`But Rosa knew.`
` This path through the grove turned and twisted many times, and only seemed to be long.`
` She tore straight through it!`
`She had played here often since her childhood years.`
`So she knew!`
`To the beach. To the beach.`
` To the sea, to the sea, to the sea.`
`And after reaching the sea?`
`Nothing to do but swim, swim, swim, and if Maria can't swim, I'll carry her as I swim!!`
`There's nothing but death on this island!`
`"Kya!!!"`
`"Mamaaaa?!"`
`As she raced down the stairs, she took a bad step.`
`A violent pain ran up her left ankle, and her mind went completely blank.`
`Rosa fell down several stairs, shocked by her ankle, which was bent at an odd angle.`
`...And the blanket with the ingot wasn't there.`
`She had let go of it the instant she fell, and it had disappeared somewhere into the darkness.`
`Only the gun was left.`
`Tremors in the earth were getting closer.`
`It was only a matter of time before the goat heads flooded in.`
`She didn't want to imagine how many there would be, or how strange they would look.`
`The lightly dancing gold pursuers arrived.`
`The gold butterflies surrounded Rosa and Maria, waving and clamoring as though saying 'the prize is here, the prize is here'.`
`Rosa couldn't even try to get up.`
`The violent pain from her broken ankle was so great that she couldn't ignore it, even in her last moments.`
`Aaaaaaaaaaaaah, what am I doing...`
`I had the gold, which would've been worth several million yen.`
`I might've been able to start over with that!!`
` And yet I fell, lost it, and now my own life is in danger, and Maria's too?!`
`...What has my life been?!!!`
`I was born into an incomprehensible family!`
`With irritating older siblings since the day I was born!!`
`What did I do?!`
`No matter what I did or didn't do, I was always in trouble and bullied and made fun of!!`
`What has my life been?!?!`
`"Mama, ...Mama, Mama...!!"`
`"........."`
`The roar inside Rosa's heart shriveled away and disappeared.`
`...It disappeared when she heard Maria's crying voice, as she sobbed and clung to Rosa.`
`"......Maria, `
`Mama remembered something she's got to do.`
` Please go on ahead."`
`"No, no no no no!!`
` I wanna stay with Mama!!`
` I don't want Mama to die!!"`
`'!s1`
`...even though I'm such a bad Mama, `
`...you still say you want to stay with me?"`
`"Yeah...!`
` ...I wanna stay with you, `
`...wanna stay with Mama...!"`
`'!s1`
`...but I was always putting you off.`
` I went to your athletic meet, `
`I went to Parent's Day, `
`...but I was always thinking about how I appeared to the world, and you were never in my eyes.`
` ...Are you saying...that you want to stay with that kind of mother...?`
` Even though, `
`...I've been such a bad mother......?!!"`
`"Hey, Mama.`
` ...Did you know?`
` You're my only Mama in this world.`
` There's no good Mama or bad Mama.`
` ...There's just one Mama.`
` So I don't need any other Mama in this world.`
` And I wanna be your one and only Maria."`
`"......The Maria you wanna spoil when you're in a good mood...and the Maria who's a nuisance and you don't want to be around...aren't different people.`
` There's only one Maria.`
` ...So the scary Mama and the nice Mama are the same.`
`'!s1`
`...they're my one and only...`
`Mama..."`
`'!s1`
`...such...`
`...an idiot...`
` ......I didn't need gold.`
` If only I had just pulled you by the hand...`
` ...I was such...`
`...a stupid Mama...!!"`
`The shadows of the goats covered the sky even more thoroughly than the trees of the forest.`
`Their roars blotted out the world with fear.`
`Rosa, still hugging Maria, readied her gun with one hand.`
`"Maria, let's go together.`
` I'll never leave you.`
` ...Let's always stay together so that Mama never gets lost again...!"`
`"Yeah...!!`
` We'll be able to see each other soon.`
` We'll be together forever...!!`
` ...We'll be able to see each other...in the Golden Land...!!`
` And then we'll play together!`
` Play with the 'Wolves and Sheep Puzzle'!!`
` Mama hasn't solved more than one of the puzzles, but I've solved them all.`
` So I'll be the riddle-giver!!"`
`She had bought it as a birthday present...and then hadn't played it with Maria after that first night.`
`"Yes, we'll play together!!!`
` I promise!!!"`
`"Mamaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`Those eyes, sparkling like red-hot lava, looked just like a group of fireflies.`
`They danced, closed in, and attacked.`
`"Aaaaaaaaaahhh, come ooooooon!!`
` Let whoever wants to eat the bullet Maria chambered for me step forwaaaaaaard,`
` aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!"`
`The vase was very beautiful, rich with history and value.`
`Even as young as I was, it still forced me to take a deep breath when I witnessed its beauty.`
`Of course, it was a member of Grandfather's favorite collection.`
`So that I didn't accidentally destroy its fragile beauty,`
` I was always given strict orders never to touch it.`
`...But that just made me want to touch it.`
`It looked light...and yet so elegant that just glancing at it gave it an indescribable sense of dignity.`
`...I wanted to see what it felt like to touch a vase like that.`
`However, ...just as Grandfather had said, it was a thing that shouldn't be touched.`
`Something this beautiful should never be touched.`
`Such beauty can only dwell in something so easily broken.`
`Because of that, just the brush of a finger by someone like me would...`
`Just like how a fun dream disappears with a 'poof' when you wake up, `
`...it disappeared, fell, and broke into pieces.`
`I realized that, because of my own foolish curiosity, I had done something that couldn't be taken back.`
`No matter how much I regretted it, no matter how much I apologized...`
`The broken vase would not be returned to its original form...`
`Grandfather will probably scold me.`
`Probably very harshly.`
`I ended up breaking into tears and sobbing, frightened...`
`'!s0`
`!d800`
`!d700`
`As mysteriously glowing golden dots shone in the air, the butterflies began to gather, one at a time.`
`Oh, it's Beatrice.`
`Beatrice, that reliable Golden Witch, had arrived.`
`The butterflies kept gathering until they formed a cloud, ...and then she was there...`
`She was always there for me.`
`Whenever I was in trouble, she'd always appear and save me.`
`"Good day to you, princess."`
`"Beatrice!`
` ...Waaaah, hic, hic...!"`
`"Oh, my...`
` Why are you crying so, and on a day so well-suited for a tea party...?"`
`"...I broke Grandfather's precious vase...`
` Waah, Grandfather's gonna get mad at me.`
` ...I don't know what to do...`
` Hic..."`
`"I see, that is worrying.`
` The Master really treasured this particular vase, didn't he?`
` ...Hohohoho, imagining how he'll punish you scares even me, Beatrice."`
`Grandfather was a very frightening person.`
`And when you failed to follow something he said even once, he would become so mad, with a rage that would make even the fallen angels in hell quiver.`
`Since I knew that down to my bones, I couldn't do anything but tremble and cry...`
`"I possess no magic that can scoop up your fallen tears, princess, `
`but if you need magic that will prevent the Master from scolding you, I might be able to manage something."`
`"R-Really...?"`
`"Yes, if you'll be gracious enough to believe in my power, princess.`
` The power of belief is the source of magic.`
` ...Miracles only appear before those of great faith."`
`"...I-I believe...`
` I believe in your power, Beatrice.`
` So please, fix this vase.`
` Please...!"`
`"If that is what you want, princess.`
` ...Then leave it to me, Beatrice."`
`When she extended her index finger, a golden butterfly softly landed there and changed its form into her favorite cane.`
`But even that was enough to give me a small glimpse at Beatrice's wonderful and awesome magic power.`
`She pointed her cane at the broken vase, and, just like a child's lullaby, she began speaking the magic words...`
`"Come, try closing your eyes.`
` And try to remember.`
` What form did you have?`
` It was surely a very, very beautiful form.`
` Please, show me that form one more time..."`
`Were they words, or was it a song?`
`No, it had to be magic.`
`After all, can't you see?`
` ...The pieces of the vase are rapidly gathering together,`
` gently returning to the place where they'd been on display, ...reassembling into their original form.`
`"...Incredible..."`
`"See?`
` Now it's back to normal.`
` This way, you won't have to get yelled at by the Master."`
`"Beatrice, you really are amazing.`
` You can fix broken vases like it's nothing."`
`"That's not true.`
` Returning something broken to its original form is a very, very difficult thing to do.`
` My magic can only make it remember what it once was for a short time."`
`"...?`
` But the vase really turned back to the way it was, right...?"`
`"Correct.`
` But that doesn't mean the vase has avoided its fate of being broken.`
` All I did was temporarily get the broken vase to remember its form before it broke.`
` I have not yet attained the high levels of magical power that might be used to restore a broken fate to its original form."`
`At that time, the high-pitched scream of a servant could be heard from inside the mansion.`
`When I went to see what had happened,`
` ...I noticed that several of the servants had gathered...and were cleaning up the remains of the broken vase.`
`From what they said, it seemed a black cat had sneaked in from somewhere and had climbed up on the vase, causing it to break.`
`I understood the meaning of Beatrice's words.`
`...At the moment I broke the vase, 'the vase was broken'.`
`Beatrice let me see the vase being restored, but that was a temporary thing.`
` It didn't mean she'd changed the fate of 'the vase being broken'.`
`And so, ...the vase remembered its true fate and 'broke'.`
`However, the one who broke it wasn't me, but a cat that had snuck in...`
`That's right.`
` Beatrice never said 'Let's fix the vase'.`
`She said she'd prevent the Master from scolding me.`
`The fate of the vase breaking hasn't changed, but the fact that I broke it certainly has...`
`Beatrice cleverly saved me from danger with that magic...`
`"It is very easy to break something.`
` After all, you didn't need magic to break that vase, princess."`
`"...Then, is fixing stuff really hard...?"`
`"It is.`
` It's so hard that you broke down crying, unsure of what to do."`
`"...Does that mean magic is easier to use when doing terrifying things?`
` That breaking...`
`...and killing is really easy, `
`...but fixing and reviving things is really hard...?"`
`"...That's right.`
` With magic, it is far easier to break and kill.`
` That's why weak witches lose to temptation and become intoxicated with gathering easy power for themselves, neglecting their true magical training.`
` ...Real magic is the power to repair, to revive.`
` To summon happiness that has disappeared, to summon love that has grown cold.`
` And, it can even summon a smile to the face of a princess who has forgotten how."`
`"Then...Beatrice, since you managed to fix that vase, does that mean you're an incredible witch?"`
`"My days of training are far from over.`
` After all, I couldn't make the vase forget its fate for even an hour.`
` I'm sure my teacher, who taught me magic, `
` would have been able to restore the vase to its original form forever."`
`"So, if it kept breaking and breaking, she'd be able to fix it over and over again...?"`
`"Yes.`
` When one reaches that level, they are considered to be an Endless Witch.`
` That is the endless level that all witches ought to reach.`
` We offer the utmost respect to those witches and call them by that title."`
`"An Endless Witch..."`
`"That's right.`
` ...To witches with the power to mend things endlessly, the concept of breaking doesn't even exist.`
` They are released from all the sadness caused by losing things and are promised eternal bliss."`
`Certainly, the human world is full of sadness caused by separation and loss.`
`To escape that sadness, people pray to gods and ask for the power to withstand their sadness, believing it to be a test...`
`In other words, a human's life is a journey, searching for a way to withstand sadness.`
`In that case, a witch who could revive all things would be freed from all sadness in the world.`
` ...Simply put, that would mean eternal bliss...`
`"I wonder...if I could become a witch like you...and gain eternal happiness."`
`"You, princess...?`
` Hohohoh. ...It is a long, long, difficult path, you see?"`
`"I want to become a witch.`
` ...I want to find happiness.`
` Beatrice, I want to become your disciple."`
`".........`
`Do you have even a trace of doubt in that feeling?"`
`"No.`
` I want to become a witch too."`
`"...I understand.`
` Then, until you get tired of me, I will make you my disciple.`
` ...Will you call me Teacher?"`
`"Yes, Teacher."`
`"That's a good answer.`
` Then from now on, learn the depths of magic along with me.`
` I am also in training.`
` Let us both learn the proper use of magic, doing our best to reach that blissful level."`
`"Yes, Teacher...!"`
`".........`
`...Ah, a dream.`
` ...That face takes me back..."`
`An Endless Witch, was it?`
`That rank I'd yearned for in the past as the highest possible achievement...was now just another one of my titles.`
`No, you might even call it my calling card.`
`"...Every once in a while, being called that can be quite satisfying.`
` I trained so many days to achieve that rank.`
` ...It'd be a bit of a waste if I never got a chance to appreciate it.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`She shook her head lightly.`
`If it's the highest possible level, that means there's nothing higher.`
`An eternal dead end, the beginning of eternal boredom.`
`"I remember what Teacher told me.`
` When one is released from all sadness, it is the same as eternal bliss.`
` ...That's what makes me think...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`that Teacher ~ib~couldn't ever have reached that level~ib~."`
`Eternal bliss means eternal boredom.`
`...And that's the beginning of eternal torture.`
`But it all depends on how you look at it.`
`Eternal boredom is the same as a sketchbook that doesn't run out of pages.`
`It means you can draw whatever you want, can try to have as much fun as you want.`
`Boredom is the worst sort of poison, which kills all witches.`
`...Even those Great Witches who are given the title 'Lady' fear it.`
`It's the eternal poison that tortures them because of the eternal bliss they've reached...`
`"Now that I've earned the name of Endless Witch, I truly wish I could speak with Teacher again.`
` ...Is 'happiness' really what lay at the end of our training?`
` And just what is 'happiness'? I wish I could talk with her about that now."`
`'Training has no end.`
` When you think you've reached the eternal level, that's exactly the time to bemoan your own immaturity.'`
`...I recalled those words as though she'd answered me directly.`
`"*cackle*cackle*, hahhahahahahahahahaha...`
` I see, ...so I'm immature, am I?!`
` How amusing, how truly amusing.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`The sound of painfully shrill laughter rang out.`
`It was coming from my furniture.`
` ...What, did they break their toy again?`
`"Beatrice-sama,`
` this guy's stopped moving again."`
`"And I haven't had nearly enough fun yet.`
` What a pathetic man."`
`"But I haven't gotten a chance to play at all yet!`
` Let me play, let me plaaay!"`
`"Be silent, filth!`
` If you keep devouring him like starving dogs, of course he'll keep breaking right away, no matter how well Beatrice-sama fixes him up."`
`"You broke him the most, Satan-nee.`
` You just don't know what holding back means."`
`"My apologies, Beatrice-sama.`
` Please forgive my stupid little sisters."`
`"Fix him quicklyyy!`
` I'm next, I'm neeext!"`
`"Aaah, must you keep up that infernal racket?!?!"`
`"""""""Eeep!!"""""""`
`A single yell was all it took to make the noisy Sisters of the Seven Stakes vanish.`
`All they do is mess around, having as much fun as they want breaking him.`
`They only come to me to clean up afterwards.`
` ...Truly, this furniture never leaves me bored.`
`Once the furniture hid themselves, ...all that remained was a sloppy mess, the last remnants of a broken toy.`
`It had no form anymore.`
`"...It's hard even for me to remember its original form in this state.`
` Better to make it remember for itself, perhaps.`
` ...Oh, well."`
`I waved my golden pipe.`
`Then I spoke.`
` I chanted.`
` I made it remember.`
`"...Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have?`
` ...After all, right now, you pretty much look like a huge lump of scrap meat.`
` I've no idea which part is your arm and which is your leg.`
` Unless you remember, I won't even be able to recall your face.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`By the power of magic, the pitiful pieces of meat began to remember what their form had been.`
`Which part should go with which part, and where should join with where?`
`That's right, just like that.`
`...No, no, you should be a finger on the left hand.`
` That's the right hand.`
` That's it, good, good, *cackle*.`
`"...Good morning.`
` Have you woken up, Ushiromiya Battler?`
` How ironic, that your true nightmare begins after you awaken."`
`"...*cough*...*cough*...`
` ......Nngg...owowow..."`
`"If you would just accept that I am a witch, you'll quickly wake up from this nightmare, and I'll send you to heaven.`
` I am the king of Mount Purgatory.`
` There's no escape from this hell without my approval."`
`"Heh, ...hehehehe.`
` You call this hell? That's just useless.`
` Aah, it's all useless."`
`"I'm impressed you can still talk like that, after experiencing the pain of death not once, like any normal human,`
` but more times than I could count with all of my fingers.`
` *cackle*`
` This is why I never get bored.`
` I never get bored of you."`
`"Yeah, no boredom problem here.`
` After all, I get my pick of those massive tit Nee-chan's with the dazzling asses in my harem.`
` Thanks to that, I'm not likely to get bored for a while now."`
`"*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` That's splendid.`
` Otherwise I would get bored too.`
` So, my furniture,`
` I've fixed him, so you can play as much as you want."`
`"Thank you very much!`
` Kyaha, all mine!"`
`"I told you, your turn's over, I'm next!`
` Get away from him, waaah!"`
`"Heheheheheh.`
` Wonderful, isn't it, Battler-kuuun?`
` Look how popular you are."`
`"Popular guys have it rough.`
` Get in line, freaks."`
`"If you just stayed obedient instead of acting tough, this would go much easier."`
`"Nah, he's good like this.`
` His screams feel so much better."`
`"Okay, let's not break him so quickly this time.`
` Did you all hear me?!"`
`"You aren't running this show!`
` Battler-kun,`
` let's continue where we left off, okay?`
` After they locked Jessica-chan's room with the master key, how did they return the key to the corpse's pocket, which was inside the room?"`
`"...Well, maybe...`
` ...That's it, they used a fishing line or something, sending just the key into the room through the crack of the door..."`
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha!!`
` Wrooong!"`
`"So naive.`
` Of all of the doors that exist on Rokkenjima, none has a crack through which a key can slip`
`."`
`"He was wrong, right, right?`
` Okay, this time it's me, my turn!`
` Wheeere should I strike?!"`
`"Me, back of the hand!"`
`"No faaair!`
` Okay, then I've got the back of his other hand!"`
`"I'll take the tip of his nose!"`
`"Why, why? Let me do it too, let me strike too!`
` Waaah!!"`
`"Don't be so slow, Levia-nee! We've always done first come, first serve!`
` Okay, I'll take the top of his foot!"`
`"Waaah!!`
` Me too, me too!`
` I'll take his shoulder, okay?!"`
`"Keh...`
` You're sisters right? Play nice with each other, okay...?`
` ...Gwaaa...aggh......nn..."`
`"...I can't believe you're still resisting.`
` Why haven't you realized that your false courage actually gets us fired up?"`
`"Sorry, but...`
`false courage and being stubborn are my specialties.`
` No matter how you all try to confuse the issues, I definitely won't accept witches and magic...!"`
`"Even though you can't explain anything with human tricks?`
` Are you stupid?!`
` Know your place!"`
`"It's okay, we don't have to force him to accept it.`
` Soon, he'll wanna accept it so hard he'll start crying.`
` Even now, he really wants to kneel down on the ground pitifully and beg our forgiveness!"`
`"Ugaah, guahgehgehgyahh...!!"`
`"Aaaah, he's broken already!`
` Beatrice-sama!"`
`"...Ah, well.`
` Since they know I can revive him over and over, my furniture won't even hesitate to break him.`
` Good grief."`
`Giving eternal rebirth and eternal death at will.`
`Before the Endless Witch Beatrice, all death and life has no meaning.`
`Even death can't become the key to escape from my cage.`
`"Come, Battler.`
` Remember your original form again.`
` I'll toy with you to my heart's content, understand?`
` I see, I see, how truly pleasant to have a toy to play with for all eternity.`
` ...Ah, could this be the endless bliss witches gain at the endless level?"`
`"I see, I see.`
` Yes, this bliss certainly is amusing.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Wahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` I'll revive you over and over, kill you over and over!`
` Let's see, what kind of murder play will unfold on the next game board?`
` Come, bring it in. Let the next game begin, Ushiromiya Battleeer!!"`
`"Dang,`
` too bad Aneki hates cigarettes so much."`
`"Sorry.`
` She's been pretty grumpy since last night.`
` Please don't hold it against her."`
`Rudolf and Hideyoshi went out onto the deck and took out some cigarettes.`
`Eva had always hated the smell of cigarettes, but when she was in a bad mood, she got even more sensitive to them.`
`When they decided to smoke casually until they reached the island, the two of them had gotten yelled at and chased out onto the deck.`
`Hideyoshi tried to use his lighter, but the strong winds gave him some trouble.`
`Rudolf took out a Zippo with a smooth gesture and let Hideyoshi borrow the flame.`
`"When did you start smoking cigarettes, Hideyoshi nii-san?"`
`"Just after the war.`
` In the beginnin', I was rollin' 'em.`
` Then I started usin' what I sold.`
` Wahahahahahahaha."`
`"So you were already smoking when you met Aneki.`
` Bet she's always telling you to stop."`
`"I never listened to her, so she's already completely given up on that.`
` Wahaha, men gotta be stubborn, times like these."`
`Hideyoshi laughed heartily, but Rudolf snickered.`
`After being scolded by Eva, they'd escaped to the deck together with their tails between their legs.`
` There was little doubt who had gotten her way in that exchange.`
`"...She isn't usually so short-tempered.`
` ...In fact, she's usually a more gentle, quiet woman.`
` Every year, she changes when this day comes."`
`"Is that so?`
` To me, she looks just like the Aneki we've all known so long."`
`"...That's just it.`
` She's back to bein' Eva of the Ushiromiya family.`
` ...But that ain't the Eva I know."`
`".........`
`Well, I know why she's grumpy.`
` ...This family conference is gonna be a pain."`
`"...Got that right.`
` There's that plan to threaten money out of Krauss nii-san...`
` We may call it a family conference, but it's gonna be just a sibling fight at this rate."`
`Before the family conference, three of the siblings had made a secret pact without Krauss.`
`They were all facing urgent situations and needed a lot of money fast.`
`And the only one they could turn to was Krauss, who spoke for the Ushiromiya Head now that Kinzo spent his time shut up in his study.`
`For a long time now, they'd vaguely sensed that Krauss was taking advantage of the fact that Kinzo had lost interest in his own wealth,`
` and they suspected that he'd started embezzling that wealth to suit his own purposes.`
`Despite being disgusted by this, they'd turned a blind eye to it while everything was still going smoothly for them,`
` ...but now that they needed money, they really couldn't afford to let it slide.`
`Eva had asked Rudolf and Rosa to form an alliance, and they were now scheming to take that money away from Krauss.`
`"......Rudolf-kun, both you and I are company presidents.`
` We're responsible for the livelihood of our employees."`
`"Rosa's a president too.`
` Well, as a hobby."`
`"That's right, sorry.`
` ...Basically, we've all got responsibilities."`
`"...Now that I've thrown down the gauntlet in front of the executive board, I've gotta bring in the money, even if it means getting down on my knees or drinking mud."`
`"Same here.`
` ...I can't betray the employees who've trusted me and followed me for so long.`
` ...That's why I need to get some money out of Krauss nii-san, even if I have to grab him by the neck."`
`"Aneki and Aniki have always been at each other's throats.`
` ...And now she's gotta challenge Aniki head on.`
` It's no wonder she's on edge."`
`"So, Eva really has had a bad relationship with Krauss nii-san since long ago...?"`
`"Hasn't she talked about it?`
` They were always at each other's throats."`
`"She never talks about the past, even if I ask.`
` ...She probably doesn't want to remember."`
`"...She's always been brainy and shrewd.`
` Her grades were good too.`
` Compared to that, Aniki was just average.`
` ...The simple fact she existed would've been pressure enough, but she kept boasting about it and driving him into a corner."`
`"...That fool...`
` Why drive him into a corner so openly?`
` I'd hardly call that shrewd."`
`"Hahaha, no kidding.`
` ......Aneki...regretted being born a woman.`
` ...So, she probably couldn't forgive Aniki, since he was chosen to succeed the Head just because he was a man.`
` ...She'd always boast to Dad, letting him see that she was better at every little thing."`
`"Father really is an old-fashioned person.`
` Gender discrimination was part of his system of values.`
` ...I'll bet Eva's eagerness to prove herself made him dislike her a bit..."`
`"............"`
`"Wouldn't you say schooling for women is like sugar in black tea?`
` The taste is dull and flat without it, but too much ruins the whole thing."`
`...Since you can still drink black tea without sugar,`
` he was in effect saying that there was no need for women to study.`
`Those infuriating words were what Nii-san hurled at me in my despair,`
` when I asked to go to college only to be denied by Father.`
`I protested that I needed to build up proper dignity and an education as the oldest daughter in the Ushiromiya family, making college an essential next step.`
`But when it came down to it, Father's and Nii-san's answers were exactly the same.`
`'How conceited for a woman.'`
`I've never taken the Ushiromiya name lightly, not once since I was born into it.`
`And I've been even more careful not to take my father's name, Ushiromiya Kinzo, lightly.`
`Our family is an old one, with many traditions, `
`but it lost its wealth and businesses in the Great Kanto Earthquake, pushing it to the brink at one point.`
`That was when Father took control with his ingenious talent, reviving it to be even greater than it had been before.`
`Not once did I forget that I was the daughter of that great Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
`That's why I always made every effort to become worthy of that name.`
`I needed dignity worthy of the Ushiromiya family.`
` Schooling.`
` Manners.`
` And leadership.`
`Even if I couldn't quite reach Father's level, I deepened my knowledge in economics and finance, trying to improve myself so I could be of use to him at any time.`
`...However, in the end, Father never acknowledged my efforts.`
`To Father, a woman was only meant to support a man, and nothing further than that was permissable.`
`When was it that I came to understand that?`
`...It may have been as early as my childhood years.`
`...But, I was going to have to wait until I grew up before I could truly accept it.`
`Compared to me, you couldn't have said that Krauss, my older brother of two years, `
`worked hard at all to become deserving of the Ushiromiya family name.`
`He told me many times since my early childhood that he would naturally succeed Father, simply because he was born a man.`
`...He kept on repeating that, as though it formed an uncrossable gap between us.`
`I couldn't stand it.`
` Even though I always got better grades than Nii-san,`
` even though I became class president when he never managed more than vice-president,`
` ...even so, Nii-san was considered to be the appropriate successor to the Ushiromiya family just because he was a man.`
`Of course, you could find gender discrimination everywhere in those days.`
`No, it was even considered a virtue in that era.`
`During that despicable time, people said that when a woman is born, she obeys her parents, when she gets married, she obeys her husband, and when she gets old, she obeys her children.`
`But that was exactly why I wanted to turn that on its head.`
`...Innocently, I kept trying to prove that I was the most fit.`
`...However, I eventually realized that all of my efforts had been doomed from the beginning.`
`"Wouldn't you say schooling for women is like sugar in black tea?`
` The taste is dull and flat without it, but too much ruins the whole thing."`
`"...What do you mean by that, Nii-san?"`
`"Just as there are roles that only men can fill, there are also roles that can only be filled by women, correct?`
` I do believe giving birth to children, raising them, and supporting the master of the house are roles that can only be filled by women."`
`"Are you trying to say there's no need for a woman to work or study?"`
`"I wouldn't go that far.`
` Talking to an unschooled woman is tiring and nothing more.`
` ...However, women are even more tiring when they're too smart.`
` I do believe that a woman as violently assertive as you would bring no end of hardship to her future husband."`
`"Are you trying to say that a woman has to marry and hide in the shadow of her husband?`
`'!s0`
`"Though you're my younger sister, I can look up to you for the respect you hold for Father and your desire to become a daughter worthy of him.`
` Even I am capable of feeling respect for such noble sentiments."`
`"That's just disgusting.`
` What's this about 'noble sentiments'?`
` I'd call that flowery prose, coming from you.`
` Are you pretending to be the Head already?"`
`"The decision that I should succeed the Headship has been established from the very beginning.`
` And yet, you seem to be laboring under the illusion that you might become the Head, hence the useless and reckless efforts you've expended thus far."`
`"Reckless efforts...?!`
` Is it really that bizarre for me to say I want to go to college?!"`
`"Yes, it is bizarre.`
` You undoubtably are the oldest daughter of the glorious Ushiromiya family.`
` One day, you will support that family crest by being wed to the partner most valuable for Father.`
` ...However, excessive learning is not what's being asked of you.`
` What you need are gentle feelings that will allow you to care for your husband, the ability to handle housework, and a humble demeanor that will reflect well on the master of your household.`
` These are all skills you lack utterly.`
` In the end, can you really call yourself a suitable daughter of the Ushiromiya Family?"`
`"I have no intention of being some secluded lady!`
` I just want to become the person most capable of assisting Father at his work!"`
`"Then shouldn't you do so in a manner befitting an Ushiromiya Family daughter...?`
` What is it with you?`
` You're still mannish even at your age, and you've never learned how to wear makeup in a way that will please men, much less how to cook and do housework.`
` I hear you've even been learning how to brawl."`
`'!s0`
` The martial arts aren't brawling, they're a perfect way to train and discipline the mind.`
` And when it's needed, I take more than enough care to act as a woman should!!`
` What are you trying to say?`
` That women should be slaves who work for men, so I mustn't be so forward?!"`
`"It isn't elegant to say it out loud,`
` but I think a few unpleasant words are necessary in order to correct your mistake.`
` So let me say it plainly.`
` Women exist to serve men.`
` And men exist to provide for women.`
` A woman's job is to protect a man's back, to protect his house and raise his children."`
`"Most women realize this without being told.`
` They realize it on their own.`
` ...But even after all these years, you still haven't realized that about yourself.`
` So I've decided to clear away that misunderstanding for you before you leave this family.`
` You ought to thank me."`
`"Th-This is an insult to all women...!!`
` No, wait, ...I-I have never thought of myself as a woman, and I've never depended on anyone because I'm a woman!!`
` How am I inferior to you, Nii-san?!`
` In grades and accomplishments...in everything...I'm better, so how can you look down on me when you have nothing I lack, except the fact that you're a man?!!"`
`"It's about knowing one's place.`
` Every day, I have been raised with the readiness of one who will be Head.`
` In the future, that preparation will surely become essential.`
` But you are different.`
` Even though you will marry and lose the Ushiromiya family name, you're being trapped by this unnecessary illusion."`
`"...What's your complaint?`
` Even if you had been born a man, the successor to the Headship still probably wouldn't have been you.`
` Why are you so unsatisfied that you insist on attacking me even now?"`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, eva_3e23:`
`always, always like that...!`
` Looking down on me because you'll succeed the Head, `
`...even though...`
`aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!"`
`What's my complaint, you say...?`
`I've got a billion of them.`
` Grudges, hard feelings, humiliations that I'll never forget kept floating through the back of my mind.`
`They all built up at the same time, coming out of my throat as a shameful moan.`
`"...What's all this noise?`
` God isn't the only one who holds silence as a virtue."`
`'!s1`
` "Father!"`
`He'd probably overheard our sibling fight.`
`Father entered with a clearly unhappy face.`
`"Krauss,`
` are you fighting with your siblings again?`
` Why don't you have the dignity to act as a leader for your brother and sisters?`
` How shameful!`
` I'm embarrassed to hear this from my eldest son!"`
`In a flash, he struck Krauss's face.`
`...I readied myself to be struck in the same way, but I wasn't hit.`
`"...M-My apologies, `
`Father."`
`"Dignity isn't the only thing you lack.`
` There's much more.`
` You're immature in everything!`
` And even so, you pretend like you're an adult!`
` Realize that it's a hundred years too early for you to talk like that, and devote yourself to your studies!`
` Don't make me lament my son's incompetence any more...!"`
`"Yes.`
` ...I will continue to strive so that I can become a person worthy of succeeding you, Father..."`
`It was as if those words were directed at me.`
`Even when he was being yelled at by Father, he was still bragging to me about how he was special, `
`...about how he was the successor.`
`I just couldn't stand it...and finally spoke what was on my mind.`
`Even though I realized that it would be improper for a member of the Ushiromiya family to do such a thing.`
`"Father...!!`
` Please, tell me how I'm inferior to him!!`
` I've tried so hard, studied so hard to become a person who won't bring shame to your name...!`
` Please, tell me how I'm inferior...!`
` How can I improve myself enough to earn your acknowledgement...?!!"`
`"That again?!!`
` How many times do I have to say it before you'll understand?`
` I expect nothing from you!`
` Women should be women and just learn how to cook and sew!!`
` You aren't prepared at all as a woman!`
` In you, I don't see a trace of the mindset needed to serve one's husband, to earnestly devote one's self to a man's needs!!"`
`"What good are you as a woman?!`
` Don't you realize that you're a daughter of the Ushiromiya family?!!`
` And yet, you only want to learn things so that you can act like a man!`
` Your duty is not to imitate Krauss!!`
` Don't you even understand your own duty?!!"`
`"A-As a member the Ushiromiya family, I won't bring shame to your na-"`
`"That's it, that's where you're already wrong!!`
` Your duty is to marry out of the family and bring me a man who is profitable to me!`
` And then, you will devote yourself to your husband, give birth to children and multiply!`
` Be a good wife who brings praise to your husband's family!!"`
`"Just what is it that you can do to please a man?`
` Do you think you can make tea?`
` Do you have any talent in cooking?`
` You have nothing!!`
` All you've done is to try and mimic Krauss, haven't you?!!`
` Krauss will succeed the Ushiromiya family!`
` If you are unsatisfied with that, then you are disobeying me!!"`
`"Are you saying you'll refuse to listen to what I say, even though you're my daughter?!!!`
` Get out!!`
` You're disinherited!!`
` I won't let you call yourself an Ushiromiya!!`
` Disinherited, disinherited!!`
` Uu-, *cough*cough*!!"`
`"Father, hang in there.`
` Please calm down.`
` ...Genji-san, could you bring some water?"`
`"...Yes.`
` Immediately."`
`"Eva, leave this place.`
` He doesn't mean what he says.`
` I will calm him down."`
`"*cough*, *cough*cough*!!`
`Disinherited... If you won't listen to me, you're disinherited!!`
` *cough*cough*, uugghh, *cough*cough*!!"`
`Father was coughing pretty badly, and Nii-san patted his back.`
`...As if it was a duty that was naturally his.`
`It was so vexing for me to let him take that duty all for himself right then.`
`If I carelessly approached Father at that moment, then I would probably be the one to get hit next.`
`...However, I fearlessly tried to approach Father's back.`
`Genji blocked me...`
`"...Eva-sama, perhaps it would be better if you stepped outside for now.`
` The Master is not in a good mood today."`
`"B-But..."`
`"*cough*cough*!!`
` Why are my children so incompetent?!`
` Krauss is lacking in dignity, Eva is always a stubborn tomboy!!`
` I have no son who's like a man, and not even a daughter who's like a woman!`
` Where did I go wrong raising them?!`
` Why Genji, when and where did I go wrong?!!"`
`"...Master, you haven't done anything wrong.`
` Krauss-sama has grown into a sturdy son, and Eva-sama into a lovely daughter.`
` You haven't made any mistakes..."`
`"How can you say that?!!`
` What's so lovely about her?!!`
` Far from a lady, she's always acting like a man!!`
` *cough*cough*cough*!!`
` Disinherited, disinheriteeed!!`
` *cough*cough*!!"`
`"Father, that's just what I'm always telling Eva.`
` Eva has promised that she will have a change of heart and act like a lady.`
` Couldn't you postpone that decision for just a little longer?"`
`"Who's a lady?!!`
` *cough*cough*!!`
` Disinherited, disinherited, *cough*cough, uu-, *cough*cough*!"`
`Go quickly and leave this to me.`
`Krauss gave me a look telling me that...`
`...Did I take the wrong path, just like Father and Nii-san said?`
`True, I never studied how to be a lady.`
`...Everything I've learned was done in the hopes that I could help Father someday.`
`......But...is that really true?`
`Haven't I always been trying to compete with Nii-san, with whom I've had a bad relationship since I was a young girl,`
` because I wanted to steal his position as successor and show him a thing or two?`
`Every chance he gets, Nii-san tells me that men should be manly and women should be womanly.`
`I've been tormented by this unfair discrimination just because of my gender, something people are born with and can't do anything about.`
`I resisted, endeavoring to this very day to study and prove that I'm not inferior, despite being a woman.`
`...But doesn't that mean my love of learning comes entirely from a stupid complex I've got against Nii-san?`
`Father wanted me to become a lady with whom he could go out in public and not be embarrassed.`
`...Did I betray his hopes, earning good grades and threating Nii-san just to satisfy a childhood resentment...?`
`"That's not it.`
` You swore to me, saying 'I will become the successor to the Ushiromiya family'."`
`"......You......"`
`The one whispering to me......was the 'me' of my years as a young girl, born inside my heart on the day I made that oath.`
`...That's right.`
` 'She' was my only ally.`
`When things got difficult, when I felt like I was about to get crushed by it all, she would always quietly appear and support me.`
`When I ran into roadblocks and despaired, she would always appear and support me.`
`When I grew up and the memories of my childhood years faded, I also started to forget my conversations with 'her'...`
`"I, Ushiromiya Eva, will definitely become the Head of the Ushiromiya family.`
` And I'll triumph over that irritating, arrogant Krauss.`
` ...On that day, we promised to do our best together to achieve that."`
`"...That's right, we promised.`
` ...On that day, I promised that I would become the successor to the Ushiromiya Headship."`
`On that day, when I had been overcome with sadness, wondering why I was even alive,`
` ...you appeared from inside me and lent me your strength.`
`"...Father didn't accept me.`
` I wanted to teach Nii-san a lesson.`
` I believed that doing this...would let me say goodbye to the wretched creature I once was."`
`For a time, I truly believed that my life had no purpose other than to be looked down upon by Nii-san.`
`...It's painful just remembering those days.`
` They're a wound, a crack inside my heart...`
`'She' taught me how to sew up that wound...`
`I turned my anger into effort and improved myself,`
` ...trying to become a person more worthy of the Headship than Krauss was,`
` trying to triumph over him by making Father accept me.`
` It was my perfect revenge.`
`I was vaguely aware that a woman couldn't possibly become the Family Head.`
`But I thought that maybe, if I could prove myself valuable enough to overturn that premise,`
` ...then surely even Father would select me to be his successor.`
`If that happened, ...then I'd be able to have the greatest and most perfect revenge against Nii-san, `
`who always acted like his succession to the Headship was completely inevitable...`
`"That's right.`
` If we can manage that, the wounds in our heart will be healed.`
` ...We promised each other to do our best until that day comes.`
` And now you're saying you're gonna break that promise?`
` Scum.`
` Coward.`
` If only you'd just give up and die..."`
`Even though she looked like me as a kid, she was still another me.`
` ...Her tongue was sharp because it was mine.`
`"...It makes me pretty mad hearing that, even from myself.`
` You have no right to speak of me like that."`
`"Then let's use that anger to fuel our learning.`
` ...Changing anger into power is my magic.`
` I've saved you from a bunch of tight spots with that power, letting you to succeed when you shouldn't have.`
` As long as you have my magic, there's nothing you can't do."`
`"...That's right.`
` Anger has always been my driving force.`
` I wonder when it was I forgot that..."`
`"If you can remember me again, that magic will become ours once more.`
` Come on, let's turn that anger into power and study even harder, okay?`
` I know we've still got a lot to learn."`
`"Let's go to college, study more and more, get excellent grades, and drive Krauss into a corner.`
` That guy acts like we're nothing, but I'm sure he feels pretty well cornered in the inside.`
` If only he'd just learn his place and die.`
` If he did, we could become the Head.`
` Rudolf won't take the job.`
` That kid can't go against us."`
`"......Stop that.`
` ...No matter how much more I study, Father still won't accept me."`
`"Why not...?"`
`"Father told me to be womanly...`
` Because I'm a woman, no matter how hard I tried, Father wouldn't have passed the Headship on to me, even if I had been born before Nii-san...`
` No matter how much effort I put in, ...I can't become anything more than a woman.`
` I won't be acknowledged.`
` Nii-san doesn't try at all, but I can't surpass him.`
` He'll look down on me forever..."`
`"...Father and Krauss are the worst kind of male supremacists.`
` If only they'd just die."`
`...She cursed them for my sake.`
`Words that I couldn't say so easily, ...she said for me.`
`Even though I understand that she's just another part of myself inside of me,`
` ...I feel like she's the only ally I have who can sympathize with me.`
`However, while sympathy might do a lot to calm my heart, it won't do anything to improve my current situation.`
` ...In the end, she can only console me for however long it takes me to be dejected by reality...before I finally accept it.`
`"...Thank you.`
` You've done enough.`
` ...Now that it's come to this, I'll become such a good lady that it'll shock even Father...`
` I'll find an excellent man that Nii-san can't even compare to..."`
`"You can't do that."`
`"......"`
`'She' rejected my timid thoughts.`
`...I understand.`
` ...Because 'she' is me, I understand.`
`"All Father said was that he won't let a woman succeed the Headship 'now'.`
` But even that's just a rule Father made up.`
` Since he made it, he can get rid of it."`
`"......Human feelings can change far more often than the number of sand grains on a beach.`
` Krauss is such a stupid man that Father's eventually gonna realize it, even if we don't prove it for him.`
` ...When that happens, the wall that separates man from woman will be demolished by Father himself, who set it up in the first place.`
` That day will surely come."`
`"...How can you be so sure?"`
`"Because that's my...magic."`
`"........."`
`"If you just believe, this magic will surely summon a miracle.`
` ...The basis of my magic is nothing more than your believing heart."`
`"............"`
`If I use this magic, ...then surely, I'll never have to doubt until the day I die...that I'll eventually become the Head.`
`...But I don't know if that's the right thing for Ushiromiya Eva...`
`Maybe I should aim to become the kind of lady Father wants, someone who can proudly participate in high society.`
`And if I'm reborn, maybe Father will change his opinion of me.`
` ...Maybe I can find my own lifestyle, just as Nii-san has found his.`
`And anyway, I just can't imagine my stubborn father choosing a woman like me as the Head,`
` especially if it means skipping over Krauss.`
`"......You don't believe?"`
`"U-Um, I was just thinking.`
` ......Maybe I can't succeed the Headship, but as a woman, I can have a child. And Nii-san still isn't engaged.`
` ...If Nii-san isn't able to father a child, and I gave birth to one, ...then wouldn't that make my child the next Head after Nii-san?`
` In other words, ...wouldn't that mean the same thing as stealing the Headship from Nii-san...?"`
`"......Are you serious?"`
`"...Y-Yes, I'm serious.`
` ...True, it'll be very sad to abandon the resolve I've had since childhood.`
` ...It pains my heart to betray you, my younger self.`
` ...But this is my most realistic option...!"`
`"Are you throwing away your dreams?`
` ...And me as well?"`
`"I'm not throwing anything away.`
` ...I'm an adult, and the day has come for me to part ways with you."`
`"That's right.`
` Eva's already become an adult.`
` She's even forgotten how to use magic,`
` ...and now she's the mother of a single child.`
` She forgot all about how magic can grant one's own dreams, and now she's forcing those dreams onto her son."`
`"...Even though Father and Krauss ruined your life, you're trying to push your dreams onto your son, ruining his life.`
` ...Is that what you call being an adult?"`
`"G-George is a son I'm proud of, one who won't embarrass himself no matter where he goes...!`
` The dream I wasn't granted might come true for George...!`
` Jessica's a delinquent in both her grades and her behavior.`
` And she's a woman!`
` If only Jessica would step down, George would become the heir...!"`
`Even saying it was painful.`
`Am I just forcing my own regrets onto George?`
`It's not like I have any right to look on Jessica with scorn.`
`Wasn't I just horrible for hitting her with the same words that had caused me so much suffering...?`
`...I understand.`
` I understand...`
`The desire to triumph over my brother is part of my own personal revenge.`
`...I can't use George for that...`
`"...So I'll take revenge myself.`
` I have a plan to cheat Nii-san out of some of his money, with Rudolf and Rosa as my allies.`
` I'll surely be able to get back at him.`
` ...In any case, I'm sure that Nii-san is embezzling Father's assets..."`
`"...What a boring plan.`
` Why don't you just give up on that and cry yourself to sleep...?"`
`"............"`
`"We will become the Ushiromiya Family Head.`
` ...Don't mistake what your dream is.`
` And believe me when I say it'll definitely come true.`
` Believe in my magic."`
`"...If I believe, I wonder if any power will dwell in that magic."`
`"It will.`
` My magic can grant any wish with certainty."`
`".........`
`...I'll believe.`
` ...I'll believe, ...so create a miracle with that magic...`
` ...If you don't, ...the hole in my heart will never heal..."`
`"Okay.`
` ...Then listen well.`
` Listen to my magic words.`
` ...And understand. If we can solve the riddle, we can become the Ushiromiya Family Head.`
` ...So lend me your ears and listen carefully..."`
`Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved hometown.`
`You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key...`
`"Eva nee-san,`
` it looks like we're about to arrive."`
`When Kyrie shook her shoulders, Eva jumped and awoke from her doze.`
`"......!`
` ......Ah, `
`...I'm sorry.`
` I was half asleep."`
`"Sorry to scare you."`
`"Aunt Eva, you were out cold.`
` Did you get up early this morning?"`
`"...Maybe.`
` I let you all see something embarassing.`
` I'm sorry."`
`"Well, I'd say it's pretty impressive you were relaxed enough to sleep.`
` Battler kept yelling 'We're gonna faaall, we're gonna drooown!'`
` Can't get bored with this guy around."`
`"Sh-Shut up!`
` All humans have at least one thing they're weak against...!"`
`Battler and Jessica came in, messing around.`
`Rudolf also made a face as if asking, 'Are you okay?'`
`"Get ahold of yourself.`
` When you see Dad and the rest, all that sleepiness'll go right out the window.`
` Let's all give it our best, okay?"`
`"...That's right.`
` We have to keep it together, especially this year..."`
`"That's it.`
` ...Let's all tighten our assholes and go."`
`Rudolf said these strict words in a small voice that only Eva could hear.`
`Failure would not be tolerated in this year's family conference.`
`...All of their companies were hanging in the balance.`
`Even Rudolf's face looked a little tense.`
`Eva's expression probably looked tense as well.`
`"Mom, I have our luggage.`
` Let's go up onto the deck."`
`"...Thank you.`
` You really are considerate, George."`
`"Why are you thanking me so suddenly?`
` It's not like you, Mother."`
`"Evaaa, Geooorge.`
` We're there.`
` Grab our luggage."`
`"Uu-!`
` We're there, we're there!`
` *giggle*!"`
`"Hey, Maria!`
` Stop running or you'll trip!"`
`It seemed Maria was already getting excited.`
`She ran circles around Hideyoshi, escaping from Rosa, who was trying to catch her.`
`"............"`
`"What is it, Mother?`
` ...Do you feel sick...?"`
`"George,`
` take our luggage and go on ahead.`
` Your mother's probably feeling anemic, so I'll lend her a hand."`
`"Really...?`
` Okay, I'll head out first."`
`Something odd in Eva's expression told Hideyoshi that it hadn't been a pleasant awakening, so he made George go on ahead.`
`Rudolf's family and Rosa's family also went up onto the deck, leaving only Eva and Hideyoshi inside the boat.`
`Eva had a vague expression on her face, as though she still hadn't been able to escape from her daydream.`
`"............"`
`"...What's wrong?`
` Why the meek face?"`
`"......I wonder if I'm using George as a tool for my own revenge...`
` ...I wonder if my childish hostility towards Nii-san has caused me to treat that child's life like a toy...`
` Aah, what have I done, ...what have I...!"`
`"That isn't true.`
` George is our wonderful son, and he'll always perform admirably wherever he goes.`
` Eva, even if you let your own hopes get in the way a bit, everythin' turned out okay in the end, hasn't it?!`
` You haven't done anythin' wrong.`
` In fact, George is grateful for the strict discipline you gave him, right?"`
`"...Really?`
` Hey, really?!`
` George doesn't think I'm a terrible mother, does he...?!`
` Does he, does he, does he?!"`
`"He's never said anythin' like that, not even once.`
` You're just worryin' too much."`
`"Hideyoshi-sama,`
` everyone has left the boat.`
` ...Oh, did you lose something?`
` Do you need a hand?"`
`Kumasawa had come to check on them when they hadn't gone up to the deck.`
`Hideyoshi hid Eva behind his back so that her expression wouldn't be seen.`
`"Yeah, sorry.`
` My necktie pin just got a bit crooked!`
` We're fine, and we'll be out in a sec.`
` Wait outside for us!"`
`"Is that so?`
` ...Hohohoh.`
` Then I will wait outside..."`
`Even though she didn't really understand, Kumasawa realized that something had come up...and disappeared so that she didn't trouble them further.`
`If they stayed here any longer, they would probably make everyone else worry too.`
`"...It's about time to go.`
` We'll make George and the rest worry."`
`"......George...really doesn't despise me...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Nothin' of the sort.`
` In fact, he's very grateful."`
`"............"`
`"...Did you have a nightmare?`
` Again?"`
`'!s200`
`'!s0`
`Hideyoshi knew that Eva was often tormented by nightmares.`
`And they always grew more marked on the days leading up to the family conference...`
`Hideyoshi knew that Eva's relationship with Krauss was still full of antagonism to the point of being traumatic...`
`and that she still couldn't let go of the feelings she'd had as a child.`
`"That was a dream.`
` ...I'm with you now.`
` If I grasp your hand like this, that dream'll go away.`
` Right?`
` Look.`
` I'm holdin' tight."`
`"...*giggle*`
` That hurts.`
` ...Thank you.`
` I'm fine now...`
` ...Let's get off the boat."`
`"Yeah.`
` Let's get off the boat.`
` Everyone's waitin' for us."`
`"...Umm, ......I'm sorry."`
`"Hmm?"`
`"...I'm sorry...`
`...that I yelled at you...`
`...about the smoke from your cigarettes just now..."`
`"Come on, you normally wouldn't apologize for that sort of thing.`
` ...You're all frail after havin' that dream.`
` ...Don't worry 'bout it.`
` I was wrong for not realizin' that the smoke was affectin' you."`
`"......Have you...started to hate me...?"`
`"No way, no way.`
` Wahahahahahaha.`
` If I hated you after somethin' like that, we wouldn't have lasted three days.`
` Come on, stand up, stand up.`
` Let's get off the boat."`
`"Hideyoshi-sama, Eva-sama.`
` Is everything all right?`
` Are you not feeling well?"`
`This time, it was Gohda.`
` It looked like they'd kept everyone waiting too long after all.`
`Even Eva had to stand up without grumbling now.`
`...She had to stop forcing her bad mood onto her husband and causing him any more trouble.`
`...Because that wasn't someting a 'good wife' would do.`
`"Is everything okay?`
` If it's a matter concerning your health, shall I call Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"Thanks,`
` but I'm just feeling a little anemic.`
` I'm fine now."`
`"It's a woman's disease.`
` Don't worry about it.`
` Wahhahahahahaha."`
`"Come on...`
` Don't say stuff like that in front of people, it's embarrassing."`
`"Oooh, sorry, sorry."`
`Eva elbowed Hideyoshi in the gut.`
`By that time, her normal expression had returned, which allowed Hideyoshi to relax a little.`
`The bright sunlight outside almost made her dizzy.`
`A small plank for getting off the boat was lowered, and Gohda was waiting there, smiling and ready to lend them a hand.`
`"Please, Eva-sama.`
` Your hand."`
`"Thank you."`
`"Welcome to Rokkenjima."`
`'!s0`
`"...Huh?"`
`When she left the boat, ......it seemed to Eva as though she'd heard the voice of her young self.`
`No, it hadn't seemed that way.`
` ...Someone 'had told' her "Welcome back".`
`After becoming a shameless adult, `
`...the voice of her young self was distant.`
`"What am I living for...?`
` What can I do to release myself from this obsession...?"`
`Hideyoshi heard her talking to herself.`
`When Hideyoshi held on tightly to Eva's shoulders, his firmness alone told her that there was no need to say any more...`
`Maybe it was because the typhoon was getting closer.`
`The lively cries of the seagulls, which usually greeted them when they arrived, couldn't be heard at all...`
`"...What, you mean six years ago?`
` I mean, I was still in elementary school back then, right?`
` It's pretty unfair to expect me to remember everything, don't you think?"`
`"True.`
` Especially because we were so young, we've grown a lot in these six years.`
` If I hadn't been introduced, I might not even have remembered you."`
`"Really?`
` I figured he was Battler right away.`
` And when he opened his mouth, I was sure."`
`"Uu-.`
` I just met him for the first time.`
` Didn't know him six years ago."`
`"That's right.`
` Maria-sama was only three years old then."`
`"Well, the same goes for me.`
` I only knew Maria when she was three years old, and since she's grown so big, of course I wouldn't recognize her."`
`After lunch, we had all gone out to the beach to walk around, talk, and take it easy.`
`Our parents were apparently having a suspicious, complicated discussion, so we ended up leaving them behind.`
`...Well, just as I'd guessed from the start, the conversation focused on me, since I'd been away for six years.`
`"Still, you've really gotten tall.`
` I wouldn't call myself short, but your height really surprised me."`
`"That's right. I remember well what Battler-sama was like six years ago, but I was surprised even so."`
`"Yeah, seriously.`
` I can hardly believe this is the same Battler we knew back then."`
`"I'm surprised how much everyone remembers about it.`
` My memory's all hazy."`
`"Yeah, I'll bet.`
` Looks like it's taking you a while to remember us.`
` You know, that hurts a bit."`
`"Come on, this was six years ago, right?`
` I'm the one who has it bad, being forced to remember...!"`
`"...Are you saying that you can't remember well because it was six years ago?`
` I can remember it as clearly as if it happened yesterday..."`
`"Well, your memory's great, after all.`
` You remember the kind of things Battler did and said back then pretty clearly, don't you?"`
`"Come to think of it, that's right.`
` Shannon's memory can be incredible when you'd least expect it."`
`"Uu-.`
` I'm horrible at remembering.`
` I remember fun things, but can't remember boring things at all.`
` Uu-."`
`We all laughed, saying that everyone was like that.`
`"Shannon.`
` By the way, what was Battler like six years ago?`
` Remember any interesting episodes?"`
`"Let's see.`
` ...I'm sure that he said something like this when he left.`
` 'I'll be back, #fefefe<see you again>#ffffff.`
` I'll surely come for you riding a white horse'."`
`'!s0`
`stop iiiiiiiiit, so embarassiiiiiiiiiiing!!"`
`"Gyaaahahahahaha!!`
` Sounds just like something you'd say!`
` Yeah, I remember you always used to be full of those stupid lines, Battler!`
` Waaahahahhaha!!"`
`"Hahahaha.`
` It really does sound like something Battler-kun would've said back then."`
`"Uu-.`
` Embarrassing? Is that embarrassing?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` Horribly embarrassing...`
` Maria, I'm sure that when you're in middle school, you'll want to say embarrassing stuff like that...`
` When that happens, make sure you write it down and read it three times before saying it out loud.`
` If you don't, you'll definitely regret it..."`
`"Still, everyone has to pass through that pitiful period...`
` That's right, that's how you learn your place, learn shame, and become an adult.`
` Yeah, it's one of those bittersweet things everyone does in adolescence as they transition to becoming adults, a memory you just wanna forget...`
` Aarrggwaaahhh..."`
`After all, this was all stuff I'd let slip out without thinking, so I didn't remember the words exactly.`
`But now that those words were being recited to me, they were as embarrassing as all hell.`
`I only recently came to understand this weakness...and was working hard to avoid such careless outbursts, but...`
`...I guess I was just born with the habit of speaking without thinking, and there's nothing I can do about it.`
`"Shannooon, do you remember any other embarrassing stuff?"`
`"Yes, well... I remember a few other things, but...`
`since it looks like the person in question wants to forget them, I think I'll refrain from saying any more..."`
`"To be brutally honest, I don't remember this at all.`
` Please, don't make me remembeeer."`
`"...Uu-.`
` Shannon's bullying Battler...?`
` Uu-.`
` You can't.`
` You shouldn't bully people."`
`"Hahahahaha. She isn't really bullying him.`
` Let's leave it at that, okay?`
` But Shannon, you'll have tell me all about it sometime Battler isn't around.`
` It sounds pretty interesting."`
`"Yes, certainly."`
`"N-No, you can't, Shannon-chaaaaaaaaaan...!!"`
`For a while, George-aniki laughed at me, as though warming up for when Shannon-chan would tell him about more of my embarrassing misspeaks.`
`George looked like he was flirting with Shannon,`
` ...but he seemed somewhat open and frank about it.`
`He was always that way with his cousins, but he usually took on a reserved, gentlemanly attitude when he came in contact with the servants.`
`...When I thought about it, I got the feeling he was being a bit overly friendly, which seemed strange.`
`Maria started scribbling in the sand with a stick, and George-aniki and Shannon-chan joined in.`
` This left me and Jessica off to the side, so I asked her secretively.`
`"...Hey, Jessica.`
` Is George-aniki...umm, going out with Shannon-chan?"`
`"Ooooh?`
` What the, how'd you guess?!`
` Battler, you've got a keener eye for people than I thought."`
`"Huh, ...whaaaaaaat?!`
` I was just kidding, ...but they're actually going out?!"`
`"Shhh!`
` Your voice is too loud!`
` ...It looks like they're keeping it secret for now, okay?`
` It'd be better if nobody found out about it, especially Aunt Eva."`
`"I-I see...`
` Love with a servant, huh...?`
` ...Y-Yeah, but, since when?`
` Whew, I guess a lot can happen in six years...`
` But yeah, Aniki's an amazing person, and Shannon-chan seems to be kind and brave, `
`...so they might make a pretty good match."`
`Actually, six years ago, I remember taking notice of her just a little bit.`
`I see, she really fits well with George-aniki, nothing I can do about that.`
` ...Goodbye, my fleeting first love of six years ago...`
`......Which means that...the collection of embarrassing lines Shannon-chan had just held back on...`
`probably had something to do with that...`
` Aaaaaaaaaaarrghh, I can't take it...`
`"How long have they been going out?"`
`"That depends on what you call going out, but I think it's been at least a year.`
` But if you count the time they both had one-sided feelings, it'd probably be several years."`
`Before I'd realized it, the two of them had separated themselves from the group and were walking down the beach, talking about something.`
`...They looked calm, `
`and rather than a light relationship between two lovers, it looked like a more serious one, as though they were already engaged.`
`"...Six years ago, huh?`
` That's a long time.`
` What did those six years mean to me?`
` I've just gotten taller.`
` It was just a waste of time, six years I spent obstinately fighting with my dad."`
`"What about you, Battler?`
` You got a girlfriend?"`
`"Hmm, I wonder.`
` There's a few girls that I have fun with.`
` But there's no 'only one'.`
` ...I guess I'm just a kid.`
` I think it's more fun to be noisy with a large group of people than being alone with one person."`
`"Aah, that's so you, Battler.`
` But take your relationships with your female friends seriously.`
` When girls get wrong impressions or form a group, it can be scary, you know?`
` They might be having secret feuds over you behind your back, with people getting hurt or crying."`
`"That's so weird.`
` I think I remember getting the same bit of advice from one of the girls in my class just last week.`
` ...What's this all about?`
` Why can't everyone just have fun together?`
` Do people really want to couple up that much?"`
`"...It's probably because you've never found a partner like that, Battler.`
` Well, you might run into someone sooner or later.`
` You've just gotta wait patiently!"`
`"What?`
` It almost sounds like you've already found a partner like that.`
` What about you?`
` Have you gotten a boyfriend?"`
`"Huh?!`
` M-Me?!`
` No, err, wahahahahaha..."`
`"Come on, that reaction's so easy to understand...`
` From the looks of it, there's some boy you're thinking about, but you haven't been able to confess to him yet, something like that."`
`"N-No, umm, that's not, umm, uh!`
` Sh-Shut up, who cares about that...!"`
`"If you're the one who brought up this subject, why are you yelling at me now?`
` Women are creatures who always ask questions, and yet almost never answer them.`
` What cruel creatures, seriously."`
`"...W-Well, umm.`
` ...I did try...`
`to confess once.`
` Well, umm, I struck out pretty badly."`
`"Did you get an 'I'm sorry'?"`
`"No, umm, ...`
`...well, uh, my feelings were seriously one-sided, and they didn't really know how to respond, I guess...`
` It was like they didn't view me that way at all."`
`"Well, I can understand that.`
` You talk like a man, after all.`
` If you don't act a bit more graceful, you won't be able to catch a boy's interest."`
`"I-I-Is it really...`
` ...Is the way I speak...`
`really that bad?"`
`"...Hmm?`
` Well, umm, how you talk isn't everything, but when people like you, who usually have a rough style of speech, `
`suddenly start working hard to talk more normally... well, there are guys out there whose heart'll skip a beat when they see how determined you are."`
`"I-Is that really true...?`
` I see, `
`...yeah..."`
`Jessica suddenly started talking more meekly, and then her face instantly went slightly red.`
`...I see, even though her confession didn't go well, it looks like she still hasn't given up.`
`But still, I get it.`
`After seeing how close George-aniki and Shannon-chan have gotten, I also kinda want to find a girlfriend.`
`Six years.`
` ...Six years of puberty are pretty important, and they went by pretty fast.`
`As the typhoon approached, the clouds grew steadily grayer, but even so, I had this really refreshing feeling.`
`...Maybe I'll try thinking more seriously about the opposite sex, more than just the size of their boobs...`
`"By the way,`
` it looks like George-aniki's going out with a servant.`
` ...Don't tell me it's the same for you?"`
`"Huh, ...whaaaat?!?!`
` Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Why do you think that...?!"`
`"Come to think of it, that kid Kanon-kun, who greeted us in the rose garden...`
` You were covering for him pretty intensely, considering he was just a little awkward at talking."`
`"N-No, that's not...`
` Wahahahaha, now you're getting paranoid...!!"`
`"Then tell me just one thing.`
` Right now,`
` is the boy you're after within one kilometer of this spot?"`
`"W-Well about that, umm, ...I-I-I wonder..."`
`Kanon-kun was the only boy on this island now who could possibly become her boyfriend.`
`So, judging by her reaction, I was right on.`
`I didn't think of the Ushiromiya family as a noble family, ...but love with a servant...`
`I wouldn't have dreamed that two pairs of Romeo and Juliet would be right next to me...`
`Aunt Eva would probably become an obstacle to George-aniki and Shannon-chan's love.`
`If Aunt Eva ever learned that Shannon-chan was the partner of her only beloved son,`
` she'd probably scream at her for trying to steal away her precious George.`
`And a relationship between Jessica and Kanon-kun would probably be just as full of difficulties.`
`Aunt Natsuhi was also very strict about that kind of thing.`
`...After all, Jessica's husband would probably become the Head of the Ushiromiya family in the future.`
` If that person had once been a servant working for the family...well, things would get complicated.`
`"Well, love is different for every person.`
` As long as you're with someone who's fun to be around, does anything else matter?`
` When two people pair up, they don't need anyone's permission, as long as they accept each other.`
` Worrying about what your parents or family will say means you've already lost.`
` Don't forget that.`
` You'd better not go out with someone with mixed feelings."`
`"...Tch...`
` I can't believe you're saying something so philosophical-sounding when you haven't even been in love."`
`"Don't treat love like a matter of profit and loss.`
` It's about heart.`
` That's all I have to say.`
` Well then, `
`<see you again, have a nice day>."`
`"...Pfft, `
`...wahhahhahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` George nii-san, Shanno-n, listen, liste-n!`
` This guy, he's said another one of those lines!!"`
`"I didn't say anything, I didn't say anything!!`
` Waaah, don't make fun of me, don't make fun of me!!"`
`"Uu-, I heard it!`
` <See you aga-in>, <see you aga-in>!!"`
`For a while, we forgot that the wind was getting stronger and played around on the beach.`
`...I grew a lot these past six years...and being able to celebrate my youth and meet with all of my cousins was truly refreshing.`
`...It was a bit late now, but I realized that I should've gotten back together with everyone a lot sooner, and returned to the Ushiromiya family...`
`"It sure is nice to have all the cousins together every once in a while..."`
`"Uu-!`
` I like it too! It's really fun when all the cousins get together!"`
`"That's right.`
` We're already old enough.`
` It's not like we couldn't meet each other when our parents aren't around.`
` ...It might not be a bad idea to gather the cousins together and play every once in a while."`
`"That's a good plan.`
` Maybe we should set up something like that the next time we get a chance."`
`"Yeah, I agree.`
` I hope we cousins can stay friends forever."`
`"Hey, hey, if you make such a big deal of it, you almost make it sound like relatives usually end up hating each other."`
`"Hahahahahaha."`
`George-aniki and Jessica laughed, but it felt just a little strained.`
`...Did I say something wrong?`
`Judging by how our parents made quiet expressions and tired faces every once in a while during the boat ride and at the airport, maybe I should've kept that to myself.`
`"...You're right.`
` It's just like Jessica said.`
` Let's always be friends to each other."`
`"Uu-!`
` Me too!`
` We're all friends!!"`
`"That's right.`
` Yeah.`
` We'll always be together.`
` We'll always be friends."`
`"Heheh.`
` Man, we've been saying some pretty embarrassing stuff.`
` I feel kinda awkward."`
`"But I think it's very important.`
` People are creatures who find it very hard to stay together, much less remain friends, unless they truly desire it."`
`"That's right.`
` You really can't take everyone being friendly for granted."`
`"Uu-.`
` A witch I know said it.`
` Happiness won't be granted unless everyone believes in it."`
`"That's true.`
` Maybe some magic exists in the power of belief.`
` If we all believe in that, I'm sure it will bring us happiness."`
`"All right.`
` Well, if we're doing embarrassing stuff already...`
` Let's all swear to believe in this together, okay?`
` That we'll all always be friendly, that we'll always be happy."`
`Like hell we'll end up like our parents.`
`As if we'd ever search for each other's weaknesses, going after Grandfather's fortune...`
`"Okay!`
` We'll always be friendly and happy.`
` Let's all believe in that."`
`No matter how much we cousins tried to nostalgically have fun, dark clouds continued to approach Rokkenjima.`
`...I wonder if the typhoon will pass and let us see the clear skies before we leave this island.`
`Who cares about what our parents are planning?`
`Who cares about the inheritance and the honor of our old family?`
`As youthful as we were, we were renewing our old friendship.`
`And we all believed together that we could find happiness.`
`'!s0`
`I want this pair of days to end...`
`without anything weird happening, `
`in peace and happiness...`
`and calmly...`
`No, ...I don't just want them to end.`
`...Please, let them end...!`
`'!s0`
` Kyah-hahah-hah-hah-hahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"Damn iiiiiiiit!!`
` Don't show up, don't appear!!`
` Dammit, dammit, dammit!!"`
`"Sorry to keep you waiting.`
` I've finally prepared a new game.`
` Come, let us begin this tale of tragedy!`
` Come to me, winds, rain, typhoon!`
` Cut this island off from the real world!!`
` Throw Rokkenjima into another realm, into the spirit world, into a world of fantasy!"`
`And so, the tale repeated for the third time.`
`However, to an Endless Witch, `
`what did it matter whether it was the first, second, or third time?`
`It probably didn't matter at all.`
`After all, this was a tale of fantasy, endlessly repeating until the match was settled.`
` Would Battler surrender first, or would the witch?`
`Then the sky grew dark and cloudy, and the rain and wind were summoned together and became a typhoon...`
`Maria could be seen in the rose garden, paying no mind to the rain that had started falling,`
` going around in circles, searching for that single rose that should have been marked...`
`"......Not here...`
` Not here...`
` My rose...`
`that we marked...isn't here, `
`...uu-.`
` ......Uu-!!"`
`Maria definitely remembered it.`
`That rose had been in the flower bed right here.`
` And yet, it wasn't anymore.`
`She didn't know what to do with her irritation at not being able to find something that should've been there,`
` and, moaning bitterly, she couldn't help but keep going back and forth in circles around the same spot.`
`She was acting almost as though she'd be able to see it if she looked at a different angle,`
` but even though she did that, there was no way to find something that wasn't there...`
`The wind grew increasingly strong, and the rain turned into cold, large drops.`
`There was no way even Maria would fail to notice this.`
`However, if she couldn't find her rose here, it would surely disappear forever.`
`...Maria believed that.`
`That feeling spurred her on to keep searching for a rose that she had no chance of finding...`
`Just then, the cold drops of rain tormenting Maria were suddenly blocked.`
`".........Uu-?"`
`Maria raised her head.`
`...When she did, she saw an umbrella there, protecting her from the rain...`
`And the one holding out that umbrella was...`
`...the witch she admired, Beatrice.`
`"Beatrice...!!"`
`"What are you doing so frantically in the middle of all this rain?`
` You could catch a cold like this.`
` Even witches have to care for their own health."`
`"I...`
`...can't find...`
`my rose...`
` ...Uu-.`
` No matter how many times I search, `
`...even though it should've been here, `
`...I can't find it..."`
`Maria told Beatrice about how there had been a slightly unhealthy, pitiful rose,`
` and that she was sure they had marked it.`
`"Hoho.`
` So you can't find it.`
` ......If you are a witch's apprentice, you should use magic to search for the rose.`
` I believe that searching with just your eyes won't be nearly enough."`
`"...Uu-.`
` ...I can't find it.`
` ...I did my best and tried to search with magic, but I can't find it..."`
`"I think practicing your magic is a very good thing, but it might be a little too much for you with all this wind and rain.`
` ...Allow me to lend you some special power.`
` Concern for one's disciples is also one of a teacher's duties."`
`"Th-Thank yooou,`
` Beatrice!!"`
`Maria's face, which had been full of sadness until just now, split open into a grin.`
`Maria knew.`
`She knew that there was nothing Beatrice's magic couldn't do.`
`So she was sure that Beatrice would be able to find the rose easily, even though Maria couldn't...`
`Beatrice closed her eyes lightly, acting as though she was listening for something in all this wind and rain.`
` Then she heard it, opened her eyes, and spoke.`
`"......Hmm.`
` All things in this world are transitory.`
` Too bad, Maria.`
` ...It seems your rose couldn't withstand all of this wind and rain."`
`"Uu-...`
` Then, my rose......?"`
`"It was uprooted by the wind...and is no longer of this world."`
`".........Uu-..."`
`What Beatrice had said was quite reasonable.`
`...There was nothing odd about the flower being broken off at the stem in this strong wind.`
`...However, Maria couldn't accept this and bitterly gave a low-pitched moan...`
`"......No."`
`"Hoh?"`
`"...No, no, no!`
` It's my rose!!`
` My rose won't come back, no!`
` I'll bring it back to life with my magic.`
` Beatrice, teach me how to revive a rose with magic...!!"`
`"Ha!`
` It's much too early for an apprentice like you to learn the hidden art of Endless Magic.`
` Know your place."`
`".........Uuuuuu."`
`Maria wiped the tears from her eyes, full of regret.`
`Beatrice shrugged her shoulders and chuckled at Maria's pitiable expression.`
`"Very well.`
` I will lend you my power, the hidden art that can revive a rose."`
`"Really?!"`
`"Indeed.`
` ...Well then, concentrate the power of your heart.`
` Close your eyes, forget the rain, forget the wind, and search for the soul of the wandering rose with the eyes of your heart."`
`"...Uu-."`
`Maria closed her eyes.`
`Then, she repeated Beatrice's song-like words...`
`"Come, try to remember.`
` Rose, what form did you have?"`
`"...Come, try to remember.`
` Rose, what form did you have...?"`
`"Don't look.`
` Don't listen.`
` And believe.`
` ...Release the power of your soul from the cage of flesh that imprisons it.`
` ......That's it.`
` ...Good..."`
`Around Maria, who was concentrating her power, her eyes tightly shut, small golden butterflies began to dance.`
` ...Was this the manifestation of the magical power Maria held?`
`"Lost soul of the rose.`
` Gather into one, and remember your form.`
` ...Come, gather, remember..."`
`The glitter of the gold butterflies began to strengthen, and their numbers increased.`
` Then, Beatrice raised a finger up to the skies, and they began to gather at the tip of that finger...`
`This was the miracle of the golden magic...`
`The gold butterflies began to condense into a single dazzling grain of gold.`
` ...It was a single glittering gold seed.`
`It rode on the tip of Beatrice's finger, budded into a golden sprout, and opened into a golden leaf.`
`It then slowly fell from that fingertip, sank into the mud of the flower bed, and began to grow steadily...`
`...Maria, who admired magic and the witch, really wanted to see this fantastical sight.`
`However, as an apprentice, Maria was still not qualified to see it.`
`...No, she was probably afraid that, if she opened her eyes to look, the power that she had concentrated in her heart would be cut off, and the magic would be lost.`
`Therefore, Beatrice, as the only one permitted to witness this golden miracle,`
` was the only witch, the sole master of many miracles.`
`Then, the fully-grown rose bloomed, creating one golden flower.`
`And when Beatrice poked it with her finger in just the right way,`
` the gold-colored sparkle scattered, just as if a golden soap bubble had popped, and what remained was a single beautiful rose.`
`"...Hmm.`
` It looks like you've remembered a splendid rose.`
` ...However, if we just leave it mixed in with these other roses, you won't be able to tell it apart.`
` Shall I perform one last service?"`
`Beatrice, for the sake of her cute apprentice who was moaning even more now in concentration,`
` decided to use one more bit of magic.`
`When she snapped her fingers, a single gold butterfly appeared, fluttered around, and landed on the flower that had just been revived.`
`Then it suddenly burst open and disappeared, becoming golden lace and marking the rose...`
`"That will do.`
` ...Maria,`
` you may open your eyes now."`
`"......Uu-?`
` Where's the rose?`
` It's not here.`
` Not here."`
`"Not over there, over here.`
` ...Look.`
` I've marked it with golden lace."`
`"Wah, ...you did...!!`
` Awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome!!`
` Thank you Beato, thank you Beato!!`
` I want to become a witch quickly, a Great Witch like you!!"`
`"And you can.`
` Long ago, I too wished for that innocently, just as you do, and I have attained that level."`
`Maria was ecstatic over the revived rose, clapping her hands and jumping around in joy.`
`...Watching that, Beatrice also smiled, looking fairly pleased.`
`By now, I can break and repair any soul if I try, not just that of a rose, and kill and revive as I pleased.`
`Come, the barrier of the storm has now sealed Rokkenjima off from the natural world.`
`Now is the time for the Golden Witch, Beatrice, to descend as an Endless Witch.`
`Beatrice pulled from her pocket an envelope with the family crest, the One-Winged Eagle, and gave it to Maria.`
`Maria frolicked around at being selected to be the witch's messenger.`
`"So, Kinzo,`
` I've come to join in on your fun once more...`
` My preparations are already complete.`
` What of you?`
` Have you prepared enough coins to bet in tonight's game...?"`
`"Of course. I'm fully prepared, Beatrice...!!`
` I've assembled a plethora of pieces.`
` I'm ready both physically and mentally!`
` So then, let us make the ante.`
` All that you have given should be returned to you in the end.`
` Come, take it!!"`
`Kinzo flung the window of his study open wide, took off the valuable golden ring that had been on his finger,`
` and threw it into the darkness of the raging wind and rain...`
`That ring was struck by lightning, and after twinkling gold for an instant, disappeared.`
`Kinzo watched it go, grinning broadly and fearlessly.`
`"I don't think I'll lose.`
` You are mine.`
` Forever!!"`
`The ring that Kinzo had thrown became a single gold butterfly and fluttered around in the wind and rain.`
`It headed for the rose garden, almost as though it was being guided there.`
`It then found the figure of the Golden Witch and fluttered down...`
`When it came down right in front of Beatrice,`
` it burst open and returned to its original form, flying through the air.`
`The way it was going, you would've expected it to fall into a puddle, but it stopped suddenly in midair.`
`...Almost as if some transparent person had caught it.`
`Apparently, even Beatrice hadn't expected this.`
`However, she realized what...no, who it was, and grinned broadly at it.`
`As she did, the shadow of the person who had caught the ring began to fuzzily appear...`
`It was the figure of a young man wearing a butler's uniform embroidered with the One-Winged Eagle crest...`
`There was no man like this among the servants of the Ushiromiya family.`
` Even so, Beatrice laughed as though it was someone she remembered fondly.`
`"Ronove, is it?`
` ...It's been quite some time.`
` It seems you have remembered me.`
` You were always a man who took loyalty seriously."`
`"It has been quite some time since your last correspondence...`
` Not for a single day have I, Ronove, forgotten that I serve you, Milady.`
` I was more afraid that you had forgotten about me.`
` After all, you can be quite forgetful."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!`
` I see, yes, I certainly am forgetful.`
` I'd forgotten even your sarcasm until I heard it again."`
`"Milady, take this."`
`With an exaggerated yet elegant gesture, he bowed respectfully...`
`and held out to Beatrice the Head's Ring that he'd just caught.`
`"It is the Ushiromiya Family Head's Ring, returned to you from Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
` It is now once again in the possession of its Master."`
`"Indeed.`
` This is Kinzo announcing the start of the game.`
` Of course I'll accept it."`
`"So, how shall we play tonight?`
` Shall I prepare the roulette immediately?`
` Or shall I prepare some black tea first?"`
`"I can't decide which, but first, I need you to greet someone.`
` I'm sure that guy's got his mouth hanging open and can't shut it.`
` Right, Battler?"`
`"Greetings.`
` Allow me to introduce myself.`
` I am called Ronove, and I serve at the side of Milady Beatrice.`
` It is truly a pleasure to meet you."`
`"See?`
` His mouth's hanging open and he can't shut it, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Yeah, no shit, another incomprehensible guy just showed up!!`
` First I grumble about goat-headed people doing the Bon dance, and then goat-heads start showing up in swarms,`
` and since then, not only have those seven ass nee-sans appeared, but now there's even a butler!!`
` It doesn't make sense, cut it out!!"`
`"By the way, Battler,`
` did you notice?`
` Did you realize that meeting him is a true 'Devil's Proof'?"`
`"A-A Devil's Proof...?!`
` What do you mean...?"`
`"He may not look like it, but this guy's one of the 72, a genuine demon.`
` In other words, I've brought a demon right in front of you, which truly proves that they exist.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Ronove holds a noble rank in hell, the 27th highest-ranked Great Demon.`
` He's a pretty useful man.`
` I summoned him at high cost and made him serve me."`
`"It is an honor to meet you.`
` While my name is amongst those of the nobles of hell,`
` I now serve as the head furniture of Beatrice-sama, who despite being a vulgar human, is a Great Witch of such caliber that demons flee before her."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* He's a very useful man, but he's impudent with his words.`
` Frustratingly enough, he sometimes forgets to respect his Master."`
`"Nothing in my contract specifies the manner in which I am to speak.`
` Would you like to change that contract?"`
`"It keeps me entertained, so it's fine.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`Beatrice turned her back to him, cackling.`
`After bowing once to her back, Ronove turned back to Battler and stuck out his right hand, showing off an innocent smile.`
` Normally, this would mean that he was asking for a handshake.`
`"...Wh-What is this supposed to be?"`
`"I am another who has been subjected to Milady's whims.`
` In that sense, I am sure we could become good friends.`
` This is a handshake of friendship.`
` ...Of course, this in no way implies your entry into a contract with a demon, so fear not."`
`"Sorry, but I'm right in the middle of a big fight with your master.`
` I only shake hands with an enemy after we've beaten each other up in a rainy schoolyard and are all worn out, like something you'd see in a teen drama.`
` Remember that."`
`"I see.`
` To shake hands with you, Battler-sama, I must create a fitting atmosphere in a suitable location,`
` exchanging sweet words and physical language with you that rings true to your heart.`
` When the opportunity arrives, I shall arrange for such an encounter."`
`"I must say, I simply lo-ve situations like that myself.`
` Pu ku ku ku...!"`
`As Ronove laughed tauntingly, he whispered to Battler, bringing his face so close that their noses were almost touching.`
`Battler, his face turning red after getting so close to another of the same sex, pushed him away.`
`"Y-You're a creepy bastard...`
` I see, just right for Beato's butler..."`
`"It is an honor to receive such words of praise.`
` I'm very confident in my tea brewing abilities, so please look forward to tea time.`
` Baking cookies is one of my hobbies, so please feel free to request any snacks you may desire."`
`"Just what I'd expect from a pair of the same gender.`
` You've started getting along well right off the bat.`
` I'm jealous."`
`"My, my.`
` I apologize for making you jealous, Milady.`
` I shall not sneakily snatch your guest away from you."`
`"Well then, I will leave for now to retake my post as head furniture and greet my subordinates.`
` Please forgive my short absence."`
`"Indeed.`
` Only the common goats and the Seven Sisters used for the ceremony have manifested themselves.`
` You will be able to finish greeting them in no time."`
`"Oh?`
` Those lively Seven Sisters are here?`
` I wonder if those naughty girls have grown a little more graceful?"`
`"...Ihihi.`
` If that's graceful, I'll have to doubt the definition of the word graceful."`
`"Is that so?`
` Then I suppose you've already had the opportunity to play with those sisters.`
` Judging by your expression, it would seem they're just as naughty as always.`
` Even though I am always telling them to act more fitting as servants of Beatrice-sama.`
` What troublesome kids..."`
`"If that's your problem, don't worry.`
` They actually act perfectly fitting for their master..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Now even you have begun to say it!`
` However, a conversation means that you accept your partner.`
` The fact that you've started to respond to my idle chatting proves that you are gradually starting to accept my existence."`
`"Heh.`
` That's because, even if the sun starts rising from the west, I will definitely, absolutely never accept that you're a witch.`
` You might wanna try a more positive approach, like crying and kissing my shoes."`
`Even if Battler was bluffing, he still spoke forcefully, a fearless expression on his face.`
`The witch and her butler snickered together, realizing that their guest had regained more than enough of his willpower to attend to a new game...`
`and that preparations were complete...`
`After Ronove exchanged a few words with Beatrice, he bowed silently to Battler, scattered into several gold butterflies, and disappeared.`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` It is truly pleasing to have such a boisterous atmosphere.`
` ...How boring were the days when I was trapped alone on this island, unable to regain my power and lacking anyone to talk to..."`
`"...I get how that unpleasant guy is really fitting as your butler.`
` ...But tell me.`
` Why has that butler only appeared now?`
` You said something about how only the goats and the nee-chans of the Seven Stakes had manifested themselves.`
` What did that mean...?"`
`"Indeed.`
` You still resist, but I am a fully-fledged witch.`
` I am in contact with several nonhuman entities in the spirit world."`
`"I'll bet.`
` No sane people would hang out with you.`
` First some goat monsters, then those ass nee-chans, and this time a demon butler's showed up.`
` ...I hate to think about it, but the way things are going, I wouldn't be surprised if even more weird people appeared..."`
`"Hahahaha!`
` Among the furniture that work at my great golden mansion, how many demons do you think want to come over and play?`
` They will keep coming.`
` Many of them will appear."`
`"When the door to the Golden Land is opened, I will call back all of my furniture and build my new castle here on Rokkenjima.`
` Then I plan to invite all of my old friends, and we will drink and dance together for three days and three nights."`
`"...Of course, I also plan to invite Kinzo's family, you see?`
` You too, if you wish.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"...So is this what you mean?`
` That, since you lost your power for a long time, you couldn't summon them?`
` ...And then, since your magic power has been gradually increasing, `
`you've become able to summon more and more monsters?"`
`"It is as you say.`
` You stopped a hair's breadth before crumbling, `
`but your heart is already wavering, and you are unable to deny that I am a witch.`
` That wavering in your heart has been slowly restoring my power as a witch."`
`"So, are you trying to say that creepy butler appeared...`
`because I started to surrender?"`
`"That's right.`
` Bit by bit, you are surrendering to me...!`
` Isn't all that humiliation you suffered in the last game a result of you submitting to me so deeply?`
` Wasn't it great when you had to sacrifice your back for the sake of my feet?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"...D-`
`Dammit, `
`...I thought I'd be able to keep things as they were, as long as I didn't accept you.`
` ...But it looks like that was wrong."`
`"Correct.`
` The closer you get to surrendering, the more the game will swing in my favor.`
` Isn't chess the same?`
` In the process of cornering each other's kings, we trade several pieces.`
` Of course, I still haven't cornered your king."`
`"...And furthermore, you're giving it everything you've got just to help your king escape, and have lost several pieces to me, as well as a large advantage.`
` It is only natural that further developments will tend to turn in my favor."`
`".........Damn......"`
`"From now on, you will probably be frantic as you try to avoid my checkmate.`
` ...However, as you do, I will steal your pieces from you one by one.`
` In the end, you'll have lost everything but your king, and you won't be able to escape no matter how much you try. Then you will receive a true checkmate."`
`"...You were talking big last time, weren't you?`
` Something about how you'd never accept me and would torment me with eternal torture.`
` Only witches who have reached the endless level can talk about eternity.`
` That's been beyond you ever since the very beginning.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*, hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-ha!!"`
`"Kinzo-sama has already publicly displayed the location of the hidden gold within the epitaph under my portrait.`
` The rules apply equally to all who can read the epitaph.`
` If you discover the gold, I shall return everything to you."`
`"Tonight, I ask that you enjoy your battle of wits with Kinzo-sama to the fullest.`
` I sincerely pray that this night will be both intellectual and elegant.`
` --Beatrice the Golden."`
`When Maria finished reading the letter that Beatrice had handed her, everyone was at a loss for words for a while.`
`And then, they all broke the silence at once...`
`"R-Ridiculous.`
` What a worthless, vicious prank!"`
`"Seriously.`
` There is no way Father gave up the Head's Ring.`
` Beatrice?`
` Ha!`
` What a transparent prank, hoping to confuse us just by bringing up that name."`
`"Hey, hey, who filled this dessert up with a little too much punch?`
` I wanna applaud and praise you, so come clean, okay?`
` Rosa?"`
`"O-Of course not...!`
` I wouldn't pull a prank by assuming Father's name!"`
`"Then Aneki?!`
` Aniki?!"`
`"Me?!`
` Are you an idiot?!`
` It was Nii-san, right?!`
` Only he could plan something this vulgar!!"`
`"Are you trying to mock me?!!`
` I'm the one who wants to question you!`
` Who is behind this ill-natured prank?!"`
`Krauss beat the table and stared at everyone.`
`...Since that included the children too, he scared most of them...`
`"...A letter from a mysterious person who claims to have been given full rights to Father's assets.`
` Considering that the whole point of this family conference is the discussion of that subject,`
` ...I think it's too hasty to call this a mere prank."`
`"We can't be sure.`
` Maybe it really is one of Father's shady pranks...`
` He might've planned this to shock us a bit, since we've been discussin' the distribution of his inheritance without him..."`
`"If Dad was the one who planned this,`
` ...then we can't take what Maria-chan just read aloud as a joke, right...?"`
`"...That's right.`
` If you interpret the contents literally, ...then this is a test from Father.`
` The epitaph of the witch has been displayed in the hall for quite some time now, so that any one of us could solve it.`
` There was plenty of notice.`
` That means he was saying that the first person to solve it would be handed the inheritance along with all of his wealth, right...?"`
`...See?`
` My magic granted your wish...`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, nat_3e4:`
`"Well, doesn't this letter shake that?!`
` This is a message from the person who was given full rights to all of Father's wealth!`
` Nii-san's right to become the Head has returned to a blank slate.`
` The person who solves the riddle...`
`the person who finds Beatrice's gold will become the next Head of the Ushiromiya family!!"`
`"Ridiculous...!`
` Do you think we can trust the meaningless words in that letter?`
` That the seal was the real thing?`
` There's no way we could trust that!!"`
`"Then let's try to go and ask Father directly!`
` At this point, you can't get away with saying he's grumpy or feeling bad, right?!`
` The sealed wax clearly shows that this was from Father's representative!`
` If you doubt that, then show some proof, Nii-san.`
` Show that this letter does not contain Father's will!!"`
`"V-Very well.`
` It is just as you say.`
` It no longer matters whether Father's in a good mood or not...`
` Let us go up and ask him directly."`
`"Let's do it.`
` We'll ask Dad directly.`
` Dad is Dad, so why would he act in such a roundabout way?`
` Then again, I guess that would be like him!"`
`"I-I wonder if we really should continue this discussion on the assumption that this letter came from Father..."`
`"Stupid Rosa!!`
` Isn't it obviously from Father?!`
` That letter is Father's!!`
` Isn't it obvious that he's giving the four of us an even chance to become the Successor?!!`
` Die, you brainless idiot!!"`
`Rosa really is dumb.`
` If only she'd just give up and die...`
`"I-I'm sorry...!`
` Th-Th-That's right, `
`I'm sorry..."`
`In the beginning, the adults had all doubted the credibility of the letter,`
` but after realizing that this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance in the inheritance struggle for the three younger siblings, Eva changed her position, claiming that the letter was authentic.`
`Rudolf and Rosa caught on and agreed.`
`"Outrageous!!`
` How can adults like you take such a worthless prank this seriously...?!`
` I don't need to be Father to understand his contempt!!"`
`"Whoa, whoa, whoa!`
` Natsuhi-san, all we've gotta do is ask Father and we're done, right...?!`
` Won't everything be fine if Father just tells us that he doesn't know about any letter?"`
`"Nii-san,`
` take responsibility and just get him to say that he doesn't know about the letter.`
` This is no time to get scared just because he's in a bad mood, okay?!"`
`He's still scared of Father at his age, that idiot.`
` If only he'd just give up and die...`
`"Y-Yeah!`
` Let's get this settled clearly.`
` He's probably eating in his study right now.`
` Let's have him set down his chopsticks for just a moment...!"`
`"It's decided.`
` Let's go!`
` Kyrie, wait here for a while.`
` We'll go to check whether it's true or not and come back quickly."`
`"...Thank you.`
` I'll wait patiently for Gohda-san to bring in dessert."`
`The four siblings, Natsuhi, and Hideyoshi all rose from their seats forcefully and flew out into the hallway with a clatter.`
`Afterwards, only the children, stunned completely speechless, Nanjo, who looked uncomfortable,`
` and Kyrie, who just shrugged, were left.`
`In the middle of all of this was Maria, who looked a little scared at the adults' sudden change.`
`...However, judging from her appearance,`
` she didn't look like she realized the full meaning of what she'd just read.`
`"...What in the world...was that all about...?`
` I don't get it..."`
`"...They're all bastards.`
` Do they really want the inheritance that much...?!"`
`"......Everyone,`
` this is our parents' problem.`
` It has nothing to do with us.`
` So you mustn't worry about it."`
`"Even if you say that, `
`...they were so blatant about it..."`
`"I can't believe them...!`
` Showing off their greed like that...!"`
`"Uu-!`
` Everyone has to believe together that we'll be happy!`
` Uu-uu-!"`
`"...That's right.`
` We all did promise.`
` Come on, Battler-kun, Jessica-chan, you too..."`
`"......Haah."`
`"...I feel horrible..."`
`We couldn't accept it at all, but we laid down our arms for the time being.`
`...We'd been vaguely aware of how filthy this family conference was going to be.`
` ...However, after that six-year blank, I couldn't help being shocked...`
`When he saw that the children were completely dejected, Doctor Nanjo cleared his throat uncomfortably.`
`"...It's an adult matter.`
` It has nothing to do with all of you young people.`
` Let us forget about it."`
`"I would if I could...!"`
`"I know it's hard.`
` But forget it for now.`
` ...All of your parents are fighting frantically to make your futures just a little brighter.`
` Please, don't look at your injured parents with those cold eyes when they come back."`
`".........`
`No matter how much you ask us, Kyrie-san, `
`...that'll be tough."`
`"If we could be happy with an explanation like that,`
` ...we wouldn't be kids..."`
`"Uu-!`
` Everyone, be happy-!!`
` Can't get da-rk!!`
` Belie-ve!`
` If everyone doesn't believe we can be happy, that happiness will get away!`
` Everyone has to believe!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"...I like the sound of that.`
` I'll believe too.`
` I'll believe we can find happiness."`
`"Uu-!`
` Aunt Kyrie, thank you!!`
` Battler and Jessica, you believe too!`
` Beatrice is also always saying that magic won't have any power if you don't believe.`
` Uu-!"`
`Kyrie-san rose from her seat quietly, went over to Maria, and crouched down so that their eyes met.`
`"...Uu-.`
` Aunt Kyrie believed.`
` Now, Battler and Jessica have to believe."`
`"Those two are strong.`
` They'll feel better soon, and then they'll believe."`
`"Yeah."`
`"More importantly, `
`......I want you to tell me something."`
`When Kyrie-san said that, Jessica, George-aniki, Doctor Nanjo and I all listened closely.`
`...It looked like our parents were so concerned with the inheritance problem that Grandfather filled their minds,`
` but we wanted to ask Maria about something simpler.`
`"Uu-?`
` What?"`
`"Who gave you that letter...?"`
`"Beatrice!!"`
`"The witch drawn in that portrait...?"`
`"Uu-!`
` She gave me this letter and an umbrella!`
` And she used magic to fix my rose that was broken!`
` Beatrice is an awesome witch who can do anything!!"`
`"......Could you tell us about that in a bit more detail...?"`
`Without even being allowed to wait for dessert, we were chased out of the room.`
`I heard that, in the end, our parents were unable to get Grandfather to respond.`
`...Well, I hate to say it, but I feel like giving Grandfather a high five right now.`
`He was probably pretty satisfied with how his strange letter had given his children a good shock, since they'd all been so infatuated with the inheritance problem while Grandfather was still alive.`
`I also felt like our despicable parents had gotten what they deserved in all of this confusion.`
`...But I couldn't really say that I was feeling great.`
`I felt all sulky.`
`Apparently, Grandfather hadn't seemed concerned with the whole thing, but he also hadn't denied anything about the letter either.`
`When talking about the witch's letter, Grandfather's name kept popping up.`
`If Grandfather knew that someone was stealing his name, then considering his character, he'd probably be mad with rage.`
`But even though Grandfather now knew the contents of that letter, he coldly ignored it.`
`So, did that count as a silent yes?`
`Aunt Eva and Dad were trying to interpret the letter in their favor, their greed clearly visible.`
`It wouldn't have mattered so much if that was all, but the adults had now started focusing on Maria, who had received the letter.`
` They kept pounding her with questions about who had given it to her.`
`Maria repeated over and over again that she had gotten it from Beatrice, but there was no way such a mysterious person could've sneaked onto the island.`
`...After all, this island's small, and there's no one living on it outside the Ushiromiya family household.`
`Maria kept repeating that she'd gotten it from Beatrice no matter how many times she was asked.`
`The adults seemed to think she was trying to trick them, so they didn't hold back and questioned her until she broke out in tears...`
`When Maria was released, she sobbed, all worn out from crying.`
`After our parents ordered us to go to the guesthouse and take Maria with us,`
` they shut themselves up in the dining hall and started getting louder and louder as they discussed the inheritance.`
`It seemed that, because of that strange letter, Uncle Krauss's chances of becoming the next Head might've been reduced to a blank slate,`
` and in exchange for accepting him, my dad and the rest were trying to swindle Uncle Krauss out of a lot of money...or something like that.`
`Disgusted as we were, Jessica and I were happy to move over to the guesthouse.`
`We didn't want to be under the same roof as those filthy adults, their heads so filled with thoughts about money.`
`George-aniki pleaded on our parents' behalf, saying that he wanted us to understand them.`
`...I understood his reasoning.`
`No matter how filthy this talk of money was, it wouldn't go away if you just closed your eyes to it.`
`But even so, how could they sink so low as to overtly fight over the money of the dead...?`
`Maria had cried herself dry and was hiding in her bed.`
`She hadn't even twitched for a while, so she was probably sleeping...`
`"......Who in the world gave that letter to Maria-chan?"`
`"George nii-san,`
` you can't ask her that anymore.`
` Isn't it fine to say that Maria got it from Beatrice and leave it at that...?"`
`"After all, we don't want to make her cry any more than this."`
`...Even though we said that,`
` we couldn't clear away a gloomy feeling.`
`"There are only 18 people on this island now.`
` The thought that, somewhere in the rain, a 19th person gave Maria-chan that letter and is now hiding somewhere...`
`doesn't seem realistic at all."`
`"Most likely, ...somebody got Shannon or someone to put on the dress from that portrait...and cleverly got Maria to go along with their story."`
`"...Though, in Maria's case, just seeing the dress would probably convince her that it really was Beatrice."`
`"Maybe it doesn't really matter who handed her the letter.`
` The important thing is who sent it.`
` ...The point is that Grandfather wanted to cause an uproar by assuming the name of the witch.`
` Seriously, that old geezer's good at riling people up."`
`The most likely answer is that our occult-loving Grandfather was playing around, `
`handing the letter over to Maria, who shares the same hobby as he does, in such a dramatic way.`
`...Though, he failed to give any thought for what Maria would have to go through, making it a pretty shitty thing to do...`
`"Seriously. Messing around with Maria's pure heart...`
` It doesn't matter who handed the letter over.`
` Maria says she got it from Beatrice, so let's treat it that way."`
`"I agree.`
` Let's do that.`
` To Maria-chan, Beatrice is kind of like what Santa Claus is to most kids."`
`"Whether we're dealing with some nonexistent 19th person or Santa Claus,`
` as long as we all acknowledge them, they'll at least 'exist' inside Maria.`
` ...I see, guess it can be important to lie to a child to protect their dreams."`
`"......Hmm?`
` What's up, Jessica?`
` Are you still angry?"`
`Jessica had her hand on her chin, as though there was something that she just couldn't understand.`
`When I called out to her, she came to her senses.`
`"Aah, ...sorry.`
` Well, ...actually,`
` ...I was wondering if Maria might've actually met Beatrice."`
`"...What do you mean by that?`
` Are you saying there's a 19th person on this island?"`
`"If you truly take Maria-chan's words to heart, then you would arrive at that answer."`
`"No, that's not what I mean.`
` ...I'm talking about the story that someone we don't know has been living on this island since long ago."`
`"Living, you say? Where?"`
`"...In the forest."`
`The adults were gathered in the dining hall, spending a very long time continuing the discussion that had been started by Beatrice's letter...`
`Krauss strongly claimed that the letter was a simple prank,`
` but he couldn't overturn the claim that Kinzo's failure to deny the letter was answer enough.`
`Judging by Kinzo's character, if he knew that a letter had been written in his name, he would be mad with rage.`
`Since all of the siblings knew that, Krauss had no choice but to withdraw his claim.`
`Without even having to summarize it, the contents of the letter were simple.`
`The person who could solve the witch's epitaph would receive the Headship and assets.`
`This did a lot of damage to Krauss, who had been sure that he would receive the Headship,`
` and was better news than the rest of them, who had already given up, could have hoped for.`
`However, there were some points that worried them.`
`'The person who solved the epitaph' was not limited to a member of the Ushiromiya family.`
`Taken literally, anyone, no matter how doubtful their origin, might receive the Headship.`
`And furthermore, this meant there was a chance that all of the Ushiromiya family's assets would be stolen by some unknown person.`
`In that sense, it was definitely not a situation where even the other siblings could afford to lower their guard.`
`Had this letter come from an assassin sent by Kinzo, calling themselves Beatrice?`
` ...Or was this the scheme of some unknown person trying to steal the Ushiromiya family's wealth?`
` They still didn't know the truth.`
`...But they could say one thing for certain.`
`'!s0`
`received this problematic letter...`
`today, on this island.`
`In other words, someone planning something to do with that letter was on this island today.`
`...Had it been set up by Kinzo, one of the four siblings,`
` or maybe some unknown person?`
`No matter how much they suspected each other, they couldn't reach a conclusion.`
`After getting tired of bickering with each other, `
`they finally reached the extremely obvious conclusion that doubting each other was just a waste of time...`
`"...We've made no progress.`
` We've just been spinning our wheels."`
`"That's right.`
` And the mere fact that you've realized it means we won't have to waste any more time."`
`"It is not certain that Father sent the letter.`
` My husband is merely exasperated by your inability to hold a conversation."`
`"Who's unable to hold a conversation?`
` You keep yelling at me every time I say something.`
` Do you truly think that such shameful behavior is fitting for a member of the Ushiromiya family?"`
`"Would you give it a rest, Eva?`
` You too, Natsuhi-san.`
` That topic's finished for now."`
`"Sh-Shall we all cool our heads off for now?`
` Let's have some cool drinks brought over."`
`"That sounds good.`
` It would probably be wiser if we cooled our heads.`
` Don't you want to take a short break too, dear?"`
`"...Aneki looks like she's in a bad mood,`
` so I'll pass on that break.`
` But I agree about the cool drinks.`
` Rosa, have someone bring some water.`
` A whole pitcher."`
`"Yes, understood..."`
`Rosa headed over to the extension telephone in a corner of the room and called the servant room.`
`She then passed on what Rudolf had told her to the person on the other end.`
`The vicious bickering up until now vanished as though it had been a lie.`
`That silence continued until Gohda finished setting the table and retreated from the room...`
`"......Is there anything else that you require?"`
`"No.`
` Please leave us."`
`"Yes.`
` ...Then if you will excuse me.`
` If you need anything, call me at any time."`
`After listening to the sound of Gohda's footsteps disappear off into the distance, everyone took a deep breath at the same time to break the tension.`
`"...It sure is raining hard.`
` I wonder if this 19th person is taking shelter in the rose garden arbor about now."`
`"I-I wonder.`
` ...They might be able to escape the rain there, but it would be quite cold."`
`"...A mysterious 19th person as a visitor.`
` Sounds pretty interestin', just like a mystery novel.`
` Normally, in that kind of story, it's a safe bet that the person doesn't exist, that one of us 18 would be fakin' it."`
`"...I suspect Genji and the others.`
` Just as I thought, it would have been better if we had dismissed all of the servants of the One-Winged Eagle, no matter what excuses we had to make."`
`"Come now, don't say that.`
` We must be grateful for their long years of service.`
` ...Of course, we can't let our guard down."`
`"I'm sure you agree too, Nii-san, that whether or not Father was behind this,`
` the person who handed Maria the letter was a servant."`
`"Indeed.`
` In any event, we were all being 'friendly' in our big happy circle until dinner, weren't we?`
` All of the siblings have alibis.`
` Only a servant could have handed Maria that letter."`
`"...But all of the servants...`
`said that they were too busy with the bed-making to have any spare time during which they could go to Maria-chan in the rose garden...`
`........."`
`"Hey hey, what are you trying to say then?`
` You aren't saying that the witch of the forest, Beatrice-sama, came over and actually handed Maria that letter, are you?"`
`"Ahahaha.`
` Rosa, you used to believe in that so much, it really frightened you, right?`
` Don't tell me you still believe at this age.`
` In the witch of the forest."`
`...If she did exist, I'd love for her to appear.`
`But no matter how much I wished, she didn't appear before me even once.`
` She didn't save me from my crisis...`
`"O-Of course not...`
` I just thought that since all 18 of us said we didn't do it, there might really be a 19th person..."`
`"That can't be. In the first place, we were the only ones who came in on that boat.`
` We didn't see any mysterious stranger ridin' with us.`
` You don't think they coulda swam across this rough sea, right?`
` I can't really imagine it.`
` Wahahahahahaha."`
`"...Logically, that's true.`
` It is difficult to imagine that there's a single hidden and uninvited guest on this isolated island...`
` ...However,`
` ......it looks like some of us still can't abandon the possibility completely, right?"`
`Hideyoshi had laughed it off, saying there couldn't be a 19th person,`
` but Kyrie had sensitively picked up on the delicate atmosphere among the four siblings.`
`In a normal situation, there shouldn't have been any uninvited guests on this small, isolated island.`
`How would they have come here, and from where, and where were they hiding?`
`And why hadn't they appeared openly, even though they had sent a letter in their name?`
` ...Nothing could explain that.`
`But not only had the four siblings not joined in on Hideyoshi's laughing,`
` they also seemed unable to completely deny in their hearts the possibility of a 19th person...`
`"Kyrie-san,`
` please don't misunderstand. It's not as though we believe in anything like that fairy tale-like legend of the witch."`
`"...Is this another topic to insult Father?`
` Simply speaking of such a thing is a betrayal against him."`
`"*giggle*giggle*`
` I wonder.`
` ...However, this is Father we're talking about.`
` It could be possible, ...right?"`
`"......I-I don't know anything..."`
`"What's this, what's this?`
` Why's everyone gotten so gloomy...?`
` What are you talkin' about?`
` ...In short, the legend of the witch isn't a joke, ...but a fact?`
` That's ridiculous!"`
`"Hahahaha.`
` Of course, nobody believes in some witch riding a broom and flying in the sky.`
` ...But the woman in that portrait,`
` ...Beatrice, might really have existed on this island."`
`"......Hideyoshi-san,`
` it looks like we aren't talking about a witch, but something a little simpler.`
` ...So, it must be something like this."`
`"Everyone suspects that Father had a mistress named Beatrice secretly living somewhere on this island.`
` ...Is that it?"`
`"Father was always exemplary at keeping strictly to the rules!`
` It is completely inconceivable that he would bring something so filthy onto this island...!"`
`Natsuhi snapped at them immediately, but it looked like the four siblings, including Krauss, didn't agree.`
`...On the contrary, they appeared to think Kinzo wouldn't even have hesitated to do something like that.`
`From the beginning, it had been whispered that Kinzo had built a mansion on this island specifically because of the existence of an entrancing mistress...`
`"...I'm sorry, Natsuhi-san. I know how much you respect Dad, but that rumor's been around for a long time.`
` All the buildings on Rokkenjima were built by Dad on his own."`
`"...People've always guessed he had some contraption or secret room set up in this mansion that only he knew about,`
` and it's always been whispered that, hidden somewhere on this island, there's a secret mansion none of us know about."`
`"I see.`
` This island might look small on a map, ...but it's quite large for just the Ushiromiya family to live on.`
` ...So people have suspected that he built a secret mansion somewhere in the uncivilized forest for his mistress to live in?`
` That would be quite a large-scale scheme."`
`"In the beginning, people thought it might be somewhere inside this mansion.`
` ...That there might be a hidden basement, with a fabulous hidden room, where the witch in that portrait was secretly hiding.`
` ...After seeing that intricate auto-lock on Dad's study, it isn't too hard to imagine, right?"`
`"...After all, Father did spread the rumor that a large amount of gold was hidden somewhere by some mechanism.`
` I wouldn't be surprised if there existed some hidden room inside this very mansion that none of us knows about yet."`
`"When Mother was alive, she would often scour the entire mansion searching for Father when he wasn't anywhere to be found.`
` ...Mother also suspected what Rudolf just said.`
` She believed there was a hidden door or stairway somewhere, and that his blonde-haired mistress was hidden behind it."`
`It's hard to believe, but there are some actual examples in other countries of people cheating with someone over a period of several decades by making them live in a hidden attic room.`
`Furthermore, Kinzo had a mansion this extravagant.`
`...It was possible to suspect the existence of a hidden room...`
`"From what I've heard,`
` ...the legend of the Rokkenjima witch was just a fairy tale made up to scare children away from the uncivilized forest.`
` ...But it's starting to sound like there's a little more to the story."`
`"Well,`
` as you know, this is a lonely island without anything but the Ushiromiya mansion on it.`
` When Rosa and I were little brats, on stormy nights, we got so scared by the sound of trees rustling in the direction of the forest.`
` We had this crazy delusion that something weird might be looking out at us from between those trees.`
` It's only natural for a brat to think of stuff like that."`
`"...But when Rosa and I complained about it, some people figured it was more than a brat's imagination.`
` ...Isn't that right, Aneki?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` Nii-san and I thought you might've coincidentally spotted Father's mistress, living in secrecy on this island, as she went out for a walk when no one was looking.`
` Of course, Mother felt the same."`
`"...Even among the older servants, you often heard that ghost story about how the witch of the portrait wanders the mansion at midnight.`
` Outwardly, I laughed it off as just a ghost story, but on the inside, I suspected very much that it hinted at the existence of a hidden mistress."`
`"In that case, ......you're sayin' that the existence of a 19th person...`
`might not be completely ridiculous?`
` ...That they might actually be somewhere around here...?"`
`"......Sounds like one of those 'Devil's Proofs' Rudolf's always talking about.`
` ...It might be possible to prove that there is a 19th person, but it's impossible to prove that a 19th person doesn't exist.`
` ...Should we continue this discussion under the assumption that there's a person named Beatrice hiding somewhere on this island...?"`
`"That's a good plan, from the perspective of risk management.`
` It's probably much more prudent to say she might exist, rather than saying she couldn't exist."`
`"I-I see.`
` Sorry, I was a bit careless...`
` Rosa-san, sorry for laughin' just now..."`
`"Huh, ...ah, ...it's fine, I don't mind."`
`Hideyoshi apologized deeply for taking the worst-case scenario lightly, despite calling himself the president of a company.`
`Silence fell again.`
`Preparing for the existence of a 19th person...`
`would mean, in effect, acknowledging the presence of some unknown person hidden on this island.`
`And since this person might be planning something shady, `
`it was only natural that the conversation would turn in an ominous direction...`
`"...In the past, Father would sometimes suddenly disappear without telling anyone where he went.`
` After all, he is a man who values silence.`
` It wouldn't have been out of the ordinary for him to shut himself up in some library room after purposefully not telling anyone where he was going."`
`"...However, when the witch theory was slowly refined into the theory about his mistress, people eventually whispered that he was secretly going back and forth to see her."`
`"Mom was totally paranoid in her last years.`
` She'd sometimes suddenly start making a fuss, asking the servants to start looking for Dad immediately because of some urgent situation."`
`"...Yes, that did happen sometimes.`
` Mother was always doing things like that in her later years, and that frightening atmosphere still hasn't gone away.`
` ...I can say it for certain now.`
` She was a person to be pitied."`
`"So then, ...what happened with those large-scale searches of the house?`
` Did they find anythin'?"`
`"No.`
` Father wasn't caught foolishly in a hidden room even once.`
` Always, after a long time had passed, he would suddenly show up somewhere.`
` Then he'd say that he'd taken a nap in some library room, or that the wind had summoned him to take a walk on the beach."`
`"...But it was always some place where the servants had already looked.`
` ...We never knew where Father had gone.`
` Even at that time, Grandfather was famous for his occult inclinations,`
` so some of the servants exaggerated, saying that he might have turned into butterflies and danced around the rose garden."`
`"So in short, Father frequently disappeared, and no one knew where he went."`
`"Yeah.`
` Since we couldn't find him no matter how much we looked inside the mansion, we got more and more sure that Dad might've been somewhere outside.`
` But the area outside the mansion isn't large at all.`
` ...Which leaves only the forest."`
`"And if you tie that in with the legend of the witch, you get a theory like this:`
` Father actually built a hidden mansion somewhere in the forest,`
` inside of which a mistress by the name of Beatrice lived, and he sometimes went to see her."`
`"...I was also young at the time.`
` I was so eager to find where Father was having his affair that, at one time, I followed him when he went outside."`
`"...Of course, it was a failure.`
` Every time Father went out, he was oddly intent on avoiding places where he might be seen...and was extremely careful to prevent anyone from spotting him.`
` And, he was extraordinarly earnest in his attempts to do so.`
` But that actually made me sure.`
` He must have been going out for some reason that the members of his family couldn't know about."`
`"And that'd be going to meet his mistress.`
` Probably tryin' to avoid being seen."`
`After seeing Hideyoshi nod and say 'yes, yes' as though this was quite obvious, Eva got a little sullen.`
`"...Well, anyway,`
` this island was like a sketchbook in which Father, with his Western obsession, could draw out all of his dreams.`
` ...Everything about this island was exactly how Father wanted it.`
` It wouldn't be odd at all if there was a hidden mansion somewhere for his mistress to live in..."`
`Eva's words spoke for what all of the siblings had come to think.`
`For a while, the room returned to silence again, and everyone listened to the sound of the wind and rain...`
`...Was there a hidden mansion on this island, and had Kinzo's mistress been living there in hiding for a long, long time...?`
`Everyone thought they were being too suspicious, and they hesitated for a long time without speaking, `
`...but everyone shared a common opinion.`
`Kyrie, who had been listening the whole time with her eyes closed, spoke to no one in particular.`
`"...How long has this rumor about Father's mistress been around?"`
`"As soon as we moved to this island, about 30 years ago.`
` After all, it probably would've been impossible for him to have a hidden mansion built while we were here.`
` People and materials would have to be going in and out.`
` It would've been exposed quickly."`
`"So, if it was possible, it happened before we moved here.`
` ...It probably could've been built along with this mansion when we were still living in Odawara."`
`"Since Father had to set up a double life with his family and his mistress, it's probably reasonable to assume that he had it all planned from the beginning.`
` And his relationship with that mistress probably went back to the days when we lived in Odawara."`
`"Probably.`
` If, as Father says, she is the source of the vast amount of gold he used to gain the funds that resurrected the Ushiromiya family,`
` we could probably conclude that they had a close relationship since Odawara.`
` ...A relationship trusting enough for her to lend him a vast quantity of gold.`
` I can't even imagine how old that relationship must have been."`
`"......Perhaps Father gave her some kind of valuable advice for succeeding in business.`
` It's natural to think that, out of a sense of gratitude for that, this person gave Father the gold.`
` If you think about it that way, it's obvious that they would have a close relationship after that.`
` Rather than a festering relationship with a mistress, it was probably a relationship of gratitude to the person who saved the Ushiromiya family from its crisis."`
`"...I don't know if what Natsuhi-san's saying has a ring of truth to it or not.`
` But, even in that case, isn't building a hidden mansion and havin' her live in it going a bit too far?`
` Doesn't that mean they felt something a bit more than gratitude?"`
`"Well, this is all just speculation.`
` ...In the first place, no one's ever found that hidden mansion.`
` ...Aniki, you were planning on expanding this island into a resort, right?`
` As you were doing that, you didn't manage to stumble on it by chance, did you?`
` Maybe you even bumped into some gold there, too."`
`"...Hahahaha.`
` Do you think Rokkenjima is Treasure Island or something?"`
`"Don't play dumb.`
` ...We know that, although you say you're opening a resort, you have really been planning to investigate the entire island, right?`
` Judging by all that trouble and confusion we were talking about earlier, you haven't been very successful, have you?"`
`"I don't know what you're talking about, but it's a misunderstanding.`
` Isn't it perfectly natural that investigating this island would be the first step in turning it into a resort?"`
`Krauss tried to play dumb, but it was plainly obvious to his siblings, who knew him so well.`
`...Krauss was definitely sure of the existence of a hidden mansion.`
`And under the pretense of opening a resort, he had been closely investigating the island, searching for a clue as to the location of the hidden gold.`
`They couldn't tell whether that conviction was just him overthinking things, or whether it was based on some physical proof.`
`...Still, if Krauss, with all his guile, was sure,`
` that was enough proof for the other siblings to be sure too...`
`"...The story about a witch livin' in a forest is obviously a fairy tale,`
` but the story about some blonde-haired girl livin' secretly in a mansion no one knows about in the middle of the forest...isn't much better."`
`"That's right.`
` That really would be just like a fairy tale.`
` You like those, don't you, Rosa?"`
`"...Huh, ...w-well..."`
`"When the mansion was built on this island, Father was at the height of his prosperity.`
` With his money, he could probably obtain anything, make any of his wild imaginings real.`
` ...A mansion in the forest where a witch quietly waits...`
` ...It sounds like the kind of situation Father would like."`
`"...Doesn't it?`
` Like something from the occult or a fairy tale.`
` ...It feels like Dad's kind of hobby."`
`On this island, on which the Ushiromiya family had lived for 30 years now,`
` a hidden mansion that no one knew about had been quietly built to house a witch, about whom nothing was known except what could be guessed from a portrait...`
`Even this hastily thrown together theory...`
`might not be completely delusional, considering all of Kinzo's strange habits and his vast wealth...`
`"...It might not have been impossible for Father to build a hidden mansion to satisfy his dreams.`
` ...However, let's be realistic.`
` Would it be possible to house his beloved woman in that hidden mansion for decades without it becoming inconvenient...?"`
`"...Well,`
` if there was love, it could've been doable, right?"`
`"Think of the facilities needed to let his beloved woman live healthily.`
` ...And in a way that would satisfy Father.`
` For example, even if it was on a small scale, it would have to be an intricate and pleasant residence."`
`"And it would probably need to have...`
`'!s1`
`gas, `
`and running water maintained, `
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, kir_3e59:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kir_3e60:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kir_3e61:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kir_3e62:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kir_3e63:`
`"......When you say it that way, it sure sounds like a weak point in our theory.`
` ...But that isn't enough to get rid of my feeling that Dad might've been able to do it anyway.`
` After all, it's Dad we're talking about."`
`"That's right.`
` ...It's our Father."`
`"If Father wanted to succeed in an endeavor, he would succeed no matter what.`
` ...Saying that something would be difficult for a normal person and therefore impossible...doesn't apply when it comes to Father."`
`"Indeed.`
` You should never underestimate Father.`
` ...Father's madness can't be understood by normal people."`
`I wouldn't put it past 'that' Kinzo.`
`...As long as you stick to this phrase, a considerable amount of credibility can dwell in any absurd story.`
`However, that didn't cause the importance of what Kyrie had said to waver.`
`This was different from stealthily raising a kitten in a cardboard box and keeping it a secret from your parents.`
`Taking care of a person in secret over a period of 30 years would be an incalculably massive task...`
`"...After all, Father's Legend of the Gold started before he gained possession of Rokkenjima.`
` That'd mean his relationship with his mistress was over 30 years long...`
` How old would that make her?`
` In the worst case, she could be as old as us or older, right?"`
`"...By that age, the body starts to break down.`
` I don't care what the mansion's like, I wouldn't use the word 'agreeable' to describe livin' in a place where people's eyes can't reach, almost like she was under house arrest..."`
`"That's right.`
` ...If what Father told us about Beatrice is true, then that relationship has lasted for over 30 years.`
` ...She might've been a charming young woman at the time, but it probably makes sense to assume she's an old bag like us now.`
` I can easily imagine that, given the contents of that letter."`
`"You should talk.`
` Heheheh."`
`Krauss laughed as if none of this applied to him.`
`Of course, Eva was offended, but she didn't strike back.`
`"Quit it, Aniki.`
` ...So if everything we're thinking's true, then she should be joining in on Dad's inheritance problem with her head held high.`
` After all, ...there's a good chance their love was mutual, unlike with Mom.`
` Even if she knows she's his mistress, she might also be proud to be his true wife."`
`"......That is an insult to Mother."`
`"Yeah, sorry.`
` ...However, everyone knows that it was a political marriage decided on by the elders among his relatives.`
` ...Because of that, it definitely wouldn't be strange for Dad to have a mistress."`
`The family sank after the Great Kanto Earthquake, and Father was set up as the Ushiromiya Family Head against his will.`
`However, in the beginning, the elder relatives treated Kinzo like a dummy and influenced him powerfully, almost like he was a puppet.`
`He wasn't permitted to decide anything by himself, not even his marriage partner...`
`...Ever since he met that Golden Witch Beatrice in those distant days,`
` Kinzo's Legend of the Gold was quickly embellished into something dramatic.`
`'!s0`
`...it could mean...`
`that Kinzo really did find a woman he loved.`
`If she also knew the whole story, `
`even if they weren't marriage partners, it wouldn't have been odd for her to consider herself his true wife inside her heart.`
`...And now, the person registered as his true wife was already dead...`
`"...Which means she might feel confident staking her claim, not just for the rights to his assets, but regarding the battle over the Headship too."`
`"......I see.`
` I'm starting to see the purpose of this letter.`
` The Headship goes to the one who solves the riddle of the epitaph...`
` Is that what it means...?"`
`"Even if that mistress was added into the family ranking system, she isn't a direct relative of Father, so she'd be inferior even to the children.`
` ...In other words, she'd be one step below Rosa in rank.`
` That wouldn't be a good position to enter the battle for the Headship from."`
`"I see, so that's it.`
` ...If someone can solve the witch's riddle, they'll get the Headship regardless of rank.`
` In other words, it's the most advantageous condition Beatrice could possibly get, since she's got no chance otherwise."`
`The revival of the Ushiromiya family was made possible by the gold Beatrice had bestowed.`
`...That was quite a distinguishing service she had provided.`
`She had built that wealth together with Kinzo, so it was natural that she would think of herself as the one who should inherit it...`
` It would also be natural for her to despise the thought of giving it up to the children of the wife Kinzo never loved.`
`"H-How could she be so impudent...?!`
` Even if such a mistress actually exists, joining in on the battle for the rights to the Head's inheritance would be a reckless action far above her place!`
` What disregard for her own position...!"`
`Natsuhi turned red, her fist quivering.`
`...She had also come into the Ushiromiya register due to complicated circumstances.`
`Those who knew that understood more or less why she was so angry for the sake of Kinzo's dead wife.`
`"...Well, thanks to that reckless action of hers, we all have an even chance now, right?`
` Father has even given it his silent approval.`
` ...Will the person who succeeds the Ushiromiya family be his mistress Beatrice, or one of us, the relatives he doesn't love?`
` Maybe he wants to make us struggle over that to see who's worthy."`
`As Eva giggled roguishly, Krauss shrugged his shoulders and looked away.`
`"...However, since she's the one who brought this rule to light in the first place, `
`maybe that means it gives her a significant advantage."`
`"Th-That's right.`
` ...In the first place, if Beatrice meant that letter literally, then she's Father's alchemist.`
` In other words, she's the manager of his gold.`
` It wouldn't be strange at all if she knew where it was hidden, would it?!"`
`"Isn't that harsh?`
` It's like she's giving us a riddle she knows the answer to!`
` She'll probably show up rudely, say 'Hey, here's the answer, I'll take the Headship now',`
` and snatch everything away from us!"`
`"............`
`...That's right.`
` The person who brings up a riddle always knows the answer.`
` There's a good chance that this is all a trap to steal everything from us."`
`"...If you think about it like that, don't you start to doubt whether she really had any gold in the first place?`
` Why would she tell us about it?`
` All she has to do is keep quiet and embezzle it."`
`"It really is...`
`strange."`
`That certainly was the case.`
`If the epitaph showed the way to the hidden gold, why would she challenge them to try and solve it?`
` If they actually did solve it, wouldn't the gold all be stolen from her...?`
`Could it be that this person was trying to stir the siblings up so they'd solve the epitaph,`
` and then planned to steal it away at the last second...?`
` It was an extremely logical possibility.`
`"......No, `
`if you spin the chessboard around, there might be a pretty good chance that they actually do have the gold."`
`"Why are you so certain?"`
`"...Wait, Aneki.`
` ...Kyrie, please keep talking.`
` Why do you think that?"`
`"After all, do they really think we'll let go of the Ushiromiya Family Headship...`
`just because someone tells us the answer to the riddle in the witch's epitaph?`
` That we'll be so impressed by their answer...that we'll just give up?"`
`"...Well, `
`...that's true.`
` No way they're so naive that they assumed we'd just give up after being told the answer to a riddle, `
`that we'd just say 'Here you go' and hand it over."`
`"Of course.`
` The Headship of the Ushiromiya family is not something that can be handed over so easily!"`
`"That's it exactly.`
` No matter how Beatrice might one-sidedly propose a game like this, even if she were to spectacularly show us the answer,`
` there's no way we'd obediently hand over the Headship.`
` ...In other words, unless she has a compelling force in the form of challenging us to a game with equal conditions for us all,`
` this won't truly count as a game."`
`"You're right.`
` ...Unless the losers have no choice but to give up on the Headship`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~because of a compelling force~ib~`
`, this won't really count as a game."`
`"And what might this compelling force be?`
` Would they bind us in chains and threaten us into handing over the Headship?"`
`"......I see.`
` I get it.`
` ...They'd just have to do something to make us want to give up the Headship willingly.`
` Yes, I see.`
` ...To do that, Beatrice would have to own 10 tons of gold...!"`
`"I-I see, I get it too!`
` In other words, ...it's a trade?!"`
`"Huh?`
` Wh-What do you mean...?`
` A trade?`
` Trade what?!"`
`"The Ushiromiya Family Headship for the hidden gold.`
` ...Beatrice surely plans to tell us the location of the 10 tons of gold...and use that as a bribe to gain the Ushiromiya Family Headship."`
`'!s0`
`"They want to trade the Headship of the glorious Ushiromiya family for...m-money?!`
` That's blasphemy!!`
` Blasphemy against the Ushiromiya family!!"`
`"...Please listen without getting mad.`
` ...About how much wealth does this glorious Ushiromiya family have right now?`
` Are we really that affluent?"`
`"Th-The definition of affluence is not dependent on property.`
` It is about heart!`
` Our financial situation has nothing to-"`
`Krauss interrupted Natsuhi as she started to go on and on emotionally.`
`In this situation, the more she went on like that, the worse it would actually sound.`
`"...Me aside, I hear your current situations are...quite unfavorable."`
`"Oh, really?`
` I've heard that your financial situation's really bad too.`
` Offering up more and more as collateral for new money to gamble with.`
` Repeatedly dabbling in new gambles, unable to accept your losses.`
` ...If we count what's going on behind the scenes, you're in even bigger financial straits than the rest of us."`
`"Just how much money have you lost, Nii-san?`
`'!s0`
`"Wh-Who are you saying has no talent?!!`
` And what do you mean, financial straits?!!"`
`Natsuhi became indignant once more, but Krauss raised his hand again and interrupted her.`
`"...It seems you are making a small mistake.`
` Business is not something that can be judged based on current progress alone.`
` For someone with a long-term outlook on business such as myself,`
` it may sometimes appear at a glance that I have suffered significant short-term losses."`
`"Aniki,`
` we've been collecting evidence.`
` Your position right now isn't one to be proud of.`
` ...So this is what Kyrie's trying to say.`
` ...Every one of us has got money trouble.`
` And Beatrice has 10 tons of gold."`
`"...As the only person who knows the location of the 10 tons of gold, Beatrice is planning on using it to force us to sell the Headship.`
` ...About how much is 10 tons of gold worth?"`
`"At a rough estimate, ...let's say 2 billion yen?`
` ......No, 20 billion yen.`
` With that much piled up, we'd be ecstatic to accept her as the Successor."`
`The scene returned to silence.`
`In fact, the rain and wind felt even noisier now.`
`...It was probably the sound of the windstorm racing through the insides of their minds...`
`"......Th-This isn't funny.`
` ...To think we'd give up the Headship to some woman of doubtful origin...`
`...just because she had a little money stored up..."`
`"Don't be stupid...!`
` The Headship wasn't even yours in the first place, right...?!`
` We've got nothin' to lose and money to gain.`
` We'll have to calculate our profit and loss, but it's somethin' worth listenin' to...!"`
`They knew that Krauss had eaten up much of the Ushiromiya family's assets.`
`So, it was dregs that remained of that inheritance, ...versus 'the cost of being accepted as the Head' that Beatrice would pay.`
`It was a shame, but honestly, the former was less enticing than the latter.`
`"...Well, it probably wouldn't end up as four equal portions.`
` Since Aniki would be giving up his position of Successor, his portion would have to be larger.`
` ...Makes me feel kinda jealous, you know?"`
`"............"`
`"Dear...!`
` The amount of money isn't the problem, right?!`
` Your cowardly younger siblings are trying to sell the glory of the Ushiromiya family for money, don't you see?!`
` Why aren't you displaying your dignity as the oldest son?!"`
`"......Natsuhi, `
`stay quiet for a while."`
`"Dear?!?!"`
`"...This is a dizzying proposal.`
` ...We were each planning on getting 250 million yen out of Aniki.`
` If the witch treats us with ten percent of those 10 tons, `
`...ummm-"`
`"That's 2 billion."`
`"...Yeah.`
` That'd mean she's treating us with ten times our original goal.`
` That alone would be more than enough for us.`
` ...It's not like I've got any attachment to the Ushiromiya name.`
` I'd be happy to sell it off..."`
`"Even if 10 tons is a slightly optimistic figure,`
` ......yes, it'd still be a fascinating prospect for us.`
` ...We were trying to form an alliance among the siblings to kick this outsider called Beatrice out."`
`"...But, if this is her plan, `
`...it'll tear apart the unity between us.`
` ...Yeah, by this point we can state it clearly.`
` ...The goal of Beatrice's letter was to disturb our alliance."`
`If the three younger siblings, who never had anything to do with the inheritance,`
` were paid enough money to satisfy them, they would happily accept Beatrice as the next Head.`
`A moat had been dug all around Krauss.`
`In that case, the negotiations would be one-on-one between her and Krauss.`
`He tried to look strong, but Krauss's financial and political situation was extremely weak.`
`...He might bluff in front of his siblings, but on the inside, he was considering entering negotiations, depending on the sum of money involved.`
`In order to bury his losses, Krauss had taken advantage of the fact that Kinzo had shut himself up in his room...and had embezzled Kinzo's personal assets.`
`Therefore, when Kinzo died and the inheritance was distributed, Krauss's situation would probably be investigated.`
`But if he gave up his seat as the Head to Beatrice, `
`she would also receive rights to the assets, and as a result, the distribution of the inheritance to the siblings would not occur.`
`...In other words, Krauss' embezzlement might not have to be made known to the other siblings...`
`Of course, the siblings were frightened of Kinzo, but it was doubtful whether they still actually respected him as a father.`
`By this time, they each had their own families, their own wealth, and their own lives.`
`If they were paid enough money in exchange for Rokkenjima, the wreckage of Kinzo's dreams,`
` ...there was a significant likelihood that they'd relinquish the Ushiromiya family name...`
`In other words, Beatrice's victory was already guaranteed in this 'game'.`
`Not as the winner of 'Beatrice's game', `
`...but as the winner of 'Kinzo's game'.`
`...Kinzo once ordered that the epitaph be put on display.`
` And until today, no one had solved it.`
`So Beatrice 'solved' it.`
`In other words, this is less of a game and more like Beatrice's declaration of victory...`
`However, Kyrie still thought there might be a catch.`
`If this was a declaration of victory, Beatrice would only have had to display the gold openly and state her intent to buy the inheritance.`
`And yet, she had gone to all of this trouble, telling the siblings to try and solve the epitaph.`
` Why did she set up this 'new game', where she agreed to hand over the all of the gold and the inheritance to the epitaph solver?`
`Kyrie tried spinning the chessboard around several times.`
`...She searched for the sort of ideal strategy Beatrice might be after, something that could lead to this kind of thinking.`
`...In the end, ...she reached a single conclusion.`
`"......Could it be...`
`arrogance?`
` Or maybe...`
`she's playing...?"`
`"...What are you talking about?"`
`"The witch sent us a letter of challenge, forcing us to try and solve the epitaph.`
` She might be taking us lightly, thinking we could never solve it.`
` ...However, at the very least, there ought to be an extremely small chance that we do solve it."`
`"After all, we have here four of Father's children by blood, right?`
` The questioner called together four blood relatives who, if they tried frantically to work together and avoid having those assets stolen from them,`
` might come across the answer of the riddle by chance."`
`The reason the witch had a superior position in negotiations compared to the siblings...was that only she knew the location of the hidden gold.`
`But if that hiding place was exposed to someone other than her, the witch's advantage would crumble.`
`"In short, Beatrice gains nothing but risk by writing this witch's letter of challenge.`
` ...Of course, it might have had the effect of splitting apart the siblings' alliance,`
` but if that was her only goal, why would she take this risk, however slight it might be...?`
` That seems reckless to me."`
`"...But if we keep in mind a certain type of emotion, that risk becomes comprehensible."`
`".........`
`...And you're saying it's arrogance?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ...When people have an overwhelming advantage, they tend to get arrogant.`
` And when they do, they want to show off that advantage to the losers, so they sometimes take on small risks.`
` ...A moderate amount of risk adds a little spice to the joy of victory.`
` It'd be boring to win without any risk."`
`"......I understand.`
` I like that kind of thing too.`
` ...Yeah, I understand it well."`
`"I thought of a few plausible explanations for the true motive behind Beatrice's letter,`
` ...but I think this really might be the truth.`
` ...The emotion hidden behind that letter was...`
`...arrogance."`
`"......Arrogance."`
`"She's trying to throw her weight around, looking down on us, as if there's no way we could figure out such a difficult epitaph.`
` ...It might even be possible, if surprising, that the epitaph wasn't written by Father, but by her."`
`"...Sounds great.`
` ...Solve the riddle of the epitaph, she says?"`
`If only I solved it, I would be made the Head, right...?`
`...I'll solve it...`
` I'll accept the witch's challenge.`
`As if those other idiot siblings could solve it.`
`I'll solve it by myself, and then I'll prove that I'm the one who's fit to succeed the Ushiromiya family...`
`"I'll take that challenge.`
` ...I will...`
`solve the riddle..."`
`"...I see...`
` So she's not a witch, but a mistress named Beatrice, who lived on the island...`
` ...So there can be more than 18 people!`
` Which means I can defeat the line of reasoning that says any crime impossible for all 18 people must involve magic.`
` ...That's a big scoop."`
`"Pardon me.`
` Battler-sama, would you like some black tea and cookies?"`
`Beato's butler, who called himself Ronove, appeared out of nowhere.`
`A plate set on a silver tray that he held was filled with delicious-looking, steaming black tea and cookies.`
`...I really don't like this guy's smile.`
`For some reason, it doesn't look like a smile used to warmly greet a guest.`
`It feels like he's mocking me somehow.`
`...I don't know if he really takes me for an idiot,`
` or if it's just a joke or something, but it's really irritating me.`
`"...I don't need any.`
` I'm busy now.`
` Leave me alone."`
`"Oh, my.`
` Such a shame, and the cookies were so delicious too.`
` Cooked so wonderfully they would be wasted on a mere Human."`
`"I'll eat some when I feel like it.`
` Just set it down somewhere and get out of here."`
`"Will that be acceptable?`
` Then I shall do so.`
` You may eat them when they get cold and stale, and then regret to the fullest that you did not eat them while they were fresh."`
`"......You really are annoying.`
` ...Well, you're a lot better than that Beato, who keeps doing that creepy cackle right next to my ear."`
`"Yes, yes, that is quite true.`
` There are times when Milady's laughter becomes quite undignified.`
` Every time I hear it, I find it painful to comprehend `
`why such a noble demon as myself must serve such a Master.`
` Pu ku ku ku..."`
`"...Man, you're weird.`
` If you don't like it, then couldn't you just not work for her?"`
`"And yet, to continue serving is furniture's joy.`
` If we do not serve, we would hardly be furniture."`
`"...Setting that aside,`
` how has the game been proceeding?`
` Just now, you seemed to have found some useful information that quite pleased you.`
` Well now, I wonder what your shallow wit has conjured up."`
`As Ronove mocked me and giggled,`
` he followed my earlier words literally and placed the black tea and cookies in a random spot nearby.`
`"...In any case, it appears you are now more confident in the existence of a 19th person, yes?`
` Would you be gracious enough to allow me to hear your opinion?"`
`".........`
`...Yeah, sure.`
` I'm just going to say it again in front of Beato anyway.`
` No reason to hide it.`
` ...Basically,`
` it looks like there's a hidden mansion somewhere on this island, and that Grandfather had his mistress living there.`
` So, the question that's been torturing me about whether there are 18 or 19 people...can be easily resolved."`
`"You have driven yourself into a corner because of the dead-end that you yourself have created.`
` Even though you deny the witch, Battler-sama, you hold a double standard, and refuse to accept that the culprit is one of the 18."`
`"...The easiest way to deny the witch would be to suspect one of the 18.`
` ...It isn't easy to gather alibis for every one of them.`
` You always find at least one person with a fragile alibi.`
` ...I could probably continue to deny the witch forever if I just used that person as a scapegoat."`
`"However, I refuse to do that!!`
` Aah, it's useless, it's all useless!`
` Every one of those 18 people is either a parent, a relative or a cousin to me!`
` And those reliable servants, who are sometimes serious and sometimes fun to be with.`
` I won't let myself use any one of them as a scapegoat!!"`
`"In the past, my resolve wavered.`
` That's how Beato hit me where my heart was weak."`
`"...Ah, accepting and understanding one's own weaknesses.`
` It is not something that can often be accomplished.`
` Battler-sama, you use this theory about a 19th person as a spear.`
` ...Or should I say, a shield?"`
`"In any event, in contrast to how unprepared you were in the previous games,`
` the fact that you now have a compass bearing on how to fight... ...is a dramatic leap forward, let us say.`
` With this, you can suspect a 19th person and pursue your theory that the culprit is a human,`
` without having to doubt any of the 18 you love and respect."`
`"That's it exactly.`
` Like in the first game, when Kanon-kun was killed in the boiler room,`
` ...there were plenty of tricks I could've mentioned without hesitation, `
`as long as a 19th person existed."`
`In the very first game, Kanon-kun was killed in the boiler room.`
`One might think he was attacked by Kumasawa-san, who had gone down into the boiler room with him,`
` or maybe that someone who had appeared to be dead earlier was actually faking and had ambushed him.`
` Either way, it was a move that forced me to suspect one of the 18.`
`However, by simply proposing that a 19th person existed,`
` there was no longer any need to suspect one of the 18 for that murder in the boiler room.`
`"In short!`
` I can at least deny the line of reasoning saying that...`
`if something is impossible for every one of the 18, therefore the culprit is a witch."`
`Using this argument, it's easy to explain, for example, the problematic case that has already occurred in this game,`
` 'who gave Maria the letter?'`
`Even if all 18 people have alibis,`
` I could easily explain everything by saying that a 19th person must've visited her and given her the letter.`
`"......Hmm, hmm.`
` I'd say that's quite a good move.`
` Now, how would I strike back against it?"`
`"...You still have plenty of weak points, even if you are aware of them.`
` Maybe the '18 person attack' would be an effective move.`
` To judge the strength of your defense, it may be amusing to contest that point again."`
`"Then how will you do it,`
` demon butler...?!"`
`"...I believe it would be appropriate to ambush the piece representing this 19th person that you mentioned.`
` Battler-sama, you have never met this 19th person, yes?`
` Would you please show some proof that this 19th person exists?"`
`"How naive.`
` Of course, I knew you'd probably try that move...!"`
`"My, my.`
` Please respond to it."`
`"Witches and demons and the like...`
` There's no more fitting move for you guys to use.`
` ...It's one of those `
`'!s0`
`When you try to make some claim to humans like us, we always counterattack by telling you to show some proof.`
`Because that's a human move.`
`But I'm fighting with a witch.`
`I'm taking part in a battle with someone who isn't human!`
`And some moves exist that can only be used in a game against a witch.`
` There are cheap moves!`
`And that's what this 'Devil's Proof' is.`
`Because it's impossible to prove!`
`Let's assume that there's a hidden mansion on Rokkenjima, separate from the Ushiromiya family mansion,`
` and that a woman named Beatrice lives there.`
`In order to prove this, one must find this mansion and actually bring Beatrice out of it.`
`That's called actual proof in the human world.`
`However, if we follow the rules of the 'Devil's Proof', you can't deny that she exists, even if there's no proof that she does.`
`Because it's impossible to prove that something doesn't exist.`
`...That's right, I'm finally able to turn the tables using this 'Devil's Proof', which tormented me so much before.`
`Those guys were always trying to force me to accept the existence of the witch with it.`
`After all, it was physically impossible for me to show any proof that 'witches don't exist' and deny Beato's claims.`
`That's why I kept getting hit with the reckless argument that witches do exist...and was unable to counterattack.`
`And that's why I'll spin the chessboard around right now!`
`If I can't disprove the existence of witches, then that means...`
`if I suggest that a 19th human exists, you can't deny that either.`
`In other words, because this problematic and mysterious mistress is craftily hiding herself, it'd be perfectly natural if you never found her no matter how hard you looked.`
`So, you can't say that your inability to find this 19th person proves that she doesn't exist.`
`Therefore, it's impossible to deny the 19th person's existence.`
`Beato used the 'Devil's Proof' to make denying her own existence impossible,`
` but this time it's become my weapon.`
`If we can get away with this argument, then forget just a 19th person,`
` this island could be full of people we don't know about,`
` and even if there were 10 or 100 of them, she still couldn't deny that they existed.`
`In the last game and the one before that, among the murder scenes that showed up, `
`there were several that were extremely intricate and must've taken a lot of effort to set up.`
`It's really hard to imagine a single culprit setting up all of those.`
`However, if not just a 19th person, but 10 or 100 people were hidden somewhere, that wouldn't be any problem at all.`
`If they all split up the work, they could handle any job in a short period of time.`
`Of course, doubts will naturally arise as to whether a large group of people like that could sneak around the mansion without being noticed,`
` but those are all settled by the 'Devil's Proof'.`
`You can't deny that even 100 people were there just because they weren't seen or noticed.`
`Even though I'm saying it myself, it's such a stupid argument that it makes me wanna throw up!`
` However, because it's such a dirty move, it's a perfect one to use against a witch.`
`Well, this is just my imagination,`
` ...but what if about 100 suspicious men wearing goat masks were hiding in the shadows...`
` Something like that's worse than laughable, almost like they're cockroaches.`
`If you see one, it means there's 100 more hiding somewhere.`
`"...Well, I do think it's a ridiculous argument that's horribly twisted.`
` If my opponent were human, I'm sure they'd yell at me like I was out of my mind.`
` ...But my opponent is a witch.`
` And after all, that's the kind of competition we're having, isn't it?`
` I'll use any kind of reckless argument to explain it using humans and deny the witch!!"`
`"...Anyway, with this move, I won't have to doubt any of the 18 who are close to me again.`
` I won't suffer a defeat like last time again...!!"`
`"...I see.`
` You have learned from your previous defeat.`
` That is good.`
` It's no surprise that you've become so devious now that you're in your third game."`
`"......You first strengthen your own defense.`
` That is truly a solid first step.`
` Quite a spectacular move, I would say."`
`"Well, even if we do assume that there's a 19th person,`
` there are still a few tricks left that I can't resolve, like the actual number of master keys, no matter how many humans I add.`
` ...Still, it isn't bad as a first step, for the time being."`
`"Battler-sama, your trump card is the important piece called the 19th person.`
` ...You countered my move of asking where the proof was by using the 'Devil's Proof'.`
` ...A good skirmish.`
` Although I must apologize for making a move by myself when Milady isn't here,`
` ......I find that I too am growing slightly interested.`
` ...I wonder if you will allow me to make yet another move on Milady's behalf?"`
`"...Let's have it.`
` I've got no shortage of opponents, be they witches or demons!"`
`"This move you presented called the 'Devil's Proof'...`
` It's a specialty of us demons, but there are also various other moves available to us.`
` ...Do you know of a move called 'Hempel's Raven'?"`
`"Hempel's Raven...??`
` What are you talking about?"`
`'!s1`
` Ah-hahahahahahahahah-hahahahah-hah-ha...!"`
`Just then...aah, that enraging laugh I've heard so many times started echoing.`
`The room was filled with dazzling golden butterflies, and in the center of that whirlwind, the Golden Witch appeared.`
`"If it isn't Milady.`
` Good morning."`
`"I thought you might be doing something interesting while I was away.`
` ...'Hempel's Raven', was it?`
` Such a familiar old move I could almost laugh.`
` To think the day has come when I get to show it off to Battler.`
` It's a classic move to use against a 'Devil's Proof'."`
`"...Ronove, I will make this move.`
` Do not get in the way of my fun."`
`"So you've finally shown up, you guffawing witch.`
` I see you're laughing like a freak just as usual.`
` ...This guy was talking behind your back just now, telling me how undignified you look when you do that.`
` Right?"`
`"How rude.`
` Is that true?"`
`"Nonsense.`
` Why would I speak such gossip about Milady, `
`whom I regard with such sincere respect?"`
`"...I can't believe you'd say something so shameless.`
` Doesn't look like we'll be getting along well together..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` Well, that is fine.`
` Let us return to the point at hand.`
` 'Hempel's Raven' is used to show actual proof using the contrapositive.`
` ...In other words, it is a move like this...`
` What must you do to prove that ravens are black?"`
`"Huh?`
` What are you talking about??`
` Prove that ravens are black...`
` ...Wouldn't you just have to catch a raven and check to see if it's black?"`
`"That's right.`
` You must simply prove that 'a raven = black'.`
` Do you see that, if you instead prove that 'birds that aren't black = not ravens', you would reach the same argument?`
` If you go throughout the world and examine all birds that are not ravens, and prove that none of them are black,`
` then as a result, you can claim that 'therefore, black birds are ravens'.`
` This is called an argument by the contrapositive.`
` ...Is that too difficult for you?"`
`"Yeah, no kidding.`
` ...I've got no idea what you're saying."`
`"Battler-sama,`
` what about this example?`
` Let us say that you have two boxes, and one of them is a winner, with a cookie inside.`
` Of course, the other one is a loser and is empty."`
`For example, here are two boxes,`
` where one has a cookie inside and means you win...while the other is empty and means you lose.`
`At this moment, 'it has a cookie inside = you win',`
` which implies that 'you do not win = it had no cookie inside'.`
`When such a relationship exists, the latter is called the contrapositive...`
`When 'if A then B' is true, then 'if not B then not A' is also true.`
`"...Well, that's obvious.`
` If the one you guessed was the loser, then you'd automatically know that the other one was the winner."`
`"...In other words, if you choose the box at random, whether it's the winner or the loser,`
` you'll be able to figure out which box has the cookie in it after your first move."`
`"That is correct.`
` If the cookie is in the box you open, then the 'Devil's Proof' is satisfied.`
` You can directly prove that 'this box is the winner = this box has a cookie in it'.`
`However, if the box you open is empty, then the reverse, Hempel's Raven, is satisfied.`
` In other words 'this box does not have a cookie in it = this box isn't the winner."`
`"And as long as we accept the premise that there are no more than two boxes,`
` the contrapositive shows that the other box is automatically the winner."`
`"...Well, I think I'm starting to see your reasoning.`
` Only poison can stop poison, and only twisted logic can stop twisted logic.`
` ...Then what?`
` How does that overturn my claim that, 'because there's definitely a 19th human hidden on this island,`
` even if all 18 people have alibis,`
` I still won't have to accept witches'...?"`
`"Very well.`
` I will teach you about my move.`
` First of all, you are stating that 'the culprit is not among the 18 = the culprit is a 19th person'.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` ...So if you use the contrapositive, it ends up like this.`
` In short, 'the culprit is not a 19th person = the culprit is one of the 18'!"`
`"Huuuh?!`
` What the, what do you mean?!"`
`"Only that I've countered your move.`
` Let's try and keep things simple.`
` Ronove, explain.`
` It seems you've made things easy enough for Battler to understand with your cookie in a box analogy."`
`"Then forgive my presumption.`
` Allow me to explain my earlier example once more."`
`Allow me to repeat my earlier story about two treasure boxes,`
` one of which has a cookie in it.`
`In this situation, you have an '18 person box' and a '19th person box'.`
`So the cookie represents the culprit.`
`Battler-sama, let's say you open the 18 person box.`
`Because the cookie is not there, `
`you have paradoxically proven that 'therefore, the cookie is in the 19th person box'.`
`That lets us make an even more paradoxical claim.`
`In other words, if it was first shown that the 19th person box was empty,`
` it would prove at the same time that 'the cookie is in the 18 person box'.`
`Battler-sama played this move in order to avoid having to doubt any of the 18,`
` but it's now been used to prepare an '18 person attack'...!"`
`'!s1`
`...what the hell...?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` If I go first and prove that the inside of the 19th person box is empty,`
` you will automatically have to accept that `
`the cookie is in the 18 person box.`
` All I've done is say it the other way around, yes?"`
`"So, ...that move I was so confident in...was actually a double-edged sword?"`
`"That's right.`
` As soon as you played that move and attempted to explain everything with a 19th person,`
` you'd already taken on a risk that you might be forced to accept that the culprit was one of the 18."`
`I see...`
` 'Hempel's Raven'.`
`...So this is a countering technique?!`
`...Wait, if I really think about it, this counter is really disadvantageous for me.`
`This isn't a cookie we're talking about.`
`If I imagine that the 'loser' treasure chest actually has a bomb in it, it gets even clearer.`
`And there aren't just two treasure chests, `
`but 18 plus 1 more for the 19th person.`
` If you think of it as a total of 19 boxes, it gets even easier to picture.`
`First off, one of the premises of the human culprit theory is that the bomb will definitely be in one of these boxes.`
`I didn't want to place the bomb in the boxes for any of the 18, so I used the 'Devil's Proof'...`
`and created the 19th person box so I could throw the bomb in there.`
` ...That much was fine.`
`But then, Beato struck back.`
`Now, if the contents of the 19th person box are empty, `
`that'll automatically mean that the bomb's in one of the other 18 boxes.`
`If I could examine what's inside all 18 of those boxes,`
` then as long as I can show that the bomb isn't in any of them,`
` I'll be able to safely show that the 18 are innocent.`
`If that were possible, I'd have nothing to fear!`
`However, in reality, that'll be almost absolutely impossible.`
`The police wouldn't come here in this typhoon.`
`We don't have access to scientific investigations or experts or anything.`
`In short, we can't prove anything decisively!`
`It'll be impossible for me to find any proof other than simply gulping down whatever alibis each of the 18 give.`
`That means I personally have to prove their innocence, and I have to do it perfectly.`
`Like by staying with them the whole time, never letting them out of my sight for a second.`
`By doing that, I could probably be sure of that person's innocence, `
`sure that the bomb isn't in their box.`
`...However, in practical terms, that'll be impossible!`
`In other words, I'd have to expend an incredible effort just to check the contents of one box.`
`And there are 18 of them!`
` In other words, unless I bound all 18 of them in chains and watch over them,`
` it'll be impossible to prove that all of them have empty boxes.`
`However, Beato only has to open one box, the 19th person box,`
` and show that it's empty to prove that the bomb's in one of the other 18 boxes.`
` (Furthermore, there's no need for her to show 'which' of the 18 boxes has the bomb!)`
`I've got 18 times more work to do to explain my pet theory than Beatrice does for hers...`
`"When a 'Devil's Proof' exists in the world,`
` it takes a vast amount of effort to argue against it, and there are many cases in which it is impossible to do because of the situation.`
` However, 'Hempel's Raven' turns that problem around...and makes it possible to prove things easily!"`
`"By using 'Hempel's Raven', various reckless arguments become possible to prove true or false.`
` ...For example, let us say I make the proposition 'All humans except me = foolish'.`
` Normally, I would have to examine all of humanity except myself and show that they are all foolish.`
`...However, in reality, it would be impossible to investigate billions of people.`
` It's just the same sort of effort you'd need to open all 18 boxes."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` However, by using 'Hempel's Raven', the contrapositive of that proposition would change it into this.`
` If you, to use your phrase, spin the chessboard around on the claim that 'All humans except me = foolish', `
`you would have to do nothing more than prove that 'not foolish = me'.`
` ...And what do you think that means?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` As soon as I know the fact that 'I am wise', `
`I will be able to show in an instant that every one of the billions of people in the human race is foolish.`
` In less than a second, I could finish proving that the entire human race is more foolish than me!!"`
`"It truly is the strongest and fastest QED in the world,`
` this `
`'Hempel's Raven'!"`
`"Wha......What a ridiculous argument......!!!"`
`"It is a very, very convenient move.`
` Not only demons, but gods also use it.`
` When they propose that 'the blessed = the servants of a god',`
` the contrapositive is 'a human is not a servant of a god = he must not be blessed'."`
`"So in order to prove that servants of gods are blessed with divine protection,`
` they only have to bring ill fortune down upon those people who don't receive such protection."`
`"......So, by bringing misfortune down upon those who don't believe in them,`
` they prove their blessedness."`
`"An enormous cost is required to give humans happiness.`
` ...However, it takes a lot less to bring humans misfortune.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` So by using 'Hempel's Raven', gods are actually giving believers the joy of divine protection for cheap."`
`"...Y-You demon.`
` It's a demon's argument...`
` ...That's crazy...!!!"`
`"It seems we've gone off-topic.`
` Let us get back to the point."`
`"The move for my counterattack is complete.`
` ...And now, in response to your claim of 'the 19th person is the culprit, therefore, the 18 are innocent and the witch doesn't exist,' `
`I say 'therefore, if I can prove that the culprit is not some 19th person,`
` we can be sure that the culprit is either one of the 18 or a witch, `
`right?'"`
`For a while, I just stood there, shocked, completely forgetting to close my mouth...`
`Just when I'd thought I'd countered one of their strong points,`
` their counterattack had been this reckless argument that I couldn't possibly have anticipated...!`
`Is this...gonna be impossible after all...?!`
`To continue denying the witch on an island with no more than 18 people...`
`and still believe in the innocence of those 18 people...`
` ...Is that just a delusion?!`
` Am I just trying to escape reality?!`
`Not yet...`
` ...Don't give up this desperate struggle yet.`
`Who cares about 'Whoever's Raven'?`
`They're just trying to confuse me by bringing up weird bits of trivia...`
`I used the 'Devil's Proof'.`
`Don't feel uncertain about something you've used once.`
`Believe in the spear you've drawn.`
`And then, forcefully...gouge it in...!`
`"...We're still in the opening part of the game.`
` Do you plan to keep thinking on this level?"`
`".........`
`Ah, `
`...wait a sec, `
`I want to be sure.`
` I'll admit I talked about a 19th person to keep it simple,`
` but if we're gonna use the 'Devil's Proof' to raise the number of people above 18,`
` then we'd have no way of knowing if there were 10 people, 100 people, or an indeterminate number of people.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~There's always one more than you assume~ib~`
`.`
` ...Get it?"`
`They countered my twisted logic with something even more twisted.`
`So the only thing that could counter that...would be even crazier twisted logic...!`
`"Hmm, I see.`
` ......Even if I somehow prove an alibi for the 19th person,`
` as soon as I do, you will think up a 20th person and claim that they are the culprit.`
` By repeating this endlessly, you would make it so I kept searching for their alibis for all eternity.`
` ...I see, I see, *cackle*cackle*!`
` Just like a demon king summoning a plague of locusts.`
` I wouldn't expect anything less from Kinzo's grandchild.`
` It looks like you have been gifted with a talent in summoning."`
`"...In short!`
` It's impossible to always prove an alibi for each person X outside of the first 18!`
` ...How do you like that, Beato...?!`
` Now that I know we're having a battle with twisted logic, I won't lose!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` How foolish...`
` Who do you think I am?`
` I am the Endless Witch!`
` The thought that you could challenge me endlessly is just absurd.`
` Endless control means that I am able to kill endlessly."`
`"...When your 19th person folds, you will summon a 20th,`
` and when your 20th person folds, you will summon a 21st,`
` and when your 21 person folds and your 22nd person folds,`
` you will summon a 23rd person, a 34th person, a 64358223579673204th person!`
` Did you think you'd have me at your mercy for all eternity?!"`
`"I laugh at 'infinite regress'!`
` The 'infinite' doesn't work against me!!"`
`"Well then, how will you kill my 'endless'? Just try and show me!!"`
`'!s0`
`".........!!`
` ......Here it comes......"`
`"When I speak in red, it will contain absolutely no illusions.`
` If I say once in red that there are no more than 100 people on this island,`
` you will no longer be permitted to create a 101st person.`
`*cackle*cackle*!`
` See, Battleeer?`
` What truth shall I tell in red this time?`
` Where shall I strike for the kill and force you into hopelessness?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Come, show me your usual frightened face..."`
`"........."`
`".........What?"`
`"...Ihihihihi."`
`"...Why...are you laughing...?"`
`I wonder what kind of creepy look I had on my face as I laughed right then.`
`That red sure is scary.`
` ...Every time it jumps out, I'm driven into the depths of hopelessness.`
`But...I've already realized something.`
` ...There's no need to be overly afraid of the red.`
`"......You've brought out your trump card again.`
` So...?`
` How and for what will Beatrice-sama use the red this time?"`
`"...Hoh.`
` What do you mean by that?`
` Suddenly looking so relaxed..."`
`"Sorry, but I was waiting for you to take out that blood-red treasured sword of yours.`
` ...Let's see, what'll you proclaim in red this time?`
`You aren't going to say 'the culprit was one of those 18 people', are you?`
` Be careful, since that'd mean self-destruction for you, right?`
` That'd be the same as throwing away your own witch theory yourself.`
` A complete resignation."`
`That's right,`
` the red wasn't always a weapon that worked in Beato's favor alone.`
` It was the other way around.`
` If she used it the wrong way, it was dangerous enough that she could bring about her own death.`
`If she used it carelessly and said something that ended up denying herself, that'd be exactly the same as self-destructing.`
`"Of course, it'd be sad and difficult for me to accept if you told me in red that one of the 18 was the culprit.`
` ...No matter who the culprit actually was, I'd definitely have to deal with some tough emotions..."`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@`
`@:dwave_eng 0, but_3e311:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, but_3e312:`
`Beatrice's red was her true trump card.`
`When that person speaks in red, it's definitely the truth, and no amount of proof or counterarguments can change that.`
`Until now, she's used that to severely wound me, and each time, the tiny foundations supporting my heart get split in half.`
`However, if she uses it carelessly, then I can also gleam a little information about the truth.`
`...In the last game, I used that to my advantage, especially during the chapel's closed room trick,`
` and almost completely got her boxed in at one point.`
`But she was pretty sly herself.`
`She learned from experience, and since then, she's started using discretion in the timing of her red...`
`This feeling of tension was almost literally like a battle with real swords.`
`...This is a high-level intellectual battle.`
`...No, not an intellectual battle.`
`This really is twisted logic.`
`This was the world's craziest and worst battle of twisted logic...!!`
`"Okay, now it's time to hear your plan.`
` ...That's right.`
` To use your 'Hempel's Raven', `
`first, you'll have to confirm in red how many humans there are other than the 18.`
` And after that, if you proclaim in red that none of the people in this group are the culprit...`
`that's right, that might be a fatal wound to me."`
`"......I'm surprised that you no longer have even an atom of fear for the red, which once terrified you so much...`
` You're quite resilient."`
`"Try taking it out.`
` That treasured sword, that trump card of yours.`
` This time, you might be able to make me surrender with a single stroke, right...?"`
`"...*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` ...Interesting.`
` I wouldn't have it any other way..."`
`Agitate her.`
` Challenge her.`
`Drive her into a corner to make her speak in red...`
`Of course her red's always wiping out my only rays of hope.`
`But...don't be afraid of that.`
`On this island overcome with falsehoods and illusions, the only thing I can trust is...`
`the information she speaks in red.`
`It's my only way across the chasm of hell.`
` Just a single tightrope.`
`Her merciless blood-red blade is the only way I can survive.`
`...This isn't just walking on a tightrope, it's like literally walking on the edge of a blade...`
`Of course I'm afraid.`
`Because my victory condition is the denial of witches, then, to use her contrapositive logic, the culprit must be human.`
`But I didn't want to search for a culprit amid the 18.`
`...That's what made me stick to a weak position, since I had to claim both that it couldn't be a witch and that it couldn't be one of the 18.`
` Last time, I was unable to understand that, so that's where she hit me, leaving me tattered and defeated.`
`...But that's okay.`
`Let her hit me.`
` Let her attack.`
` No problem...`
`Someone said it once in an old sword-fighting movie.`
`That 'A good fortress has one, and only one, intentionally weak point'.`
`The enemy would gather there.`
` They would be lured there.`
`And that would be where the actual battle took place.`
`...As long as I understood my weak points,`
` and as long as she wanted to attack those weak points,`
` ...it was as if I were luring her into launching an attack there...`
`Gauge the distance between us with care, ...retreating step by step.`
` Make them move forward.`
`The more she recklessly flourished that red, the more chances I would get to strike back.`
`Don't be afraid of the red.`
`Keep her cornered, so that she'll have no choice but to refute me with the red...!`
`No matter how oppressively she speaks in red,`
` ...that's right, that red itself is the same as fresh blood leaking from her wounds.`
`"So,`
` ...what's wrong?`
` ...First of all, why don't you tell me how many people are on this island total?`
` If you don't, your raven can't cut me up...!"`
`".........Hmph.`
` ...How surprising that you can be this desperate and yet this difficult.`
` ...One cannot make light of someone putting their life on the line, no matter what the era.`
` ...It's no surprise you're Kinzo's grandchild.`
`'!s1`
` ......the bolder you become!"`
`"...Ihihihi..."`
`Ronove cleared his throat.`
`"It appears to be a stalemate.`
` That black tea I worked so hard to make is getting cold, `
`Milady."`
`"......Nng."`
`Ronove, who was supposed to be her ally, roguishly rushed her into making her next move.`
`Beato probably thought she'd managed to smile back and appear confident, ...but she couldn't hide the sweat building up on her forehead.`
`By now, she had completely lost the confident feeling that had allowed her to turn her nose up at her worthless opponent.`
`Of course, she probably wouldn't be cornered by something like this.`
`...She's just being cautious.`
`Until now, I've been inexperienced.`
`I didn't know how to fight, and I wasn't strong enough to be her opponent.`
`However, now that we've reached the third game, she's realized that I'm starting to become more skilled,`
` and she's grown more cautious, thinking every move over carefully...`
`Sure, that's just fine, Beatrice.`
`Sorry to keep you waiting.`
`Are you happy now...?`
`"...Now it's starting to get interesting, huh...?`
` Hihihihi!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` ...Battleeeeeeeeer..."`
`"This isn't getting us anywhere...`
` Then, should we get to the heart of the matter and go with the usual?"`
`"...Hoh.`
` The usual, you say?`
` ...Then, by all means.`
` If I don't hear you say that, I guess I just won't feel like starting..."`
`The first move was mine...`
`"Here I go, Beato.`
` Repeat it.`
` ...'On this island, there are only 18 people'."`
`"............"`
`"...If I hear you say this in red, I'll have no choice but to suspect one of the 18.`
` ...I won't be able to say a 19th person did it, so all doors will be closed to me.`
` ......However, I believe the culprit definitely isn't one of the 18!`
` There's no way any of those 18 could commit such brutal murders...!!"`
`"........."`
`"I'll say it again.`
` Repeat it!`
` 'On this island, there are only 18 people'."`
`"............`
`......I refuse.`
` I won't say why."`
`Whew...!`
`I'd avoided what would've been the worst red for me.`
`If she'd repeated that, `
`I'd be faced with those two worst choices of accepting the witch or suspecting one of the 18,`
` like last time all over again...`
`But Beato hadn't proclaimed my ultimate and greatest weakness in red.`
`She refused to repeat it, even though there was no reason for her not to strike, even though it was a weakness she should've been drooling at.`
`She hadn't sliced me up with red by using that move, which should've been as good as forking a rook and the king...!`
`...This was a big sign of my advantage.`
`That's right.`
` The culprit isn't one of the 18.`
`I won't suspect anyone...!`
`And since the culprit isn't a witch either,`
` ......it means a 19th person exists on this island.`
`And that's you.`
`A person who, as Grandfather's mistress of 30 years, `
`has been secretly living in a hidden mansion in the forest for a long, long time.`
`The 'human' Beatrice......!!`
`"That's right.`
` You aren't a witch or anything like it.`
` ...You're just a human...who's been living on this island in hiding for several decades...!"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle... `
`...Did you just call me, the Endless Witch who has lived for over one thousand years, a human?`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`For a while, Beatrice continued to laugh unpleasantly and gloatingly...or maybe spitefully.`
`"...Are you ready? I'll keep going.`
` ...Again, repeat it.`
` 'There are 19 people or more on this island'!"`
`"............"`
`Beatrice fell silent once again.`
`She'd probably remain extremely cautious as long as confirming the number of humans on this island might give her some large disadvantage, `
`depending on the situation.`
`The red has already become a foothold for my counterattacks.`
`Now that we know this, it makes the red very risky for the witch.`
`But if she couldn't repeat this, her 'Hempel's Raven' wouldn't be effective.`
`To break my 'Devil's Proof',`
` she would need to settle the existence and number of people outside the 18 in red.`
`That's right.`
` She couldn't break the existence of a 19th person unless she used red.`
` I've ~ib~closed Beato in~ib~, `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`giving her no choice but to speak in red...!`
`'!s0`
`...a way to fight...`
`in this witch's game!`
`"It's okay to refuse.`
` ...If you can't say it in red, that means there's a total of 18+X people on this island."`
`"...That X is a pretty massive piece to lose on your first move, right?`
` After all, from now on, all of the tricks that were impossible for the 18...`
`can be explained with a human X who isn't in that group.`
` ...This huge piece can break open all the rooms you said were closed because everyone had an alibi...!"`
`It was just like how a chess bishop can cut a thin line through enemy forces as long as there's a slight gap.`
`It could only be effectively used on squares of the same color, but it was very good at controlling territory on the board.`
`"............`
`......Nng."`
`It looked like Beato also noticed her current plight.`
`She couldn't just let such an important piece go, especially this close to the beginning of the game...`
`If she pulled out her red treasured sword, it wouldn't be that difficult to save herself from this.`
`...But Beato was completely aware that I was expecting it.`
`She was afraid that a careless red truth might end up strangling her own neck...!`
`Because...in the first place, a witch is something that ought to be denied in red.`
`Believe.`
` Don't doubt!`
` Witches don't exist!`
`Something like that couldn't exist in this world.`
`They can only exist in the valleys between truths.`
`...They have a fragile existence, curled up in these cracks, frantically trying to protect themselves from the brutal winds of truth,`
` and they can only barely exist like a mirage by surviving on falsehoods and illusions.`
`In other words, the red, which only witches can use, is the reality that might easily deny their very being.`
`...The more they brandish their red words, `
`...the more they begin to lose bit by bit that crack in truth inside which they can endure.`
`That's why they don't want to use red words and carelessly lose that crack in truth, which is based on fuzzy information...`
`or illusions, in other words.`
`That's because they understand that they're gradually being cornered.`
`Of course, that bastard will never admit it.`
`Because, if she did,`
` it'd be the same as admitting that she's something that can't exist in this world, like an imaginary number.`
`Don't be afraid.`
` Stay strong...!`
`I know that she's the one who's really been pierced to the bone.`
`After all, her red treasured sword can't be used without a lot of preparation...!`
`"...What's wrong?`
` I'll say it again.`
` ...Repeat it!`
`'!s0`
`".........`
`...Hmph.`
` ...I refuse."`
`At the end of Beato's worrying,`
` ...she took a single deep breath and quietly announced her refusal.`
`...I thought she'd use it.`
`But Beato refused to speak in red, even though it would cost her victory in the opening part of the game.`
`"You refused...?`
` Which means that, from now on,`
` I can create as many fictional character Xs outside of the 18 as I want...?"`
`"Do as you wish.`
` ...I have refused to repeat what you have told me.`
` Isn't that enough for now?`
` ...The reason for my refusal is...`
`...`
`...no, I won't tell you yet.`
` Anyway, you'll know soon enough."`
`"...Ihihi.`
` Still acting tough, I see..."`
`"...Choosing not to use the red is another way of using it.`
` You called it my red treasured sword.`
` A pleasant metaphor.`
` I will use it too.`
` ...A treasured sword is at its best when it is sheathed.`
` In fact, there are times it can instill even more fear because it is sheathed."`
`"That's right.`
` ...As I fight, I always have to keep in mind whether you might spin everything around with those red words.`
` It's some pretty serious pressure."`
`"...And there are also times when you make things pretty tough by refusing to repeat after me.`
` ...Those times, I can't tell if you can't repeat because my guess was right, `
`or if you're just misleading me and letting me flounder about.`
` If you think of it that way, yeah.`
` It's a sheathed treasured sword."`
`"......So what?`
` If I'm going to push you off a cliff anyway, best to let you climb a bit higher first.`
` ...We have still barely begun.`
` Much is left to come..."`
`"I'll resign from this challenge.`
` ...Go and get drunk on your faint victory for now.`
` ...But only for now."`
`Practically speaking, the early part of the game ended with her being a sore loser.`
`Even so, I couldn't relax my guard at all.`
`...That tension didn't fade one bit...until I was greeted by the sound of Ronove's applause...`
`"...Spectacular, Battler-sama.`
` Perhaps you have started this game with an advantageous development."`
`"Who knows...`
` I still don't know whether I've taken a piece by my move,`
` or whether she guided me into taking it.`
` ...After all, knowing you...`
` You probably know I'm being led into a trap, and that clapping is just you mocking me openly, right...?"`
`"How could you think that?`
` I am innocently celebrating your ability, which has enabled you to take one shot at Milady, even though it is only the first round.`
` ...In any event, Milady is a person who is quick to become arrogant.`
` I believe that a little encouragement such as this can be good medicine every once in a while."`
`"...This butler of yours sure has a vicious tongue..."`
`"He does, doesn't he?`
` Sometimes he ticks me off as well."`
`"My, my, how incredibly rude of me.`
` Well then, Milady, Battler-sama.`
` How would you like some more black tea?`
` The game has still barely begun.`
` Please allow me to prepare all the tea and snacks needed to adorn this game.`
` I ask that you continue your game without any reservations."`
`"I will.`
` Let's move forward.`
` Now is when it really starts."`
`"......Hmph.`
` Very well.`
` Let us advance the clock.`
` Ronove, black tea please."`
`"Certainly.`
` How about a cookie?"`
`"I don't need one.`
` Give it to Beelzebub to keep her happy.`
` ......Remain silent for now."`
`While listening to the sound of the demon butler pouring tea, the witch closed her eyes slightly and fell silent.`
`...For some time, she was deeply lost in thought, but eventually a roguish glint came into her eyes.`
`"Very well.`
` ......Why don't I inform you now as to why I refused to speak in red during that first move?"`
`"...What...?`
` Bring it on.`
` Show me what you've got."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...`
` Yes, that piece really was big enough that I'd hate to lose it.`
` ...It may be hasty, but allow me to make my move.`
` I won't use the red, but from here on, Rosa will explain on my behalf.`
` Listen."`
`"Of course, I think the same way.`
` Rosa does too, right?`
` ......Rosa?"`
`"Huh? Ah, sorry...`
` M-Me too.`
` I think that too."`
`"......What's wrong, Rosa-san?`
` ...You've been really quiet for a while now.`
` Are you feelin' sick...?"`
`From the beginning, Rosa had never been one to cut in on the siblings' fights.`
`...But even so, she seemed unmotivated...`
`and had said almost nothing during this night's conference.`
`The whole time, she had hung her head...and appeared to be thinking of something else...`
`"You've been in a daze for a while now.`
` Do you think you can protect the inheritance like that?`
` You're also the mother of your child, so get a stronger hold on yourself."`
`"I-I'm sorry..."`
`"Did you wake up really early in the morning?`
` If you feel sick, you shouldn't overdo it."`
`"...The beds in our guest rooms have been prepared.`
` How about taking a rest?`
` I will guide you."`
`"No, ...I'm fine.`
` Thank you."`
`"...What is it?`
` Is there something you're worrying about?"`
`"......No, not really......"`
`"Is that so...?`
` It feels like your mind has been elsewhere this whole time.`
` ...I wonder if that has anything to do with what we've been talking about...?"`
`At those words, everyone stared at Rosa together.`
`As if in response, Rosa's shoulders quivered.`
`Apparently, Kyrie's guess hadn't been wrong.`
`...Rosa couldn't deny it either...`
`".........No, umm...`
` ............"`
`She swallowed whatever it was she had been trying to say and went silent again.`
`Of course, the other siblings also began to realize that something about her appearance was different from usual...`
`"What is it?`
` ...You've been weird for a while.`
` Did you think of something...?"`
`"We all just swore to remain united, didn't we?`
` Don't hold back, worryin' by yourself.`
` We said we'd talk."`
`"...Rosa,`
` tell us."`
`The men pressed her one after the other, and Rosa confessed resignedly and nervously...`
`The atmosphere made it seem as though she was confessing to some modest prank,`
` which had inadvertently brought about a serious situation.`
`"No, umm...`
` ...Th-This mistress of Grandfather's, this Beatrice...`
` ...I was wondering if she's still...`
`alive..."`
`"Huh?`
` Isn't it obvious that she's alive?`
` After all, she was able to send that letter to us."`
`"Whether she's in good health or not is a different story though.`
` The woman in that portrait must be getting up there in age by now."`
`"I'd say she's healthy.`
` People who are crafty when it comes to money stay healthy no matter how old they get!`
` Her evil plan might even be the best rejuvenating agent.`
` Wahahaha."`
`"...She shouldn't be...`
`alive."`
`"Huh?`
` ...What did you just say?"`
`"Beatrice is...`
`...dead...`
` ......I-`
`I killed her...!"`
`"Wh-What did you say...?!"`
`"...Wh-What do you mean, Rosa...?!"`
`"B-But it wasn't really me who killed her...`
` ...Th-Though I did bring her to a place like that!`
` ...No, I did kill her after all...`
` I tried to make myself believe it was a dream!!`
` ...But...it wasn't really a dream, was it?!`
` Which makes this...a letter from Beatrice's ghost!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`It was so sudden that everyone was lost for words.`
`Rosa kept on talking, unable to stop, holding her head as her hair flew all about...`
`"Calm yourself...!`
` Rosa-san...!"`
`"I-I have absolutely no clue what's goin' on...!`
` Already dead?`
` What do ya mean...?!"`
`"...I think it means two things.`
` First, ...its literal meaning.`
` ...And second, it backs up our earlier guess."`
`"Which means...`
`......Rosa...has met with Beatrice, right?"`
`"I-I've never heard Rosa mention anything like this.`
` ...Rosa, when was it?`
` When could you possibly have met Beatrice?!"`
`"Long ago!`
` Long, long, long ago!!`
` We'd just moved over to the island and I was still young!!`
` It wasn't my fault, it's not like I killed her...!!`
` Whaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"...Calm down!`
` Nobody's blaming you for anything, right?`
` First, drink some water.`
` Okay?`
` Natsuhi-san, the pitcher please."`
`"Y-Yes.`
` ......Here you go, Rosa-san.`
` Please, calm yourself..."`
`"............"`
`Until Rosa was able to calm her ragged breathing, ...no one was able to speak a word...`
`"...Beatrice,`
` I have been calling to you for some time now.`
` Did you not hear me...?"`
`"...Mu.`
` Were you?`
` My apologies.`
` I was lost in thought.`
` Forgive me."`
`"The weather is pleasant.`
` ...Yes, I can understand how the weather has stolen your heart.`
` Will you have your black tea here...?"`
`"......Who...am I?"`
`"............`
`...I will bring some tea now.`
` Wait here for a while."`
`"Forget about the tea.`
` Talk with me."`
`"...Very well."`
`Kinzo had used the excuse of getting black tea to try and interrupt the conversation for the time being.`
`...But his attempt had been very transparent.`
`I sat in a garden chair and beckoned Kinzo to do the same.`
`Kinzo sat down heavily, exaggerating his age.`
`For a while, we sat and appreciated the silence...`
`"...Who am I?`
` Until today, no one has answered this question.`
` ...For some reason, everyone averts their gaze and evades me."`
`"........."`
`"...I have known you for a long time.`
` I think of you as my best friend, even as a father.`
` ...That is why I want so much for you to tell me.`
` You should know.`
` ...Who I am..."`
`".........`
`......Why are you worried about something like that?`
` You are Beatrice.`
` The Master of this mansion, is that not so?`
` ...What more could you want to know?"`
`"......I do not know."`
`"What's this?`
` ...Don't you even understand what it is you want to know?`
` How mysterious.`
` In one's youth, there are times one wants to play in the maze of thought that has no exit.`
` Perhaps that's what your worries are..."`
`Kinzo laughed as though it was a trivial matter.`
`...However, I couldn't help but feel that this behavior was another attempt to force me to stop any further questioning.`
`"............`
`...Hmph.`
` ...So you won't tell me...after all."`
`"There is nothing to tell.`
` You are Beatrice.`
` Isn't that more than enough?"`
`"...No, that's not it.`
` ......What I wish to know is not my name.`
`'!s1`
`who...`
`I am.`
` ...Who am I? What am I?`
` ...How long have I been here, ...and how long will I have to continue my days here?"`
`".........`
`...I really should bring some black tea.`
` Don't you think it a waste of all this fine weather?"`
`"............"`
`"......What's this all about...?`
` It looks like it's probably the story of your past, right?"`
`"Something like that.`
` ...To think I would go this far back..."`
`"Looks like you had some pretty deep worries even then, `
`...wondering who you were."`
`"...That is to be expected.`
` At the time, I was unable to understand who I was,`
` or why I was alive."`
`"Well, in puberty,`
` everyone's captured by those philosophical worries at least once, wondering what meaning there is in their life.`
` Doesn't this just prove you had a charming period like that at one point?"`
`".........`
`...I'd been in that mansion since the time of my birth.`
` And I lived only inside the mansion.`
` Of course, I went out into the garden, but the area around the mansion was surrounded by a very tall fence. I was unable to leave through it,`
` and I was told severely that I mustn't leave."`
`"...I could walk freely throughout the mansion and the garden, `
`but outside of that, not once was my desire to take just one step outside of my own accord granted."`
`"......What do you mean by that?`
` ...Are you trying to say that, as far back as you can remember, you were always a bird in a cage?"`
`"...That's what I thought at the time.`
` After all, as soon as I became aware, I was living like that.`
` I didn't even think to question it."`
`"Who in the world......are you?"`
`"That's it.`
` That is what I also hoped to know."`
`"......Heh.`
` I'm sure you'll say something like 'I wasn't a human, I was a witch,' right?"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"No, that's not true.`
` That isn't true ~ib~yet~ib~.`
` ...Or should I say that ~ib~was once~ib~ the case.`
` ...I was constructed by Kinzo, a human built by a human.`
` ...No, perhaps I should call it a cage made of flesh."`
`"What the hell...?`
` ...This is getting weird."`
`"...You probably won't believe it anyway,`
` but listen first.`
` ......I was a mighty witch, who had lived for one thousand years.`
` But at one point, I was summoned by Kinzo,`
` ...and by that hidden art, I was bound as his prisoner for eternity."`
`"......Never heard that before.`
` From what we hear in the Ushiromiya family, you were summoned by Grandfather,`
` made something like a devil's contract with him, and gave him the gold."`
`"Indeed.`
` That is correct.`
` ...Then, I was supposed to vanish until the contract was complete.`
` But......well, popular women have it rough.`
` ......By some turn of events, Kinzo fell in love with me."`
`"...Grandfather's nearsightedness must've gotten pretty bad.`
` With astigmatism too, ihihi.`
` To fall in love with you, of all things."`
`"......Hmph.`
` Well, to me, there could be nothing more bothersome.`
` ...However, the power of Humans is a frightening thing.`
` He displayed that fearsome power and rooted me to this place.`
` ...He said I wouldn't be freed until I nodded my head in agreement.`
` ...Such an overbearing man."`
`"Isn't that awesome.`
` Everyone knew Grandfather was obsessed with the occult, `
` ...but who would've guessed he had the power to root down the Great Witch Beatrice...`
` ...Heh, ridiculous.`
` Who'd believe such a weird story?"`
`"...As I thought, you don't believe."`
`"All I believe is the fact that you lived in this hidden mansion in the middle of the forest.`
` You are the 19th person on Rokkenjima, right?!"`
`"...Indeed.`
` Just as you imagine, this is deep within the forest of Rokkenjima.`
` A hidden mansion not to be found from the outside world.`
` Its name is Kuwadorian (Nine Birds' Retreat)."`
`"...Come to think of it, I heard the guesthouse's real name was Toraian (Visitor's Retreat).`
` ...I see, the naming sense is similar.`
` ...So, you were Grandfather's mistress, who lived here in secret.`
` Isn't that right?!"`
`"Mistress isn't the right way to say it.`
` ...You should probably call it Kinzo's unrequited love.`
` I spoke of it just now, correct?`
` He fell in love with me of his own accord.`
` He then courted me, but I rejected him."`
`"...Then, I was shut up in this hidden mansion.`
` ......No, that's not quite right.`
` ...It would be more correct to say that I was shut up in this body."`
`"......I've got no idea what you said at the end there."`
`"You will just make fun of it and refuse to listen, right?`
` After all, you say you don't believe in witches or magic.`
` If you have no ears to hear what I tell you, `
`saying it would be the pinnacle of foolishness."`
`"............`
`...I'll decide whether I believe or not.`
` ...After all, if I don't ask, the story won't continue.`
` Tell me.`
` ...Let's hear this story from your past."`
`"Very well.`
` ......I refused Kinzo when he courted me, but he was not a man to lose heart at something like that.`
` He wanted to make me nod my head in agreement no matter what.`
` He shut me up in this mansion and spent an eternity trying to win my heart."`
`"...Talk about overbearing.`
` Guess no one likes obstinate men, huh?"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*`
` Regardless of whether I responded to his courting or not, `
`having a man so desperate for me was...well, as a woman, it wasn't so unpleasant."`
`"...However, I never accepted his proposal.`
` I tried to find some way to break through his guard, `
`but that barrier was firm, and I couldn't crack it."`
`"...And then?"`
`"After trying to resist in various ways,`
` I eventually reached the conclusion that, to escape from Kinzo's barrier, I would have to throw away this body of flesh.`
` ...The physical body is a vessel with many restrictions for a magic user."`
`"Throw away your body of flesh...?`
` What does that mean?`
` Something like an out-of-body experience?"`
`"Well, if you want to think of it that way.`
` However, I am no spirit.`
` Even though I am a witch, in the beginning, I was born with a human's body of flesh.`
` So for me, throwing away that physical body,`
` while it didn't mean the same thing as death, it did require a similar level of resolve."`
`"So in other words,`
` ...you decided that you couldn't be released except by suicide, is that it?"`
`"It wasn't suicide.`
` It was nothing more than throwing away my body of flesh.`
` ...Of course, becoming nothing more than soul is a precarious situation.`
` When the soul leaves its body of flesh, it is constantly exposed to the strong winds of the sun.`
` It was not easy for me to maintain myself and avoid being scattered by them."`
`"It was a final measure that I wanted to avoid if I could.`
` However, there was no other way to break through Kinzo's barrier.`
` ...*cackle* Anyway, I am an unfettered person.`
` I couldn't stand being kept in a cage until Kinzo's life was over."`
`I couldn't see this stuff Beato kept going on about, about throwing away her body of flesh,`
` as anything more than suicide.`
`Grandfather persistently courted her, and to escape from that, `
`...she chose her own death...?`
`"......So you're saying you committed suicide?`
` What are you talking about?`
` Isn't that you, sitting carefree there in the garden chair?"`
`"...That's right.`
` That is the new cage I was given by Kinzo."`
`"......Cage?`
` You mean this mansion?"`
`"No.`
` I mean my body, relaxing in the garden chair over there.`
` ......Even though I was so desperate to escape that I became naught but a soul,`
` Kinzo still had no intention of letting me go."`
`"...Oh, he was a fearsome person.`
` Normally, when the object of one's unrequited love shows that she is willing to die, it should be enough to bring that person to their senses, even if their love has lasted a hundred years.`
` ...Perhaps that's why even he managed to become a sorceror of sorts.`
` ...*cackle*."`
`"Don't try to confuse me with that incomprehensible witch-girl talk.`
` ...What exactly are you trying to say?"`
`"That Kinzo didn't let me escape even after I became a soul.`
` ...Human emotions are terrifying.`
` To think he would be able to exhibit such power...`
` Tying down a dead soul...`
`is not something that can be accomplished easily, not even for a magician who specializes in such matters.`
` Because I knew this, Kinzo's fearful magical power shocked me for the first time."`
`"......Then, Kinzo seized my soul and brought me back.`
` However, a cage to hold a seized soul cannot be made from iron or lead.`
` ...Only one thing remained."`
`"......What?`
` You aren't gonna say it was a magical cage or something, are you?"`
`"Wrong.`
` It's that body of flesh over there, just like yours or mine.`
` ...Only a cage made of flesh and blood can tie a soul down to this world.`
` ...Kinzo shut my soul up in a cage of flesh built to be exactly like me."`
`".........`
`...So to sum up, it's like this?`
` Grandfather obstinately courted you, you started to hate it, and you committed suicide,`
` but you weren't clever enough to finish the job?`
` ...Damn, you really took a roundabout way to say something like that."`
`"No, that's wrong.`
` My soul was shut up in the seed of a homunculus,`
` and I was born out of a test tube."`
`"Huh?!`
` But that's crazy...!`
` That isn't even possible, right?!"`
`"Kinzo accomplished even the miracle of creating life.`
` And simply to shut my soul up in that cage.`
` ...That he would show such magical power simply because of his own love...`
` A thoroughly terrifying person."`
`"Aah, it's already gotten pretty ridiculous!`
` Say whatever you want.`
` I won't believe anything.`
` Just do what you like."`
`"......Mu.`
` ...What's with this unpleasant attitude?"`
`"Heh, `
`in the beginning, I showed a little interest, thinking that there might be some huge hint hidden here,`
` but the more I ask, the weirder this story starts to get.`
` I get the feeling that even though this is supposed to be a game about denying witches,`
` I'm suddenly being forced to just swallow this story about witches."`
`"Sorry, but I don't feel like listening to this any more.`
` Just keep rambling on to yourself as much as you want.`
` I'll be over here, picking at my earwax or something."`
`".........`
`...Hmph."`
`When I started acting cold, Beato seemed unusually discouraged.`
`Of course, her expression was still shameless,`
` but in that really easy-to-understand expression of hers, `
`I had the feeling I was able to catch a glimpse of loneliness at my failure to find the story of her past interesting.`
`...For some reason, that subtle reaction made her seem pitiful,`
` so even though I kept my careless attitude, I decided to cover for her slightly.`
`Damn it, even though she's an irritating witch, I'm still weak against her because her chromosomes are XX...`
`"...Well, I've got absolutely no desire to believe you, but...`
`...keep going.`
` Let's have a bit of a story instead of a tea snack."`
`"So you treat the story of my past like little more than a snack...`
` ...Do you expect me to just casually tell you when you insult me like that...?"`
`After I made fun of her, Beato reacted a little sensitively.`
`It looked like, even though making fun of people was her specialty, she was horrible at being made fun of by others.`
`Just then, my black tea cup suddenly made a sound, surprising me.`
`"...Milady's soul was seized and breathed into a cage of new life.`
` In other words, Milady received life as a human once more."`
`Before I realized it, the demon butler had taken my cup and was adding more black tea to it.`
`"Ronove,`
` enough of that.`
` This person just said it was too ridiculous to be worth listening to.`
` Well, he's too ridiculous to be worth talking to."`
`"I'm baking some new cookies right now.`
` Until they're ready, I thought you might find the story of Milady's past to be a perfect substitute for a snack.`
` Pu ku ku...!"`
`"...D-Didn't I say that's enough talking about me?!`
` Such unpleasant people, the lot of you.`
` I'm leaving!`
` Ronove, serve our food and then go.`
` No pointless chitchat with Battler."`
`"Certainly.`
` I will make an effort."`
`Beato's short temper peculiar to women, which I didn't really understand, took hold of her, and she turned her body into gold butterflies, scattered, and disappeared.`
`After that, only Ronove and the scent of the black tea were left...`
`"...I feel kind of bad, like I pissed her off or something."`
`"As long as you're aware of it yourself, I need say nothing more."`
`"Wait a sec.`
` Weren't you the one who struck the finishing blow?"`
`"Pu ku ku ku.`
` My, what could you mean by that?`
` How would you like some sugar and milk?"`
`"...Just milk will be fine.`
` ......And some tea snacks would be nice too."`
`"...Well, it will be a bit longer before the cookies are ready."`
`"Didn't you say we've already got something to use in place of a snack?"`
`"...Certainly.`
` If you will listen quietly, I will continue the story."`
`"She said something about a homunculus.`
` ...I know a bit about that.`
` It's that thing, right?`
` A manufactured human created with alchemy or something?"`
`"Yes.`
` Milady's soul was shut up in a homunculus, and she was revived into this world, receiving life again as a baby.`
` ...However, because she was a baby,`
` any professions of love on Kinzo's part would have been quite useless."`
`".........`
`......You aren't saying...`
`...that Grandfather shut that baby up in this hidden mansion...`
`until it grew to reach the same age she'd been?!"`
`"Correct.`
` That is what I am saying.`
` However, while her soul was the same, a human spirit is strongly influenced by its container.`
` Milady lost all her memories of the past and grew up as a very normal human girl."`
`"And you're saying...that's the Beato sitting in the garden chair?"`
`"Yes.`
` That is correct.`
` It grew to be completely identical.`
` However, it did not possess her power as a witch.`
` ...Milady was completely human."`
`"............"`
`Beato, who was sitting in the garden chair, looking up at the sky, voiced that same question again.`
`She asked who she was.`
`...The meaning of those words was finally starting to click.`
`She couldn't understand why she was living here, all locked up.`
`Grandfather had seized Beatrice's soul, shut it up in a body of flesh,`
` and then shut that up in a hidden mansion.`
`However, since she had lived here since the time of her birth, she couldn't even understand who she was,`
` or why she lived shut up in there...`
`...W-Wait, wait.`
`Who would take such a stupid story seriously?`
`Why don't I change my interpretation?`
`...In other words, couldn't it be something like this?`
`Grandfather met Beatrice.`
`He then fell in love with her and courted her, but she didn't accept him.`
`Then, he flew into a rage and shut her up inside this hidden mansion.`
`Beatrice tried to escape, but no matter what she did, she couldn't succeed,`
` ...so she finally chose her own death.`
`...And then, ......no.`
`...Maybe there was a girl who looked just like Beatrice...no, a baby.`
`Grandfather raised this child with care.`
`But maybe he didn't view this child as his daughter.`
`'The soul was once again shut up in a cage of flesh.'`
`Those words probably meant that he didn't view this kid as her child, `
`...but as her reincarnation.`
` Maybe that's what it meant.`
`If you interpret it that way, even a story this weird might make a little sense...`
`...No, no, no.`
`This might be some bullshit Beato cooked up to confuse me.`
`As if I could accept any of this...!`
` In the first place...Kuwadorian, was it?`
` There's no proof whatsoever that a hidden mansion actually existed.`
`Couldn't this be something she just fabricated on the spot?`
`"`
`A hidden mansion called Kuwadorian does exist in the forest of Rokkenjima`
`.`
` That is the place we were just talking about."`
`"......Huh?`
` R-Red?!"`
`Ronove used the red to say that Kuwadorian actually existed.`
`...Did that mean the same thing as the red Beato used?`
`"I may not look it, but I am a demon.`
` ...Please keep this a secret from Milady, yes?"`
`"...S-Sure!"`
`Beato, who knew I would try to trip her up, had grown extremely cautious when using red.`
`To think that Ronove could also use the red...`
`However, it was the red of a crafty man.`
`I didn't know how far I could accept it, `
`but anyway, I might be able to get some kind of hint out of it...`
`"So that Beato relaxing in the garden of Kuwadorian...and that conversation she had with Grandfather...were the truth?"`
`"Yes.`
` It is the truth.`
` In the past, `
`the pair actually had a conversation like that in this place`
`."`
`"Th-Thanks a lot.`
` I'll ask for some more red.`
` You said she was born from a homunculus,`
` but does that kind of unscientific, magical thing actually exist?!"`
`"I am unable to answer that question.`
` After all, doing so would cause a stalemate."`
`"...A stalemate??`
` What does that mean?"`
`"It's a chess term referring to a state in which, similar to a 'perpetual check', `
`any further progress in a game becomes impossible.`
` This would be the opposite of an endless repetition of moves, `
`because all moves would disappear, and it would bring about a kind of deadlock.`
` In chess, this would lead to a draw, just as a perpetual check would.`
` ...However, there can be no draws in the game between you and Milady.`
` Therefore, I am unable to answer a question that would bring about a stalemate."`
`"......You obviously want to confuse me by saying incomprehensible stuff,`
` but simply put, you're trying to dodge the question, because you can't use the red to say that something magical like a homunculus exists, right?"`
`"If I were to say in red that 'a witch exists', what would you do, Battler-sama?"`
`"......Mu.`
` ...Whether or not I believe that is what our whole fight's about, right?`
` If I was told that point blank,`
` it'd be game over."`
`"If I said 'a witch exists' in red, you would have no room for argument.`
` However, since the reason would never have been made clear to you, Battler-sama, you probably wouldn't accept it.`
` However, after being told that in red, you would have no room for argument and would not have been shown any proof."`
`"In this situation,`
` even though you wouldn't be able to admit defeat, you would have no way to make a counterargument, and it would become a deadlock.`
` Even though checkmate would not have been reached, there would be no existing moves left."`
`"Since you would not be able to play your next hand, it would never become Milady's turn, `
`and the game would stop there for all eternity.`
` As a result, Milady would be unable to force you to submit.`
` ...That would be a deadlock situation.`
` In order to avoid that, `
`I am unable to answer questions of this nature in red."`
`"...So, to say it quickly, you're saying point-blank questions are prohibited?`
` Well, that's true, I guess.`
` If I were told 'a witch exists', I'd have to give up from the start."`
`"I am pleased that you understand.`
` I believe we might be able to work together if you ask your questions in a different form."`
`"...Can you help me with that line Beatrice dodged when I told her to repeat it?`
` About the number of people on this island?"`
`"If Milady held back on repeating it, then of course I cannot respond.`
` As Milady's furniture, I am unable to be too forward."`
`Ronove made an exaggerated gesture, trying to act like a loyal retainer.`
` This guy's so shameless.`
`"Heh.`
` Just when I thought you might actually be useful.`
` ...I'll give up on that and search for a different question.`
` ...That's right.`
` I was forgetting to check something important.`
` ......This is a story about Beato's memories, right?`
` When did it happen?`
` It couldn't be happening right now, right?"`
`"Correct.`
` This is the world of 1967`
`.`
` The world of 19 years previous."`
`"......Hmmmmm..."`
`Let's try rearranging this story again.`
`I wonder if it couldn't be something like this...`
`Grandfather fell in unrequited love with a person called Beatrice.`
`Then, he confined her in this hidden mansion and continued to court her.`
`But she was stubborn and didn't give in.`
`Eventually, she grew pessimistic about being able to escape from here...`
`and probably...committed suicide.`
`'!s0`
`...her soul was put in a homunculus and...`
`No, no, if I accept that, it's the same as accepting the witch.`
`I can interpret that part like this.`
`She probably...had a posthumous daughter.`
`Grandfather must've believed that her soul had been placed in a new physical body...`
`and might have thought that the child was the reincarnation of Beatrice...`
`...That means, at least 19 years ago, Beato existed on this island as the 19th person,`
` ...umm...`
`"...I'm starting to get confused.`
` ...Either way, we can't do more than speculate.`
` The only thing we can say for sure in red...`
`is that in 1967, in a hidden mansion on Rokkenjima, Beatrice existed as a human.`
` That's all."`
`"That is correct.`
` In 1967, in a hidden mansion on Rokkenjima, Beatrice-sama existed as a human`
`."`
`"Oh, thank you.`
` That really helps."`
`"Congratulations.`
` With this, you have made clear the existence of the piece known as the 19th person.`
` A 19th human for you to blame, just as you longed for."`
`"...A sacrificial sheep upon which you can shift the blame of any crime.`
` How amusing that it happens to be Milady.`
` Pu ku ku ku."`
`Ronove laughed indiscreetly.`
`Somehow, I didn't like how he put that, so I didn't feel like laughing along with him.`
`"...That's right.`
` There's that thing Aunt Rosa said.`
` ...Beatrice is dead?`
` 'I killed her'?`
` What did that mean...?"`
`"As for that, it may be faster to see the actual circumstances rather than listen to me tell you.`
` Let us advance the clock a little more."`
`Ronove pulled a stylish pocket watch from his pocket and touched the watch stem.`
`As soon as he did, I saw gold butterflies gather behind his back and take the form of a person.`
`...Was it Beato?!`
` I quickly realized that it was someone else.`
`It was her.`
` That oldest sister of the Seven Stakes, who loved tormenting me more than her three meals a day.`
`...If I don't consider myself lucky to see that sexy ass, I won't be able to keep up with their torture game...`
`"Ronove-sama.`
` So, you're still here.`
` This is an urgent call from Beatrice-sama."`
`"My, my,`
` what kind of urgent business could it be?`
` ...It's seems my chat with Battler-sama has run a tad long."`
`"Well then, Battler-sama, if you will excuse me.`
` Please continue to enjoy your game with Milady."`
`"Yeah, yeah.`
` I'll enjoy it as best I can.`
` ...'Cause my conversations go a lot more smoothly when they're with you, as opposed to her.`
` And you're more gracious with the red too.`
` Come and talk again any time you like."`
`"......Battler-sama,`
` despite how I look, I am Milady's furniture.`
` ...I can do nothing that Milady does not desire.`
` What I said in red was something that normally should have come from Milady's mouth.`
` ...I did nothing more than announce the red truth in Milady's place as she sulked."`
`"So she really was sulking then?`
` Ihihihi!"`
`"Pu ku ku ku."`
`Seeing me and Ronove incomprehensibly hitting it off, that Stake nee-chan cocked her head curiously.`
`"Ronove-sama,`
` we are keeping Beatrice-sama waiting.`
` Let us hurry."`
`"Yes, I shall go immediately.`
` Well, Battler-sama, I will see you later.`
` ...It appears that we have finally started getting along.`
` As I thought, I have the feeling we'll manage to become good friends."`
`"Sure, if you mean partners at gossiping behind Beato's back."`
`"Ronove-sama!"`
`"Yes, yes.`
` If you will excuse me."`
`Maybe she didn't like seeing him act so friendly with me, or maybe she really had been told to hurry.`
`When the Stake nee-chan let out a thunderous cry, Ronove laughed frivolously and disappeared, as if running away...`
`"...Hmph.`
` Why am I, the oldest sister of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, being summoned for menial tasks like this?!`
` ...Even though Beato-sama could've told one of the younger sisters, who look like they've got nothing better to do. Sheesh...!"`
`"Why so grumpy, nee-chan.`
` If you're hungry, eat a cookie or something.`
` Why don't I give you the last one?`
` Ihihi!"`
`"...Hmmmm?`
` How thoughtful.`
` Then, shall I take one?"`
`I casually pushed the snack plate with the last remaining cookie over to her.`
`"Thank you."`
`As though coming as a period at the end of the sentence, a sharp sound pierced the table...`
`The nails on three of her fingers extended, grew sharp...`
`and pierced the space between my fingers on the hand that was pushing the plate, missing them by a hair's breadth.`
`...It had happened in an instant, ...so for a while, I didn't even realize that her fingernails had grown.`
`The tips of those sharp nails were like blades with a red manicure.`
`...The spaces between the bases of my fingers hurt sharply.`
`...Those razor-like blades had been plunged into the table a hair's breadth away from the back of my hand and my fingers...`
`Because of those three blades, I was unable to even let my careless right hand tremble, and by now, all I could do was let a bead of cold sweat drip down.`
`"......Whoa.`
` ...Nee-chan, isn't it about time you cut your nails?"`
`"It's Lucifer.`
` ...That is my glorious name.`
` The honored furniture who serves Beatrice-sama, and the oldest sister of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory."`
`"......I'm not like my disgraceful younger sisters.`
` If you don't show proper respect, you will regret it."`
`"...And why would I regret it, exactly?`
` Can't really think of a reason."`
`"......Heheheheheh.`
` Stupid kid.`
` ...Do you really wanna play with me that much?`
` Was it that unforgettable?`
` I'll thrust my stake deep, deep into you and let you enjoy being gouged to the fullest, okay...?`
` Heheheheheheheheehehehhh...!"`
`"...Dammit.`
` Some day I'll have you down on the floor and say the same thing."`
`"Oh, really?`
` Wow, I can't wait.`
` Hehheheheheheheh...`
` ...Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!!"`
`Rosa eventually regained her calm.`
`The men wanted to hurry her into talking faster, but Kyrie intervened.`
`...If something like that really had happened, ...then it would have been a terrible experience that Rosa wouldn't want to remember.`
`After taking several deep breaths with her hand over her chest, it seemed that she had more or less resolved herself to talk...`
`"...How old was I then, I wonder...`
` ...Middle school probably, ...though I don't remember well.`
` Anyway, I think I was about that age..."`
`"Which means...maybe about 20 years ago?"`
`"Back then, my grades weren't very good, and Mother was always angry at me.`
` ...I tried to do my best in my own way, `
`but I couldn't match up to Mother's expectations at all..."`
`"...Mother was always very strict with Rosa.`
` I sympathized with her at the time."`
`"Hmph.`
` You say that, even though you were always talking behind her back."`
`"Would you give it a rest, Eva?`
` And then?`
` Where did you meet Beatrice, Rosa-san?!"`
`"Hideyoshi-san, you mustn't rush her now.`
` ...It's okay, Rosa-san.`
` Tell us at your own pace."`
`"......Thank you.`
` ...It was a day I'd been harshly scolded by Mother."`
`Even though my tutor had promised to keep it a secret, `
`...apparently, they told Mother all about how I had complained.`
`Mother scolded me brutally, saying my name was a disgrace to the Ushiromiya family.`
`...Of course, I was doing the best I could.`
`But I had none of Krauss nii-san's dignity,`
` I couldn't get excellent grades like Eva nee-san,`
` and I had no leadership abilities like Rudolf nii-san.`
`...I never stood out, didn't particularly excel at anything,`
` and I found myself asking why I'd even been born into the Ushiromiya family.`
`I began to question more and more why I'd even been born at all.`
`...This is what happened on the day I experienced my mind going blank for the first time...`
`For the first time in my life, `
`...I realized that in addition to facing or surrendering to my problems,`
` I had the third choice of running away.`
`Though I say 'run away', there was no way I could've left Rokkenjima and gone somewhere else.`
`But, anyway, I wanted to run away from the mansion and my own self at that time.`
`...In a way, it was like a kid running away from home, or maybe a passive sort of suicide...`
`"...I wanted to disappear.`
` Or maybe it was that child-like form of resistance where I tried to make my parents worry by disappearing...`
` ......I childishly thought that if I went into the center of the forest, escaped from the Ushiromiya house,`
` and maybe became lost, then I'd make them worry and teach them a lesson."`
`"And then, ...you went into the forest that you were told never to enter?"`
`"...Yes.`
` After reaching the beach, I followed alongside the ocean.`
` ...I didn't have any particular reason,`
` ...but I felt that, if I went around to the opposite side of the island, there might be a place there that no one knew about, `
`which might become a hidden house just for me."`
`"If you go around by the beach, that'd be impossible.`
` It becomes a cliff partway, right?`
` There's no way you could pass that way."`
`"...Of course.`
` So, I kept going wherever I could, which kept taking me deeper and deeper inland.`
` ...It's a horrible forest without any paths, but that was comforting to me then.`
` ...If I could make it through such a dangerous forest, then I'd be that much further away from the Ushiromiya family."`
`"......How shameful.`
` If you were scolded because of your grades, all you had to do was work harder."`
`"You mustn't say that.`
` Doesn't Rosa have her talent as a designer instead?"`
`Literally speaking, he was covering for Rosa,`
` but everyone knew that Rosa's company hadn't been profitable.`
`"Quit it.`
` This is no time for sarcasm.`
` ...So, you managed to end up there by coincidence...?`
` At Beatrice's...`
`hidden mansion."`
`Rosa nodded weakly...`
`"About how far did you walk?`
` Could you show it to us on a map...?`
` Natsuhi-san, do you have a map of this island?"`
`"No, there isn't one here now..."`
`"It wouldn't help.`
` I was just walking randomly.`
` Even if you gave me a map, I wouldn't know.`
` ...And 20 years have passed since then.`
` I probably couldn't reach it again even if I went into the forest..."`
`"......Hmmmmmm..."`
`Several people let out dejected sighs.`
`It was vividly clear that in their haste, they'd thought some hint related to the witch's epitaph...`
`or maybe even the gold itself might be resting there.`
`"On Rokkenjima, only the land around the mansion is ready to be developed on.`
` ...The rest is completely uncultivated, and it'd probably take a lot of work to survey the entire island."`
`"But just knowing that it actually exists is helpful.`
` It would take some money, but if we enlisted an aerial photography company to investigate,`
` or asked the businessman who constructed this mansion about what happened at the time,`
` we could probably find some way to search for it."`
`"That's right.`
` ...At least we have more options now, as opposed to when we weren't sure it existed."`
`"...Indeed.`
` It may be worth investigating right away."`
`"The siblings will do that investigation together.`
` We won't leave you on your own, Nii-san."`
`It wasn't yet certain that the gold was hidden in that secret mansion,`
` but the sparks seemed to have started flying between Krauss and Eva already.`
`"Give it a rest for now, you two.`
` Rosa, please continue."`
`"......Yes."`
`Blindly, randomly, I kept running, on and on.`
`Suddenly, I came across something I thought was an animal trail.`
`I was very tired and had no idea how far I'd walked,`
` so at that time, I naturally took the easiest path.`
`As I did, ......suddenly, right before my eyes, a very, very tall fence appeared.`
`It was a fence wonderfully adorned in a gothic style.`
`For an instant, I thought I'd gotten turned around and returned to the original mansion.`
`Of course, there were fences around the mansion to stop us from entering the forest.`
`But this fence was decorated differently, ...and moreover, it was very tall.`
`It probably reached a full two stories up.`
`It was covered with ivy and created a mysterious, solemn atmosphere...`
`At the time, ...I believed in the legend of the witch of the forest, Beatrice.`
`I had been told that she was frightening,`
` but some of the servants told me that she'd sometimes help you if you respected her.`
`...Since I had little confidence in those days,`
` I believed the only way I could be saved was by receiving her help.`
`That's why I thought what I did.`
`...I believed that this was the fence of the mansion belonging to Beatrice, the witch of the forest.`
`I thought that if I could meet with Beatrice, she'd definitely save me.`
`So I decided to try going in.`
`But the fence was very, very tall, and it didn't look like I'd be able go over it.`
`So I chose to walk around it.`
`I thought that if I did, I'd eventually reach a gate.`
`But it wasn't that easy.`
`The fence had an incredible length to match its incredible height, and no matter how far I went, I didn't reach a corner.`
`It might have encircled a massive area,`
` ...or maybe I just had that impression because my child's legs made it difficult to walk in the forest.`
`Anyway, I couldn't find a gate for a while,`
` and I started to feel sad, as though the witch had rejected me...`
`As I did, I eventually came upon a large tree, whose twisted root had bent the fence.`
`It might get my clothes dirty, but if I crawled, it looked like I'd be able to sneak in...`
`"......And there you found the hidden mansion?"`
`"I don't know if it was the hidden mansion we've been talking about...`
` Still, at the very least, it wasn't a place that we know of."`
`It wasn't as though I came out into a garden as soon as I passed the fence.`
`I had to continue through a lot more uncultivated forest after that.`
`As I did, ...the forest suddenly opened up.`
`And what appeared there...`
`...was an unbelievably fantastical scene.`
`To think that, on Rokkenjima, where I thought only we lived, `
`...there could be such a wonderful mansion hidden away...`
`A beautiful flower garden spanned the front of the mansion.`
`It was a flower garden of a completely different design from the rose garden we know so well, and it was very lovely.`
`Of course, the mansion was also wonderful.`
`...It was a couple sizes smaller than ours,`
` but it was still elegant and adorable at the same time.`
`Then, ......I saw her figure.`
`I saw her sitting in a garden chair positioned to give a view of the flower garden, wearing an elegant dress.`
`It was that black dress embroidered in gold that we would later know from that portrait.`
`...I hadn't seen an elegant dress like that except in fairy tales and on the stage of musicals.`
`...For a person to be wearing it as her normal clothes...`
` That in itself seemed quite fantastical.`
`That mysterious scene was enough to make me lose my sense of reality.`
`If someone had told me then that it was a dream,`
` I might have nodded obediently and waited to wake up in my bed...`
`I had forgotten to hide myself in my shock, so she eventually spotted me.`
`At first, her expression was quite listless,`
` but when she noticed me, her eyes opened very wide.`
`...It was only natural, considering that a guest she didn't know had suddenly appeared.`
`I lowered my head automatically, planning to greet her and apologize for entering without permission...`
`"......Who are you?`
` The new gardener?"`
`Those were the first words she said to me.`
`...I grew slightly calmer.`
`Because I realized that we could talk to each other.`
`Because I hadn't been turned into a frog just by meeting her eyes, like a terrifying witch in a fairy tale.`
`"...I-`
`I'm sorry.`
` ...I shouldn't have entered the garden without permission..."`
`".........`
`...Who are you?`
` Name yourself."`
`"I-I am Ushiromiya Rosa."`
`"...Ushiromiya...`
` .........Hoh.`
` ...One of Kinzo's family?"`
`"Huh?`
` Ah, yes!`
` I'm Kinzo's daughter.`
` G-Good afternoon...!"`
`I was a little surprised.`
`...After all, Father was a great man, feared by everyone.`
`And yet, she had spoken of him without using honorifics.`
`So, I was immediately terrified of her.`
`...After all, `
`if she could refer to my fearsome father that way, she must be a witch with incredible power.`
`After staring at me curiously, she beckoned me to come over.`
`Frightened as I was, I obeyed.`
`...After all, I thought she might really turn me into a frog.`
`...The closer I got, the stronger that fear became.`
`After all, ...as I keep saying over and over,`
` ......that woman and her dress and the flower garden and the mansion...`
`that whole picture was so fantastical and beautiful that it seemed separate from reality.`
`It probably wouldn't have surprised me at all to learn that she really was a witch...`
`And I really was lucky.`
`She hadn't turned me into a frog.`
`As I awkwardly stood there, stock still, she motioned to an open chair and urged me to sit down.`
`"Have a seat.`
` Welcoming and speaking to those who visit this garden for the first time is my sole pleasure.`
` ......Of course, I have no pleasures other than that."`
`As she said this, she let an unhappy smile show for just an instant.`
`Because I was full of a strange mix of tension and excitement, I rudely asked her a question all of a sudden.`
`'!sd`
`...are you the witch of the forest, `
`...Beatrice?"`
`"Indeed.`
` I am Beatrice."`
`"As I thought.`
` Beatrice actually existed..."`
`"...Did she really look like the portrait?"`
`"...Yes.`
` Really, just like the portrait."`
`"So, `
`...she wasn't just a witch from Father's imagination..."`
`"Well, what did you talk with her about?"`
`"...As she prepared some tea, she asked me all kinds of things about myself.`
` ...First, she was surprised that I had come through the forest.`
` It seems she believed that many dangerous wolves lived outside the fence."`
`"...So when I told her I'd come through the forest to reach this place, she was shocked.`
` She asked how I had managed to escape from the wolves.`
` Did I give them a biscuit and they let me go?`
` Or did I cover myself in a magic cloak? ...That kind of thing."`
`"Wahahaha.`
` ...That sure sounds like a witch.`
` What an interesting person."`
`"Quiet, dear.`
` ......This goes way back, `
`but didn't Father threaten us, saying we should never get near the forest because of the wolves that lived there?"`
`"Yes, he did say something of the sort.`
` Ridiculous.`
` Even though Japanese wolves went extinct long ago.`
` Truly a trick to fool children."`
`"I don't remember though.`
` Did Dad really tell us something like that...?`
` It was the witch of the forest, right?`
` I don't think I've ever heard about wolves."`
`"This was when you were still in elementary school.`
` Don't you remember?`
` Back then, you actually said you thought it'd be cool to try petting the wolves.`
` Father immediately gave up the wolf story and changed it to the story about the witch.`
` Seriously, what transparent lies they were, ahahahahaha."`
`"Hahahahah.`
` At the time, the witch story had a much more immediate effect on you, Rudolf, than the wolves.`
` I remember it well.`
` Don't you remember those nights when you clung to my back?"`
`"...*giggle*`
` I see, so even Rudolf-san used to be that cute."`
`"Shut up.`
` I was just a kid."`
`"...Well, at any rate,`
` if Father's the one who shut Beatrice up in there, it makes sense that he'd use the same story about wolves.`
` To him, the vast forest of Rokkenjima was a wall that shouldn't be crossed, dividing his two incompatible worlds: `
`the Ushiromiya family and his mistress's mansion."`
`"Considering the height of that fence, it does sound as though Father turned that whole area, garden and all, into a giant jail cell.`
` ...Just like a border dividing his two separate worlds."`
`"...Wolves aside, could there have been some breed of stray dogs there at the time?`
` Perhaps the fence was there to protect against those."`
`"There aren't any wolves or stray dogs on Rokkenjima.`
` That fence was probably...`
`a border between us and Beatrice."`
`"But if she innocently believed that story about wolves, that's pretty...naive.`
` That's nothin' like what I'd expect a witch to do."`
`"...You're right.`
` I sensed that too.`
` ...She was very pompous, just like my image of a witch,`
` ...but she was somehow very childish.`
` She was...how should I put it...too straightforward.`
` ...She gave me the impression that she didn't know anything about the world."`
`"It was as though...she'd come from some fairy-tale land.`
` ...She really was a strange person."`
`"...What happened after that?`
` ...Did you end up talking about Dad at all?"`
`"Yes.`
` Once every few days, usually on an arranged day but sometimes suddenly, `
`Father would casually appear and they'd drink together, or else take a walk together or something.`
` She said she just happened to be alone on the day I visited."`
`"I see.`
` An obvious mistress, you might say.`
` ...My, my.`
` I don't know how much younger she was, but good for Father."`
`"...We can be sure this was no indecent relationship."`
`"Idiot, there's no way a lover's meeting between a man and a woman wouldn't have some sensuality.`
` What happened next?`
` What did you talk about after that?"`
`"......I'd already introduced myself, so I asked about her.`
` ...When I did, the atmosphere quickly grew depressing.`
` ...How should I put it... She seemed to grow listless and lonely.`
` ...It was that same expression I saw on her face in the beginning."`
`"Well, she was his hidden mistress, after all.`
` If she just walked around wherever she liked, Mom might've found her.`
` ...I'll bet she was practically under house arrest."`
`"Even though she had beautiful clothes, a beautiful mansion, and a garden, she must've felt pretty cramped.`
` I'll bet she had it rough.`
` ......And then?"`
`"She was definitely worried about something.`
` ...I remember feeling really sad myself,`
` when I realized it wasn't something I could do anything about by talking to her."`
`"......She seemed to forget I was even there.`
` ...She gazed vaguely off into the distance...and was silent for a long, long time.`
` ...I thought I must've said something wrong,`
` ...but it didn't seem to be the type of atmosphere where I could apologize, `
`...so I remained silent too for a long, long time, until she remembered I was there..."`
`And then, ...she muttered unexpectedly.`
`"......Are there really no wolves beyond the fence?"`
`"...Huh?`
` Y-Yes, that's right.`
` I've never seen wolves, not even in a zoo."`
`"What is a zoo?"`
`"Ah, ...it's a place where they keep all kinds of animals.`
` They're full of rare animals like elephants and giraffes and pandas."`
`".........`
`...So, ...there aren't any wolves in a zoo?`
` Then, umm, ...it might not be so scary."`
`"Even if there were wolves, all of the animals are put in cages, so it's safe.`
` That's why you can safely look at them and learn about them."`
`The mighty witch of the forest was apparently terrified of wolves.`
`I remember it looked pretty funny to me, at the time.`
`"......`
`...How am I any different?"`
`"......Huh?"`
`She didn't know about zoos.`
`I explained how fun zoos could be, `
`but it was very difficult for a person like her, who had never visited one, to understand...`
`On the contrary, as I explained it to her, her expression grew increasingly dismal.`
`...She couldn't see the difference.`
`Apparently, even though she lived in an elegant mansion that was surrounded by a high fence and seemed to lack for nothing,`
` she couldn't see how she was any different from animals shut up in cages...`
`"Who am I?`
` ...Everyone calls me Beatrice.`
` ...And that does indeed seem to be the name of a great witch, as you say."`
`"...But that isn't me.`
` I cannot use any magic.`
` ...I simply have the soul of that witch sealed inside my body."`
`"......?"`
`There was definitely something odd about her.`
`Beyond just being cut off from the world,`
` it seemed she truly believed that magic exists.`
`I think she talked about lots of weird things, but I don't remember the details.`
`All I thought was that...`
`this might be a person to be pitied.`
`She was unable to leave this mansion of her own free will, a prisoner without even realizing it.`
`...And she didn't know anything about the outside world, didn't even understand who she was.`
`...She probably vaguely realized that she was to be pitied.`
`But since she didn't know anything, she seemed incapable of recognizing her own unhappiness.`
`Long ago, when I told Nee-san that I felt sorry for a bird in a cage, she said this:`
`'A bird that only knows about the inside of the cage doesn't long for the outside'.`
`But this wasn't a bird.`
`She really was a person.`
`Even if she'd never been outside the cage, she understood that there was more to the world.`
`So, `
`......I invited her.`
`"Do you want to try...`
`...going outside the fence?"`
`"......Th-There really aren't any wolves?"`
`"There aren't.`
` You'll definitely be safe."`
`"............`
`...I want to leave.`
` But the gate is always closed."`
`"There's the place I came in through.`
` It's got a crack you can slip through."`
`"...If we go through there, will there be a world outside?"`
`"Yes."`
`".........There really aren't any wolves?"`
`"*giggle*`
` Right, there aren't any."`
`"............"`
`I'd only planned on inviting her to go on a short walk,`
` ...but she kept looking over her shoulder at the mansion, as though she was seriously worrying over the decision.`
`Then, I learned what she was preparing herself for.`
`"......I...have had enough of this place.`
` ...I want to go...outside.`
` And I want to know...who I am, what's happening in this world,`
` ...and why I was born."`
`I didn't know what her life had been like before then.`
`It was probably something she couldn't express easily.`
`If it was harsh, she just had to say she wanted to escape.`
`If it was sweet, she just had to say she'd stay.`
`For example, `
`maybe it was like how a hot fireplace on a winter day makes the air get thicker and thicker, giving you a headache...`
`Even though you know you shouldn't keep things the way they are, you still need courage to open the window and be tormented by the cold wind...`
`She was starting to realize that she couldn't stay there forever.`
`She was starting to realize that she had to go outside someday.`
`But, since she didn't know about the outside world,`
` she must have needed courage to take that unspeakable first step outside...`
`And despite that, she had made her decision.`
`She'd voiced her decision to go outside, a decision she was probably making for the first time in her life.`
`...I hesitated for a moment.`
`Father had decided that she should live here.`
`She was like Father's beloved bird in a cage.`
`If I just let her escape,`
` ...Father might scold me harshly...`
`"I want to see."`
`"......Hmm?`
` See what?"`
`"I want to see...a zoo."`
`".........Ah."`
`I was just a little surprised when she finally gave me a gentle smile.`
`Could that have been...`
`a farsightedness brought about by her decision to venture out from her cage?`
`It was a smile so gentle, I couldn't imagine that it had come from that once dark face...`
`"...When I speak with you, I keep hearing about things I don't know.`
` ...I don't even know about this thing called school, nor do I know about zoos.`
` I don't know about movie theaters.`
` I don't know about amusement parks.`
` ......And I feel, from the bottom of my heart, that I want to know about those things.`
` ...Will you take me to see them?"`
`"Huh? ...Y-Yes."`
`...I was nervous about how I could keep it a secret from Father,`
` ...but her face looked so happy, so I went along with her and nodded.`
`But she seemed not to notice the meaning behind my vague smile.`
`She seemed to believe that I'd really take her to all those places.`
`She was pure and genuine.`
`...She'd probably never been tricked by anyone.`
`No, ...maybe it's better to say that she'd never learned how to doubt.`
`Her smile was somehow radiant...and yet pathetic.`
`...I wanted to find a way to grant her modest wish.`
`"I...have had enough of Beatrice.`
` I want to know who I am.`
` I want to start out as a new human, not Beatrice.`
` So, I want you to take me away from here.`
` ......I don't need tea anymore.`
` I don't need this dress.`
` I won't meet with Kinzo again.`
` ...Please, take me from here, `
`Rosa."`
`However, that responsibility was one that a child like me couldn't hope to fully bear.`
`Still, when I saw her serious gaze, along with that brilliant smile that made it look as though a possessing spirit had left her,`
` ...I could feel a little courage start to rise up inside me.`
`This was definitely something that would get me into a lot of trouble.`
` ...And yet, it was definitely the right thing to do.`
`'!s0`
`...but I'll take her away from here.`
`Of course, I won't be able to talk to Father, and not Mother either.`
`......Should I talk to Onii-sama or Onee-sama?`
`No, what about that reliable Genji-san...`
`or, that's right, what about Kumasawa-san, to whom I can always talk when I'm in trouble.`
`I'm sure they'll be able to do something.`
`Anyway, for now, I'll take her out of here.`
`This was already a place she didn't want to be.`
`...So, I took her to the crack in the fence and led her outside.`
`She was all nervous, checking to make sure there were no wolves around,`
` but once that fear disappeared, `
`even just walking around this dense forest seemed to be fun somehow.`
`Every time she found something, she'd ask me about it.`
`And they were all really trivial things.`
`...What's that flower?`
`What's that leaf?`
`And that sound?`
` And that smell?`
`It really was like the inside of that fence had been her entire world.`
`So, now that she'd traveled beyond the limits of her world......`
`...It's strange.`
`When I first saw her, I really thought she was the witch herself, relaxing inside the witch's mansion.`
`But now, it was different.`
` Or actually, the complete opposite.`
`...She'd left a world she'd believed to be finite...and was overjoyed at the realization that the world was endless, something she'd never thought of before.`
`So everything she saw was new.`
`...It was almost as though she was the one who had been thrown into a fairy tale.`
`If she was Alice, then I felt almost like a rabbit holding a watch...`
`To her, it was probably a really fun walk, filled to the brim with excitement.`
`...But I was actually at a loss at what to do.`
`...After all, I walked randomly to get there.`
`Of course I didn't know the way back to our mansion.`
`There were no lights in the forest, and I hadn't brought a flashlight.`
`I realized it would be terrible if it got dark while we were still like this...and grew impatient.`
`She was too innocent,`
` and apparently, she couldn't understand at all how frightening it would be to face the night inside the forest.`
`But I was the one who brought her outside.`
`...I had to take responsiblity somehow and resolve this situation.`
`So, I had a thought.`
` ...Let's go out to the ocean for now.`
`If we then follow the beach around, we should eventually make it back to the mansion.`
`However, that was much more of a problem than I'd imagined.`
`...I didn't have a map or a compass.`
`There was no way I could walk in a straight line through an uncultivated forest, and I immediately lost my sense of direction.`
`I already had no clue which trail I had come by...and was completely lost...`
`At this rate, night would definitely fall before I had a clue where to walk.`
`But this was no time to cry.`
`After all, that woman following behind me was so innocent and having so much fun.`
` ...So, I definitely had to lead the way through this forest, `
`for the sake of her smile as well.`
`Gritting my teeth so that she didn't see me looking troubled,`
` I pushed my way through the woods, advancing down a path that wasn't a path.`
`Then, after going through various troubles, I fortunately managed reach the ocean...`
`At that time, I still didn't even have a clue where I was on the island,`
` but for the time being, I was just a little reassured, `
`realizing that if I just went around this way, I would surely be able to return to the mansion.`
`However, though I had reached the ocean, we were at the top of a rock cliff.`
` The beach was far below us.`
`I was tired from walking around the forest for so long,`
` so I figured that an open area, even a rocky beach, would probably be much easier to walk in.`
`So, I suggested that we go down that rocky cliff somehow.`
`...It looked pretty dangerous, but I figured there was no other way.`
`However, Beatrice agreed to my plan without any doubts.`
`...Even though she was probably older than me,`
` ...she meekly obeyed, almost as though she were some kind of chick who thought I was her mother.`
`I searched to see if there was some part of the cliff I'd be able to get down.`
`...Then, I found a place where the cliff had fallen over and made a slope.`
`...It looked a little dangerous,`
` but if I went down using both hands and both legs, like I was crawling, I thought it'd probably be okay.`
`"...Let's go down here.`
` It'll be dangerous if we aren't careful,`
` but if we go down to the beach and walk along it, I don't think we'll have to worry about being lost anymore."`
`"Indeed.`
` If that's what you're doing, I'll go too.`
` Even getting lost is fun for me.`
` Quite amusing."`
`......She really had no sense of danger.`
`There was probably no doubt that she'd lived a life without discomfort.`
`Even though she knew it would get dark when night fell,`
` she couldn't imagine how dangerous the inside of a forest could be without a light.`
`Furthermore, it seemed that she couldn't grasp at all how dangerous it might be if she fell from the cliff.`
`I warned her repeatedly to be careful.`
`I cautiously examined our potential route down.`
`...It seemed to be...quite a long drop.`
`I think it might've been about 10 meters down.`
`If you looked at it from the bottom up, it would probably have looked shorter than the roof of the mansion.`
`But looking from the top, it felt almost like staring down from the observation room on Tokyo Tower.`
`But Beatrice still appeared to be completely without fear.`
`...It felt as though she had never even been taught that high places were dangerous.`
`...No, maybe she believed that she was a witch...`
`and that she could fly, so there wasn't any need to worry.`
`"Please be careful.`
` ...We're...pretty high up."`
`"Indeed.`
` I shall be careful.`
` It looks like we can get to the ocean if we go down.`
` Is there an aquarium there?"`
`"No, there aren't any aquariums on this island.`
` But there should be lots of fish in the sea."`
`"I see.`
` So there are fish.`
` Are there...umm, whales and dolphins and penguins, like you talked about?"`
`"No, you'd have to go to an aquarium for those.`
` ...And you'd have to leave this island to find an aquarium."`
`"Is that so?`
` ...Well, I'm looking forward to it.`
` What kind of fish are whales?"`
`"Umm, ...they're really big fish...huh, aren't they mammals?`
` And they spit seawater into the air."`
`"Hoh.`
` And dolphins?"`
`"Umm, they're really smart fish, and...oh, weren't they also mammals?`
` They're really smart and can be taught tricks and stuff."`
`"Hohhoh.`
` Then what about penguins?"`
`"Umm, ...uh, weren't they birds...?"`
`"What's going on?`
` We're talking about aquariums, but none of these things seem to be fish..."`
`"Ummm, uhhh...`
` Well, um, there aren't just fish. It's full of all kinds of things that live in the ocean."`
`"Hohhoh.`
` I really am looking forward to that...`
`......nn-"`
`'!s0`
`She let out what might've been a funny, `
`...rushed and short cry...`
`no, it was probably a scream.`
`It came right out of the blue.`
`...Her body separated from the cliff...and silently fell.`
`I immediately wanted to say something to her.`
`I wanted to say 'Didn't I tell you to be more careful?!'`
`...It was the thought of a child.`
`It was how a child immediately gets mad when something bad happens, trying to find an excuse to show it wasn't their fault.`
`Of course, I said it out loud.`
`Are you okay?`
` Didn't I warn you over and over...?`
`".........So,`
` ...she fell from the cliff, `
`...and then what?"`
`"........."`
`"...What happened to her,`
` ...Rosa?"`
`Rosa fell silent.`
`...Her gaze dropped to her feet, ...as though she were seeing through the floor into some disgusting memory...`
`"She...died, didn't she...?"`
`Eva's brutal words were the ones Rosa had most wanted to avoid.`
`And when she was hit with them, ...she screamed in resignation.`
`"Yes, she died!!`
` It was a rocky beach, with lots of sharp, dangerous rocks exposed!!`
` Her eyes were still open, and an incredible amount of blood kept pouring out, ...quickly spreading out until it looked like a red carpet...!`
`I spoke to her, shook her!!`
` But she refused to respond, not even a blink...no, she wouldn't even close her eyelids!!`
` It was my fault!`
` She was wearing a dress, remember?!`
` Even though I knew her outfit was difficult to move in, I said we should go down the cliff!!`
` She was incredibly innocent, so she obeyed what I said without any doubts...!!"`
`"...How long do you plan on remaining dead?`
` Open your eyes already.`
` Darn you, turning into a lump of meat all by yourself while I'm gone."`
`"I was just flirting with your ass nee-chan friends.`
` ...More importantly, what the heck's going on here?"`
`"Well,`
` as you can see, `
`...I missed my footing, fell down,`
`'!d800!s1`
`"What the hell...?`
` ......Even though you showed up as the 19th person, `
`...you were already dead...?"`
`"Don't mess with me, that's impossible...!`
` Aunt Rosa was a kid, and she was panicked.`
` And it's not like a doctor was there.`
` She probably just mistakenly thought you were dead, and you were probably...umm...alive and pretending to be dead or something.`
` Isn't that right?!"`
`It can't be true.`
`She's got to be alive.`
`Otherwise, how can she be here...?!`
`...The kid-aged Aunt Rosa shook Beatrice's body, crying.`
`I stared into that face too, `
`......but her eyes were still open, and it really was a corpse.`
`...I wanted to dodge the issue by saying something vague, like 'she must be playing dead',`
` ...but no matter how I looked at it, it didn't look fake at all, ...it really did look like she was dead...`
`Beatrice had fallen upside down from a cliff of that height,`
` ...and her head had smashed against the pointed tip of those sharp rocks.`
`'!s0`
`after landing on those rocks...`
`from that height...`
`But I couldn't accept it...`
`No matter how dead she looked, ...she had to be alive...!`
` Then, she went on to become this damn irritating witch!`
` That makes all the inconsistencies fit.`
`Grandfather must have kept her confined constantly in a hidden mansion.`
`Then, to take revenge for that,`
` ...she committed several atrocious murders!`
`Aunt Rosa probably just mistakenly thought she was dead.`
`But she was actually alive, and as soon as Aunt Rosa left, would miraculously breathe again.`
`...Then, she somehow lived on until today...and opened the curtain on her revenge drama.`
`Otherwise, the facts don't fit together!!`
`"...I won't let you trick me so easily.`
` Can you repeat it in red?!`
` That she's certainly dead!!`
` She has to be alive, right?!`
` It's obvious!!"`
`"How does that look alive to you?`
` It's definitely dead`
`!"`
`"............Nnngggggg..."`
`My theory that the 19th person was Grandfather's mistress, a human Beatrice, had been defeated.`
`...I had planned to strike back from a defensive position, but...`
`"...Then, ...who are you?`
` You just died, right?!`
` Don't tell me you revived yourself with magic?!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` I've already explained that, have I not?`
` ...The 'me' lying over there definitely possesses my soul,`
` but that body's nothing more than a cage of flesh tying me to the physical world.`
` This is how that cage of flesh was broken.`
` ...Do you understand what that means?"`
`"......I don't have a clue anymore.`
` ...Keep having fun with your witch girl tricks.`
` I'll listen to that in place of a snack!`
` What the...it's empty.`
` Hey, could I get some more black tea?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Ronove,`
` our guest would like some tea."`
`When Beato clapped her hands, Ronove appeared.`
`...Butlers sure are convenient.`
`"A refill, you say?`
` Certainly.`
` How much shall I pour you?"`
`"Well, I've got more than enough snacks.`
` Half will be fine."`
`"Even so, filling it to the brim is the English custom."`
`Even though just enough to wet my throat would have been fine, he filled it to the top.`
`I turned my back to Beato, sipping it in silence...`
`"Hey, ...open your eyes...!!`
` Beatrice...!!"`
`Rosa shook me...`
`...no, shook the corpse that had once been me.`
`I watched over her from a short distance away.`
`Ah, ...so I fell from there and died...`
`For a while, I believed that was true.`
`...I saw Rosa spend a long time beside my corpse, then watched her as she ran away.`
`...Eventually, I realized that I was a different individual from that corpse...`
`".........That's right.`
` I am...me.`
` ...So, I've finally managed to escape from Kinzo's bonds..."`
`Eventually, I felt the memory returning...`
`The fact that I was an Endless Witch who had lived for one thousand years.`
`Then, I remembered that I'd been summoned by Kinzo, and that I'd been imprisoned by him for a long time...`
`While being imprisoned in a cage of flesh, I completely lost my memory as a witch.`
`However, thanks to Rosa, if you could say that...`
`...Thanks to my accidental death, I'd now finally regained my self...`
`"...Rosa,`
` you probably regret bringing about my death.`
` But I should be thanking you.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`I couldn't see Rosa anymore.`
`Did she go to call a doctor, or was she so terrified that she ran away?`
`...It no longer matters.`
`That soulless shell no longer has any value.`
`And yet, ...I'm so frail now.`
`Even this glorious midday sun is agony to me.`
`I destroyed my human form.`
`Then, I changed it into several gold butterflies.`
`...Yes, with my magical power as frail as it is now, this form is easier to maintain.`
`To escape even a little from the light of the sun, I rode the wind and gently flew up the side of the cliff.`
`It will probably be a bit cooler in the forest.`
`Anyway, I'll take some time to recuperate and regain my former power.`
`...As I ponder how to make Kinzo pay up all he owes me.`
`Dancing alone through the air, I looked down at the shore one more time.`
`On the rocky shore...lay the figure of what had once been me, ...the figure I would eventually regain.`
`To regain the form of that physical body I had thrown away, `
`...it would probably take more than one hundred, two hundred days.`
`...And it might require one thousand days, or perhaps even more.`
`However, I am the Endless Witch.`
`The Golden Witch who has lived for one thousand years.`
`Waiting any countable number of days would be no problem.`
`*cackle*cackle* Oh, Kinzo.`
`Regret that you are not here now.`
`No longer will you be able to capture me.`
`...*cackle*cackle*!`
`"......And then, you changed into gold butterflies, hid in the forest, and waited for your magical power to be restored? Is that what you're saying?"`
`"That is correct.`
` I take this form to sneer at you, but most of the time, it is easier magically for me to keep my form as gold butterflies."`
`"Hey, feel free to take a load off and stick to whatever's easiest.`
` I wouldn't mind not having to hear your irritating laugh."`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` When I turned into butterflies and slipped into the forest, it was already no longer possible for Kinzo to find me.`
` ...However, Kinzo was not dismayed.`
` Still, he was not immediately able to prepare a way to catch me."`
`"So, he first moved to prevent me from leaving this island...`
`and to keep me from regaining my power.`
` ......My, my. At any rate, Kinzo's spitefulness was unimaginable.`
` ...It was pretty tough to be loved by someone like that.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"He found a way to keep you from leaving after you turned into butterflies?`
` What, did he put a bug net around the entire forest?"`
`"Indeed.`
` A magical one.`
` ......Didn't you know?`
` On the sea in front of the harbor is a reef...upon which sits a small shrine of Eastern magic."`
`"...Ah, that.`
` It was gone by this year, though.`
` It was a small shrine built long ago by a shugenja, right?"`
`"From the very beginning, Rokkenjima has been an island enveloped by a distortion.`
` It attracts things of magical power and other related creatures.`
` ...Milady herself is one of them.`
` How about some more tea?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*, please.`
` ...They brought harm to humans and probably left several eerie legends in their wake.`
` That small shrine was built in ancient times by an Eastern magician who heard of them.`
` A long time passed, and that power was lost.`
` By repairing it, Kinzo restored this island's barrier...and once again bound me to the island."`
`"...Can Eastern magic work on a Western witch like you?"`
`"Normally, the affinity would be poor.`
` However, for the purpose of sealing me here, it may have been quite convenient in a way."`
`"If it was Western magic, I would have had some knowledge.`
` For any barrier, there would have been some measures I could have taken.`
` But Eastern magic is outside my area of expertise.`
` It was as if I had been given chopsticks instead of a spoon for some soup that I wanted to drink."`
`"In a space dominated by Eastern magic, Western magic loses much of its power.`
` Even if she were given one thousand days to regain her strength,`
` she would have to wait many, many more."`
`"...So you're saying it took you 20 years to regain your power, and now you've revived, as we can all see?"`
`"Those were horribly long years...`
` I spent many days in the form of gold butterflies, found Kinzo's mansion, and watched over him every day.`
` I lived through those days with no means to enjoy myself except to ponder how I would get back at him."`
`"...That period of 20 years was fortunate for me.`
` Kinzo tried to use all sorts of magic to find and capture me, but each failed.`
` There's a limit to how many miracles a single human can bring about.`
` Even simply holding me captive for that long had been a miracle far above his place.`
` It would be unthinkable for me to be captured like that multiple times."`
`"......Grandfather said something in the previous game.`
` It was something like...magic lies in a miracle of probability."`
`"Indeed.`
` As Kinzo was searching for a hidden art to capture me again, he stumbled upon that.`
` ......Then, he finally worked out the ceremony involving the offering of 13 people as sacrifices to revive me again."`
`"13 people...as sacrifices..."`
`"That is the witch's epitaph.`
` A song of sacrifices.`
` ...Six people on the first twilight.`
` Two people on the second.`
` And then five more people on the fourth through eight twilights.`
` A forbidden ceremony, involving the offering of a total of 13 people as sacrifices...`
` Those sacrifices were to be chosen randomly, and the one who held the ceremony, Kinzo himself, was no exception."`
`"Dumbass...`
` Are you saying that all the gruesome murders on this island were a weird ceremony?!!"`
`I'd had a vague idea that this might be the case...`
`But I couldn't just hear that it was true from a witch and a demon and say 'Oh, really?' and accept it!`
`"There are 18 people on Rokkenjima.`
` 13 are offered as sacrifices, five are left alive.`
` Then I revive.`
` ...In other words, the odds that Kinzo will be able to meet me again are probably around one in three.`
` He bet his own life on those odds,`
` wishing for a reunion with me for the last bit of his remaining life."`
`"......You're saying he gathered our family for the sake of that joke of a ceremony?!`
` Don't fuck with me!!`
` Don't say stuff like that, damn it!!"`
`"It was all set out in our contract from the beginning.`
` When Kinzo's life ended,`
` all the gold I lent him and all of the assets he created would be given to me.`
` ...Yes, Kinzo did stab me in the back quite brutally, `
`but looking back now, it was a rare and precious time during my thousand years of life.`
` After all, boredom is my natural enemy.`
` To Kinzo, who offered me a chance to run away from that for several decades...`
`yes, you could say I owe him for that."`
`"I decided to go along with Kinzo's game.`
` So, to start, Kinzo returns the Ushiromiya Family Head's Ring to me.`
` It was my gold that revived the family, after all.`
` ......Then, 13 people are chosen at random to be sacrifices.`
` While that happens, you all run about, `
`showing me all kinds of human interactions as you try to oppose me, and entertaining me greatly.`
` Yes, I truly have taken a liking to this game of Kinzo's!`
` *cackle*cackle*."`

`"#ff0000There are no more than 18 humans on this Rokkenjima#ffffff!"`

` Are you saying the piece I took...the X...doesn't exist?!"`
`"Pu ku ku ku...`
` That is what this means.`
` My condolences.`
` ...Still, you do move fast, Milady.`

` Well then, Battler-sama, would some more tea be agreeable?"`
`"I-I don't need it, damn it!!`
` I don't believe it!`
` The culprit can't be one of the 18!`
` Then what are you, and why are you here?!!`
` If the 19th person doesn't exist, then are you saying you're one of the 18 in disguise?!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Perhaps you are castling.`
` Though reluctantly, you are doubting one of the 18 people as your last way out.`
` ......However, it will be difficult for me from here on out.`
` If you choose to stop caring about propriety, `
`you could prepare a culprit freely amid 18 people!`
` Making you reach checkmate `
`by evading those 18 pieces...`
`...will be truly difficult."`
`"As if I'd do that!!`
` I won't suspect any of the 18!`
` I don't want to suspect people!!`
` Have I really been cornered here again...?!`
` Damn it, damn it, damn it!!"`
`"It looks like we're finally approaching the end, in the third round of this game of ours.`
` You've nowhere to run anymore, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` You don't want to suspect any of those beloved people in the 18, do you? Were you trying to hide that from me?`
` Then why do you refuse me?"`
`"They say you should play the opening like a book, the middle game like a magician, `
`and the endgame like a machine.`
` I'll corner you from here on.`
` Slowly, carefully, ...surely.`
` Or, on the other hand, would it be better if I pressed you all at once, which might suit your style more?"`
`"Yes, that should fit you well, let's do that.`
` I'm now fully aware of the sorts of attacks you're weakest against!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle* Hihihihihihihihihihi!!"`
`"............Well then,`
` how will this game be resolved?`
` ...You may submit, or you may resist.`
` ...Either way, it will truly be an entertaining banquet worth betting my short remaining life on."`
`In his dimly lit study, occasionally brightened by lightning,`
` Kinzo kept mumbling and laughing to himself.`
`On the antique clock with the intricate design that had been sitting on his desk,`
` the two overlapping hands tilted to the right and began to slide.`
`The measure of time that counted up to 24...had returned to 0...and had begun to count back again...`
`"...Measuring time is a brutal thing.`
` It drags itself all the way to 24 over the course of a day, and then returns back to 0.`
` ...It certainly did count to 23:59.`
` However, is it ever able to reach 24:00?`
` ...If you conclude that it returns to 0:00 again without reaching 24, how futile it must all be."`
`But perhaps a person's life is the same.`
`You live, aiming for a perfect 24, and in the instant you reach it, you return to 0.`
`People will probably praise the departed, saying that he did reach 24, but he most certainly did not.`
`......In the end, he's a 0.`
`"I am different.`
` ...I will live and reach 24.`
` That itself is the Golden Land.`
` ...For that is where Beatrice dwells."`
`Kinzo had been fumbling around with some tarot cards for some time.`
`It looked as though he was trying to divine his own luck with a contest, doing it over every time he didn't like the result.`
`The most forbidden action in tarot reading is trying to predict the same thing twice.`
`To do so ridicules the results of fortune telling...`
`and also desecrates those beings higher than humans that give revelations through the tarot cards.`
`However, Kinzo knew.`
`Tarot cards shouldn't be used twice because...since they're nothing more than a random number generator,`
` reading them twice will naturally cause a different result to appear.`
`...Therefore, reading them twice was only forbidden to preserve the mystique of the tarot cards' results.`
`...However, that didn't mean that Kinzo didn't take tarot reading seriously.`
`Kinzo's interpretation of tarot reading was done in a completely different way.`
`That was to repeat the reading, over and over,`
` without giving up in the slightest, until he reached the result most favorable to him.`
`The mark he set for this 'most favorable result' would vary,`
` but when he demanded the most favorable result in a strictly literal sense,`
` it was the same as a simple roulette of luck, where he seeked an arithmetic miracle.`
`...However, Kinzo used miracles of numbers as the basis of his magical power, so this functioned perfectly well as a magical ritual.`
`In other words,`
` until the result he desired appeared perfectly, he would strive to repeat the tarot readings over and over, with conviction, turning the feelings of his heart into prayers,`
` so that when they reached the heavens, they would be sublimated into results.`
` This was Kinzo's personal magical interpretation.`
`Therefore, even though Kinzo's tarot cards were no different from those generally used,`
` the way in which they were used was completely different...`
`".........`
`...Tonight...will not go as I thought."`
`Kinzo stopped his hands for a second.`
`...He seemed not to be getting the results he wanted.`
`On the contrary, bad cards that shouldn't show up so often appeared repeatedly...`
`and continued to interfere with the miracle Kinzo wished for.`
`".........Hmph.`
` ...Is that how it is?"`
`Kinzo seemed to have received some revelation that was different from normal.`
`But, judging by the unlucky cards scattered across his desk, it was difficult to imagine that the omen had been a good one...`
`For a while, Kinzo closed his eyes tightly, pondering something.`
`Then, as the thunder roared, he made up his mind about something, took the telephone receiver, and dialed.`
`"......It is I.`
` Is Genji there? An urgent matter has come up."`
`"......Haah."`
`In front of the entrance hall, Shannon's once burning face had been cooled off by the frigid air.`
`...She had thought...`
`that George's proposal would surely come sooner or later.`
`It wasn't as though she hadn't prepared herself mentally.`
`And she had answered by nodding.`
`Had she been reckless because of her youth?`
`Should she have thought about her future more seriously?`
`I wonder if my immediate reply made him think I'm a cheap girl.`
`...If I'd at least waited until tomorrow morning, would that at least have shown him I was taking this seriously?`
`Now that she'd already received the ring from George, Shannon kept fidgeting in embarrassment.`
` I should've done this, I should've done that.`
`As she did, she heard the sound of footsteps splashing through puddles.`
`Shannon immediately chased away the emotions welling up inside her.`
`"...Genji-sama?`
` And Kanon-kun too...!`
` I-I'm sorry, I have to go back soon, umm..."`
`She grew stiff, thinking she'd surely be scolded for spending too much time in her secret lover's meeting with George.`
`"Shannon,`
` the Master told us to come to the study, saying it was urgent.`
` Let us hurry."`
`"...Huh?`
` Y-Yes, certainly...!`
` What in the world...?"`
`"He said he had a premonition of misfortune.`
` ...How convenient for him, considering he's the one who started this ceremony."`
`"We will enter from the back, so that Gohda doesn't notice us.`
` Hide your footsteps."`
`"Yes.`
` ......Nee-san, take care.`
` You're so noisy."`
`Kanon was especially good at hiding his footsteps.`
`...Just like a cat.`
`He was able to suddenly be there without anyone noticing and leave in the same way.`
`For example, even though he stepped in puddles, `
`the sound he made was far smaller than that of the rain hitting them...`
`Genji also had abilities of that kind.`
`...Or rather, those servants called furniture were supposed to be like that.`
`Just like how desks and closets go unnoticed by members of the family, `
`these servants also held it as a great virtue to just suddenly be there whenever they were needed.`
`Compared to that, Shannon's footsteps still strongly asserted themselves.`
`...She was also trying to hide her footsteps, `
`but compared to Kanon and Genji...well, you could say she was a little more boisterous...`
`Eventually, they reached the back door, and the three of them entered the mansion.`
`Immediately, ......they thought they felt something.`
`It was different from a sense of smell, ...and it seemed to hit the depths of their noses.`
` ...This hard-to-describe sensation, which you might call a sixth sense, allowed them to perceive that something was different than usual.`
`"......Genji-sama."`
`"...Indeed. Let us hurry."`
`That sensation made it feel as though a tense something was pressing in around them.`
`Realizing that, the three of them dashed up the stairs, heading for Kinzo's study while still hiding their footsteps.`
`When they dashed up the stairs, ...that smell of sweet poison particular to Kinzo's study reached their noses.`
`".........Nn."`
`"What is it, Genji-sama...?"`
`"...The barrier...is dead."`
`"Huh?`
` .........Ah."`
`After hearing Kanon's words, she looked at the door to the study.`
`A scorpion pattern was engraved on the doorknob.`
`A powerful ward against magic.`
`The final barrier, which protected Kinzo himself.`
`It had been broken.`
`Of course, there was no change to the doorknob that the eye could see.`
`However, those who could understand things people couldn't perceive...`
`were able to recognize that a dramatic change had occurred...`
`"...Master.`
` Master...!`
` It is Genji.`
` Please open the door."`
`Genji called in this way after knocking several times, but there was no answer from the study.`
`"Shannon, guard our backs.`
` Kanon, search inside the room."`
`""Yes...!""`
`Kanon put his ear against the door, searching for a presence inside the study.`
`To protect the backs of the pair watching the door, Shannon faced the other way, ready for the unexpected.`
`"......The Master must be in here.`
` ...But it's too quiet."`
`"Do you mean to say he's safe?"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"No.`
`~ib~ It's too quiet~ib~."`
`"...Could it......possibly be..."`
`"Master,`
` excuse us about the door."`
`Genji pulled a gold key out of his pocket.`
`It was the only key to the study that existed, other than the one Kinzo held.`
`He stuck it in the key hole and turned it heavily.`
`...At first glance, that seemed to prove that it was a sturdy lock.`
`However, now that the barrier had been destroyed, `
`this door might as well have been left open, from the viewpoint of anyone with magical power.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`The heavy sound just now meant that the door had now been opened ~ib~even for humans~ib~.`
`"...Excuse me."`
`As Genji respectfully bowed his head,`
` and Kanon's sense of tension grew tighter,`
` and Shannon trembled,`
` they entered the study...`
`They immediately discovered Kinzo's figure.`
`...He was sitting on the reception sofa so that his back faced them.`
`Genji noticed the person sitting across from him, and again bowed deeply.`
`Kanon also noticed that person,`
` ...but he didn't bow his head.`
`He stood in front of Shannon and spread out his arms, blocking the way to her.`
`So without even seeing that person's face, Shannon already had a good idea who it was...`
`"...So, you have come,`
` Beatrice-sama."`
`"Genji, is it?`
` You came very quickly.`
` Yes, it is always best when furniture answers to their master's call quickly.`
` Unlike this person."`
`"......`
`...So, Ronove-sama has come as well."`
`Genji directed his greeting towards the thin darkness behind and to the right of Beatrice, where there shouldn't have been anything.`
`Even Kanon and Shannon would never have imagined that someone was there.`
`...However, the darkness responded immediately and praised Genji's eyesight...`
`"As usual, you don't disappoint.`
` It has been quite some time.`
` ......Still, you've grown old, haven't you?`
` Have so many years truly passed you by?"`
`"My days have been full and satisfying.`
` ...It appears you have been living quite a full life yourself, Ronove-sama."`
`"Yes.`
` Thank you.`
` ......And Shannon, it has been a long time since I last saw you as well.`
` You have grown quite beautiful.`
` And, it seems that you have grown quite strong.`
` That is fortunate."`
`"......Thank you very much."`
`"...Nee-san, who in the world..."`
`"This will be our first meeting, Kanon-kun.`
` ...I, Ronove, have been entrusted with the position of Beatrice-sama's head furniture.`
` ...I am an old friend of Genji-san's,`
` and I am also furniture, just like you.`
` Although the master I serve is different."`
`The tense color didn't disappear from Kanon's face in the slightest.`
`...Depending on the master furniture served, they might be kind or brutal or anything else.`
`...If this person claimed to be furniture serving the hated Beatrice,`
` then he must be despicable as well...`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` It seems I'm thoroughly despised.`
` It's as though you hate everything that has anything to do with me."`
`Beatrice openly sneered at Kanon's hate-filled face...`
`Then, Kanon finally realized.`
`Beatrice and Kinzo were having a chess game across the reception table.`
`But Kinzo hadn't even quivered.`
`He was holding his head with both hands, his eyes closed tight, ...as he contemplated his next move.`
`...Or was he in anguish...?`
`"......Master......"`
`"I have told Kinzo two things.`
` There was good news and bad news.`
` ...The good news is that he'll have the good fortune of being reunited with me before the ceremony ends.`
` The bad news is that Kinzo has been selected as the very first sacrifice in the ceremony."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` There's absolutely nothing I can do about it.`
` Because it truly was decided by the fickle roulette."`
`"...L-Liar.`
` We know you're just a murderer who kills for fun..."`
`"Stop it, Kanon-kun..."`
`"...So, Kinzo,`
` isn't it about time you decided to accept your loss?`
` ...*cackle* With this, our long contest is at an end, yes?"`
`"............"`
`At a glance, it was hard to make out the situation on that chaotic chessboard.`
`...However, judging by Kinzo's anguish and Beatrice's malicious confidence, `
`it seemed to be over already...`
`"......It is unavoidable...`
` ...Perhaps even this could be amusing."`
`"It is to me too.`
` ...Resolving my contest with you may bring a flood of emotions, but it has already surpassed love and hate.`
` ...It was fun.`
` These past few decades certainly weren't boring...!"`
`Beatrice advanced her queen...and made her final move.`
`...And that...`
`decided it.`
`"Checkmate.`
` ......This is my final tribute to you.`
` Without any reservations, `
`...sleep."`
`'!s1`
`...fuhahaha, `
`haah`
`hah`
`hah`
`hah`
`hah`
`hah`
`hah!!"`
`Kinzo suddenly stood up and laughed, like an opera singer facing a full crowd and spreading his arms, `
`...as though he had succeeded in a century-long plan.`
`That laugh...`
`...spat crimson.`
`Crimson flames poured out from inside him, `
`spitting even out of his mouth, ears, and nose, and all at once, his body was wrapped in hellfire...`
`But Kinzo kept laughing.`
`The more he laughed, the more the hellfire spewed from his entire body and began to char him...`
`Those flames became a brilliant light, `
`which dazzlingly shone on the various magic tools throughout the room, making their distorted shadows dance across the walls.`
`...Those shadows looked like the dead in hell, watching over Kinzo in ecstasy as he burned...`
`'!s0`
`for one who had made a contract with the witch, `
`it was an extremely fitting end...`
`...in accordance with those terms...`
`After laughing and howling in the roaring flames for a some time, `
`Kinzo flopped to the ground, as though he was a puppet whose strings had been cut.`
`Those incredible blazing flames disappeared as though he'd been completely burned up, `
`and afterwards, nothing remained but a festering and burnt corpse that one could hardly bear to look at...`
`".........Horrible..."`
`"Hmph.`
` You should talk.`
` As if you didn't think that was a fitting way for him to die..."`
`"...Why have you shown yourself...?`
` Do you have some business with us...?"`
`"Stop it, Kanon-kun.`
` ...You mustn't provoke Beatrice-sama."`
`"It would seem you have them absolutely terrified.`
` Pu ku ku ku."`
`"I imagine I'll never get along with Kanon.`
` Hey, it's not as though I dislike you particularly..."`
`Beatrice grinned.`
`Kanon violently averted his gaze, obviously unhappy.`
`...His reaction was so different from what he wanted to do that it made the witch and her butler laugh.`
`"Kanon,`
` ...you stand in the presence of Beatrice-sama.`
` Carefully consider your manner of speech."`
`"Oh, I care not, Genji.`
` Let him say what he pleases.`
` I am gracious."`
`"...How are you gracious...?!"`
`"I am always gracious to those who are about to die.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`Kanon was taken aback by that creepy laughter...`
`Beatrice wasn't here just to take Kinzo's life.`
`The first twilight required six sacrifices.`
`Kinzo alone wasn't nearly enough.`
`...And they'd just casually walked in here...`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Fear not, Kanon.`
` ...It isn't as though you'll be selected as sacrifices just because you came here.`
` ...After all, you were called here because you'd been selected already...!"`
`"......What......?!"`
`Their instincts were good enough to spot her meaning instantly...`
`Six sacrifices were required for the first twilight.`
`After Kinzo, how many more would you need to add up to six?`
`...In this mansion, the number five instantly made them think of the number of servants here...`
`"......Is that...what you desire?"`
`"Indeed.`
` ...Thank me, furniture.`
` Tonight, your days of suffering will finally end.`
` You ought to thank me for coming here to tell you this."`
`"......Certainly.`
` If that is your desire."`
`"...G-`
`Genji-sama..."`
`Genji had agreed to the witch's heartless announcement with his usual demeanor, without raising an eyebrow.`
`"Now that the Master is dead, Beatrice-sama is our master.`
` Responding to her demands shall be our final duty."`
`"...Shannon.`
` Kanon.`
` You have done well serving until today.`
` That hard work is now over."`
`"...As I expected of you, Genji.`
` As your fellow furniture, I'm proud to have known you."`
`"Shannon,`
` ...do you have any objections?"`
`"...No."`
`"......I heard that George-sama gave you a ring.`
` Do you still say...that you have no regrets?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...That blessing was more than furniture deserves.`
` ...Just receiving the ring has already satisfied my feelings."`
`Shannon couldn't take quite as much of a philosophical view as Genji.`
`There probably were regrets left in her heart.`
`...She probably wanted to spend a little more warm time with the person she cared for, George.`
`...But she released herself from that.`
`She took a single deep breath...and a blank expression rose to her face.`
`"......Very well."`
`"It does surprise me a tad to find that you've gained such composure, Shannon.`
` It seems you too have taken a philosophical view as furniture."`
`"Won't you at least shed some bitter tears for not being able to spend a night with the man you love?`
` What a boring woman."`
`"......`
`This feeling cannot be understood by the likes of you, Beatrice-sama.`
` ...If you desire our lives, please accept them.`
` We will solemnly carry out that duty."`
`"...Very well.`
` Excellently put..."`
`"Pu ku ku ku.`
` Just the type of person Beatrice-sama can't handle."`
`"She's been taking such a far-sighted view of things lately.`
` I must've tormented her too much last time.`
` Speaking of which, didn't I do the same to Battler?`
` ...Hmmm.`
` Am I still soft?`
` Or is the way I corner them lacking?`
` In any case, she's just no fun."`
`"......However, it seems you will still entertain me, right?`
` Kanooon?"`
`"......Kanon-kun..."`
`"........."`
`Compared to the two who had taken a far-sighted approach, ...there was a painful anguish on Kanon's face.`
`Kanon was still far too young to accept his demise after being told of it by a suddenly appearing witch...`
`"...Kanon.`
` I hate boredom more than anything.`
` And the fact that the other two have obediently accepted their deaths isn't amusing at all.`
` ...So, I hope you don't betray my expectations."`
`"......Are you trying to make me your plaything...?"`
`Kanon realized that he was being provoked.`
`...However, no matter how furiously anger spurred him on, his opponent was a witch.`
` He was furniture.`
` He hadn't had a chance of victory from the beginning.`
`But the witch was expecting that he'd struggle in vain and writhe around, `
`and was even looking forward to it...`
`...Just thinking about that was frustrating enough to get his blood boiling.`
`Was disappointing the witch by refusing to resist, like the other two, `
`the only way he could strike back at her...?`
`"Eldest of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, Lucifer.`
` Arise."`
`"...Lucifer of Pride, right here."`
`"Kanon,`
` it would be far too cruel to force furniture to fight a witch.`
` No matter how much anger spurs you on, you would have no hope in a battle without a chance of success.`
` Of course, such a battle would be boring for me as well."`
`"...So, let it be furniture against furniture.`
` Why not resolve it with a battle between you two?`
` That should be enough to allow you some hope for victory, right...?"`
`".........`
`...Forgive me, Beatrice-sama,`
` but how could I be inferior to this good-for-nothing furniture?`
` As if this cutie would have any chance against me...`
` Heheheheheheheheheheheheh."`
`"............Nng."`
`"Prove that you can defeat my furniture, the Seven Stakes of Purgatory.`
` If you manage to win through, `
`......let us see.`
` I will let you select the five who will escape becoming one of the 13 sacrifices.`
` I will welcome the five you recommend into the Golden Land without any conditions.`
` ...How about that?"`
`Kanon understood that he was being provoked.`
`...However, the witch's offer was very tempting.`
`By this point, Kanon couldn't care less about this evil ceremony the witch and the rest were trying to carry out.`
`...On the contrary, it was much more important that he remain alive so that he could be invited to the Golden Land...`
`and have his wish granted by Beatrice there...`
`"You cried, saying you'd had enough of being furniture, right...?`
` I shall grant your desire.`
` I shall give you that human body you wanted so much, you cried yourself to sleep.`
` What do you say...?`
` That way, you and Jessica could be together, yes?`
` Ooh, just perfect.`
` You may recommend that Jessica and yourself be invited to the Golden Land."`
`"...If you alone finding happiness isn't a satisfying solution for you, `
`then you can add in Shannon and George, the one she loves...`
` If you're worried about duty, then you can also add Genji.`
` Hoh!`
` That's five people.`
` Isn't that enough, Kanon?`
` ......With this much of a reward, ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` ...You won't let me get bored, will you...?"`
`"...She's just playing with you.`
` There is no need to listen to her."`
`"...I-I don't like it.`
` Are you okay with this, Nee-san?!"`
`Beatrice couldn't hide her evil smile at those words.`
`"I don't like it.`
` I want to be happy!`
` I've had enough of being furniture.`
` I want to become human...and have normal love...!`
` I want to know that...the ocean is blue, like you!"`
`"......How young.`
` I'm jealous."`
`"That's why I like the young ones.`
` ...Genji, Shannon, stay back.`
` Kanon, Lucifer, forward."`
`"As you command."`
`"............"`
`"...Hehheheheheheheheheheheh.`
` I don't like it.`
` ...That way you look down on me, `
`as if Beatrice-sama would be impossible, but with me at least you'd have a chance.`
` ...I really don't like it."`
`That was probably humiliating for Lucifer.`
`...But at the same time, she was also happy...that she was lucky enough to have this adorable prey all to herself...`
`"......Come, furniture of the witch.`
` ......Don't think that you can look down on me forever...!"`
`"So, Battler.`
` Isn't this a fun show?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......Dammit.`
` Another weird thing's happening...`
` Like I'd ever believe in a magic battle...!"`
`"Look, look, don't turn your eyes away, look at it.`
` Look, look, look!`
` It's magic, it's furniture,`
` no matter how much you try to deny me and magic, `
`look, look, look, look, look!"`
`"If you've got all this happening right in front of you, it'd be a waste to miss it, don't you thiiiiiink?`
` Look, look, look, `
`just stop thinking,`
` magic exists!`
` This is fantasy!`
`'!s1`
` look closely,`
` look, look, look, look!!"`
`"Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit...`
` I won't accept witches, I won't accept magic...!`
` But, if it's being done right in the open like that, what am I supposed to say?!`
` ......Damn, dammiiiiit!"`
`"Come now, don't turn away, look closely, okaaaaaay??`
` Magic exists, this is fantasy, so stop playing detective.`
` I know your secret, you actually don't really like to think things through, right??`
` Then just stop, stoooop, *cackle*cackle*!`
` Look, look, it's gotta be fantasy, gotta be fantasy, kihhihihyahyahhyahhyahhyahhyahhyaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"Shut up, shut up, shut uuuuuuuuuuup...!!!`
` Don't talk to meeeeeeee...!!"`
`"......This guy's getting stubborn.`
` ...Won't you apologize and crawl on the ground right now for being so conceited that you thought you could beat me...?`
` If you did, I wouldn't mind forgiving you, okay...?"`
`"Then you wouldn't have to have your skin ripped off while you're still alive...`
`or get lashed all over your body as you squirm until you die.`
` Hehheheheheheheheh!"`
`"You're a cutie, so apologize...`
` If you do, I'll finish you off so, so gently, while it still feels great..."`
`"Be silent, furniture of the witch.`
` ...I have no intention of speaking with you."`
`"...S-So you're saying you think nothing of me...?`
` Hehhheheheheheheheheh, that disrespectful gaze of yours...`
`...is really ticking me offff!!"`
`"......Kanon-kun........."`
`"............"`
`"...Isn't he stronger than he was against Satan?"`
`"This is why humans are so frightening.`
` In fact, sometimes they even become witches and treat demons as butlers."`
`"Pu ku ku ku ku!`
` So, which should I cheer on?"`
`"...Are you...`
`...saying this guy's on par with me...?!"`
`"......Don't look down on me.`
` As long as you have that pride, you'll never defeat me."`
`"Y-Y-`
`You speak of Lucifer, the eldest of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, and say that I cannot win?!`
` H-How conceited!!"`
`"...Wha........."`
`Kanon was desperately trying to stay alive, and he had a strong desire to become human.`
`But Lucifer didn't feel anything stronger than a slight desire to play.`
`...So, that led to an inevitable result.`
` It was a result that could be reached by the power of humans.`
` ...The power of the heart.`
`"......That's as far as you go.`
` You cannot win against me."`
`The glowing red curve extended straight out from Kanon's arm,`
` ...pointing at Lucifer's throat, just beneath the tip of her chin...`
`"...Wh-`
`What is this...?!`
` How could I...`
`  ...There must be some mistake..."`
`As she ground her teeth in irritation, she tried to deny the truth right before her eyes.`
`...But no matter how much she believed in her own superiority, it didn't change the facts right in front of her.`
`"Hoh.`
` ...Well done, Kanon.`
` Wonderful, you haven't bored me.`
` ...How pitiful my furniture is compared to that.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"...Lucifer,`
` you are boring Milady.`
` Was this opponent really too much for you to handle...?"`
`"I'm disappointed, eldest of the Seven Staaakes.`
` Hahihihihihihihihihihihi...!"`
`It would have seemed like mere rebuke to an outsider.`
`However, furniture serving the witch knew what kind of severe treatment was promised by that rebuke...`
`and understood what had been left unsaid...`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!`
` You...good for nothing furnituuuuuuuuuuuuure!!!"`
`She howled.`
` ...Abandoning her last bit of pride, she made her body explode, exposing her true form.`
`That form was a demon stake, which bounced off the walls surrounding the room...`
`"How could you shame me so much?!!`
` Kill, kill, kill, kill!!`
` You blockhead!`
` Even though you can't even follow my movements anymore!!`
` I won't play around anymore, I'm seriously mad, I'll pierce your heart in one blow!!`
` I'll plow right through you, make a fountain of bright-red blood reach the ceiling!!`
` Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeee!!"`
`"K-Kanon-kun......!!"`
`After flying about wildly for some time, with a speed approaching the limits of what a human eye could follow,`
` Lucifer flew at Kanon's heart...`
`She could tell that it was Kanon's blood by the sweet taste of it.`
`...But she quickly noticed one thing.`
`...She hadn't pierced his heart...`
`"......Hoh.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"This is why humans are frightening.`
` ...Would you like some black tea?"`
`"I am fine for now.`
` This is so amusing, I don't even need any...!"`
`"...K...`
`......Kanon-kun......"`
`"You were arrogant again...`
` ...I told you that you wouldn't be able to defeat me..."`
`The floor was stained with dripping blood.`
`...It really was Kanon's blood, `
`...but it wasn't flowing out of his chest.`
`Kanon had sacrificed his own left hand to protect his heart...`
`Lucifer was arrogant.`
`Even though she'd been given enough time to realize that this was an opponent capable of cornering her, `
`in her pride, she had believed him to be worthless.`
` She had gotten careless.`
`...So, just as she had announced, she had aimed for his chest, trying to pierce his heart.`
`Because she was arrogant, she hadn't even thought of aiming for somewhere other than the place she had announced.`
`...No, maybe she had thought about it a little.`
`...However, her pride would not allow her to aim for a different spot.`
`After all, she was...`
`...Lucifer of Pride.`
`Kanon, withstanding the pain,`
` grasped the demon stake sticking deep into his left hand strongly with his right hand...`
`and pulled it out...`
`When she heard the sound of breaking bones and even more blood dripping down,`
` Shannon looked away reflexively.`
`There was an air hole in the back of the pierced hand so big, you could clearly see through to the other side...`
`Kanon's face was filled with pain, `
`...but right now, `
`he had won, without a doubt.`
`The demon stake he was gripping with his right hand turned back into Lucifer again...`
`...So that Kanon was now gripping exactly where her neck was.`
`'!s1`
`......gu, `
`............"`
`"...It's my victory,`
` ......Beatrice."`
`Kanon didn't hold back at all with the hand gripping Lucifer's throat.`
`...She had challenged him again after their fight had already been decided.`
`Kanon had no obligation to be considerate.`
`But even so, Kanon released the witch's furniture.`
`...Was it his naive humanism, his pity for another furniture,`
` or a final bit of respect to the witch?`
`In any case, when she was released, Lucifer fell face-down on the ground,`
` wretching and moaning over the pain in her throat...`
`"Spectacular, Kanon.`
` ...Your great efforts have proven the correctness of some of Kinzo's research."`
`Ronove was clapping his hands.`
`...To Kanon, who had won at great cost and had a wound on his left hand that wouldn't close, Ronove's applause only felt like mockery.`
`"...All possibilities dwell within the human heart, was it?`
` ......My, my, this is why humans are frightening!`
` Well done, Kanon.`
` You were victorious.`
` Spectacular!"`
`"...Haah,`
` ...haah,`
` ...haah..."`
`"Are you okay?!`
` Kanon-kun..."`
`Shannon ran up to him and wrapped a handkerchief around his left hand, which was still spraying blood.`
`"That was incredible, Kanon!`
` Truly incredible.`
` Even I was hoping, at least a little, for an upset.`
` That you didn't let me down makes you truly splendid furniture.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` I think better of you now.`
` I honestly think better of you!"`
`"...Y-You haven't forgotten our promise, right, `
`...Beatrice...?"`
`"Indeed.`
` Of course I haven't forgotten.`
` Witches and demons may be inhumane.`
` However, we are much more noble than humans when it comes to keeping promises."`
`"I will not go back on my word.`
` I guaranteed that if you won, `
`I would give you the right to decide the five people who will escape becoming the 13 sacrifices."`
`"...B-Beatrice-sama,`
` it's not like I've, lo...`
`higi!!"`
`When Beatrice waved her pipe, heaven and earth turned over just for Lucifer.`
`...So, as a horribly natural result, she 'fell' onto the ceiling.`
`The ceiling doesn't seem that high to people standing on the floor.`
`...However, people who fall on it upside-down and head-first usually don't agree...`
`"Milady,`
` isn't that a little much?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Perhaps you are right.`
` I suppose I'll forgive her."`
`Beatrice waved her pipe again.`
`When she did, the magic that had been effecting Lucifer was released.`
`...So, as a horribly natural result, this time she 'fell' properly, back onto the floor.`
`'!s1`
`...gghh...`
`Beatrice-sama, `
`...f-forgive me......"`
`"What are you so afraid of?`
` I have already forgiven you, haven't I?`
` *cackle*!`
` So, Kanon.`
` Shall we continue?"`
`"......Continue what?`
` ...You aren't saying you want me to finish her, are you...?!"`
`"Ah, no, no.`
` It isn't over yet, right?"`
`"......What isn't?`
` ...Stop dodging the question...!!"`
`"I did promise to you your reward, didn't I?`
` If you could defeat my furniture,`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~the Seven Stakes of Purgatory~ib~`
`, riiiiiiight?"`
`"Come, arise, the Seven Stakes of Purgatory.`
` The six younger sisters of the worthless elder sister!"`
`""""""Kyahhahahahahahahahahahahaha!!""""""`
`The air split with shrill laughter,`
` and as a golden splash scattered about, the remaining six Sisters of Purgatory showed themselves...`
`All the Seven Sisters of Purgatory were here, after Kanon was able to defeat one only by sacrificing his left arm...`
`By now, Kanon regretted his thoughtlessness in accepting the witch's challenge.`
`...He had been foolish to assume that a game against a witch would be on an even footing...!`
`"......Laaame.`
` Onee-sama, why are you crawling on the floor?"`
`"Y-You people.........`
`nnnggh..."`
`"I told you, Onee-sama's useless.`
` Even though she acts like she's so great just because she's the oldest, that's only on the outside."`
`"Yeah, seriously!`
` Lucifer onee-sama, your disgraceful behavior will damage the reputation of us all!`
` Know your shame!`
` You novice!"`
`"......Nng, ......gggh..."`
`"Kanon-kuuun, that was totally awesome.`
` But don't get cocky, okay?`
` Lucifer onee-sama brags all the time, but she's no big deal compared to the rest of us sisters."`
`"...That's why I'm always saying Lucifer-nee shouldn't do anything.`
` Just let her keep bragging all the time.`
` After all, those of us with talent can handle all the tough jobs."`
`"What are you gonna do, Onee-sama?`
` Out of respect for your pride, `
`we were planning to stay out of your way, in the hopes that you'd challenge him again in that beat-up body of yours..."`
`"...But Kanon-kun sure is strong, right?`
` Right now, no matter how much you struggle, there's no way you could win, right...?"`
`"...Y-`
`You people......"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` My, my, you sisters are always so lively.`
` Is this any time to fight amongst yourselves?`
` It's only together that you're the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, correct?`
` Now, play nice and execute the tasks I give you.`
` And swiftly, okay?"`
`"Hey, Lucifer onee-sama,`
` if you wanna borrow the power of your little sisters,`
` ...then say it, okay?`
` We wanna hear you ask us for help with your own mouth."`
`"Nng...... Do you plan to mock me even more......?!"`
`'!s1`
` weak,`
` ugly,`
` and shameful...`
`...Lucifer, the eldest sister, beg my younger sisters to save me'.`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, rg2_3e29:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, rg2_3e30:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, rg2_3e31:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, rg2_3e32:`
`"...You...`
`...b-`
`bitch..."`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory unanimously closed in on their worthless sister.`
` Abusing her.`
`...Even Kanon, who had been fighting for his life until a second ago, couldn't bear to look at it...`
`"A-As if...`
`...as if I...`
`could say...`
`something like that..."`
`"Quickly now.`
` Clearly, we won't make any progress here with you alone.`
` Hurry up, let the Seven Sisters strike Kanon."`
`"Pu ku ku ku...`
` My, my, what is the matter, Lucifer?`
` This is an order from Milady, is it not?"`
`"......How cruel."`
`After grinding her teeth over and over after hearing her sisters' curses,`
` ......Lucifer trembled all over...`
`and answered her sisters' request...`
`"......I-I, the foolish, `
`...weak, `
`......ugly...`
`...whaa...!"`
`"And shameful!!"`
`'!s1`
`...Lucifer, the eldest sister, `
`...beg...`
`......whaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!"`
`The girl known as Pride was finally unable to endure the words she was saying...`
`and broke down crying.`
`However, the six younger sisters kept giggling coldheartedly.`
`"Wait a sec!`
` Don't try to trick us by crying!`
` You haven't finished saying iiit!"`
`"That should be enough.`
` Come, sisters, let us display our power."`
`"I won't be satisfied 'til I hear the whole thing, okay?!`
` C'mon, c'mon, Onee-sama, keep going!"`
`"That's enough!`
` Come on, this shame effects us all!`
` We won't let them leave here alive!"`
`"Okay, how should we play with this pitiful furniture?`
` Any wonderful plans?"`
`"Ye-s, yes!`
` Beelze thiiinks the seven of us shooould get along and split Kanon up between us!"`
`"Good idea.`
` ...That way all of the sisters can get along."`
`"Then I'll take the head!`
` I'll leave the limbs and guts to you all!!"`
`"No, no, noooooooooooo!!`
` I get the heeead!!"`
`"There's no way that promise'll mean anything, right?!`
` First one there wins!"`
`"Hihihihihi!!`
` Kanon-kun, if you've got any ideas for how we should kill you, just tell us, okay?`
` The Seven Sisters'll kill you in an aaawesome way!"`
`"............Damn..."`
`"...Aaarrrrrrgggh!!`
` You've shamed me so deeply!!`
` Slicing you into eight pieces won't be enough!!`
` I'll slice you into a hundred pieces!!`
` Here we go, everyone!!"`
`""""""Yeees, Onee-sama!`
` Kyahhahahahahahaha!!""""""`
`The seven of them burst at once.`
`They had no intention of playing or boasting.`
`This time, they would genuinely follow their master's order.`
`...Take Kanon down. Swiftly!`
`The Seven Sisters jumped around the room faster than the eye could see, examining how they could best kill Kanon.`
`They tortured Kanon with their cruel giggles, sometimes making a close pass at him.`
`...They kept scraping his arms, shoulders, and cheeks, `
`gradually carving red letters into his body...`
`At that moment, Shannon dashed up behind him, holding on to him so that she blocked the way to his body at least a little.`
`At the same time, a red cylinder wrapped around the two of them, like a beam of light sent from heaven.`
`That cylinder repelled the evil ones who tormented Kanon...`
`"Whaaaat?!!`
` You're me-an!`
` This has nothing to do with yo-u!"`
`"Ah, I see.`
` You must want to play with us."`
`"Kyaha!`
` Then I'll take i-t!`
` All mine!!"`
`"Beatrice-sama,`
` can we take Shannon as our prey...?"`
`"Hmm?`
` Aah, I don't mind, do as you like.`
` It seems Kanon alone won't be enough to satisfy your gluttony."`
`"You have our deepest gratitude.`
` Come on, I'll make you regret coming out uninvited!"`
`"I'll turn you into scraps of meat so unrecognizable, you won't be able to tell which is which,`
` mix you and mix you and mince you into hamburgers!"`
`"Idiot, breaking that barrier should come first, right?!`
` Don't let your gluttony get in the way of your job!"`
`""""Yees, Onee-sama!!""""`
`As a horribly natural first action, the Seven Sisters began to destroy the barrier Shannon had created.`
`...Shannon's barrier certainly was strong.`
`It was powerful enough to impress even Beatrice.`
`...With its strength, frail furniture would turn to dust just by touching it,`
` and it was firm, like a tree with deep roots.`
`But no matter how big a tree gets, it will eventually surrender to a saw or a hatchet.`
`For the Seven Sisters, 'chopping down' Shannon's barrier would be annoying, but not impossible.`
`A sound like beetles jumping about grew even fiercer and filled the room.`
`The red barrier began to be cut up and eroded away as though with an hatchet, a saw...no, a chainsaw by now...`
`"......How foolish.`
` Even though you must know that your barrier can't fully protect you from these girls.`
` Why...?"`
`"......Because I couldn't overlook it."`
`As Shannon covered Kanon, who was already at his limits, sprawled on the floor, she spoke back resolutely.`
`"If you hadn't barged in uninvited, I would have given you a death like sleep.`
` Why have you gone to all the trouble of exposing yourself before the Seven Sisters?`
` ...Not all deaths are the same.`
` A cruel death will cause you far more anguish than merely dying.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......Go ahead, do as you like.`
` Just as you always do what you want, I did what I wanted."`
`".........`
`...Hmmmm.`
` At any rate, you're not quite amusing at the present moment.`
` Romance is most interesting when you're wondering whether it will succeed or not."`
`"Once it does succeed, a woman is like salmon who has finished laying its eggs.`
` I have already tired of you."`
`"Thank you.`
` No words from a witch would make me happier."`
`"...Hehehehhihihahaha.`
` Then, at least in the end, let me see you die in a truly entertaining manner.`
` Seven Sisters, can you hear me?!`
` Kill Shannon in a way that shows me the limits of brutality!!"`
`".........Shannon..."`
`"...My apologies.`
` In the end, I wasn't able to reach your level, Genji-sama."`
`"......You're an idiot, Nee-san...`
` If you'd just let me be, ...then you might not have had to meet a horrible end..."`
`"No, it's fine.`
` ...I received a ring from George-sama and lived as a woman.`
` I have protected you and lived as a sister.`
` With this, my life is complete, with no regrets."`
`"...Nnnngyaaaaaaaaaaahhhh, you're pissing me off.`
` That philosophical take really is irritating!!`
` Like I said, you're furniture, you don't even smell like a humaaaaaan!!"`
`"Look at me, ~ib~I~ib~ am a human!!`
` Don't spout off philosophical crap, like you're more complete than I am, you furnituuuuuuuuuuure!!"`
`"......How ugly.`
` Are those regrets...what you truly are?"`
`"They aren't regreeeeeets, this is called living!!`
` What's this about not minding if you die, just because you were given a ring?!`
` Aaaaah, I can't understand it, it's incomprehensible, disappointing, outrageous, stunning, and it's all useleeeeeeeesss!!"`
`"...Milady, perhaps you're acting a tad undignified."`
`"Shut up, furniture!!`
` Shannooooonn, do you think I'll let you die so easilyyyyyyyyyyy?!`
` Now's the time to bite your tooooooongue!!"`
`"......How pitiful.`
` If you can see yourself reflected in my eyes,`
` then shudder at your own ugliness."`
`"Fear not, `
`once I've crushed you up, you'll be much more ugly even while you still liiiiiiiive!!!"`
`At that time, ......Genji softly entered the red barrier.`
`Perhaps that barrier didn't block those without ill intent.`
`Then, ...Genji gently held her from behind...`
`and covered her eyes with his right hand.`
`"......Genji-sama..."`
`"You've already done enough...`
` ......Go to sleep before me."`
`"......Yes.`
` ......Thank you very much, Genji-sama..."`
`"......Indeed."`
`After that, Genji softly pressed his left hand near her collarbone...`
`...As he did, eminating from that area...`
`a crimson stain gently spread out.`
`When Genji removed his hand, `
`......bright-red, fresh blood oozed out of there.`
`It only happened for the first instant, and it was shaped like a crimson rose...`
`And when he removed his right hand covering her face, `
`......there was a peaceful expression there, as though she was sleeping.`
`'!s0`
`...silently, `
`......and slept.`
`Her soul had already been sent to a world where the malicious witch and her furniture could not reach her, `
`no matter how evilly they tortured her...`
`This scene left Beatrice and the Seven Sisters stunned.`
`...Only Ronove wore a mysterious smile.`
`Then, Genji leaned over Kanon, who was crouching on the floor.`
`"......You did well.`
` You should sleep now too."`
`"............`
`......Yes.`
` Thank you very much, Genji-sama."`
`Just as he had done with Shannon, he softly covered Kanon's eyes with his hand, `
`then gently pressed the area around Kanon's collarbone with his other hand.`
`...And when his hand was removed with the lightness of a feather, `
`...there was a crimson rose there.`
`But that rose shape quickly turned into the stain of bright-red blood pouring out...`
`"...Wh-`
`What is...that...?"`
`"...What a boring person.`
` ...Even though it's so fun to poke the balloon of life with a needle so that it forcefully explodes."`
`"Spectacular, Genji.`
` ......You truly are furniture."`
`"...Thank you very much.`
` ...Well then, Beatrice-sama, Ronove-sama.`
` With this as my final task, allow me to rest."`
`"......Tch.`
` Damn you, snatching away my fun.`
` Why don't I take all the thrashing and mashing I wanted to do to them...`
`and give it to you instead??"`
`Beatrice faced him with an unsatisfied expression, `
`but Ronove spoke quietly to Genji with a soothing smile.`
`"You have worked hard.`
` You are my greatest servant.`
` ...As a final gift, I shall bestow upon you a peaceful sleep fitting for all the labors you have performed."`
`"What?!`
` Wait, it's not your place to...!"`
`When Ronove snapped his fingers, `
`...Genji slumped to the floor like a puppet with its strings cut.`
` ...Suddenly, and yet gently.`
`He crumpled, falling into a sleep that no witch could call him back from...`
`It was as filled with kindness as the sleep he had given Shannon and Kanon...`
`"...What was that, Ronove?`
` ...What a boring anticlimax."`
`"Are you not a mighty Great Witch, Milady?`
` What happened here is hardly worthy of your concern.`
` ...It isn't like you, to let the provocation of someone like Shannon get to you."`
`"............`
`...Hmm."`
`What was it that had Beatrice so irritated?`
`...Was she still unable to remove the thorn of Shannon's words?`
`Ronove laughed lightly, as though lamenting the complexity of humanity and a woman's heart, and ordered the Seven Sisters to go.`
`...After all, there were still two sacrifices left for the first twilight.`
`The Seven Sisters disappeared in ecstasy...`
`Gohda was doing the nighttime rounds.`
`Rokkenjima had always been empty, except for the Ushiromiya Family household.`
`So, checking that the doors and windows were all closed had no real purpose.`
`However, ever since the time Natsuhi had condemned such an attitude as being careless, the nighttime rounds had become part of the servants' daily routine.`
`...In the first place, Natsuhi had ordered this because of the occasional witch disturbances.`
`Everyone who came and left this island knew about the legend of Beatrice, the witch of the forest.`
`It had become established as this island's characteristic ghost story.`
`Because of that, it was only natural that some people would claim that, when they thought they were alone in the mansion, `
`...they would hear a strange sound or see the shadow of a person.`
`However, when that created a little too much of a disturbance and reached Natsuhi's ears, `
`she made a fuss, thinking that some suspicious person might have been entering and leaving.`
`Apparently, she had roused all the servants and had them check throughout the mansion.`
`Because all of that panic over the witch had happened before Gohda's arrival, `
`he had only heard about it from the more senior servants.`
`Ghost stories like that could be found in any workplace.`
`Even at the hotels and restaurants Gohda had worked at, there had been plenty of them.`
`So when he heard about that story on this island, `
`he'd given a forced smile, thinking 'Ah, so they have that kind of thing here after all'.`
`That forced smile aside, he had figured that, when in Rome, do as the Romans do, and had taken it seriously.`
`Gohda went along with it on the outside, but in his heart, he'd assumed it to be a childish trick.`
` ...At first, that is.`
`"......This certainly is eerie.`
` Yes, I can see why it was so easy for past servants to get into a panic."`
`He could understand how someone doing the rounds on an eerie night like this...`
`might believe they'd seen a ghost if they saw a lace curtain waving in the breeze from a window that hadn't been closed.`
`"So, if you make fun of the witch of the portrait, there is a curse.`
` ...It seems there was even a servant who received a serious injury and quit.`
` ...Well, I wouldn't want that.`
` Think of my age.`
` I probably wouldn't be granted a workplace this hospitable again...`
` Aaah.`
` Witch of the portrait,`
` I'm working sincerely, so please give me some peace."`
`Gohda prayed to the portrait, his hands together, as though he was at a Shinto shrine...`
`At that time, ...he thought he heard a sound.`
`The kitchen?`
` Was that the sound of something metal falling on the floor?`
`Maybe a mouse or a cockroach had come out and knocked over some of the dishes.`
` No, no, how could that be?`
` It was usually cleaned thoroughly!`
`Thinking he'd check out what that noise really had been, Gohda entered the kitchen.`
`He turned on the kitchen light.`
`When he did, he heard a strange sound.`
`*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*.`
`...To a cook like Gohda, the sound felt like the lid on a pressure cooker or something shaking.`
`Surely, there wouldn't be a pot on the burner when no one was in the kitchen.`
`Even if someone was using the gas, walking away from it would be quite dangerous.`
`...Just in case, Gohda decided to inspect the area around the gas range...`
`"......What is this...?"`
`When he did, in the corner with the gas range, `
`...the pressure cooker really had been set out, just as he'd thought.`
`But the flame wasn't on.`
`...And yet, the lid was clanking...`
`Was something fermenting and leaking gas?`
`...How could that be?`
` ...Then was there a mouse or something inside?`
`...How could there be? Ridiculous...`
`When people were watching, Gohda acted as though he had a bold personality fitting for his build,`
` ...but he actually had an unexpectedly timid side to him.`
`He was frightened that there might be something inside, and he couldn't bring himself to check it carelessly...`
`In his cowardice, ...he grabbed a nearby wooden pestle,`
` and with a *clunk!* `
`he tapped it a little forcefully against the side of the pressure cooker.`
`When he did, the clanking sound suddenly stopped.`
`...He should've been relieved that it had stopped,`
` ...but the fact that it had stopped when he'd hit it was even more eerie, and made him even more suspicious about what was inside...`
`"......Hmm, ...*gulp*.`
` ......Mysterious phenomena do not exist in this world.`
` Yes, witches and magic, things like that couldn't possibly exist.`
` All phenomena can be explained with science.`
` ...As if monsters and witches could exist...!"`
`He repeated that many times, trying to build up his own confidence.`
`...The gap between what he was saying and what he was doing was quite comical.`
`"Who would believe in a witch, who would believe in magic or curses...?`
` ...Come on, `
`...show me what you really are...!`
` Take that!"`
`...He removed the lid of the pressure cooker.`
`'!s0`
`was the sparkling clean silver bottom of the pot.`
`...There was absolutely nothing frightening like he'd imagined.`
`"......Whew.`
` ...Hahahaha, it's only natural.`
` ...There's no way there could have been anything inside."`
`By now, Gohda realized that he had been a coward.`
`...So, while he still had some doubts as to what had caused the lid to make that sound, `
`...he figured it wasn't a big problem, and decided not to worry about it too much.`
`Then he took the lid he'd grabbed...and softly set it back down where it had been.`
`...It's fine, it won't make a sound.`
` ...Of course it won't.`
`As if witches or magic could exist...!`
`*clank*.`
`*clank*clank*clank*clank*.`
`"......Huh...?"`
`*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*.`
`*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*!`
`"...E-Eeeeeeeeeeeppp!!"`
`All of the pots and dishes in the kitchen started clanking at once.`
`It grew even stronger, so that finally, the lid to one of the pots fell off...!`
`And...from inside that pot, ......a slender white arm reached out.`
`Lids fell off the other pots one after another, `
`and another, `
`and another...`
`"Eeeeeeeeeepp!!!`
` As if...as if witches could exiiiist!!`
` As if I'd believe iiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`When the number of arms grew to seven, a loud, shrill laughter split the air.`
`"What a letdown!`
` Too bad that someone who can make such delicious food is such a lightweight!!"`
`"If you don't want him, I'll take him, he's all mine!!"`
`"Wait, I said nooooooooooo!!`
` I'll take him!!"`
`"Huh?!`
` Wha, whaa?!?!`
` HYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!"`
`""""Kyahahahahahahaha!!!""""`
`Come on, let's search, there's only one more.`
`That old hag!`
`Where is she?`
`She isn't in the mansion, what about the guesthouse?`
`Kuhihihihi, first one wins, first one wins, right?!`
`Come on, search, search, find her, find her...!`
`Don't be noticed by the relatives in the dining hall, right?`
`And don't get noticed by the kids in the guesthouse, right?`
`Search in silence, kill in silence!`
`After all, it's still just the first twilight!`
`She isn't in the guesthouse.`
`But she wasn't in the mansion either, right?`
`Hey, hey, I found her, I found her, she's in the rose garden.`
`Why's she standing around there without an umbrella?`
`She's already given up, all mine, all mine, all miiine!`
` You blockheads can just sit there and watch!`
`I told you, nooooooo, this one's miiiiiiiiiiiiine!!`
`Come on, if we take any longer, we'll be scolded by Beatrice-sama!`
` Let's take care of it all at once!`
`"............"`
`There, found her, surrounded her!`
` Come on, let's get along and do it all at once, okay?!`
` Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie!!!`
`"......Huuuh...?`
` ......What?"`
`'!s1`
`What is...`
`this...?"`
`"......Hohohohoh.`
` What naughty girls.`
` ...You wouldn't happen to be friends of that child, would you...?"`
`"...Just what is this......this old hag...?!"`
`"There's got to be some mistake!!`
` One more time!!"`
`"...Why can she defend against us?!"`
`"Move aside!`
` One more time!!!"`
`"......No matter how often you try, it won't work.`
` This person...is good."`
`"......I am waiting for that child.`
` Would you mind calling for her?"`
`"D-Do you really expect us to run errands for you like that?!"`
`"There's no need."`
`"Beatrice-sama...!"`
`"......After all, even I have manifested by now.`
` ...I was certain that you had awakened."`
`"Ronove,`
` it's been a long time.`
` ...Yes, truly, a long time."`
`"This person's talking to Ronove-sama without using 'sama'...!"`
`".........And...`
`it's been a long time since I've seen you too,`
` ...Beatrice."`
`"Sh-She's not even using 'sama' for Beatrice-sama..."`
`"Enough.`
` Don't you know who this is?`
` ...The name 'Beatrice' itself is hers.`
` I only inherited it from her.`
` ...This is my teacher,`
` the previous Lady Beatrice."`
`"The previous...`
`Lady Beatrice..."`
`Gold butterflies appeared in ones and twos from the garden of roses and began to gather around Kumasawa...`
`Then, after she was wrapped in a golden sparkle, she burst and disappeared, and Kumasawa's form was no longer there.`
`...Instead, there was another Golden Witch, ......the one who once taught the path of an Endless Witch to Beatrice,`
` and the only person Beatrice ever called Teacher.`
`Her hair was long, beautiful, and vividly youthful,`
` and her figure in that elegant dress couldn't possibly have been mistaken for an old lady...`
`No, this looked like a completely different person from Kumasawa.`
`"......Well, well, Teacher.`
` I never even dreamed that we would meet each other again."`
`"Yes, neither did I.`
` ...I certainly never dreamed that my sleep would be disturbed."`
`"Such a troublesome time for you to awaken.`
` ...If you'd remained asleep as usual, the first twilight could have ended without much trouble.`
` ...Or perhaps I should be glad you're here.`
` ......I was just getting a tad bored."`
`"...As usual, it seems you're toying with sinless people in a vulgar game.`
` ...I believe I taught you several times that the power of the Endless Witch mustn't be used to cause people trouble."`
`"Don't say that, Teacher.`
` Isn't boredom our natural enemy?`
` This is just a little spice to escape from that."`
`"......Tch.`
` The more the corrosion advances, the stronger my power becomes, and the easier it becomes to summon my minions.`
` ...But who would have thought it would release the seal on you, Teacher, at the same time..."`
`"It's precisely because I predicted such a thing would happen...`
`that I slept so very close to where you were.`
` ...Though, I prayed in my sleep that I would not be woken again."`
`"...Being reunited with you like this is a very sad thing for me."`
`".........You're as cunning as always, Teacher...`
` *cackle*..."`
`"Ronove,`
` have that young furniture step back.`
` Furniture only serves its master.`
` The master is responsible for all of her crimes."`
`"......Certainly,`
` Madam Beatrice."`
`"I have already passed that name on to this child.`
` ...Come now, step back, `
`furniture girls.`
` ...I may give warnings a second time, if you did not listen to the first.`
` However, do not expect to receive a third..."`
`"...Step back, Seven Sisters of Purgatory.`
` If you get dragged into this, only dust will remain..."`
`"...B-Back, everyone..."`
`Ronove and the Seven Sisters of Purgatory retreated.`
`After that, what remained was the Beatrice whose daring expression didn't falter...`
`and the teacher Beatrice, who had given up that name and wore a composed smile...`
`"Well then,`
` ...Teacher,`
` what tea shall I prepare for our long-awaited reunion?"`
`"Let's see.`
` This reunion was longer in coming than the visit of a comet.`
` Perhaps I will accept your hospitality.`
` ......And if it seems a mistake has been made,`
` ...I'll have you return my name and the title of Endless Witch."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` So, even the title of Endless Witch has a license renewal policy?`
` ...As you wish, Teacher.`
` See how splendid your disciple has become, `
`and see how far she surpassed you so long ago...!"`
`The air between the two Beatrices seemed to explode with sparks.`
`Just by glaring at each other, they purged all spirits from that space.`
`...As they watched, the Seven Sisters shivered.`
`...After all, if they had retreated just three steps less than they had, they would already have been turned to dust by now.`
`"So come,`
` Beatrice.`
` ...Surrendering my name to you is the only regret I have in life.`
` I will now correct that error by my own hands!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...`
`...Tsk, tsk, tsk.`
` ...You've got it wrong, Teacheer.`
` My only error...`
`was becoming your disciple in the hopes of gaining such a puny level of power, get iiiiiiiit?"`
`"What are you calling magic?`
` What are you calling the Endless Witch?`
` ...All you've got is a power that can be gained just by noticing, right?`
` And you act as though that's so great and impressive.`
` Your turn's long over, Teacheeeeeeeeeeeeer!!"`
`"......I...`
`I-I don't have a clue what's going on anymore...!`
` What in the world is happening right in front of my eyes...?!"`
`"...You poor thing.`
` It seems my disciple is causing you trouble.`
` I apologize."`
`"Wh-Who the heck are you...?`
` Why did old Kumasawa turn into a nee-chan like this?!`
` I mean, seriously, who are you?!`
` I don't get it!`
` What kind of special effects are these?!`
` My head feels like it's gonna explode!!"`
`"I am the witch teacher of that child.`
` My old name was Beatrice.`
` When that child succeeded me, I gave up that name, so I have no name of my own."`
`"Like you've already said, your disciple's been a real pain to me!`
` Please, take responsibility and do something!`
` No, wait!!"`
`"I don't believe in stuff like this!!`
` As if witches and magic could exist!!`
` I won't accept this messed-up battle!`
` Dammit, what should I believe?!!"`
`"Hohohoh...`
` That's just like you, hospitality with a very quick temper."`
`"...*cackle*cackle*`
` I'd expect nothing less from you, Teacher.`
` It seems this is so trivial to you, you don't even feel like opening your eyes...!`
` But I doubt you'll be able to win unless you're prepared to wreck this whole island, seeeeeeee?`
` Come, arise, Shoulder War Towers!!"`
`In response to Beatrice's summons, a terrific earth tremor split the rose garden.`
`And on either side of her shoulders, two massive War Towers sprouted and stabbed into the heavens.`
`They stretched up to 100 #fefefemerute#ffffff tall, and each had over 360 ports.`
`They were War Towers of the gods' army corps, which had prevented even groups of ancient heroes from invading their sacred grounds.`
`As Beatrice elegantly floated in the gap between the massive two-headed towers, she looked down on her teacher, sneering with a sense of absolute superiority.`
`With the two massive towers lined up behind her shoulders, the witch looked very small,`
` like a butterfly dancing between huge trees.`
`"Hihhyahhyahhyaaaaaa!!`
` Don't think you can dodge it by turning into butterflies, okay?`
` The density of the twin towers' barrage wouldn't just make you a pinned bug sample, it'd make you a madly stabbed pincushion, right...?"`
`Over 720 ports opened on the towers, and godly soldiers readied their multi-shot ballistas.`
`"Is that the end of your turn?"`
`"Heh, famous last words!!`
` Blast awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!"`
`The ballista shots that numbered over a thousand were all fired at once, drawing a beautiful geometric curtain of death.`
`The boorish sound as the bowstrings were played was probably even deeper than that of a reaper swinging its sickle.`
`"Come, arise, Fallen Tower.`
` Split the single language and let that sin be known."`
`The sky was stained an incandescent red, and from between the clouds, a blazing, massive tower fell upside down.`
`That massive falling tower and its rubble...`
`sucked in the thousands of ballista shots, so that not one of them approached the body of the witch who had summoned it.`
`That's right, no group of people, no matter how large, could approach the mysteries of heaven.`
` That was the reality of the fallen tower.`
`"As I'd expect from you, Teacher!`
` If you do something, you always do it big!!`
` Khehhhuhuhuhuhyahyahya!!"`
`"My turn isn't over.`
` Come, arise, Sons of Ivaldi.`
` Bestow upon me a worthy spear."`
`As the massive crimson tower that had fallen made a terrible gold-colored explosion, `
`a massive spear appeared from inside those flames, so tall, like a tower, that you had to look up to see all of it.`
`...It was too large even for a giant's hand.`
`That divinely beautiful Spear of the Gods was so massive, it gave the illusion that the fallen tower had turned into a spear of the same size.`
` It was a spear of certain victory that none could escape.`
`"Looks like your twin towers won't help you now.`
` How foolish, to block off your means of escape on both sides.`
` You can't defend against even a single spear!"`
`When she snapped her fingers in command,`
` the massive tower-sized spear shot at Beatrice like a lightning bolt.`
`It aimed right for the middle of the center of the Golden Witch's heart with extreme precision,`
` as she danced in the gap between the towers like a butterfly,`
` slicing straight through the air like a flash of lightning.`
`"Hah!!`
` So, you use Gungnir at a moment like this!!`
` You really are incredible, Teacheeeeeer!!"`
`"Burst, useless towers!`
` Arise, Giant Soldier Battle Line.`
` Fully block that divine spear with your shields and chests!!"`
`The Shoulder War Towers exploded in gold.`
`They became several billion gold butterflies.`
`Those butterflies took the shape of seven massive armored soldiers.`
`Each stretched a full 50 merute into the sky, `
`and they lined up in front of Beatrice, protecting their master and holding massive shields that towered like windmills.`
`They were as massive as a mountain range.`
`The witch behind them was like a small moon hiding behind the mountains.`
`Once in the past, when the massive shields these giants held had been readied by the whole regiment, `
`they had protected King Whilhelm's castle not only from arrows, but from the wind and the rain,`
` for when they had faced upwards and held their shields to the heavens, not a single raindrop had gotten through.`
`"Foolish.`
` The shame of a witch who has forgotten to respect things sacred.`
` Did you think mere giants could defend against a Spear of the Gods?!"`
`"...Indeed.`
` No matter how much human metal you are armed with, you cannot block a Spear of the Gods.`
` A wonderful Epaulette Mate by Madam."`
`"No way!`
` Beatrice-sama?!!"`
`"Of course I haven't forgotten, Teacher!`
` Come arise, disciples of Hephaestus.`
` Bestow upon me a worthy shield!!"`
`A golden whirlwind arose at the feet of the Giant Soldiers.`
` It was a cloud of countless butterflies.`
`...They attached themselves to the massive shields like gold leaf, sparkling like they were a gold mirror.`
`It was the absolute defensive wall given to a goddess by the chief of the gods.`
`The Aegis Shield.`
`When the holy spear, which left a dignified tail behind it like a comet, crashed into the mountain range of that gold shield,`
` there was a terrible thunderous roar.`
` It was the creaking of the pillars that held up the heavens.`
`The Divine Spear spun around and around...and was sent flying in the direction of the setting sun.`
`"Impossible...`
` She defended against the Divine Spear...!!"`
`"No, that is not correct.`
` The divine spear avoided her.`
` It is the law of the gods that an absolute spear and an absolute shield must never fight one another.`
` Although, in the end, it means the same thing as defending against it."`
`".........Your skills have improved from engaging in these fights so often."`
`"Or rather, it seems you're still as bad as ever at this kind of game, Teacher.`
` It's my turn to strike back.`
` I shall follow the code and counter a spear with a spear."`
`The Giant Soldier Battle Line, which had fully blocked the Divine Spear, released its holy gold shields.`
`The shields fell to the earth, making the ground shake.`
`When they did, another gold whirlwind arose,`
` and the seven gold shields changed their form into seven massive spears of lightning lying on the ground.`
`At once, each of the giants lifted one of their legs high...and firmly stomped on the tips of the handles.`
`As the earth shook with a thunderous sound, the seven lightning spears spun beautifully and flew up above the Giant Soldiers' heads.`
`...They scattered into a golden splash and began to fall before the giants.`
`Each of the giants squared off, and with the force of their whole body, they kicked and smashed them.`
`The broken pieces numbered exactly 30, and became lightning spears of exactly the same size as the originals...`
`...Which made 210 for the 7 giants. And all of those burst at once, `
`with each splitting into 30 thorns, for a total of 6,300.`
`They became a barrage of thunderclouds drawing a beautiful geometric pattern, `
`and then each changed into three bolts of lightning, so that 18,900 thunderbolts shot at the Predecessor Beatrice.`
`"It's oveeeeer,`
` Beatrice-samaaa!!"`
`"I would expect nothing less...`
`from Madam."`
`That bundle of almost 20,000 thunderbolts must have reduced the teacher's body to dust.`
`But there had been no resistance.`
`Beatrice knew immediately that she had been fooled.`
`At that time, from the direction that the sun had supposedly set, she felt the impossible rays of sunlight.`
`A brilliant ray of light shone on her profile.`
`It was the figure of her teacher, holding aloft the Spear of the Gods that had supposedly been repelled a short while ago.`
`...She bore a sparkle like the sun on her back and made it shine on the incarnation of darkness.`
`...As Beatrice watched, `
`she was trapped like a mouse in a cage, cornered in a dead end formed by the Giant Soldier Battle Line.`
`By now, the Predecessor Beatrice had seized a position directly alongside that Line.`
`"Playtime is over, Beatrice...!"`
`"......Have I...`
`exposed my flaaaaank...?!"`
`Her bold expression hadn't faltered even once, but now it twisted for the first time.`
`And faster than Beatrice could click her tongue, the Predecessor Beatrice released the holy spear.`
`As it leapt through the air, it changed its form once more.`
`"Come, arise, Dvergar brothers.`
`Bestow upon me the giant-smashing Iron Hammer of heaven!"`
`"Giant soldiers, protect me!!!`
`What are you doing, you blockheads?!!!"`
`By now it was no longer a spear, but the whirlwind of a massive hammer that raised a sound like a windstorm as it flew through the air.`
`It was the legendary hammer that had shaken even the King of the Frost Giants.`
`So, the Giant Soldiers couldn't escape from that fear.`
`So, regardless of how strongly their master ordered them, they couldn't get in the path of that hammer.`
`"Back Rank Mate!`
` Rest in peace."`
`"...Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit...!!!"`
`Before the whirlwind of that massive chunk of metal, Beatrice was nothing more than a mere speck.`
`The instant the whirlwind started to suck Beatrice in, she appeared to change into a massive War Tower.`
`The Iron Hammer smashed the War Tower, scattering tremendous amounts of rubble, but it did not reach she who had escaped behind it.`
`Furthermore, when the smoke started to settle, the War Tower had sucked in the massive Iron Hammer without crumbling, and blocked the way.`
`Even the giant-smashing Iron Hammer couldn't break through the final tower protecting the witch.`
`However, this War Tower was actually the witch's last trump card.`
`It was a War Tower for dodging that could only save her from danger once.`
`But this tower was impregnable.`
` No weapon could break through it.`
`At that time, the moon disappeared.`
`As Beatrice hid in the shadows of the Giant Soldier Battle Line and the War Tower, she looked up at the sky.`
`When she did, inside the moon was the figure of a massive horse ridden by the god of war and death.`
`The Predecessor Beatrice rode the horse with him.`
`His cloak had blocked the moon and swallowed it in an eerie shadow.`
`And the Spear of the Gods was in his hand once more...`
`In other words, it was a godly knight who had jumped over the ramparts formed by the Giant Soldiers and the War Tower, attacking from the heavens.`
`"...*cackle*...`
` You got meee..."`
`"Smothered Mate.`
` It was fun, Beatrice!"`
`"Uuuooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!"`
`The struggle to the death between the two witches with the same name...was over.`
`The spear that had been launched from the heavens pierced the ground.`
`The Giant Soldier Battle Line and the War Tower split up into countless gold butterflies, wrapping the area in a gold-colored storm.`
`Then came the sound of thunder.`
`And the sound of the falling rain and wind.`
`If you looked around, the rose garden was empty.`
`...The butler and the rest were watching the two witches confronting each other.`
`......But Beatrice alone had changed.`
`She had been pierced straight through by the spear, from the base of her neck and her right shoulder to her left buttocks,`
` unable to even reach the ground with her feet, `
`...horribly exposed like a pitiful pinned butterfly, tormented by the wind and rain...`
`"......B-Beatrice-sama..."`
`".........`
`As expected, `
`...a truly fearsome person."`
`"That settles it,`
` Beatrice."`
`'!s1`
`...hihihihi, `
`...ouch...ch..."`
`Beatrice wore a bitter smile of false courage,`
` but a strand of blood dangled from her mouth, making her look even more pitiful.`
`"The title and power of the Endless Witch.`
` You will return them to me now, along with the name Beatrice.`
` ...You are too immature to call yourself an Endless Witch."`
`"......Stop...`
` Forgive me, Teacher...`
` I was just fooling around, okay...?"`
`"I will take my name back from you.`
` I shall return you to your original form.`
` Perhaps you should relinquish this power which is beyond you...and live a life suitable for yourself."`
`"......Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have?"`
`The Predecessor Beatrice began to recite the words of power.`
`When she did, small gold butterflies gathered near the skewered Beatrice...and began to swarm about her.`
`Like butterflies sucking the nectar out of flowers...`
`...They began to suck the magical power out of Beatrice.`
`And it seemed to cause her intense pain.`
`A cry of anguish issued from Beatrice's mouth.`
`She no longer had any power to resist it...`
`"Come, try closing your eyes.`
` Try to remember.`
` What form did you have?"`
`"......Come, Beatrice.`
` Repeat it with me.`
` Let us sing a song together.`
` Then it will be over soon.`
` Let us end your pain as fast as possible."`
`'!s1`
`...ha, `
`...haha...`
` ...You're right...`
` How long has it been...`
`...since I've sung with you, Teacher...?"`
`"Come, together now.`
` ......Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have?"`
`"...Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have...?"`
`When the two of them began to recite the same song, `
`more and more gold butterflies danced around, swarming around Beatrice...`
`"......It will be all right, Milady.`
` You will lose your place as my disciple, `
`but that will not change the fact that you are the lady I serve."`
`"...After that, I shall read a book for you again.`
` I shall bake you apple pies once more.`
` Just like it was long ago.`
` ...Come, try to remember."`
`"...Hahahahahaha...`
` Yes, try to remember.`
` ...Are you finally starting to remember...?`
` ......Hey, Teacher."`
`'!s1`
`that thing behind yooou...?"`
`"...What is...`
`............this...?"`
`When the Predecessor Beatrice looked behind her, `
`......there was an eerie hedgehog curled up there.`
`No.`
` ...It was...`
`herself.`
`There was another Predecessor Beatrice, whose whole body had been packed with ballista shots,`
` ...lying there like a pincushion doll...`
`"...Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have?`
` ...Or maybe that's not right."`
`"...Come, try to remember.`
` How were you killed?`
` ...Kuhihihii, kuhyahhyahhyahhaaaaaaahh!!"`
`The Predecessor Beatrice was stunned.`
`...Her form gradually began to fade away...`
`"This is...`
` ...When...did you......?"`
`"At the beginning, I did not summon a pair of Shoulder Towers.`
` There were four towers.`
` Teacher, you carelessly stepped across the Seventh Rank Rook boundary of death created by the two hidden towers, `
`which were lurking in the distance on either side of you."`
`"...It was bad manners of me to say check this late.`
` I simply must apologize.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The battle had been decided at the very beginning.`
`It had been over since the time the Predecessor had leaned forward, readying her holy spear to attack Beatrice, who had been wedged between her Shoulder Towers.`
`...The hidden towers lurking on either side had bathed her in a windstorm of ballista shots from 720 ports on both sides,`
` pinning and killing her.`
`However, Beatrice hadn't wanted it to be resolved like that.`
`She had wanted to let her teacher take her next move...and had continued acting as though the game was still on.`
`She had immediately revived her with the Endless Power...`
`and had made her continue the game as though nothing had happened...`
`Then, the Predecessor slowly remembered that she had already been killed...`
`...and began to vanish completely.`
`When she did, the spear that had pierced Beatrice also vanished.`
`Beatrice finally landed on the ground.`
`...There wasn't even a trace of a scar.`
`"......It was fun, `
`Teacher.`
` If you want to play again, I'll revive you any time.`
` And once we've had some fun, I'll make you remember that you're a corpse again."`
`"See?`
` I did everything you told me to, right...?`
` Didn't you tell me to always put my toys back in their boxes when I'm done playing with them?`
` *cackle*cackle* Hahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"...Was it...an easy victory?"`
`"You fool, it was a tough one!!`
` ......If I hadn't tricked her with the four towers, I would've been the one dead!`
` ...As I'd expect from Teacher.`
` ......But now I can stand proud."`
`"...Now, I have completely surpassed Teacher.`
` Ronove,`
` clean up Teacher's remains a bit.`
` ...I haven't lost my respect for her that much."`
`"Certainly.`
` Tonight's first twilight became a little too riotous.`
` A little cleanup will be necessary.`
` I shall see to it immediately."`
`"Goats, it is time to clean up."`
`When Ronove snapped his fingers, blazing, sparkling eyes began to blink open in the shadows and darkness, `
`becoming goat-headed attendants that appeared one after another.`
`One by one, they wordlessly stood at attention in a line behind Ronove's back.`
`"This time, what shall be done about the six corpses?`
` Another closed room pattern?"`
`"...I'm in no mood to think now.`
` I will leave it to you, Ronove.`
` ...An extraordinary closed room to torment Battler, if you would."`
`"Certainly.`
` Then it shall be extraordinary."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle* Hahhhahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` Oookay, where's Battler?`
` Battleeeeer, did you see my big momeeeeeeeeent??"`
`"......Damn iiiiiiiiit...`
` After being shown that screwed up magical storm, what can I deny?!"`
`"Forget just witches existing!`
` After being shown that tremendous, flashy fantasy, `
`what can I deny now?!!`
` I don't get it anymore!`
`  It was like that last time too, but how can I deny these awesome, wonderful magical battles?!"`
`"Iiisn't that riiight?!`
` After watching this, you can't talk your way out of it, riiiiiiiight???`
` Okay, Battler, let me hear some ridiculous reasoning, khehhihhyahhyahhya!`
` Ihhiehhiehhyaaahhh!!"`
`"Milady, your laugh is becoming undignified."`
`"Oh, my apologies.`
` But that isn't my fault.`
` After all, if Battler tightly closes his eyes, grinds his teeth, and shows me that ever so bitter expression,`
` it just automatically slips out of my mouth, you seeee...`
` Kuhhihihhyahhyahaah!!"`
`"So, Battler-sama,`
` why don't you return to the table without losing heart?`
` Milady is expecting your counterattack, you see...?"`
`"Quit messing with me!!`
` How the hell can I make a counterargument?!"`
`"In the first place, everything was already screwed up when that tower sprouted up out of the earth!!`
` Should I say that, under the ground in Rokkenjima, there's a secret laboratory for building super-alloy combining robots or something,`
` and that pushing a button can make these strange towers sprout up?!`
` Right, and then those huge giants must be the robots,`
` or maybe an evil secret association's mecha-monsters?!"`
`"I don't get it!!`
` Don't talk to meeeeeeeeeee, gwaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!"`
`"Look, look, look, look, don't cry, okay??`
` Bang bang, it's magic!!`
` If you want, I'll crush the moon and make comets fall like rain!`
` I can even bury the whole island in those massive-breasted nee-chans you like so much, seeeeeeeeee??`
` Hihhihhihhihhi!!"`
`"Come on, come on, look, look, look, my turn's over, seeeeeeeeee?!`
` Show me your response, launch your counterattack!!`
` You can't, can yoooooouuu?`
` Accept that there's a quadrillion things you can't do!!`
` You're useless against this, riiiiiiiiiight?`
` You actually like this kind of fantasy, don't yooooouuu??"`
`"I get it, that's been going around on the streets lately, hasn't it?!`
` In manga and light novels, in anime and movies!`
` Some teenage brats get a whole bunch of strange special abilities, and they blow up all sorts of stuff with the fate of the world on the line!"`
`"You love that too, don't you?!`
` I know, don't hide it, you love it, right, hi-hyahhyahhyah!!`
` Hasn't the thing you love just been displayed before your very eyes?"`
`"Why do you believe it in manga and anime, but you won't believe in meeeeeeeeee??`
` Believe, believe, believe it!`
` You can't argue back, not after you've been shown something like this, riiiiiiiiiiiiight?"`
`"Look, look, look, answer,`
` you don't need to think, you can just obediently say 'I'm sorry, Beatrice-sama'!`
` Look, look, try saying it, 'I'm sorry, Beatrice-sama', try saying it, say it, say it, don't be embarrassed, `
`kukikikikakkakakahhyahhyaaaah hahhahhahahhhahahhyaaahh!!"`
`There would've been no way to tell that morning had come without opening a window and looking up at the cloudy sky, which had become a tiny bit lighter.`
`It wasn't a refreshing morning.`
` All that could be heard was the sound of the rain, which hadn't stopped falling since last night, and the howl of the wind...`
`"...It's hard to imagine that it's morning.`
` This horrible weather speaks for our hearts."`
`"Hey, it could be worse.`
` At least it's just rain and not spears falling from the sky."`
`"Wahhaha.`
` Whether it's rain or spears, it's comin' down with a bang.`
` ......Is it already 6:00?`
` Fuaaaaaa...`
` Isn't this enough?`
` After this, we've got no measures we can take 'til the mystery 19th person, Beatrice, makes her move."`
`"True.`
` ...However, I believe we have anticipated every trick they might use against us."`
`"That's right.`
` As long as a traitor doesn't appear among the siblings, we should be able to deal with most situations."`
`"...Haven't we talked about this enough?`
` We've stayed up all night.`
` ...I'm tired."`
`"You're right.`
` How about taking a little rest after eating breakfast?"`
`"...A good plan.`
` Staying up all night is trying at our age."`
`As they all stretched, they enjoyed this unrefreshing morning as best they could.`
`"I'll go wash my face or something.`
` I probably look horrible."`
`".........?`
` What is that awful stench?"`
`As soon as they exited into the corridor, Kyrie openly made a disgusted expression.`
`"...What is it?"`
`"Hey, don't you smell something awful...?"`
`"......Nnn.`
` ...What is this stench?`
` I can't stand it..."`
`After hearing those complaints, everyone stuck their heads out into the corridor.`
`...The stench was faint, but once people started commenting on it, it was clearly noticeable.`
`Each of them went into the corridor, relying on their own sense of smell to tell them where this strange odor was coming from...`
`"What in the world could it be?`
` Let us have Genji deal with it.`
` I believe he should already have arrived in the servant room to begin the morning preparations."`
`"Indeed, please do.`
` At the very least, it's difficult to imagine `
`Gohda making a breakfast that would cause such an odor..."`
`Rudolf and the others searched for the source of the smell...and determined that it was coming from underground,`
` from the boiler room.`
`But the door was locked, and they couldn't check inside.`
`At the same time, when Natsuhi's group was on its way to search for someone in the servant room, they noticed something strange near the parlor.`
`"...What is this...?!"`
`"Wh-What a horrible prank...`
` Who would do something like this...?"`
`On the door to the parlor, drawn in a paint that looked like blood, was a strange...`
`thing that looked like a magic circle.`
`"There's no one in the kitchen yet.`
` ...Wh-What is...that?"`
`Eva's group, who'd thought the smell might be coming from the kitchen, `
`had returned after confirming that no one was there and that preparations for breakfast had not yet begun.`
`...Then, they noticed the change to the parlor.`
`"It's useless, the boiler room's locked.`
` Wouldn't that be bad if something went wrong with the boiler?`
` Has anyone spotted a servant?"`
`"......!`
` Is one of those vulgar scribbles here too?`
` There was another one on the door to the boiler room."`
`"What's that?!`
` This creepy scribble isn't just here, but it's in other places too?!`
` Haha, you don't think this is the witch of the forest Beatrice's declaration of war, do ya?"`
`Hideyoshi tried to make fun of it, `
`but staring at this creepy magic circle while listening to the wind and rain really made it seem like a message from a witch.`
`...The dripping, bright-red paint made one think of blood, which made it even creepier.`
`Hideyoshi tried to open the door, but it had been locked.`
`...As a general rule, the parlor wasn't locked.`
`Someone had gone out of their way to lock it.`
`"...What does this mean...?`
` Could it be that, while we were talking in the dining hall, someone secretly left this scribble?`
` On the doors to the parlor and the boiler room?"`
`"...I'm sure the servants are behind this.`
` We were together the whole time.`
` We all have alibis.`
` ...They probably received some strange order from Father and pulled this prank."`
`"......And there's also the case yesterday with Maria-chan's letter.`
` It's really easy to suspect that the servants are acting on Dad's orders and planning something.`
` ...Anyway, where is everyone?`
` They can't be playing hide and seek.`
` Let's look for them."`
`"B-Before that, I'm worried about the children.`
` They are safe, right?`
` I'll go and check, and while I'm there, I'll see if there aren't any servants there."`
`"Then let's split up.`
` While you go to the guesthouse to see how the brats are doing, we'll investigate inside the mansion."`
`"......I don't want to think about it, `
`but maybe these creepy magic circles aren't just in the places we've found them already."`
`"...We might be wrapped up in some bizarre game of Father's.`
` ...I will go to him and hear the situation.`
` ...Though, I doubt he'll obediently listen to me."`
`The adults split up.`
`As a result, they confirmed that the four children were safe in the so-called cousins' room, on the second floor of the guesthouse.`
`They had apparently stayed up late last night playing.`
`All of them were snoring loudly, so Rosa decided not to wake them.`
`Furthermore, Nanjo, who had returned early the previous night to rest, was also safe.`
`It seemed he believed in the phrase 'early to bed, early to rise' and had awoken refreshed.`
`During that time, Kyrie and Hideyoshi searched for the servants.`
`But they didn't find them.`
`...The servant room in the guesthouse was also empty.`
`"...The children are safe.`
` They all stayed up too late last night."`
`"The servant room is empty.`
` I looked at the shift chart, and the mornin' shift begins at 6:00.`
` They should've started workin' by now..."`
`"The nap room is also empty.`
` There were signs that a futon had been slept in, but it wasn't warm."`
`"Hey, ...isn't everyone's reasonin' right on this?`
` ...This is probably a game Father set up.`
` He must've left those creepy scribbles and hid himself somewhere,`
` tryin' to make us do somethin'."`
`"...Are you saying he's trying to see who's fit to succeed his wealth and the Headship?`
` ...Isn't that a bit..."`
`"No...`
` ...It might not be strange if Father was behind something like that."`
`"After all, Father loves doing things on a big scale.`
` ...This might've been a finely-tuned plan startin' as far back as when the epitaph was hung in the hall."`
`"...In that case, I wonder if they'll give us an announcement of the game or some explanation of it.`
` ...It certainly would be nice if an envelope with the crest, like the one handed to Maria-chan, were to appear."`
`"......That's right.`
` Maybe Nii-san and the rest have found something like that in the mansion."`
`"Doctor Nanjo,`
` have you heard anythin' about this?"`
`"...M-My apologies, I have no idea what is going on.`
` And yet...yes, certainly,`
` I could easily imagine Kinzo-san planning something on a big scale."`
`"...Shouldn't we go back to the mansion for now?`
` Maybe they found somethin' over there."`
`"If I won't be in the way, I shall go too."`
`"I-I'll stay here.`
` ...The children are sleeping upstairs.`
` We don't know what's happening.`
` We cannot leave them alone."`
`"...That's right.`
` I'll stay with Rosa-san and watch over the place.`
` Would you tell that to my husband?"`
`Rosa and Kyrie remained in the guesthouse.`
`Hideyoshi went with Nanjo and returned again to the mansion.`
`At the same time, in the mansion...`
`In a way that was hard to believe, ...or maybe we should say in a way that gave him a bad feeling...`
`Rudolf's prediction was spot on.`
`...The same magic circle graffiti that had been drawn on the doors to the boiler room and the parlor...had been found in multiple places throughout the mansion.`
`"Aniki...!`
` How's Dad?"`
`"It was no use.`
` I received no response.`
` I tried putting my ear against the door, but I couldn't sense anyone."`
`"...There's no sign of any of the servants.`
` ...Where in the world did they disappear to...?"`
`"This isn't funny.`
` Father and the servants are hiding, and there are strange magic circles all over the mansion.`
` ...What in the world is happening...?!"`
`There weren't only magic circles on the door to the boiler room and the door to the parlor.`
`There were two on the second floor...`
`and one on the third floor, for a total of five.`
`They were all the same magic circle, and all of the doors had been locked, so they couldn't check inside the rooms.`
`"...Anyway, let's do something about the boiler room first.`
` It'd be bad if something broke down and caught fire or exploded.`
` ...So we need the key."`
`"It should be in the key box in the servant room."`
`They fished through that key box.`
`Because each of the servants carried their master keys around, those weren't kept there.`
`However, all of the individual keys should have been there.`
`"......I can't believe they managed to fit so many keys in there."`
`"...It isn't here.`
` No matter how much we look, the key to the boiler room isn't here."`
`"Look, Aneki.`
` ...Only the keys to the rooms with those magic circles drawn on them...`
`are totally missing."`
`"...It's true.`
` ...How bothersome..."`
`"It's as though someone didn't want us to go into the rooms with the magic circles.`
` ...No, they went to all the trouble of making those magic circles obvious, so maybe they wanted us to enter..."`
`"I think it's the latter.`
` ...This isn't a movie, so breaking down the door is probably impossible.`
` Smashing a window might do the trick though."`
`For a while, Krauss pondered over whether this situation really called for smashing a window.`
`At that time, Hideyoshi and Nanjo returned.`
`There was nothing strange in the guesthouse, and the children were safe.`
`They told the others that Rosa and Kyrie had stayed to watch over the place.`
`"Good morning.`
` ...I heard that something strange has happened."`
`"Good morning, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...I apologize for waking you so early in the morning."`
`"What is it?`
` Did you find a letter or somethin'?`
` I was sure you'd have found somethin' like that by now..."`
`"...You're right.`
` I also believe this to be a massive joke or game of Father's...`
` But if that's the case, there should be some letter telling us about it.`
` Like the letter that was given to Maria-chan."`
`"What if Maria-chan's letter actually was the announcement, telling us that the game was on?`
` The rules of the game, 'try solving the riddle of the epitaph', have already been made clear."`
`"Then what might the five magic circles we found in the mansion represent?`
` ...And the missing servants?"`
`"...Natsuhi nee-san,`
` how many servants were there today in total...?"`
`"Huh?`
` ......Genji, Gohda...`
`...five of them, but why?"`
`"...So, there are five servants.`
` There are also five magic circles.`
` ...It's probably a coincidence, but I don't like it."`
`"...Nii-san,`
` let's break a window.`
` We should check and see what's inside."`
`"......We have no choice.`
` Do it neatly."`
`Krauss made his decision and gave permission to smash a window.`
`And he decided that the first room they would break into should be the parlor on the first floor, where the windows would be easiest to reach.`
`They had hoped to peek in through the window, `
`but the curtains were down, so they couldn't see inside.`
`Rudolf wandered around the garden, trying to find something that would be good for smashing the window.`
`Eventually, he found a rock bigger than a fist and came back.`
`"You don't have to smash the whole thing.`
` Just open it enough so you can reach the lock."`
`"Don't get your hopes up, okay?"`
`Rudolf raised the rock and hit the glass with it several times.`
`Eventually, he succeeded in opening a hole big enough that he could unlock it from the outside.`
`...Covering his hand with a handkerchief, he stuck his hand through that hole...and cautiously unlocked it.`
`"We should probably cover it with packing tape later.`
` The rain'll get blown in."`
`When he suddenly opened the window, the wind and rain made the curtain dance around violently.`
`That curtain was blown to the side.`
`...They could see into the parlor they knew well.`
`They were a little relieved.`
`...They'd thought there might be another bizarre magic circle inside the room,`
` or possibly the traces of some creepy ceremony.`
`In any event, they didn't want to hang around out in the rain,`
` so the six of them: Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, and Nanjo, entered the parlor as a group.`
`"...It seems...that nothing in particular has changed..."`
`"......Nn-"`
`"Wh-What's wrong, Shannon...?!"`
`"Wait, wait, are you okay?!`
` What happened to you?!"`
`"Blood, blood!!`
` D-D-Doctor Nanjo, take a look at this!!"`
`"Hey, Shannon-chan!`
` Are you okay?!`
` Answer me!"`
`"Y-You mustn't shake her...`
` I will examine her condition now..."`
`She had been in the shadow of the sofa, so they hadn't noticed her until they'd entered the room.`
`Shannon was lying on the floor, her chest stained bright-red with blood...`
`"He-y,`
` Battleeer, where are yoooou?`
` Look, look, Shannon's corpse has turned up, seeee?`
` I won't bully you anymore, so come out."`
`"...Hmmmm?`
` Oh, there you are.`
` What are you doing, clutching at your head in a place like that?"`
`"............"`
`Battler was crouching under the table, holding his head...`
` His pitiful figure made it plainly clear that he didn't want to see anything, didn't want to hear anything...`
`Had he heard Beatrice's sneering voice?`
`...Could he not hear, or was he pretending that he couldn't hear?`
`In any event, it was clear that he'd closed up his heart like a shell...`
`"Pu ku ku ku...`
` ...Perhaps you tormented him too much, Milady.`
` After showing him all that and demanding a counterargument,`
` I can understand why'd he want to mope around."`
`"Hey, Battleeer.`
` If you can't argue back, then resign, okay?`
` It's your turn.`
` If you don't make some move or pass...`
`or else give up, we won't get anywhere."`
`"............et."`
`"...Huh?`
` What's that?`
` I can't hear you?"`
`'!s0`
` Aaaah, shut up, shut uuuuuuuuuuuup!!`
` A witch? Magic?!`
` Why don't you just do whatever you want?! I don't believe, I don't believe any of it, `
`dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit!!"`
`"Don't talk to me, don't show me anything, disappear, disappear, just disappear!!`
` Don't get that annoying face near meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`".........!"`
`Beatrice winced reflecively at Battler's sudden rage.`
`"...E-Even if you say that...`
` If you don't finish your turn, then my turn won't come.`
` In fact, I'm the one asking you to stop boring me..."`
`"Who cares, be quiet, shut uuup!!`
` Who cares about your game?!`
` I won't go along with iiiiit!!`
` If your turn won't come until mine's finished, then just wait for all eternity!!`
` Aaaah, I don't know, I don't know, I don't get it!!`
` I won't accept witches or magic, I won't accept something that screwed up!!`
` Uuooooooooooohhh, I said don't talk to meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`...I don't know what's what anymore.`
`After being shown something that screwed up, how could I resist...?`
`I wandered aimlessly through the rose garden.`
`...It was raining and windy, but that didn't mean my body got wet.`
`...There was just a feeling of isolation as I wandered amidst the wind and rain without an umbrella.`
`".........Maybe...`
`I lost in that person's game a long time ago."`
`...Actually, didn't we already have a clear winner and loser in the last game?`
`After all, I surrendered for a time.`
`That's why the world was tinted with witches and magic.`
`...Right now, Rokkenjima is a different world, where witches stride around openly and fire off strange spells.`
`...It isn't a matter of accepting it or denying it.`
`Maybe I mistakenly assumed that I was playing a game on an even footing with Beato.`
`Maybe I was already defeated in the last game, ...and this is just the signing ceremony of my surrender.`
`A minute ago, a terrible battle unfolded in this rose garden.`
`I saw it with my own eyes.`
`I kicked the ground.`
` ...Obviously, the ground was hard.`
`And water from a puddle splashed.`
`Several towers had split this ground, sprouting like high-rise buildings.`
`...The more I kicked this ground, `
`......the more it felt like that couldn't possibly have happened.`
`But, for that very reason, I couldn't explain it with anything other than magic anymore...`
`"...If it was a closed room with a key shut up inside,`
` I'd know it was probably an extension of stuff you often see in detective novels."`
`"...But that...?`
` That big flashy thing...?`
` Damn it......"`
`"......It seems my disciple has caused you much trouble."`
`"...Huh?`
` ......It's you..."`
`Someone suddenly spoke to me, so I turned around, `
`...and in the rose garden arbor...`
`...was the Predecessor Beatrice, whom Beatrice had supposedly defeated a short while ago.`
`"......I was sure you'd died.`
` So, you survived."`
`"No, I did die.`
` ...Now, I am nothing more than a defeated chess piece loitering outside the chessboard."`
`"You're Beato's teacher, right?`
` So, in other words, you're a witch too."`
`"...Yes, that is correct."`
`"Tch.`
` So basically,`
` ...that means witches really do exist?`
` And the only one who can defeat her...isn't me.`
` That'd be you, since you can use awesome magic, right?`
` ...I'm just useless now.`
` There's nothing I can do anymore..."`
`"......Oh, my.`
` Have you surrendered completely?"`
`"What do you mean, surrender?!`
` How am I supposed to explain that?!`
` Towers sprouting and falling!!`
` Huge giants holding shields and throwing spears!"`
`"Aaah, just remembering it makes me feel like I'm going insane! We're way past the point of trying to reason this all out, aren't we?!!`
` We've left the level of tricks and things that can be explained with human culprits!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaahh, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it!!"`
`"Calm yourself.`
` ...I am nothing more than a piece on that child's game board.`
` After being removed from that board, I am no longer a being capable of doing anything.`
` But you are that child's opponent.`
` As long as you do not give up on your own, you will always have the power to strike back."`
`"Shut up!`
` Weren't you also reciting strange spells and summoning towers and spears?!!`
` What do you mean, strike back?!`
` Are you saying you'll teach me magic too, and make me take part in that massive magic battle?!!"`
`"...If you wish,`
` I could teach you a bit about magic."`
`"Oh, just what I wanted!`
` Please, give me some awesome magic to smash through her chest in one blow...!!`
` Hah, don't screw with me!"`
`"I hear that in Japanese magic, there is a ceremony used to pray for rain.`
` Do you know of it?"`
`"A rain ceremony?`
` That thing where you throw stuff into a fire and dance as an offering?`
` ...That's not magic.`
` They say that the fire causes an updraft, which makes rain clouds gather.`
` That's supposed to be an accepted scientific phenomenon."`
`"Oh?`
` ...I believed it to be a form of Eastern magic,`
` but is that not the case?`
` I believed people offered sacred fire to the heavens, as well as a dance of respect,`
` so that your entreaty for rain would reach the hearts of the gods."`
`"Maybe people did that long ago.`
` But most occult things like that have a scientific explanation."`
`"Why do things burn?`
` Isn't that because phlogiston is contained in the material?"`
`"...No, things burn because of a chemical reaction.`
` Lavoisier abolished the phlogiston theory."`
`"Why does heat transfer through objects?`
` Isn't that because caloric is contained in the material?"`
`"...I'm pretty sure that was abolished by Joule.`
` Heat is energy, not a substance."`
`"You have studied well.`
` Your knowledge is accurate."`
`"...It's just some trivia."`
`"Phlogiston, caloric, and eventually ether and god's love.`
` ...All are powerless before a scientific explanation.`
` In the past, I was told that an apple falling from a tree `
`was thanks to god's love, so that humans would be given food."`
`"So, even gravity is the love of god?`
` ...Well, that's probably the remnants from the period when religion rather than science was used to explain everything."`
`"That is correct.`
` In the past, humans called the limits of their knowledge...`
`...no, ignorance itself, magic.`
` ...Like the rain ceremony we were just talking about."`
`"Did the people of ancient times realize that there was a scientific explanation, `
`that fire gave rise to heat to cause updrafts that summoned clouds?`
` Even without understanding these things, they at least knew the result."`
`"...That probably happened a lot.`
` That stuff called 'knowledge of the ancestors'.`
` Even without understanding the reason, through long experience, they knew that they'd achieve results.`
` ...Phenomena whose principles they didn't understand were probably the same as magic to them."`
`Like this person just said, ancient people who didn't understand those principles probably believed that, `
`through the rain ceremony, their wishes would reach the heavens and make rain fall.`
`To them, that was certainly magic.`
` As long as they didn't understand updrafts...`
`"If you push an electrical switch, a light turns on.`
` ...Children do not know the scientific principles behind why a lightbulb lights up,`
` they only know the result when they push the switch.`
` If they obtain such a result without knowing the principles, doesn't that make it magic to them?"`
`"......That's pretty interesting.`
` ...Well, logically, that's true.`
` ...For example, I don't have a clue why the Braun tubes in a TV show a picture.`
` Still, I think it's totally normal to see things shown on a TV.`
` Even if I don't understand the principles behind Braun tubes, I at least know that 'If I push the switch, I can watch TV'.`
` ...It's exactly the same as having a rain ceremony without understanding updrafts.`
` ...In other words, if I don't know the principles, even TV is the same as magic...`
`or even magic itself, I guess."`
`"Do you know the structure of Braun tubes?`
` Have you ever taken one apart and looked inside?"`
`"...Nope.`
` I think I read about it in a book or something once, but it was complicated and I didn't have a clue.`
` I think that when electrons hit a fluorescent material, it creates luminescence or something like that..."`
`"That book lied.`
` Actually, there are small people called gremlins shut up inside the Braun tubes, `
`and they do their work with magic."`
`"Huh?!`
` Don't be stupid, there's no way that's true...!"`
`"How can you deny it, if you have never looked inside a Braun tube?"`
`"...I've never looked inside, but I can say for sure that small people like that definitely don't exist!"`
`"Since there are no Braun tubes here, that is impossible to prove."`
`"Y-Yeah, it's impossible to prove right now,`
` ...but later, I can take apart a TV somewhere and show you, and instantly win the argument!"`
`"So, put another way,`
` my 'magical theory' that gremlins are shut up inside the Braun tubes and display the picture with magic...`
`is impossible to disprove until we can verify the contents of a Braun tube, correct?"`
`"......Erk, `
`......what the hell, is this one of those?`
` Are you trying to say it's a 'Devil's Proof'?`
` That's a favorite trick of you witches."`
`"A 'Devil's Proof' is a bit of sophistry, one that takes advantage of the fact that negative facts are impossible to prove.`
` However, it's different from my Braun tubes metaphor.`
` That could be resolved simply by taking apart a single television."`
`"...You're right.`
` It isn't really a 'Devil's Proof'."`
`"You have proposed a scientific theory, and I have proposed a magical one.`
` ...One of those is the truth.`
` And which one it is can be ascertained the moment you look inside a Braun tube.`
` However, until the instant that happens, we cannot deny each other's theories."`
`"So, even though only one truth exists,`
` until you look into the Braun tube, you can have two conflicting truths existing at the same time.`
` ...You have a realm in which two truths can exist simultaneously, even though there must be only one truth in existence."`
`Is the cat in the box alive or dead?`
`If you open the box, you will learn the answer.`
` You will learn the truth.`
`However, until you open the box, you can claim that the cat is alive, and you can also claim that it is dead.`
`Both claims are the 'correct' truth according to the people making them,`
` and even though the two sides are in conflict, neither can win the argument as long as the box remains unopened.`
`In other words, two truths can exist at the same time.`
`Even though there can only be one cat in the box,`
` it is packed with a living cat and a dead cat, forming a strange separate world.`
`That is what Rokkenjima is now.`
`...This island is now a different world where a scientific theory and a magical one can exist at the same time.`
`...To a resident of the world of science such as yourself, `
`at a glance, it may feel as though this island had been sucked into a world of magic.`
`That might not be wrong, but it is not accurate.`
`Strictly speaking, it has been moved from the world of science to the gap between that world and the world of magic.`
`So, at a glance, it appears to you as though the world is tilted towards the magical side.`
`...But, in reality, this island is now in a perfectly impartial position with relation to those two opposing worlds.`
`"...I don't really get it...`
` The gap between reality and magic?`
` A perfectly impartial world?`
` How's that?`
` Hasn't pretty much everything that's happened been totally not in my favor...?!"`
`"Then perhaps you could think of it this way.`
` This is a trial.`
` Think of it as a court where you and Beatrice are laying out opposing claims.`
` Call it a Braun tube trial."`
`"Your opponent claims that there are tiny people inside the Braun tubes,`
` explaining one thing after another, `
`talking about the lives of these tiny people, what they look like, what type of magical power they have.`
` ...And what do you do?"`
`"...Well, I study in a library and argue back by explaining how Braun tubes are constructed."`
`"At this moment, both your claim and that child's claim exist in the court at the same time.`
` ...If you find your opponent's claim convincing, `
`it might sound like truth to you. It might look like truth to you.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~That is exactly what you saw~ib~`
`."`
`"............"`
`"At this moment, on Rokkenjima, witches and magic certainly may exist as truth.`
` ...However, until the moment that the cat's box is opened, that world is an uncertain wave function.`
` The entire situation can be explained by both sides at the same time.`
` However, there is one truth."`
`"That set of truths shrinks with observation,`
` and countless truths are weeded out to become one truth.`
` It is like when, in court,`
` the judge hands down his judgement.`
` The two truths from the prosecutor's and the defense's claims...`
`are reduced in number by the judgement and become one."`
`"......To say it in your words, `
`...this island right now is the world right before looking into a Braun tube, right...?`
` Therefore, the science theory and the magic theory cannot be denied.`
` And since they cannot be denied-"`
`"Both can exist as truth.`
` Therefore, both witches and magic can exist.`
` ...However, at the same time, your opinion of denial also exists as truth."`
`"......It is a world where two conflicting things can exist at once.`
` And, it is a world where conflicting truths cannot disprove each other.`
` ......Have you managed to understand...?"`
`".........In other words, `
`...no matter how much awesome magic Beato shows me, `
`...it's only a claim of a 'magical theory', and it doesn't disprove my position."`
`"So, 'no matter what kind of magic Beato shows me in this world,`
` it cannot become proof that magic exists'."`
`"That's right.`
` That child might even try to explain an apple falling from a tree with magic, `
`perhaps by shaking her staff and magically plucking the apple,`
` then claiming to be the thing that made it drop down to the earth."`
`"However, that would be nothing more than another claim.`
` None of your opponent's claims can prevent you from making yours.`
` ...In that sense, this world is quite 'impartial' to both sides."`
`"......I...get it...`
` ...Still,`
` by that argument, if I show a sound argument with my 'science theory',`
` and it collides head on with her 'magic theory', I also can't win against her.`
` On top of that, the final judgement won't come until we peek into the Braun tube."`
`"......Where is the Braun tube in this world?`
` ...Because it exists, there should be no reason for us to argue.`
` ...Why don't we just get along and peek into the Braun tube?"`
`"If there really is a tiny person in there, it's my complete loss.`
` Otherwise, it's my victory.`
` ...Why do we have to hold this debate without looking into the Braun tube?"`
`"That itself is the 'game' you are being challenged to.`
` Maybe, instead of a court, I should use chess as an example.`
` There, victory and loss are not determined by a judge.`
` You who fight will decide it yourselves."`
`"...Can you win an argument with an opponent in a screwed up world, where multiple truths can exist at the same time?"`
`"In actual fact, didn't you lose an argument and surrender like this...?"`
`".........Heh.`
` ...Heheheh."`
`"That is all the advice I can give you now.`
` If you wish, I can occasionally offer you counsel."`
`"...Sure.`
` Thanks, that really helps.`
` ...I'll avenge you."`
`"Hohohoh, thank you.`
` I look forward to it."`
`"What's your name?"`
`"...Beatrice used to be my name, but now that I have surrendered it, I do not have a name.`
` ......So, I shall take a temporary name.`
` ...Virgilius.`
` ...No,`
` how about Virgilia?"`
`"Virgilia.`
` Like #fefefeValkyria#ffffff?`
` Wasn't that a name for goddesses that show up in myths?"`
`"No.`
` It means the guide who leads the way to Beatrice.`
` ...I will guide you to that child, who waits at the summit of Mount Purgatory.`
` It ought to be a fitting name for such a guide."`
`"Who would've guessed I'd accept help from a witch when I'm trying to deny witches.`
` ...I see.`
` If this is a contradictory world where different claims can exist at the same time, I guess that's cool.`
` ...Ihihi, it's almost funny."`
`"I am borrowing that child's words, but you truly are like a phoenix.`
` ...Your will to fight has already been revived.`
` ...Come, if your heart is prepared, return to your opponent,`
` ...return to the chessboard where that child is seated.`
` ...I look forward to seeing how far you can fight with my disciple."`
`"Yeah, watch it.`
` ......I won't listen to her babbling anymore.`
` I'll cooly fight to the end.`
` I definitely won't get provoked by her any longer."`
`"Then let us return.`
` To the seat of the battle."`
`"...O-Oh, Battler...!`
` Where did you run off to?`
` *cackle*!`
` And I thought losers never came back for more."`
`"...Sorry to keep you waiting.`
` I've cooled my head a little."`
`"And?`
` Did you think of a response to that pleasant, thrilling, refreshing, highly acclaimed, wonderful fantasy battle between Teacher and meeeeeeee?`
` Isn't that impossible to explain without fantasy?`
` Hihhyahhahahahahahahahahahahahaah?!"`
`"...Milady,`
` didn't you just promise to be kind and act more gracefully?"`
`"Ahhyahahahahaha, oh no, oh no.`
` I just got in such a good mood when I saw Battler's face, you see?`
` Look, look, look, how are you gonna respond to that battle just now, Battler?`
` Hmmmmmm?"`
`"............`
`...Battle?`
` What battle?"`
`"...Whaat?"`
`"In this rose garden,`
` where do you see those spears,`
` and towers you made lying around?`
` ......They aren't here, are they?`
` ...In other words, it's just like the inside of a Braun tube."`
`"...The inside of a Braun tube??`
` *cackle* What in the world are you talking about now...?"`
`"At this very moment,`
` there's nothing at all in the rose garden.`
` Towers may have been sprouting with magic until a short while ago.`
` However, that's only the case until we see what's inside the Braun tube.`
` ...That magical battle is nothing more than your interpretation, your claim.`
` The fact that there's absolutely nothing to see here now proves it."`
`"This is how I argue back about that witch's battle just now.`
` Right now, there isn't anything here, which proves that nothing happened...!"`
`".........`
`...Hahaha, hahahahaha!`
` Come now, of course I can't make a huge mess when it's only the first twilight, and I am rather fond of that rose garden, you see?`
` To prevent any damage, I had the fight occur inside a barrier.`
` So it's only natural that it wouldn't have any influence on reality."`
`"...That's your claim?`
` Well, I guess that works."`
`"However!`
` At this point in time, there is nothing in the rose garden.`
` So nothing stands in the way of my claim that there was no magic done here!!"`
`"W-Wait, wait, can you deny my magic with a mess like that?!`
` It is impossible to prove that magic 'does not exist'!`
` It's a 'Devil's Proof'!!"`
`"At this point in time, this garden is the truth!`
` The instant you look inside, the tiny people inside the Braun tube will vanish.`
` And there are no traces of magic here at all!`
` So that battle between you witches 'did not take place'!!"`
`"Wh-`
`What the...`
` Th-that counter...?!`
` That power, `
`...c-could it be...?!"`
`"...Have you forgotten, Milady?`
` It is the Multi-layered Worlds Reduction Technique.`
` The power of a Finite Witch, the counter to the power of an Endless Witch.`
` Only an Endless Witch can perceive it, and it is most effective against such a witch."`
`"Sch-Schrodinger's cat box?!`
` ......Th-That old hag of a witch... What an uncalled-for hint!!"`
`"We've lost time.`
` Including the five servants and Grandfather, there are six corpses!`
` Let me check the scene.`
` I've been trudging along wasting time.`
` From now on, I'll speed things up, okay?"`
`"Take a seat, Beatrice!!`
` It's finally the first twilight, isn't it? Let's start the real thing.`
` Show me what you've got!!!"`
`...Forget what the adults expected.`
`At least for us kids, `
`these were supposed to be a fun couple of days where the cousins deepened their friendship.`
`However, when we woke up, there was an unbelievably cruel reality waiting for us...`
`"......Hic, ...hic...!"`
`"............"`
`George-aniki and Jessica were crying over Shannon-chan and Kanon-kun's deaths.`
`...Right now, everyone who was alive had gathered in the lobby on the first floor of the guesthouse.`
`And there were 12 people there.`
`...Unbelievable, right?`
`There were 18 until yesterday.`
`...And in one night, a third of that number had lost their lives...`
`I eventually sobered up from my agitation and, along with my lack of sleep from being woken up so early in the morning, `
`I was beginning to feel a faint sense of unreality.`
`...I want to think this is some kind of bad dream...`
`My cheap escapism keeps telling me that over and over.`
`Maria had gone back to sleep on the sofa Rosa was sitting in.`
`...Rather than her having nerves of steel, she probably genuinely hadn't had enough sleep.`
`The adults were holding items from what was apparently Grandfather's collection,`
` short-barrel Winchester rifles.`
`...Apparently relics from a time he'd been obsessed with Westerns, there were four guns altogether.`
`Those had been split up among the four siblings: Uncle Krauss, Aunt Eva, my dad, and Aunt Rosa.`
`Paper boxes filled with bullets lay on the table, and the siblings were silently loading them.`
`"......It's a little scary.`
` Even now, touching one of these, `
`I get the feeling Dad'll yell 'Don't touch that!' and hit me."`
`"Well, isn't that great?`
` ...No matter how much you touch them, you won't be hit again."`
`"......I can't believe it.`
` ...To think that Father...`
`......would meet this kind of end..."`
`"Well, I never did expect Kinzo-san to die normally in his bed, `
`...but even so, ...it is too horrible..."`
`"Hey.`
` I wonder if that really was Father...?`
` I think it might be a different person's corpse, used as a substitute to trick us..."`
`"...No, it was Father, without a doubt.`
` You saw his toes, right?`
` Generally speaking, there aren't many humans with six toes on both feet."`
`"But......that doesn't mean that such people don't exist.`
` I've heard that polydactyly isn't that rare a disease.`
` He was a man who liked large-scale tricks, right?`
` ...He might have obtained a corpse from somewhere that had the same number of toes on both feet."`
`"Ridiculous.`
` Why would he do something like that...?!"`
`"...I'd agree if it was a normal person.`
` ...But this is Father we're talkin' about.`
` You can't be sure Kyrie-san's talkin' nonsense."`
`"......After all, burning a corpse makes it hard to identify.`
` Still, there should be a few ways to examine him from his teeth and bone structure.`
` If the police investigated, of course they'd be able to know whose body it was right away."`
`"The problem...is that we need a telephone engineer more than the police right now."`
`"...The boats probably won't come in this typhoon.`
` ...So, will they arrive tomorrow?"`
`"Most likely, the boat will come again at 9:00 tomorrow.`
` Then, I believe we will be able to contact the police."`
`"...It's the same for us...`
`and the culprit.`
` ...Until the typhoon passes, this island will be closed off."`
`......Just from our parents' conversation, you could probably figure out the general gist, but let's explain the situation anyway.`
`First, early that morning.`
`In various places throughout the mansion, a total of six corpses, including Grandfather and all the servants, had been found one after another.`
`First, Grandfather had been in the boiler room, completely burnt.`
`The servants had died, each shut up in the rooms throughout the mansion that had magic circles drawn on them.`
`The cause of death for the servants was uncertain, `
`but according to Doctor Nanjo's diagnosis, there was a high likelihood that they had been stabbed by something like a spear...`
`or possibly shot with a gun.`
`That was why the adults had started arming themselves with Winchesters.`
`And what made the situation even more chaotic...was the fact that the telephones had become unusable.`
`It was unknown if lightning had caused them to break down or if the culprit had broken them.`
`At any rate, since contact with the outside had been cut off, we couldn't reach the police.`
`So until the typhoon passes and a boat comes tomorrow morning, `
`we'll have to protect ourselves.`
`After all, Rokkenjima is now isolated by the typhoon.`
`And just as we're stuck on the island, so is the culprit.`
`It seemed that the adults had stayed up all night, holding the family conference in the mansion's dining hall the whole time.`
`And yet, the crime had occurred in the mansion.`
`...So right when the adults had been in an uproar over money, `
`the murderer had been killing under the same roof...`
`They say Aunt Natsuhi's been strict about locking the doors and windows at the night.`
`And yet, some suspicious person had entered and left the mansion.`
`...The adults had decided that the inside of the mansion was too large to be safe, `
`so they had pulled out the guns and moved to the guesthouse, where we had been.`
`......Which brings us to the present.`
`George-aniki had begged to see Shannon-chan's corpse,`
` but the adults had refused, saying that he mustn't do so until the police arrived.`
`That wasn't just because they wanted to seal all the rooms to preserve the scene.`
`...After all, the culprit who had killed six people was wandering about the mansion.`
`To the Ushiromiya family right now, the mansion that should've been their home...`
`was now a danger zone that an unknown murderer could enter and leave at will...`
`After all, it's a huge mansion.`
`There are plenty of blind spots and dark places, and it's too vast to guarantee absolute safety with this number of people.`
`Relatively speaking, the guesthouse was much smaller.`
`It had two above-ground stories.`
` Something like 10 or so rooms?`
`...Apparently, it had originally been constructed to serve as a small hotel, as part of the plan to turn this island into a resort.`
`So, it was easier to know what was going on everywhere inside it, and it'd be easier to keep safe.`
` It made for a good place to hole up in.`
`...Also...`
`...It was extremely likely that this mass murder of six people was a 'game'.`
`After all, the culprit had proclaimed so in a letter.`
`I heard that a Western-style envelope with the family crest, just like the one Maria claimed to have received from Beatrice yesterday,`
` had been found in the boiler room where Grandfather's corpse had been discovered.`
`This was what the letter said.`
`So that there will be no misunderstandings...`
`The game I seek is for everyone to try and solve the riddle of the epitaph,`
` not for you to try and catch me.`
`If you don’t solve the riddle, the pitiful sacrifices will further increase in number.`
`It would be wiser to spend your time solving the epitaph, instead of searching for me.`
`If no one can solve the riddle, no one will survive.`
`If a person appears who can miraculously solve it, I will give them all the gold of the Golden Land, `
`the Ushiromiya Family Headship, and all of my power.`
`I was the one who succeeded the Ushiromiya Family Headship after Kinzo-sama.`
`I look forward to seeing who will succeed to that headship after me.`
`——The Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
`...This riddle of the epitaph was...that thing.`
`That strange epitaph written by the portrait of the witch on display in the hall of the mansion.`
`Grandfather was the one who had it written,`
` and the person who solved it would, supposedly, be given the inheritance or the hidden gold or something like that.`
`Ever since it was first put on display there several years ago,`
` the relatives had secretly tried to solve that riddle, despite saying on the surface that the whole idea was silly.`
`However, up until today, no one had solved it.`
`We were once again being urged to solve that unintelligible riddle, and this time, we were faced with the threat that we'd all be killed if we didn't solve it.`
`...If that wasn't a 'game', what else could it be...?`
`The bold opinion that we should search the premises for the culprit did come up once.`
`However, there was a good chance they were armed, and there might not be just one of them.`
`And, ...while they might have been able to kill more than six people, they had`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~stopped at 6~ib~`
`.`
`The opinion that won out in the end...was that we should avoid needlessly antagonizing the culprit, `
`and hole up in a safe place while we waited for the police to arrive...`
`After the adults carefully checked that the doors and windows in the guesthouse were locked, they set up camp in the lobby.`
`As they loaded their guns to distract themselves from the tension, `
`their expressions showed that they were already fatigued from this long day, which had still barely begun...`
`There was nothing for me to do.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`Now, all I could do was be taught how to use a gun,`
` to prepare for the off-chance of something happening that ~ib~led to an excess of guns~ib~...`
`...That's fine.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`Just obediently stay there, ~ib~me and the rest of you~ib~`
`.`
`"......Six people in the beginning again.`
` And this time it's Grandfather and all of the servants put together."`
`"Most likely, `
`that child has carefully studied your moves from the last game...`
`and has made an optimal move by taking the pieces you were most likely to suspect from the start."`
`"...That makes sense.`
` ...That was true both last time and the time before that.`
` The servants, who know everything about the mansion and who walk around with keys, always fall into the most suspicious category of people."`
`"...A good example in the last game would be Jessica's closed room.`
` If I'd only accepted that a servant was the culprit, that wouldn't even have been a closed room."`
`"And so,`
` ...that child went straight for them,`
` probably to block off a method of escape you'd be likely to attempt sooner or later."`
`"Beato already proclaimed in red that there are no more than 18 people on this island.`
`'………`
`諦めろってことだ`
`...In other words, `
`...`
`~ib~it's time to give up on that~ib~`
`.`
`...Now I've got to suspect one of the 18."`
`"...That child will probably come at you by stealing the pieces for all the 18, ...while also making an appearance as a 19th person who shouldn't exist,`
` for then you would be forced to accept that your opponent is a witch.`
` ...After all, now that the intimidation approach has failed, trying to force you to surrender by showing you magic,`
` the only remaining option is a frontal attack."`
`"...Perfect.`
` Bluffing won't work anymore."`
`"Be careful.`
` Deception is what witches are best at.`
` ...No matter what your opponent says or shows you, `
`it will not be able to threaten the truth that you believe in.`
` Don't forget that."`
`"......Sure.`
` As if I'd fall for the same moves over and over.`
` ......Come on out, Beatrice.`
` Let's get started!!!"`
`"I am already seated at the table of the contest.`
` And my turn is already complete."`
`"...To think we would end up having Madam as our foe.`
` This will not be easy, Milady.`
` ...Our moves will be read thoroughly."`
`"I care not.`
` By now, Teacher's moves are all old-fashioned classics.`
` There is nothing to fear."`
`"...So, just what moves can you make beyond the classics I taught you?`
` I look forward to seeing, Beatrice."`
`"...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` You okay with this, Battleer?`
` Can someone who denies witches really accept a witch as a strategist...?"`
`"Your stupid provocation is pointless.`
` This is my advisor...no, my second.`
` That doesn't change one bit...that this is a fistfight between you and me."`
`"I understand.`
` ...One as wobbly as yourself probably needs training wheels on his bicycle.`
` Do as you like.`
` Come, let us begin!!`
` It's your turn!"`
`"Let's begin with the reconstruction of the crime scene.`
` ...Virgilia, quickly please!"`
`"The first corpse discovered was Shannon's.`
` She was found in the parlor on the first floor of the mansion.`
` The door and windows were locked, and a closed room was established."`
`"...Beato, I need some details.`
` Let's reconfirm the definition of a closed room."`
`"Indeed.`
` The term 'closed room' refers to a room where the inside and the outside are completely cut off from each other.`
` Naturally, it will be impossible to even affect things across that boundary line, much less enter or escape across it.`
` This includes an all-inclusive denial of the existence of hidden doors, as well as all possibility of intervention from the outside.`
`...Henceforth, this shall be referred to as...`
`'Beatrice's Closed Room Definition'!"`
`"Let's focus in a bit.`
` ...How do you define 'all possibility of intervention from the outside'?"`
`"I refer to all types of direct intervention from the outside, such as using a fishing line or a long, thin rod.`
` In conclusion, there are no gaps in the doors and windows through which such tricks will work."`
`"I wonder about that.`
` Even if there wasn't a gap, you should be able to interfere with radio waves, like with a remote control, right?"`
`"Very well.`
` I'll add to this definition that interference due to radio waves and related methods of remote control shall be impossible."`
`"There's also an extension telephone in the parlor.`
` A device connected to that wouldn't count as remote control, right?!"`
`"The phones are already unusable, are they not?`
` ...Ah, whatever.`
` I'll include that too.`
` All direct and indirect methods of interfering with the inside of the closed room from the outside of the room are impossible."`
`"What about a voice or a knock?`
` Those should be able to interfere from the outside without someone entering the room, right?"`
`"......Even though it's a closed room, it probably isn't impossible for someone to knock or call out.`
` The closed room definition does not cover whether transmission of intent across the boundary is possible or not."`
`"In other words, you can't make it so your definition includes the blockage of all methods of communication with the outside?"`
`"That is indeed the case."`
`"Understood.`
` ......So, Shannon-chan's parlor satisfies Beatrice's Closed Room Definition, right?"`
`"Correct."`
`"......Closed Room Definition, understood.`
` Continue, Virgilia."`
`"Yes.`
` ......Shannon's corpse was in possession of one master key.`
` The relatives who discovered her collected this."`
`"Beato, repeat it.`
` How many master keys this time?"`
`"...Hmph. The same as last time.`
` #ff0000There are five, one for each servant.#ffffff"`
`"Which means this still isn't a closed room.`
` There are still four master keys left.`
` It just means that after Shannon-chan was murdered, one of the other four keys locked it."`
`"Correct.`
` ......And, it wasn't only a master key that was found."`
`"Yes.`
` ...Alongside the corpse, there was a Western envelope with the family crest.`
` Instead of a letter, the key to a guest room on the second floor was inside it."`
`"...The key to a second floor guest room...`
` The only key other than the master key that can open the door to that second floor guest room. Is that definition correct?"`
`"Indeed. There is no problem.`
` And, unlike the master keys, only one of those exists."`
`"In other words, apart from the five master keys, `
`there will be only one key that can unlock certain rooms."`
`"...In other words, this is a message telling them to go to the second floor guest room next?`
` So the adults moved to the second floor guest room, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` The door to the second floor guest room was locked, and a magic circle was drawn on it.`
` ...The relatives unlocked it with the key they had found near Shannon's corpse.`
` Inside, Kumasawa's corpse was discovered.`
` It was a closed room.`
` One that satisfied Beatrice's Closed Room Definition."`
`"......Kumasawa was in possession of one master key.`
` The relatives collected this.`
` And like in Shannon's case, there was a Western envelope discovered alongside her.`
` Inside was the key to the third floor waiting room.`
` The relatives moved to the third floor waiting room."`
`"So, there was a magic circle on the door to the third floor waiting room, and that door was locked?"`
`"Yes.`
` Inside the room, Gohda's corpse was discovered.`
` The room was a closed room.`
` One that satisfied Beatrice's Closed Room Definition."`
`"......Gohda was in possession of one master key.`
` The relatives collected this.`
` And like up until now, a Western envelope with the family seal was discovered, `
`inside of which was the key to the second floor VIP room.`
` The relatives moved to the second floor VIP room."`
`"......What's going on here...?`
` What are you planning...?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` There's no need to glare, is there?`
` It may be a closed room, but there are still multiple master keys that can open it, correct?`
` And besides the master keys, I've even given you keys specific to each room."`
`"...I don't like where this is going.`
` ...But I'm starting to see how it'll turn out.`
` So it continues like this for all six people?"`
`"Yes, that is correct.`
` Inside the second floor VIP room, Genji's corpse was discovered.`
` One master key was collected.`
` The key to the underground boiler room was discovered.`
` They moved to the underground boiler room.`
` Inside the underground boiler room, Kinzo's corpse was discovered.`
` The key to the chapel was discovered.`
` They moved to the chapel.`
` Inside the chapel, Kanon's corpse was discovered.`
` One master key was collected.`
` The key to the first floor parlor was discovered.`
` ...With this, our reconstruction of how all six corpses were discovered is complete."`
`"An addendum.`
` Along with the key to the chapel, a letter was enclosed in the Western envelope found near Kinzo's corpse.`
` The contents of the letter were as you saw.`
` It further urged the relatives to solve the riddle of the epitaph."`
`"......In that case, `
`...what's going on?`
` If the last place, where Kanon was, had the key to the very first room, the parlor, where Shannon was...`
` That makes six closed rooms, all tied together, right?"`
`"That is correct!`
` The six closed rooms are all tied together.`
` The keys to unlock each one are all shut up inside the next room."`
`"In other words, the six closed rooms form one massive closed room,`
` and all of the master keys as well as the individual room keys are shut up inside it...!"`
`"#ff0000Furthermore, all of the doors and windows on the six rooms are normal.`
` No device exists which can lock them without a key, such as an auto-lock.#ffffff`
` *cackle*cackle* What do you think? It's beautiful, isn't iiiiiiiiiiiit??? Uhhyahhyahhyaaahh!"`
`"Once again, Milady, that is not dignified."`
`When Ronove rebuked her, Beato stuck her tongue at him without showing any signs of shame.`
`"Uhihihi, sorry, sorry.`
` Playing with Battler just put me into such a good mood.`
` *cackle* So, Battleer?`
` What do you think of my move?`
` If you can't think of anything in particular, I wouldn't mind showing you how I made the goats carry the corpses...`
`and seal all of the rooms with magic, okaaaaay?"`
`"Do what you want.`
` I'll listen respectfully to this 'magic theory' that you claim is true.`
` However, I can claim my 'human theory',`
` even though it's completely different from yours, without any interference from your claim."`
`"In other words,`
` there's no need for me to pay attention to your bullshit!!`
` Go ahead and show me how you can lock the door with your multi-colored magic simply by waving your magic staff.`
` Just like those guys with their toad oil and all-purpose kitchen knives!"`
`"Virgilia, let's reconstruct the crime scene!`
` Search for a weakness!!`
` Were they all definitely dead?`
` If one of them is just playing dead, this isn't a closed room at all!"`
`"Nanjo confirmed that all of them were dead.`
` However, due to the 'Devil's Proof', it is impossible to deny the possibility of a wrong diagnosis.`
` ...In other words, that child cannot make the likelihood that Nanjo overlooked them being alive equal to zero."`
`"Here it is, that 'Devil's Proof'.`
` But there exists a sword that can carve that up...!"`
`"Wh-What's up with them?`
` ...Looks like they're having a good time, leaving me out of the discussion.`
` I'm his opponent, am I not...?`
` Doesn't he have any time to spare for me...?"`
`"Fundamentally speaking, communication with one's opponent is not necessary to the act of competing in chess.`
` ...Every time you've communicated with him outside of making your moves, you've used that opportunity to confuse him.`
` ...Perhaps this is the result of him not wanting to be led astray."`
`"......Nngg.`
` ...For some reason, I don't like it."`
`"You are challenging him to a chess match, are you not?"`
`"That's true, but...`
`...gah!"`
`Beatrice puffed out her cheeks, as though to say 'I don't know why, but I don't like it!'`
`"Because the police have not yet arrived at the crime scene, the human side's ability to inspect the scene is limited.`
` For a strict confirmation of death, I recommend that you have that child repeat it in red."`
`"Okay, that's where I'll strike, repeat it!!`
`'!s0`
`"...Milady, he has told you to repeat something in red, has he not?"`
`"Hey, enough lazing around!!`
` Do you refuse to repeat it?!`
` This is where our battle starts!!"`
`"Wha?!`
` Owowowowoow!!`
` *cackle*cackle* Sorry, sorry, that's fine, I'll answer."`
`"#ff0000These six are all dead: Kinzo, Genji, Shannon, Kanon, Gohda, and Kumasawa!#ffffff"`
`"Why are you so out of it?`
` ...Okay.`
` So I've already got one out of you.`
` We'll start by denying that classic trick where the victims are playing dead."`
`"*cackle*!`
` I won't go easy on you anymore! Come at me how you like.`
` I'll slice them slantwise one after another!"`
`"Then repeat this!`
` No one is hiding in any of the six rooms!`
` Let's see you deny the existence of people we aren't aware of!"`
`"I'll answer.`
` #ff0000There is no one hiding in the six rooms!#ffffff"`
`"Okay.`
` Now I'm sure it's only the six of them in the can.`
` And they aren't pretending to be dead."`
`"...What will you do, what will you dooo?`
` As if a human could manage anything by now.`
` Obediently kneel to the fact that I can control locks at will with my wonderful magic, okaaaaaay?"`
`"Quit babbling.`
` Repeat this too.`
` 'The six deaths were instant deaths'!"`
`"Instant deeeeeeaths?`
` Hoh, what do you mean by that?"`
`"...It means there's a possibility that a single victim on the verge of death managed to escape into the room, `
`and after locking it from the inside to create a closed room, they passed away."`
`"...Hmph.`
` A classic closed room murder trick.`
` One requiring that the victim receive a fatal wound...and then die later.`
` It is possible for a closed room to be constructed unexpectedly if the victim holes up inside the room to escape the murderer...`
`and then dies after locking the door."`
`"In order to deny that possibility, `
`you will need to proclaim that 'The six died instantly' with the red truth."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Very well, very well, I'll slay you with my red treasured sword!`
` #ff0000The six died instantly!#ffffff`
` By 'died instantly', I mean the targets instantly became incapable of action after being attacked."`
`"Well, it might still have taken them several seconds or minutes to die in the complete sense of the word.`
` But regardless, it was completely impossible for them to take any actions of their own will.`
` In that sense, I can confirm that they suffered instant deaths!"`
`"...Up until this point, I've just been checking for the classic tricks.`
` Now's when our showdown over the closed rooms really starts, okay...?`
` If the culprit isn't on the inside, they're on the outside.`
` So they somehow killed from outside the rooms."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Have you lost your mind?`
` After all, 'a closed room = murder is impossible from the outside', right?!`
` That's why only a magical murder would be possible!"`
`"No, that's wrong.`
` The right approach is 'a murder really happened = it isn't a closed room'!`
` No matter how much you try to trick me, this definitely isn't a closed room!`
` It's a sham that only looks like one!"`
`"However, Battler-sama,`
` #ff0000only the victims are inside the rooms, `
`and no other people exist inside the rooms.#ffffff`
` And by Milady's Closed Room Definition,`
` remote murders from outside the room have been clearly denied, have they not?"`
`"Wait.`
` The definition of remote murders is pretty broad, right?`
` It's not just about pulling a fishing line from outside the room `
`and strangling the victim inside the room.`
` For example, ...`
`a trap would make for an excellent remote murder!"`
`"A traap?`
` Hoh, and what might that be?!"`
`"Just as an example, let's say they were instructed to enter rooms that someone had picked out beforehand...`
`and lock the doors from the inside to create the closed rooms themselves.`
` A trap was set up in those rooms that they didn't know about...`
`and that's what killed them.`
` ...How's that?! That doesn't contradict anything!"`
`"...There are no problems.`
` It corresponds to the existing state."`
`"...There are no problems on our side either.`
` It does not conflict with Milady's Closed Room Definition."`
`"Kuhhahhahahahahahahahaha?!`
` What's with that stupid reasoning?!`
` Nothing suspicious was found in any of the rooms, right?`
` What form did that trap have?!`
` Where was it hidden and how did it operate?!`
` Explain that for all six of them...in the parlor, the guest room, the waiting room, the VIP room, the boiler room, and the chapel.`
` Well? You can't, can you?!?!"`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, but_3e935:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, but_3e936:`
`"Wh-What did you saaaaaaaaayy...?!?!"`
`"Beatrice, it's a 'Devil's Proof'.`
` The fact that he cannot explain the nature of the trap...`
`does not in itself deny the existence of such a trap!"`
`"......Well done.`
` While overbearing, a wonderful move."`
`"...Nng!!!`
` This guy's getting completely used to this...!!"`
`"Check.`
` Due to murder trap X that we couldn't find, it'd be possible to establish this closed room murder."`
`"...I-I'll kill that check with the red truth!!`
` #ff0000The six were not killed by traps#ffffff!"`
`"And the definition of a trap?!"`
`"Oh, `
`...umm, `
`...that's it!`
` Something that activates when a victim triggers it on their own.`
` Oh, ...and that's not all!`
` It also includes things activated by remote control or by a timer,`
` ...everything of that sort!"`
`"Pu ku ku...`
` So, it refers to all arrangements that could carry out a murder without the direct participation of the one who planned it out.`
` Perhaps we might sum it up that way."`
`"H-How's that?!`
` I've struck back!!`
` As if I'd let a human crush this closed room!!"`
`"......`
`......You're looking pretty frantic to win too."`
`"...Whaat...?!`
` What do you mean...?"`
`"...You're frantically fighting to make me accept your existence.`
` Until now, I thought I was just being toyed around with by you one-sidedly."`
`"...But that's not actually true.`
` You're also frantically resisting my counters, fighting to show that you exist...!`
` Now, `
`...I finally really feel that it's true."`
`This isn't torture inflicted on me, over whether I'll surrender or not.`
`'!s0`
` ...Okay, now it's starting to get interesting, isn't it?`
` All six died in closed rooms, and no outsiders were inside.`
` And there was no meddling from the outside, and also no traps.`
` Up until now, I'd probably start suspecting that this had to be the work of magic."`
`"...And if you decided to show off some bizarre magic at this moment, I might even have surrendered.`
` ......It's that favorite strategy of yours.`
` ...You intercept all my moves, and in the moment I've exhausted all options and fallen to my knees, `
`when my heart's barriers are at their weakest, you show off some strange magic and take the game all at once!!"`
`"......That short temper is something this child has always had,`
` along with a bad habit of rushing things when victory is in sight."`
`"Pu ku ku.`
` After all, Milady cannot stand putting off a match."`
`"Heeey, shut up, shut up!!`
` It's Battler's turn, right?!`
` I finished off that 'trap piece' you advanced!`
` What should I repeat next?`
` Show me what you've got!!"`
`"Right!!`
` Now that even traps have been defeated, this looks like a perfect closed room murder at a glance.`
` ...And that's why I'll spin the chessboard around right now!!"`
`"...Here it comes, that special technique of yours!`
` How exactly are you going to spin what around?!`
` Try showing meeeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Yeah, I'll show you!!`
` I don't need to think of how six people could be killed inside closed rooms from the outside!`
` Aaah, it's useless, it's useless, it's all useless!`
` That's right, the question isn't how you can kill from outside the rooms.`
` The point is how they died inside the rooms, making them closed rooms!"`
`"...That's it, this is the answer!!`
` If you assume that one of the six victims was the culprit, `
`this closed room can be explained extremely easily!"`
`"Wh-Whaaaaaaat?!`
` Ridiculous!`
` I believe I clearly said in red that the six of them were dead...!!"`
`"Oh, there were six deaths.`
` Five were victims who got killed.`
` But if you assume that the other person committed suicide, you can destroy this closed room!!"`
`"...Certainly.`
` If the culprit locked themselves in the final closed room...`
`and threw away their own life, this closed room chain would be established."`
`"The suicide of the culprit.`
` ...Normally, it would be an unthinkable move, `
`but the argument that the unthinkable cannot exist...`
`cannot be used.`
` ...And he has no responsibility to demonstrate a motive.`
` A truly powerful move, which can only be used in a chess match against a witch...!"`
`"...Well, one cannot be certain that there was no motive.`
` ...For example, it has been announced that Kinzo only had a short time left to live.`
` Perhaps he did not regret losing his short remaining life and used his own death to send a message.`
` ...It might be possible to attach such a motive.`
` ......Milady,`
` it is our turn."`
`"I-Indeed!`
` To think you'd trample even the dignity of the dead to create a culprit...!`
` What a heartless, cold-blooded man...!"`
`"I'll set up the dead as the culprit.`
` ...This worse than inhuman move...is one you used to attack Kanon-kun in the last game.`
` ...Even though the games are different, I'm taking a shot back at you with this move, `
`as a tribute to Kanon-kun for that time."`
`"Just now, I've freed that Kanon-kun from his regrets!!"`
`"Nng... Gaaaaahhhh...!!"`
`"You have no responsibility to hold back here.`
` You should try to confirm that suicide wasn't the cause of any of their deaths.`
` I recommend that you have that child repeat it in red."`
`"Right!!`
` But suicide's a naive word that won't corner her!!`
` Beato, this'll stop you!!`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@`
`".........That...is painful."`
`"Uguu...!!`
` ............Nngg, ooohh...!"`
`"Hmmmm?`
` What's wrong, all six of them were killed, right?!`
` I'm just confirming that simple premise we've had from the very beginning, right?`
` Can't you repeat it?!"`
`"Hmph, ...I refuse to repeat it.`
` ...Th-There's no reason in particular."`
`"You realize that refusing to repeat this part is the same as resigning, right?!"`
`"Checkmate!!`
` One of the six was the culprit, and they planned to commit suicide after constructing the closed room!`
` That's all!!"`
`"...W-Wait!`
` No, umm, ...I'll say it, I'll say it!`
` I'll use the red like you want!`
` #ff0000None of the six committed suicide!#ffffff`
` How's that?!`
` Are you satisfied...?!`
` *cackle*cackle*, kakkakakakaka!`
` I've struck back, I've struck back!!!"`
`"Tch, `
`...what the hell, so you can say it...`
` ...But that's strange.`
` Why are you so panicky...?"`
`"...I-I-It's your imagination.`
` This time, even I'm feeling the pressure.`
` That's right, I don't have any leeway.`
` Pay it no mind..."`
`"...The line you asked that child to repeat has been altered.`
` Do not be fooled."`
`".........Gaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh..."`
`"Pu ku ku ku...`
` It seems not to have worked, Milady."`
`"Th-That's right!`
` She didn't say 'the six deaths were all homicides'.`
` She changed it to 'none of the six committed suicide'!`
` Which means one of them wasn't killed by someone else and didn't commit suicide.`
` ......Aaaaaaaahhh,`
` I've got it, I've got it!!`
` This is the truth!"`
`"Culprit X, who was hiding among the 6, murdered the other 5 and then set up a closed room.`
` ...After that, they planned to escape from or hide in that room by some method."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"However, `
`~ib~they got in an accident~ib~`
`!!`
` The culprit died from an accident that even they hadn't expected, setting up a closed room murder that even they hadn't desired!!`
` Now it's over, Beatrice!!`
` Checkmate!!!"`
`"...D-Damn iiiit!!`
` Did you think I'd be cornered by something like that?!!`
` I'd never announce my resignation over something like that!!`
` I'll slice up that foolish checkmate with my red treasured sword over and over again!!`
` None of the six died an accidental-"`
`"...Muga?!`
` Mmmmnn, mmwt mwar muu mmnnmmng, mmmpphhh!"`
`"My apologies.`
` We request some time to strategize.`
` Please allow us a brief postponement on this matter."`
`"...It's a fair request.`
` Perhaps you should accept it."`
`"Sure!! Take a break!`
` I've been given those a lot lately.`
` Now it's your turn to take one...!!"`
`"Thank you very much.`
` Come, Milady, ...this way.`
` And let us quietly count to one hundred inside our heads."`
`"Mmmmmmmphphh!!`
` Mphphpmhmmmm, mmmppmmphhhh!! `
`Mmmmmm!"`
`Ronove quickly covered Beato's mouth with his hand as she grew thoroughly panicked and agitated, suspending the game.`
`He pulled Beato away, supposedly to hold a strategy conference...`
`"...Damn.`
` That demon butler.`
` When Beato got all hot, I had a perfect chance to corner her..."`
`Beato normally acted like she was graceful and above it all, but she actually had a really short temper and got mad easily.`
`...Her usual intellect had less of a voice when she got excited.`
`"Ronove certainly is thinking clearly.`
` ...He probably gave your opponent some time to cool down.`
` ...That child grew too stubborn trying to remove your check...`
`and was about to easily let several large pieces go.`
` ...After all, the first twilight is only a skirmish.`
` ...The correct move at that time would have been to withdraw."`
`"...So, what does it mean?`
` Did I reach checkmate, or didn't I?"`
`"That child was about to say something in red.`
` You probably wouldn't have reached checkmate yet.`
` ...But, most likely, `
`you can expect our opponents to resign once they've cooled their heads."`
`"...You're joking.`
` Even though she hates losing that much...?"`
`"Yes.`
` In a losing battle, it is essential to withdraw your troops as soon as possible to try and minimize your losses.`
` ...The difficult part is gauging whether it's a losing battle or not.`
` ...Your opponent's butler seems to have calmly made that decision."`
`"...Oh well.`
` In other words, she managed to escape by a hair's breadth.`
` ...Getting checkmate and delivering the final blow won't be that easy for me."`
`"However, you should count this as your victory.`
` It seems they barely managed to prevent a large loss, `
`but they certainly sustained considerable damage.`
` ...The scale of that child's panic ought to make the depths of that wound quite clear to you."`
`"Seriously.`
` Ihihihi, it feels like she'd start crying if I bullied her any more."`
`As we talked, Ronove returned with Beato, who wore a meek expression.`
`...She didn't yet have her usual bold smile, but it looked like the blood wasn't rushing to her head anymore.`
`"......Hey.`
` It's your turn.`
` Did you decide on your next move?"`
`"I resign.`
` ...For now, I will let you have your victory."`
`Beato told me that frankly.`
`It seemed she'd taken a far-sighted view, as though saying 'If you want to laugh, then laugh'.`
`...It was a bit of a killjoy, and I lost my desire to deliver the final blow.`
`"Well, now that you've resigned, `
`that just means we're even, since my theory and yours can't deny each other.`
` You should treat it more like a tie than a loss."`
`"...I don't need your disgusting sympathy.`
` I'm telling you that I lost this round.`
` ...When you find a dog drenched with rain, do you have a sudden urge to whack it with a stick or something?"`
`"Nope.`
` I'm not you."`
`"............"`
`Even though she ridiculed me horribly when I showed signs of defeat, this is the best she's got when the tables are turned.`
`I did feel that was pretty cowardly of her, but I decided to act with dignity as the victor and let it slide.`
`...Beato resigned.`
`That's the one result of the first twilight.`
`Beatrice couldn't counter my move of 'one of the six was the culprit, `
`and that person died in an accident'.`
`...No, she probably could've countered it, but for some strategic reason, she admitted defeat.`
`It felt less like I'd won...and more like I'd let her slip away at the last second...`
`In a chess match with a witch, battles can be fought solely with pieces known as X, which require no detailed explanations.`
`Thanks to the 'Devil's Proof', I could create as many strange fictions as I wanted and use them as fighters in our argument.`
`...But that only works in a chess match with a witch.`
`...In our human world, you can't use such abstract theories to explain things.`
`This first twilight was a chain of six closed rooms.`
`...It certainly may have been possible for a human.`
`Beato wasn't able to deny all possibilities.`
`However, I don't have a clue who committed the crime,`
` or why, or how they actually did it...`
`It may seem strange to hear me saying this after I won...`
`...But for some reason, I felt like I'd have been more satisfied if Beatrice had been able to say definitively that it was impossible for humans.`
`I managed to avoid specifics using an abstract piece called X...`
`......But I couldn't deny the sense that some eerie intent that must never be known...`
`was filling up this entire mansion...`
`When being beseiged, your true enemy isn't so much the fear of an unseen culprit...`
`as it is keeping such fears alive for long periods of time.`
`Maria got bored and started complaining that she wanted to watch TV.`
`There was no TV in the lobby, so she decided to return to the cousins' room on the second floor.`
`The adults probably wanted to make sure Maria wasn't left on her own...`
`They told all the children to go to the second floor cousins' room.`
`George, who was grief-stricken by the loss of his fiancée, led the cousins up to the second floor without any resistance.`
`At first, Nanjo had been reading a book in the lobby, `
`but when he noticed the relatives looking like they wanted to discuss something sinister, `
`he said 'It seems I am in the way...' and returned to his room on the second floor.`
`"......I'm starving.`
` And if we just keep sitting around, we'll get sleepy too."`
`"It's only natural.`
` We didn't get any sleep at all last night."`
`"...We will probably end up being barricaded here for a full 24 hours.`
` It may be wiser to take naps in turn instead of over-stressing ourselves."`
`"True.`
` My husband and I will remain here, so I ask that anyone having trouble staying awake take it easy and rest."`
`"Our opponent might be expecting that, right?`
` Even if they couldn't defeat this many people, if that number shrinks enough, they may plan to use that moment to strike."`
`"There are seven of us here,`
` so we could take three-hour shifts in pairs.`
` ...Tomorrow morning's a long way off.`
` We still have some energy now, but tonight's going to be tough."`
`"Sure will.`
` Anyone sleepy?`
` Don't overdo it, and get some rest."`
`Hideyoshi looked around at everyone to see who wanted to sleep first, but no one volunteered.`
`...Everyone was just as tired, but no one was bold enough to go to sleep right away.`
`...Their fear of the unknown culprit was just as strong as their sleepiness.`
`"...Nobody?`
` Well, don't overdo it, everyone."`
`"If we get tired, we'll deal with it then.`
` ...I'll admit I'm sleepy, but I'm not in the mood now."`
`As Eva spoke sharply, she reread the second letter from Beatrice, which had been found in the boiler room.`
`Beatrice had sent them two letters, which had repeatedly told them to solve the riddle of the epitaph.`
`And she'd even provoked them by saying she'd give up her assets and the Headship if they could solve it...`
`Eva took out a notebook and opened it to a page with the epitaph copied onto it.`
`"......Is this that epitaph?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...I hate doing what the culprit says,`
` but we do have time to waste.`
` I think it's the perfect way to stave off boredom."`
`"...Not a bad way to kill time.`
` Why don't we challenge it together as siblings?"`
`"...Can I borrow that?`
` I'll rewrite it just a little larger.`
` Natsuhi-san, do you have a slightly larger piece of paper?"`
`"There should be paper in the servant room.`
` I will bring some."`
`Natsuhi immediately brought a blank B4 sheet of paper from the servant room.`
`Kyrie borrowed Eva's notebook, wrote out the epitaph on the paper, and laid it out on the table.`
`Then, everyone quickly peered down at it.`
`...They automatically formed a crowd.`
`"I've heard about it, `
`...but, really, this is a tough riddle.`
` I don't have a clue what it's talkin' about."`
`"At one point, I also did my best to solve it, but I was just as clueless."`
`"If you did know, you wouldn't have come all the way out here with a plan to make money.`
` After all, it's 10 tons of gold we're talking about."`
`"......This is the first time I've read through it seriously, but...`
`roughly speaking, couldn't it be split into three parts?"`
`"...I've been thinking this since last night, but you really are a good thinker, Kyrie-san.`
` Perhaps you'll be able to easily solve this riddle that we couldn't."`
`"Yeah.`
` Kyrie's sharp.`
` ...She might find a more interesting take on it if she comes in without any confusing biases."`
`"......That's right.`
` Kyrie-san,`
` would you mind giving us your honest opinion after reading the epitaph?"`
`"I doubt you'll find it useful.`
` You all give me too much credit."`
`"That's fine, just say whatever comes into your head.`
` Let's hear your thoughts.`
` ...The hints you give always help me out when I'm worried."`
`"Oh, so I have been helpful?`
` It's nice to finally hear about this now."`
`"Come ooon, don't I always thank you?"`
`"You two sure are close.`
` I'm jealous."`
`"And the rest of us would also love to hear these hints of yours.`
` We're just killing time anyway, so relax, okay?"`
`Kyrie was disturbed at being praised so highly for something so strange.`
`...But they had all the time in the world.`
`Realizing that this was just a way to waste time, she decided to accept the role she'd been given...`
`"...I'm sure I'll say something off the mark, but...`
`well, I'll put forward my ideas."`
`"Indeed.`
` ...What did you mean in the beginning, about how it could be divided into three parts, roughly speaking?"`
`Well, ...I just mean what I said.`
`I think that overall, the epitaph can be divided into three sections.`
`First, there are the five lines up until 'There sleeps the key to the gold'.`
`Up until this point is the first part, which directs you to the location of the key.`
`And then there's the part formed by the 11 lines up until the tenth twilight, which refer to the location of the Golden Land itself.`
`And the remaining six lines make up the part after the Golden Land has been reached.`
`"I see.`
` It can be divided into three parts about the key, the Golden Land, `
`and the Golden Land's treasure."`
`"Even we have been able to grasp that much.`
` The three sections that refer to the key, the door, and the treasure."`
`"...Nii-san, don't butt in any more than you have to!`
` Let Kyrie-san speak her ideas freely."`
`"Kyrie,`
` please continue.`
` ...We see it the same way you do so far.`
` So then?"`
`"...I wonder about the meaning of that thing in the beginning, the 'beloved hometown'.`
` Normally, that would refer to where Grandfather lived, right?`
` Since Father went to all the trouble of telling us that it's beloved, we can imagine that it's a hometown he had strong feelings for.`
` ...Did Father come from Odawara?"`
`"......Odawara is definitely where he was born, `
`but I don't think that's the hometown he loved.`
` I imagine all of us siblings have the same place in mind."`
`"...Right.`
` This probably isn't Odawara.`
` From what I've heard, he had a very fun time as a youth."`
`"Hahhaha.`
` ...Being made the Ushiromiya Family Head was probably Dad's greatest bit of misfortune in life."`
`"...Probably.`
` Father didn't actually want to become the Head."`
`"So where is this place?`
` Is there a river there where sweetfish swim?"`
`"...Maybe there was at the time.`
` There's been a lot of development there since then, and the sweetfish might have disappeared.`
` It would be extremely difficult to investigate whether sweetfish were there during Grandfather's boyhood years."`
`"And there probably isn't just a single river.`
` I believe we all gave this a thorough investigation geographically.`
` ...You even went to the actual place to investigate directly, right, Eva?"`
`"That was only as a vacation.`
` ...But, the townscape had changed completely since Father's time.`
` After all, it was caught up in that war, wasn't it?`
` By now, even precisely locating the place Father lived is impossible.`
` ...I imagine that if Father went there himself now, `
`even he wouldn't be able to pick out the place he'd lived anymore."`
`"Well, after all, those guys have also gone through a remarkable recovery..."`
`"......Does the part about a sweetfish river bring any place name clearly to mind?"`
`"Well, yeah.`
` After all, they're sweetfish, right?`
` People say they live in rivers with clean water, so there are countless rivers that might work.`
` Any stream Dad innocently went sweetfish-fishing in was probably buried by the development later.`
` It'd be different if we had a map from before the war or a person who knew a lot about how the area was before the war, but..."`
`"...It probably isn't something like that."`
`"What do you mean...?"`
`"...Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved hometown.`
` You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key.`
` ...After these two lines, there's a single blank line.`
` ...Something is being presented with just these two lines.`
` What if the next three lines continue based upon that something?"`
`"What do you mean, something is being presented...?"`
`"...I don't know.`
` At any rate, what we can get from these two lines alone isn't something vague, like the question of which river it might be,`
` but the clear presentation of the keyword 'river'."`
`"...It may be that this isn't a 'river' with water flowing down it.`
` ...The 'sweetfish river' might be some kind of metaphor.`
` ...What sort of impressions does the word 'sweetfish' give?"`
`"......Sweetfish are like salmon.`
` They're freshwater fish, but they go out into the ocean right after they're born.`
` When they get big, they go back to the river to live there, `
`and then they spawn there and end their lives there.`
` Well, they leave their home at one point, but when they get big, they come back and lay eggs.`
` Might be able to link that to the idea of clan prosperity."`
`"Oh?`
` They're freshwater fish, but they can live in the ocean?`
` I didn't know that.`
` I figured river fish wouldn't be able to live in the sea."`
`"And they are called sweetfish because they have a pleasant aroma.`
` I have never eaten one, but I have heard they can be quite delicious when grilled with salt."`
`"What's that, Natsuhi-san?!`
` You've never eaten salt-grilled sweetfish?!`
` They're delicious!`
` You should try it sometime soon!"`
`"It is a food for commoners.`
` Hardly appropriate for your mouth."`
`"...This is just my wild idea, `
`...but the impression I get from a sweetfish river makes me suspect a family tree.`
` The sweetfish go out into the ocean for a time, but they return to the river where they were born to spawn, right?`
` ......It reminds me of myself."`
`"You're right.`
` By this point,`
` I can confess that I've sometimes suspected that it refers to you and Maria-chan."`
`"I see.`
` ...If you follow the river downstream, you will find a village.`
` If you go down the family tree, all you find is Maria's name (真里亞). Only her name has a '里' (read 'ri' or 'sato'), the character Father uses for village here."`
`"Isn't that right?!`
` ...But as you all know, Father doesn't like Maria, `
`and he almost never speaks with her.`
` And, in the past, Father told me to give Maria a completely different name.`
` I just decided to go with Maria on my own.`
` Father was very mad about that.`
` ...Given that, `
`it's very hard to imagine that he would reference Maria's name in his precious epitaph about who would succeed his wealth and inheritance."`
`"Have you ever let Maria-chan read the epitaph?"`
`"Uh, yes, of course.`
` But it looked as though she didn't have a clue.`
` ...She didn't have a clue, and she kept going on about that same occult stuff, about how it was a resurrection ceremony for the witch."`
`"......A connection between Father and Maria.`
` ...Certainly, they do share that occult hobby, but they never interacted.`
` ...I can't imagine that it refers to Maria either."`
`"...What sticks out to me is how he went out of his way to add 'beloved' to that first line.`
` ...Like you all said just now, `
`if Father was reluctant about becoming the Ushiromiya Family Head, `
`would he have fond memories for anything connected to that?`
` ...I don't think this can be Odawara, which represents the Ushiromiya Head Family."`
`"...I believe this word 'beloved' here at the beginning...`
`must refer to a place full of very important memories to Father."`
`"......Hmmmmmm.`
` ...Well, that's fine.`
` It would be hard to pinpoint since we don't have even a trace of a map from that time,`
` but at any rate, there were probably several rivers with sweetfish swimming in them near Dad's hometown during his youth."`
`"That's if we're looking for a river with water flowing down it, right?`
` And then?`
` Go on, Kyrie-san."`
`"...I don't really understand the three lines starting with 'If you follow the river downstream, you will find a village'.`
` ...It's probably linked to the two lines about the sweetfish river.`
` I imagine it's something we'd understand automatically if we knew what the sweetfish river really was.`
` ...Until we figure that out, it's probably useless to try and solve those three lines any further."`
`"So we're stuck unless we know what the 'sweetfish river' really is...`
` And there's no guarantee it even means a literal river.`
` ...Seriously.`
` What's up with the sweetfish?`
` Did Dad like to eat them?`
` Or does it have some special meaning?`
` Is it pointless to read too deeply into it?"`
`"...If you don't have both a micro and a macro perspective, your field of vision grows narrow.`
` ...It might be better to be flexible and avoid thinking too deeply, `
`focusing on an abstract image of a river where fish swim, or something that can flow...`
`up or down."`
`"Then, the answer behind the 'sweetfish river' passes through the next three lines and makes its way to the 'key to the Golden Land'..."`
`"If you think about it this way, I wonder if it was a mistake to split it into three parts.`
` There's actually four parts.`
` ...'Go down the sweetfish river', `
`'find the key to the Golden Land', `
`'journey to the Golden Land', `
`and 'the treasure of the Golden Land'."`
`"Hmmm...`
` ...Truly intriguing.`
` Well, you've gone this far. Would you mind continuing and telling us your opinion on the most central portion of the epitaph, `
`up to the point when we reach the Golden Land on the tenth twilight?"`
`"...That's the most symbolic...and also the most disturbing part."`
`"Since the word 'sacrifices' keeps coming up, `
`I can't help but think it has something to do with Father's occult ceremonies...`
` ......How do you see it, Kyrie-san?"`
`Kyrie recrossed her arms several times,`
` peering into the paper with the epitaph copied onto it as though she was looking through it...`
`".........`
`......This is...very difficult.`
` ...It starts with 'the one who obtains the key', `
`so you probably won't be able to continue without knowing what that key means.`
` ...I'll have to give up on that, but I'll take a shot at trying to solve it anyway."`
`"...Just like how the 'sweetfish river' isn't necessarily a river with water flowing down it, `
`it's also doubtful that this 'key' is actually something shaped like a key."`
`"Right.`
` It might also be a code or a keyword.`
` ...After all, this key isn't something to be stuck into a keyhole.`
` It's something that selects six people to be sacrifices for the first twilight.`
` In that sense, we can say for sure that this key isn't being used to open the door to the Golden Land."`
`"...But what a disturbing key it is.`
` A key that can choose six human sacrifices..."`
`"How would a key select anything?`
` ...Do ya spin it like a roulette...?"`
`"This key indicates a certain group of six people.`
` ...No, we should say it indicates a certain group of six things,`
` ...if this doesn't mean a literal command to offer sacrifices.`
` For example, it could be an anagram."`
`"An anagram?`
` Do you mean playing with letters...?"`
`"Yes.`
` I've been thinking about it ever since Rosa started talking about the family tree,`
` and about how village was a part of Maria-chan's name."`
`"...It seems that ever since the words 'beloved hometown' came up, `
`Rudolf-san, for example, has assumed that this epitaph points to some coordinates or some other geographical feature, but that might not be the case.`
` This could be some kind of puzzle, ...or maybe playing with letters."`
`"...Forgive me,`
` but how does one play with letters?"`
`"Oh, well, it's like 'sucker merry barrels'.`
` Whaaat do you get when you take out the e's and r's?`
` Like that.`
` Well, you were raised well, Natsuhi-san, so you probably don't know."`
`"...Merry??`
` Take out the e's and r's, huh?`
` ???"`
`"Stop it.`
` It is an undignified game, inappropriate for you."`
`Only Natsuhi didn't get it and had a blank look on her face.`
`It seemed she'd only guessed that the answer had to be something undignified, `
`going by Rudolf and Eva's sniggers.`
`"Ah, ...Natsuhi nee-san, it's something like this.`
` This is just something from Maria's book of riddles, okay?`
` There's this thing called a Tanuki Notebook."`
`"It's a notebook written like a code, with a lot of 'ta's mixed in,`
` and if you 'remove' all of the 'ta's, then the true paragraph pops up.`
` It's a game like that."`
`"Ah, ...oh, I see.`
` ......??"`
`Natsuhi finally realized the answer to the undignified riddle Rudolf had posed, and her face grew red as she hung her head in embarrassment.`
`"......So maybe 'kill' actually means 'remove' in that sense, right...?"`
`"Yes.`
` I also thought that.`
` It's possible that the key to the Golden Land is a word with six characters."`
`"In other words, ...the 'ta' from the Tanuki Notebook...is actually six characters here...?`
` Hmmm, ...this is getting complicated..."`
`"Playing with letters, is it...?`
` ...Hmmm.`
` In Japan, it really feels like a child's game, but it's apparently a stylish form of humor among intellectuals in the English world.`
` ...It is easy to imagine that Father was interested in it."`
`"...But by this point, I quickly lose my ability to understand it.`
` Up until this part, it may have been filled with mysteries, but it was extremely sequential."`
`"'Sweetfish river', 'go down it', 'then find the key'...all of that is extremely sequential.`
` And as a result, we can guess that we gain a six-character key,`
` ...but in that case, we now don't know 'what' we kill the six characters from."`
`"That's right.`
` Where do we pull the six characters from?`
` It doesn't tell us."`
`"...On the second twilight, there are 'those who remain'.`
` ...Which means that, at the very least, that 'something' has a limited number of characters.`
` You could read it like it's telling you to continue with the remaining characters after the first six characters are removed."`
`"......And yet, we don't know what this 'something' is, even though it should've been shown to us at the beginning.`
` ...Are we wrong even in our assumption that this is playing with letters...?"`
`".........Hmmmmm..."`
`Everyone crossed their arms and fell silent.`
`It felt like they were about to reach a novel understanding they hadn't managed before, ...but they stumbled just one step short.`
`Then, Hideyoshi's stomach rumbled heartily.`
`That silence was broken by laughter.`
`"Sorry, sorry.`
` Strangely enough, by spinnin' the gears in my head for a change, my stomach's gone completely empty.`
` Looks like I can't stand missin' breakfast, ...wahahahahaha."`
`"Natsuhi,`
` isn't there anything to eat here?"`
`"There should at least be enough set aside for breakfast.`
` I will prepare it."`
`"I'm also starving.`
` And I'll bet those brats above us are the same.`
` ...Still, I doubt there's enough for the 18 people here, much less a full three meals, right?"`
`"That's right.`
` It'll be a long journey 'til tomorrow.`
` Maybe we'd better take a trip back to the mansion and fish around for some canned food or somethin' in the kitchen."`
`"There's nothing more than crackers and snacks here, but if that will be sufficient, I can get them ready for you all.`
` But with this many people, there might not be any left for lunch..."`
`"That will do for now.`
` Would you mind getting those ready?"`
`It looked like the men had been taken over with an appetite that stopped all thought.`
`The atmosphere grew more peaceful, and the epitaph investigation team split up for the time being.`
`...But Eva kept staring at the paper the epitaph was written on like she was going to burn a hole through it...`
`"......Playing around with letters was nothing more than a theory of mine.`
` There's a chance it's mistaken.`
` Eva-san, don't take it too seriously, okay...?"`
`"......Thank you.`
` I'll just keep doing this on my own.`
` Would you mind leaving me alone?"`
`Eva spoke coldly.`
`...Kyrie didn't bother her any more, and instead went to help Natsuhi prepare breakfast.`
`"Nee-san,`
` shouldn't we also help prepare breakfast?"`
`"Then you go help.`
` I'm busy solving this!"`
`"S-Sorry...`
` Th-Then I'll help..."`
`"......Good grief.`
` How can you be like that?"`
`"...Huh?"`
`"The Ushiromiya Family Headship will be given to the person who solves this epitaph.`
` It looks like you've given up from the beginning, as if it has nothing to do with you, `
`but if you can solve it, there's a chance even you'll be able to receive the Headship."`
`"...This is a chance to steal everything from Nii-san.`
` Why aren't you taking such a once-in-a-lifetime chance more seriously?"`
`"...Um, ......umm, ...I..."`
`Rosa hung her head, unsure as to how she should answer.`
`...Too late, she regretted carelessly speaking to her sister when she was in a bad mood.`
`"If you've noticed anything, say so.`
` Even though Kyrie-san and I were thinking hard, you just kept nodding your head, didn't you?`
` Come on.`
` Isn't there anything you've noticed?`
` Come on!"`
`"......Uh, `
`......umm, `
`......`
` ...Don't...you think this part's strange?"`
`"...Strange?`
` What is?"`
`"Umm, ...this word, Golden Land.`
` The word Golden Land comes up several times."`
`"So what?`
` Do you find some keywords by splitting up the characters in 'Golden Land'?"`
`"Umm, ...it's just this bit about how you 'attain to the power' of the Golden Land's treasures.`
` The wording seemed a little odd to me."`
`"But what's your point?`
` Are you saying he used those words because their letters add up to something?"`
`"Umm, ...it's just that...this whole section's written like a journey to the Golden Land, right?`
` You reach the Golden Land, and then you receive its treasures."`
`"What's your point?`
` You think there's some sort of keyword tied to those treasures?"`
`"U-Umm, that's not it.`
` ...Look, isn't just the tenth twilight strange?"`
`"......Huh?`
` ...Ah."`
`"U-Umm, no, not the treasures themselves.`
` ...Look, in the tenth twilight, isn't how you receive the treasures strange?"`
`"......Huh?`
` ...Ah."`
`"Even though they're all written the 'Golden Land' (黄金郷), for some reason, only this place has the 'village of gold' #fefefe(黄金の郷)#ffffff.`
` He went to all the trouble of mixing in the character 'の'.`
` It vaguely bugged me that it's only said differently here... `
`......ah, umm, ...it's not like it means anything.`
` This is Father we're talking about.`
` It could just be a coincidental change in how he said the word."`
`"Why does it say we'll receive the treasures 'once and for the last time'?`
` If we only get them once, then there's no point telling us it's the last time. `
`And the same thing in reverse.`
` ...Oh, ...uh...but I'm probably splitting hairs over nothing, if you think about it.`
` This is Father we're talking about, after all.`
` He probably just said it that way to make it sound more dramatic."`
`"............"`
`"......Boring."`
`"Oh? What is boring...?"`
`"......Boring, boring."`
`"My, my.`
` What on earth is this child grumbling about?"`
`"She's probably annoyed by all the tips you gave Battler-sama, Madam."`
`"...Nooot really.`
` That doesn't annoy me.`
` On the contrary, I'm happy to see that useless Battler finally reach a level where he can match me."`
`"Hohohoh...`
` Did Battler-kun and I get a little too close?`
` Perhaps us old fogeys had best leave you young'uns alone."`
`"Pu ku ku ku ku..."`
`When Virgilia and Ronove giggled and cackled, `
`Beatrice's irritation meter finally reached its limit.`
`"Gaah, enough with everyone laughing at me!`
` Ronove, vanish for a while!`
` Disappear, disappeeear!"`
`"Certainly.`
` Then I shall rest for the time being.`
` Pukukukuku..."`
`Ronove bowed his head, still laughing, and vanished.`
`After that, all that remained was the grumpy and irritated figure of Beatrice...`
`and Virgilia, who was cooly enjoying her tea.`
`"......When you said '#ff0000There are no more than 18 people on this island#ffffff', you actually cornered yourself."`
`"......I knew it...`
` ......I did have this feeling it might be a bit too early...`
` I suppose that was right after all, wasn't it?"`
`"If you had led him further astray first, things might have been different,`
` but as it was, that trump card was a real waste.`
` You ended up rousing him instead."`
`In addition to denying the witch, `
`Battler had possessed a second victory condition, one of explaining everything without suspecting one of the 18.`
`It was at that point, when he'd been tossed about by two opposing goals, that his heart should have been at its weakest.`
`However, Beatrice had used the red carelessly, proclaiming that there were no more than 18 people.`
`...Because of that, Battler had been forced to suspect one of the 18, `
`......and he had finally begun to build up the resolve he needed to accept that.`
`Battler was stubborn, `
`but that was exactly why fissures would run all through him, like breaking china, when he was struck in a fragile spot.`
`That itself should have been his greatest weak point, but...`
`"......Nnnngggg.`
` ...Did I get a little too careless after my complete victory last time...?"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"Yes, you were too careless.`
` ...The last game was a difficult one for Battler-kun, `
`but it seems this game will become `
`a difficult one `
`~ib~for you~ib~`
`."`
`"...A broken vase will never return to its original form.`
` ...So, it would be more constructive to think of a next move, rather than regretfully picking up the pieces."`
`"......However, now that Battler has figured out as much as he has, how should I plot against him...?"`
`"Hohohoh.`
` Your troubled face is an even better snack than Ronove's cookies."`
`"...Uu-.`
` You and Battler...and even Ronove are treating me like sweets now.`
` ...Even though I'm not sweet at all."`
`With a shameful, childlike face that she would never have shown in front of Battler, `
`Beatrice rolled her head around on top of the table.`
`"......Teacheeer.`
` ......At least gimme a hi-nt."`
`"Oh?`
` What kind of hint?"`
`"If you know some really good move that'll leave Battler speechless and make him wanna accept me...`
` I won't ask you to say it outright, so, umm, `
`...even if it's just a hint..."`
`"Hohohoh, I can't.`
` I am on Battler-kun's side right now, `
`so I couldn't teach you something that would give you an advantage."`
`"...C'mon, don't be so stingy...`
` Your disciple's in trouble, right...?"`
`"I seem to remember you brazenly boasting that you had surpassed your teacher."`
`"......Uu-...`
` Please act like an old person and gimme just a bit of your crafty ideas...`
` Pleease...`
` It's mean if you only help Battleeer..."`
`"My, my.`
` You're still a spoiled child."`
`"...But, it's true that I may have given Battler-kun a few too many hints.`
` It did serve as a scolding to you, `
`but perhaps it was a little too much support for a fair game."`
`"Isn't that right, isn't that right...?`
` Please, Teacheeer, at least just a hint now..."`
`".........This is only a hint.`
` Think about what it means by yourself, okay?"`
`"Yeah, yeah!`
` I'll think about it myself, so please!`
` Please, gimme one that'll leave Battler down in the dumps, Teacher."`
`Considering how she acted like a great and mighty witch in front of Battler, the way she acted when he wasn't around was truly pathetic.`
`Virgilia sighed at how childish Beato still was, despite all the time that had passed.`
`"Then just a hint.`
` ...Do you know of Aesop's fable, The North Wind and the Sun?"`
`"Of course.`
` It's a story about how the north wind and the sun challenge each other to see who can steal the cloak off a traveler, right?"`
`"That's right.`
` Violent, impatient methods aren't necessarily the best decisions in all cases."`
`"...You don't have to tell me that.`
` I've already reflected on the mistakes I made when I was too anxious to achieve victory."`
`"......`
`Think well about what this means.`
` And furthermore,`
` ...there's one point that Battler seems to be misunderstanding a bit, but he isn't the only one."`
`"Do you understand the victory conditions of this game?"`
`"...What else is there, other than making Battler surrender?"`
`"......See?`
` You're already wrong there."`
`"How am I wrong?"`
`"Your victory isn't making Battler-kun surrender.`
` ...Isn't it making Battler-kun accept your existence?"`
`"...What's this?`
` You want me to butter him up, begging him to accept me as a witch?!`
` How foolish!`
` I haven't sunk that low!"`
`Grrrrrrrrrrr... Beato growled like a dog in a bad mood.`
`Virgilia shrugged her shoulders, snickering at her disciple, who was as short-tempered as ever...`
`"That is my hint.`
` For the rest, you'll have to consider deeply on your own.`
` ......In any event, your moves up until now will not work on Battler-kun.`
` A significant tactical adjustment will probably be required."`
`"...I don't need you to tell me that.`
` ...I don't have a clue what you mean by the North Wind and the Sun, `
`but at any rate, I realize I'll have to alter my course.`
` ...I'll introduce a scheme clever enough to surprise even you, Teacher...!"`
`"Hohoho...`
` I look forward to it.`
` I wonder how Battler-kun will tackle that.`
` ...I wish you good luck as well."`
`"After Battler, you mean?`
` Hmm..."`
`"......Are you gonna give up and resign already?`
` I guess you are that tired. If only you'd just grab a futon and sleep..."`
`...As my mind grew vague and I pretended to fight my drowsiness, while sinking deeper and deeper into the sofa,`
` 'I' scolded myself.`
`"...You also dreamed about stealing the position of Family Head from Krauss, right...?`
` Even though my magic's given you a chance, are you already throwing it away...?"`
`You could say that, but...`
`......This riddle is really hard.`
`Even a wire puzzle would be better.`
`...At least in that case, you know for sure that it's solvable.`
`But in the case of this epitaph riddle, we've been given no reason to be sure of that.`
`...I might just be fighting a useless battle.`
`...Still hazy, I looked at the notebook I'd been holding the whole time.`
`It was opened to a page with the epitaph, `
`which I must've stared at hard enough to burn holes in it on so many hundreds of nights, I'd lost count.`
`...That page...is truly a door.`
`On the other side lies the 'Golden Land', the place I've wanted to drag myself to no matter the effort ever since I was a child,`
` ...and the place I was never able to reach.`
`Am I touching the door with both hands, `
`with the book...no, the door right there in front of me, ready to be opened, ...and yet still unable to reach the other side?`
`"...That's right.`
` Your hand is already on the door.`
` Come on, open it with all your strength.`
` And read the characters written on the door."`
`"......Open it...`
`with all my strength.`
` ...Read...`
`the characters written on the door..."`
`Strain your eyes.`
`...See through to the thing beyond the epitaph written in the notebook...`
`"...The 'beloved hometown' definitely won't betray our expectations.`
` ...The only past Father held dear happened during his childhood years."`
`That's right...`
` Then what about the 'sweetfish river'?`
`There are several rivers where they swim, and there's reason to doubt that this just refers to one close to the place Father lived.`
`...If we take out a map and start calculating which rivers with sweetfish were closest,`
` ...things will quickly get vague and we won't be able to narrow it down...`
`"Didn't you say it yourself?`
` You said it didn't have to be a river with water flowing down it.`
` ...If the word sweetfish is too complicated, why not forget it...?"`
`"Think of a river.`
` A river.`
` Linking it with a 'family tree' wasn't a bad idea.`
` Try thinking about how to link a river with something else along those lines..."`
`...It isn't a river?`
` But where else could sweetfish swim?`
`Oh, but if we're talking about places sweetfish can swim, then maybe the ocean has something to do with this...`
`Didn't my husband even say that they go out into the ocean, even though they're river fish...?`
` .........`
`..................`
`......To the ocean.`
`............No, `
`...but...`
`......`
`...Huh...?`
`"...Did you notice?`
` But that's just a faint memory.`
` There's supposed to be a room for storing books in this building, right?`
` If you investigate, you can make sure."`
`...If that's the 'sweetfish river'......`
`......And if the key might be a six character word...`
`.........Then could the key actually be resting in that river?`
`I-I don't know, I don't know.`
`...Anyway, I have to search in an atlas...`
`But, even if I know that, I don't know 'from what' I should take the six characters...`
`"...You really don't know?`
` Think deeply.`
` ......We're pretty smart, so our ideas are solid."`
`"Don't think of it like it's something as massive as the riddle of the epitaph, but like it's a child's riddle.`
` ...Men are always children, no matter how old they get.`
` Even if Father has advanced into old age, `
`that doesn't change the fact that he's essentially a child at heart."`
`"......Throw away your awe of Father.`
` ...Think of this like it's a worthless, infantile game with riddles, like the ones Maria suddenly brought out on the boat."`
`...Riddles.`
` ...Worthless, infantile.`
`............`
`.........Huh, ......ah.`
`...I'm sure that was...what was it...umm, umm...`
`...I'm sure, if my memory isn't wrong, ...that it's probably the case, umm...`
`No, I don't have to rely on my vague memory.`
`I should be able to figure that out immediately by searching the library.`
`"......We've probably already noticed the answer.`
` ...All that's left is to investigate whether it's correct or not."`
`"Come on, Eva.`
` Let's go to the library, making sure no one sees us.`
` ...There, we should find a mountain of thick books that didn't fit in Father's study.`
` ...I'm sure we'll find a book that answers our question.`
` ......Quickly.`
` This is the first and last chance we'll ever get to make our dreams come true."`
`When Natsuhi tried to lay a blanket over her, Eva suddenly jumped up.`
`"...I'm sorry.`
` It looks like I woke you."`
`"...Eva,`
` if you're sleepy, don't overdo it.`
` You rest first."`
`"...Th-Thank you.`
` I'm just going to the bathroom for a bit to wash my face."`
`"You should take it easy and rest.`
` ...You're just gonna make yourself feel worse, you know?"`
`"I told you I'm fine!`
` I'll be right back."`
`After leaving only those words behind, I rapidly left the lobby.`
`The lobby was partitioned off by a door, so as soon as I went into the corridor, they could no longer see me.`
`...The library was next to the servant room.`
`Father always owned a vast book collection,`
` but ever since he started to become engrossed with his occult hobby, that collection grew even larger,`
` so that the normal books suitable for a normal study had been forced out as his study overflowed.`
`This so-called library was mostly used as a storage room for those normal books.`
`They were all thick, like complete encyclopedias for intellectuals,`
` but that was very convenient for me, now that I was investigating something.`
`I entered softly, ...and just in case, I checked the room with my gun readied, making sure that there were no suspicious people there.`
`Then I locked it from the inside.`
`I actually wasn't thinking that the murderer might be hiding somewhere.`
`...What scared me was the thought that one of my siblings might hear what I was investigating.`
`My heart had started racing before I realized it...`
`...I was half-asleep just a moment ago, so I didn't realize how significant this thing I noticed was.`
`But as I gradually became aware, ...my heart started to feel like it was about to explode.`
`"......I...wonder if any of the other siblings have noticed this..."`
`I don't think Krauss and Rudolf will notice.`
`...But I don't know about Kyrie.`
`She has extraordinarily good intuition.`
`......And I don't know about Rosa either.`
`"Rosa's stupid too.`
` She always has been, incredibly so."`
`Really...?`
` I'd say she was wise enough to make you think she was stupid, so that she didn't earn herself unnecessary malice.`
`"......Here it is.`
` ...I wonder if we'll find it in this one."`
`I pulled the book out and flipped through the pages...`
`"......Nn.`
` ......So this is...`
`......`
`a 'sweetfish river'...?"`
`I see...`
`This is what the sweetfish river means.`
`...Don't dawdle around, research further.`
`"Y-Yes, I understand...`
` If you follow the river downstream, you will find a village...`
` By using the character '里', does he mean a town or something?`
` That's just an area of dense population, so there could be any number of those..."`
`Why have you stopped thinking?!`
`Oh, is this too much work for you?`
` If only you'd just give up...`
`If only you'd just hand the Ushiromiya Headship over to Kyrie...!`
`"I-I don't want to...`
` I will become the Head.`
` ...This is...umm, my first and last chance...`
` ...What is this village?`
` What does it mean?!`
` Do you find one if you go down the river...?!`
` ......Ah, ...`
`aaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`...In the village, look for the shore the two will tell you of.`
`...岸 means shore.`
` Get it?`
`"Uu, ...*gulp*...`
` I-I-I understand...!`
` 'Shore', ...'shore'......!"`
`'!s0`
`...the pieces that I hadn't been able to understand at all...`
`...began to *snap*...`
`*snap*...`
`into place, all by themselves...`
`I couldn't even remember to close my open mouth.`
`...My throat grew completely dry...`
`Is it...really okay for this to be the answer?`
`R-Really?`
` Really...?!`
`"...But this isn't six characters at all.`
` ...I'm absolutely sure this is the answer, but this doesn't reach six characters at all...!"`
`Did you stop thinking again?`
` In that case, think of a way you could read it with six characters.`
`If you can't think of one, then research it.`
`...There has to be an answer.`
` You must not doubt that.`
`Is believing in that too much for you? If only you'd just cry yourself to sleep, and then you can just give up and die...`
`'!s1`
`2, `
`3, `
`4, `
`5, `
`6...`
` ...Oooh, `
`...s`
`-`
`six characters...`
` ...I-`
`I found it.`
` ...This...`
`is...`
`th-`
`the key to the Golden Land...!!"`
`Yes.`
` This is...the key to the Golden Land.`
` ...The key...to our childhood dreams.`
`...The only keyhole this key can be stuck in...is that place.`
`That...has to be what offering the sacrifices means.`
`I'm sure you get it by now, right......?`
`"...A-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!!"`
`"......This way?`
` ...Go this way......?`
` They're...inviting me to go this way......"`
`...!!!`
`My heart leapt.`
`...Because there, ......gaping wide, ...was an opened mouth in the eerie darkness.`
`"...Wh-What's this...?`
` What is this...?!"`
`When I strained my eyes, peering into the darkness, I saw something that looked like a light switch.`
`...In addition, there was a switch with 'open' and 'close' written on it.`
`When I resolutely pushed the switch, `
`rough lights, like you'd find in a coal mine, turned on sporadically, `
`making a staircase that stretched underground come hazily into view...`
`Eerily enough, it looked even more gloomy with the lights turned on.`
`Near the light switch was that 'open and close' switch.`
`...It would probably open or close this, but if the open part happened to be broken, `
`I might be shut away in this creepy underground area for all eternity...`
`So for the time being, I didn't touch that switch, `
`...and as I readied my gun again, I slowly went down the stairs.`
`The ceiling was very high, so it didn't feel cramped.`
`On the contrary, it felt as though a cool breeze was blowing upwards, and that creepiness seemed to form a sort of aura...`
`As I readied my gun and carefully stared forwards, ...I descended the stairs...`
`The walls, the stairs, the lights...all of them were very old-fashioned.`
`...It was easy to suspect that this had been built back when the mansion had been constructed on this island.`
`There were cracks in the ceiling, and water clung to the walls, constantly dripping down.`
`That water fell into a gutter that had been set up alongside the stairs, then quickly and silently flowed into the underground darkness.`
`As though it was telling me to go faster...`
`The staircase kept turning back on itself.`
`I don't know how far down I've gone, but I think it's much deeper than one floor.`
`Eventually, ......a rough, metal door showed itself.`
`And there, characters had been written in a dark red paint.`
` ...They had probably been written a long time ago.`
`'!s0`
`My heart, which was already about to explode, jumped about even more as soon as I recognized those deep-red characters...`
`There's no mistake...`
` This is the last stop.`
`......Father's...Golden Land...!!`
`I calmed my throbbing heart, somehow regained my composure, and readied my gun again.`
`...But since, in the end, I couldn't open the door with my gun held in both hands...`
`...I lowered the gun, carefully hid my breathing, and opened the door...`
`".........Th-This place...is...?!"`
`My first impression when I saw the room...`
`was that it might be linked to one of the rooms in the mansion.`
`That's right, it had exactly the same atmosphere about it as the sealed VIP room on the second floor.`
`But this was underground, so there were no windows.`
`There was only the solemn light of a grand chandelier.`
`But even though it was dimly lit by the faint light, `
`the quality of the interior was more than enough to take your breath away.`
`A bed with a canopy, and a rocking chair that looked like it would be comfortable to sit in.`
` An extravagant sofa and carpet.`
`The room was like a dream every girl yearns for at least once...`
`And yet, since it was an underground hidden room with no windows, `
`it felt more like the hidden house of a witch.`
`I'd never swallowed the legend of Beatrice, witch of the forest.`
`However, ...after being shown this room, `
`...it certainly became hard to doubt that she actually had existed......`
`and had lived in this room.`
`"......Is someone...`
`...there...?"`
`Even though I was completely shocked by this room, I carefully...`
`no, timidly searched the interior with my gun raised.`
`And, ...at the back of the room, I found it.`
`"......Eeek......"`
`My gasp came out strangely, like a bunny being choked.`
`...After all, ...after finding something like this,`
` ...no one would be able to stop that kind of stupid voice from leaking out...`
`"It's here...`
` ...I-It's really here......`
` ...Father's...gold...!!"`
`On the opposite side of the canopy bed, it was piled up in a massive heap...`
`It was a mountain, a mountain of gold ingots!!`
`Of course, they weren't piled up carelessly in a way that would damage the dignity of this room.`
`A beautiful scarlet satin weave was laid on the mountain of gold, `
`creating a beautiful three-colored mix between the red, the gold and the black of the deep darkness...`
`It was as though, when the witch slept on this bed,`
` the gold would be a respectful chamberlain waiting on her.`
`Nobly, refinedly, gracefully, beautifully.`
`It was attentively piled there with an imposing air...`
`When I tried to grab a single gold ingot, I was surprised at its weight.`
`...It was probably about 10 kilograms.`
`...Just this ingot would probably be worth more than 10 million.`
`The Ushiromiya family crest, the One-Winged Eagle, was lightly imprinted on it.`
`It was hard to tell whether it had worn away, or whether the impression had been made carelessly in the first place, `
`but it was certainly the crest of the One-Winged Eagle.`
`Just how many ingots were piled up there?`
`By doing a quick count here and there and judging by the height, there had to be a few hundred at least.`
`My mind's already gone blank, so I can't do the math well.`
`...Even a moderate guess would put it above several billion yen.`
`"That's right, ...of course...`
` ...After all, there's 10 tons of gold, right...?`
` At the current value, that's more than 20 billion yen of gold...!`
` ...I-I found it...before anyone else. ......I found it!!`
` Ahaha, wahahahahahahaha, ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`In front of the mountain of gold, I spread my arms and looked up at the ceiling.`
`A laugh without a trace of dignity flowed out from my entire body.`
`I had no intention of laughing in a weird way, `
`...but, but, I couldn't hold back the happy feeling that was flowing through me.`
`...My older brother probably wouldn't accept his loss just because I found this gold.`
`...But from now on, there would be no changing the fact that I had been the one to find it...!`
`To steal away the Headship of the family, some more subtle bargaining would probably still be required.`
`But after everything I've gone through until now, that's a completely trivial problem.`
`Even if I lose out on the Ushiromiya Family Headship, `
`...I already have 20 billion yen worth of gold!!`
`"Hahahaha, ahahahahaha!!`
` At times, I've thought that money is such a worthless thing.`
` I thought there were so many things in this world you can't buy with money.`
` ...But now I see that's just a lie!`
` Just an excuse that the have-nots make for themselves!!"`
`"In front of this mountain of gold, I've finally realized something so obvious...!!`
` By using this money, I can give birth to all the happiness in this world!`
` With this money, my husband's company is already saved.`
` We will always be happy as a family.`
` And I can even leave a vast sum of money to George...!!"`
`"The rest of the relatives will eventually be ruined and disappear.`
` At that time, George will use this gold, `
`and just like Grandfather did,`
` he will revive the Ushiromiya family's lost honor.`
` ...George is the true successor to the Ushiromiya family!!"`
`It happened!!!`
` My wish was granted!!`
`That dream I have wished for ever since I was born into this world as Ushiromiya Eva...has been granted completely at this very moment...!!`
`My husband and I will be happy for all eternity.`
`And I can also give my only son, George, eternal happiness!!`
`There's no way I'll waste it on foolish pleasures!!`
`My older brother has chewed the Ushiromiya family to bits, but George and I will revive it!`
`And that means I truly have succeeded the Ushiromiya Family Headship!!`
`"I was successful...`
` I did it, ...honey...and George...`
` ...I...your mother...finally succeeded...`
` ...No one will be able to threaten us now...`
` Aaaaaaahhh, waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!"`
`That's right, after this, never again will we be smothered by sad nights.`
`Congratulations, me.`
`Congratulations, Ushiromiya Eva.`
`...Right here, right now, the sad half of our life will have its heart's desire granted.`
`"It's all thanks to you...`
` I was given this chance because of your magic.`
` Because of that chance, I was able to make it here...!"`
`...Thank you.`
`But my magic wouldn't have been granted if we both didn't believe in each other.`
`So, it isn't just the power of my magic.`
`This is our victory.`
`Because of that, congratulations,`
` 'us'.`
`"Thank you, me...`
` Thank you, Ushiromiya Eva...`
` ...I'm glad I didn't give in before now.`
` I'm glad that I didn't drown in sorrow and forget to keep struggling...`
` ......No, this is my magic.`
` Our magic!`
` Your magic was the real thing.`
` Beatrice, the witch of the forest, is nothing more than an illusion.`
` You are the real witch, a wielder of real magic.`
` ...That's right.`
` Right now, you are the Golden Witch, Beatrice!!"`
`Eva decided to leave for the time being.`
`When she climbed the stairs again, trying to leave this secret place...`
`...She saw a creepy, swaying human shadow blocking her path, and her dreamlike state was blown away.`
`".........Who is it?!"`
`For an instant, ...she believed that the true master of this room, the real Beatrice, had appeared.`
`It seemed that the other person was also holding a gun.`
`The two of them were pointing guns at each other.`
`And eventually, they each realized who the other was...`
`"......Rosa......?"`
`"...Nee-san, `
`...what are you doing in a place like this...?"`
`"That's my line.`
` What business do you have in such a place?"`
`"...I shouldn't have given you that hint, Nee-san.`
` If I hadn't, I definitely would have been the first to reach this place.`
` ......Too bad."`
`It seemed that Rosa knew where this staircase went......`
`and what was waiting ahead of her.`
`"You should talk.`
` ......Even though I reached this place before you."`
`"......I worried too much about the sweetfish river.`
` The sweetfish part didn't really matter that much at all, did it?"`
`"That isn't true.`
` It was an excellent hint, wasn't it?`
` Well, of course, maybe there was no need for it to be sweetfish.`
` ...But when I heard that sweetfish are fish that go out into the sea, I was able to figure it out."`
`"...What's inside?"`
`"Why not see with your own eyes?`
` It definitely won't betray your expectations."`
`"......`
`...Don't be afraid, Nee-san.`
` I never had any interest in who becomes the Head.`
` I don't even care about the Ushiromiya family name.`
` ...Honestly, I actually feel good about you stealing the Headship from Krauss nii-san,`
` who was always swaggering around because of it."`
`"......Are you serious?"`
`"Of course.`
` I'm the outsider of the Ushiromiya siblings.`
` ...Even if Father had named me as the next Head,`
` there's no way Nii-san would accept it.`
` I try not to have such naive dreams."`
`"............"`
`"Let me see too, Nee-san.`
` This proof of your victory.`
` ...As long as I receive the proper portion that the siblings agreed upon,`
` I plan to proactively acknowledge you as the true victor in this 'game'."`
`"......If you shoot me, then you'll have this gold all to yourself, won't you?"`
`"The same goes for you.`
` If you shoot me, this gold will all be yours."`
`"............"`
`For a tense moment, the sisters pointed their guns at each other.`
`Eventually, after they sized up the glint in the other's eyes, they lowered their guns.`
`...Eva removed her finger from the trigger and held the gun upside-down.`
`It was a position that she couldn't quickly shoot from.`
`When she saw that, Rosa held hers the same way.`
`"...That's right.`
` That plan of shooting the other and having all the gold to ourselves is attractive for both of us.`
` ...But if one of us suddenly disappeared on this island while it's isolated by the typhoon, there would be a huge uproar.`
` ...If we hid the corpse here, it probably wouldn't be found easily, but we couldn't be sure."`
`"......No matter how many billion yen worth of gold is on the line,`
` it isn't worth the risk of committing murder.`
` On the contrary, that would give Krauss nii-san and the others ammunition to wring us for all we're worth."`
`"I agree.`
` ...It may have been a blessing in disguise that you're the one who showed up...`
`instead of Nii-san or Rudolf.`
` ...You're the sibling I trust most."`
`"......Thank you.`
` And you're the sibling I trust most, Nee-san."`
`"............"`
`"......I want to see the gold too."`
`"Wanna have a peek?`
` Now I feel like seeing it again too.`
` Even though I saw it with my own eyes, it still doesn't feel real.`
` ...Unless I see it together with you and confirm once more that it actually exists,`
` it feels like the gold will turn to fog and disappear."`
`Eva started descending the staircase once more.`
`...However, she didn't carelessly expose her back to Rosa.`
`Even though, at a glance, it looked like Rosa had lowered her guard, she definitely didn't show any signs of carelessness.`
`...Then, they reached that room of the witch once more.`
`Rosa also gasped, stunned speechless by the vast amount of gold...`
`...Rosa and Eva walked absentmindedly through the rose garden.`
`They had left the guesthouse secretly, so they had to be careful when they returned.`
`It was time to snap to it and keep their guards up.`
`"...Congratulations, Nee-san."`
`"Thank you."`
`"You decided it, didn't you Nee-san?`
` 50% goes to the one bearing the title of Successor to the Headship.`
` ...It certainly worked out well for you.`
` Now, that portion isn't Krauss nii-san's.`
` ...So your share is now 50%, along with a quarter of the rest, for a total of 12.5 billion yen."`
`"Isn't that incredible?`
` ...2.5 billion is enough for me.`
` Rudolf nii-san won't complain either.`
` Krauss nii-san will probably be the only one to complain."`
`"...Yeah, you're right.`
` ...After all, Nii-san is the de-facto manager of Rokkenjima.`
` And since the gold was on these premises, `
`even though I was the first to discover it, things might get complicated if I don't handle it cleverly."`
`"It won't get complicated.`
` Didn't we give it our all in that discussion last night with that in mind?"`
`"......I wonder if it will really go that smoothly.`
` I've already completely gotten over my excitement.`
` How we manage everything from here on is the real problem."`
`"...That's a problem for the new Head of the Ushiromiya family.`
` A problem for you to enjoy, Nee-san.`
` It has nothing to do with me."`
`"Heh, that's some big talk, coming from you..."`
`"...I'll support you as the second discoverer...`
`if you'll at least give me the early payment we decided on.`
` I'd like 150 million yen by March."`
`"Yes, that will be fine.`
` ...If you support me, I'll graciously pay you that much.`
` I'm not Nii-san."`
`"Anyway, why don't we go and shock Nii-san and the others?`
` Even if we cover up the actual location, I want to see Krauss nii-san's shocked face as soon as I can."`
`"......`
`......Wait a second, Rosa.`
` Wait a while before telling everyone about it."`
`".........Huh?`
` ...Why?"`
`"...You idiot, isn't it obvious?`
` ...This is that haughty Krauss nii-san and that sly Rudolf we're talking about.`
` Even if we do announce it eventually, it's certainly too early now."`
`"Unless we carefully investigate how to make our next move, `
`it's possible that all of the gold we've finally found will be snatched away by Nii-san."`
`Eva thought she was saying something extremely natural.`
`...So when she saw Rosa's expression suddenly cloud over, she was a little surprised.`
`"...What are you unsatisfied about?`
` You know what kind of a person Krauss nii-san is."`
`"......`
`Nee-san, that's against the rules."`
`"What do you mean?"`
`"...Didn't we make a rule that whoever found the gold would announce it immediately?`
` If you hesitate, the foundation of the rules will be destroyed, `
`and that could lead to something worse in the future.`
` ...With Krauss nii-san as crafty as he is, `
`that violation of the rules will come back to bite you."`
`"Don't be stupid.`
` This is Nii-san's island.`
` And that gold just now wasn't cash.`
` We're talking about the liquidation of a vast 10 ton mountain, right?"`
`"It will take a significant amount of time to carry it off and turn it into cash.`
` And that will only work in Nii-san's favor, since he has practical control over this island.`
` Don't you even realize that?!"`
`".........I don't like it when you search out each other's weaknesses like that.`
` All I want is to reach a clear decision regarding my 2.5 billion portion."`
`"Of course, if you were to give me 2.5 billion in cash right now, `
`you'd be free to continue negotiating however you like.`
` But until I have my share in my own pocket, I will follow the siblings' rules."`
`"How can you be so naive...?`
` You don't understand Nii-san's craftiness at all!"`
`...It wasn't that Rosa didn't understand the craftiness of her older siblings.`
`In that sense, Rosa more or less understood why Eva was being so cautious.`
`But in her heart, `
`she couldn't clear away her suspicion that Eva wanted to keep all of the gold to herself.`
`...Because she knew that Eva was at least as crafty as her other siblings.`
`In other words, Rosa wanted to put a stop to any chance Eva had to keep the gold all to herself...`
`by quickly informing the siblings of the gold's discovery...`
`"......`
`...Rosa,`
` sorry, but at least listen to me this once."`
`"......Are you saying that if I don't listen to what you say, you won't be able to get me that 150 million?"`
`"......`
`...That isn't the way I wanted to say it.`
` ...But if you really need that money, supporting me is a more realistic option.`
` ...If you talk to Nii-san and Rudolf, even the portion that's your natural right might disappear.`
` You don't want that, do you?"`
`"............"`
`For a while, a severe expression that she'd never shown to her sister before rose to Rosa's face.`
`There wasn't even a trace of her restraint as a younger sister.`
`...There was just the ruthlessness...`
`no, the seriousness of a single human arguing about a vast sum of wealth.`
`Eva made light of it, chuckling.`
`"...My, my.`
` How careless we must be to stand around here talking like this,`
` even though a frightful murder case has just taken place, and the culprit might still be on this island."`
`"I'm sure it was just the servants playacting.`
` There were no murders on this island in the first place."`
`"...Oh?`
` So, you do think that after all."`
`"The circumstances surrounding those six deaths shows us that clearly.`
` A crime from the outside couldn't possibly have created those six closed rooms."`
`"...Doctor Nanjo said they were all dead, but that was a lie too.`
` This is all a complicated act that Father cooked up.`
` All of the servants are just playing dead.`
` ...A murder never occurred in the first place.`
` There's no way that there's a murderer prowling around."`
`"...Hah.`
` I'm surprised you noticed.`
` You looked pretty scared, so I didn't think you'd figured out so much."`
`"...I'm good at reading the mood of a situation.`
` I've got you to thank for training me so well."`
`That's right.`
` Come to think of it, now that the servants are 'dead', almost everyone on this island is a member of the Ushiromiya family.`
`As for Nanjo, he proclaimed the 'deaths' of the servants,`
` but when the relatives began to discuss the riddle of the epitaph, he disappeared off to the second floor as if he didn't want to get in the way...`
`"All of it...`
`was an act to get us to try and solve that epitaph.`
` ...And that's why...`
`you need to announce that you're the victor, Nee-san."`
`"There's no way that burnt corpse was really Father.`
` ...He got a corpse with the right number of toes from somewhere...and went to all the trouble of burning it in that creepy way of his, so we would see it."`
`"...I'm sure he's hiding somewhere, watching to see how we'll behave.`
` ...I'll bet he already knows you reached the Golden Land, Nee-san."`
`"...That's why you should announce that you're the winner soon.`
` I'm sure Father will appear out of nowhere to applaud you and proclaim that you're his successor."`
`"............`
`............"`
`"...Then again,`
` ...I've still got to pester you for that 150 million, `
`so I can't stand against you in any way."`
`"......So you'll listen to what I say...and keep quiet about this to Nii-san and the rest...?"`
`"............"`
`"...Make your position clear,`
` ...Rosa."`
`"......I want to tell them.`
` We made that rule just last night.`
` We shouldn't just throw it away."`
`"Of course, I will announce it in front of the siblings.`
` ...However, I want to closely analyze the situation first.`
` We've got to carry out 10 tons of gold, convert it into money,`
` and distribute it fairly."`
`"...Until I have proof that I can do all that without Nii-san getting in the way, I want some time to think.`
` I only want to postpone my announcement until then.`
` ......I'm certainly not keeping it secret because I want it all for myself."`
`"......`
`...You'll definitely announce it to everyone sooner or later, right?"`
`"...Yes, of course.`
` Even I want to rub it in Nii-san's face as soon as I can."`
`"......About how much time will you need to think?"`
`"I won't know that until I've thought about it."`
`"......Will one night be enough?"`
`"I can't promise you that it'll take only one night...!"`
`"Out of respect for you, the Successor, I'll support you for one night.`
` ...This year's family conference will end tomorrow morning, when the typhoon passes and a boat comes to get us.`
` ...That's right, when the seagulls cry.`
` ...I will remain silent until then."`
`"If you still feel that you need more time to think after that, ...then we'll cross that bridge when we get there, okay?`
` ......I'll support your position `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~to the best of my ability~ib~."`
`"............`
`...You...really are cunning, aren't you?`
` ...I'm surprised.`
` Were you always this resilient?"`
`"...I guess it's true that women become stronger when they have a child.`
` I realized that in myself when I had Maria."`
`"......`
`Understood.`
` For the time being, thanks for your cooperation.`
` ...We can talk about tomorrow when it comes."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ...I'm convinced that you'll become a fair-minded successor to the Headship, one who'd never even consider taking all of the gold for herself."`
`"...Isn't that obvious?!`
` ...I will split the gold evenly among the siblings."`
`No way.`
` I found it.`
`Because I...because we solved the riddle of the epitaph!`
`So this gold is all mine...!!`
`"I won't give it up to anyone!`
` I am the Head of the Ushiromiya family!`
` I am, 'I' am!!"`
`The witch inside Eva claimed exclusive possession in a loud voice.`
`...Of course, that didn't reach even close to Rosa's ears, and it probably didn't reach Eva's either.`
`"...Indeed.`
` I shall acknowledge it.`
` You are the true Head of the Ushiromiya family, chosen by the witch's epitaph.`
` Now, I acknowledge it upon my name."`
`'!s1`
`You are......?`
` That outfit...`
` You couldn't...`
`actually be...`
`Beatrice...?"`
`Maybe Beatrice was happy that Eva had called her by her own name.`
`She cackled cheerfully.`
`In concert with that laugh, gold butterflies crept up as though a storm of gold dust was spinning around the room, `
`and the room shone the color of gold...`
`"Indeed.`
` I am the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
` ...*cackle*cackle* There is no need to be so frightened.`
` I am praising your exploits.`
` ...Truly excellent.`
` Imagine that you would spectacularly solve that riddle of the epitaph...`
` It is worthy of my admiration...!"`
`"...You're the one who sent that letter?`
` So, I'll inherit all of the gold and the Ushiromiya Family Headship, right...?`
` You wrote that in your letter.`
` And I overcame that challenge...!"`
`"Indeed.`
` I shall acknowledge it.`
` Right now, all of the gold piled up here...and everything of the Ushiromiya family...is for you to do with as you please.`
` After all, from this moment on, you are already the Ushiromiya Family Head."`
`"...R-Really?`
` It's true, right?`
` Right?!"`
`"Do not be agitated.`
` I am openly praising you.`
` As proof, I shall grant you this."`
`Beatrice took a ring off of her own finger...`
`and held it out to Eva.`
`She fearfully accepted it...`
`...and realized that it was a ring.`
`'!s1`
`Could......`
`this be......"`
`"Indeed.`
` This Golden Ring is proof of the Ushiromiya Family Headship, returned to me from Kinzo.`
` From now on, it is yours.`
` You may place it on your finger and hold it high before your siblings.`
` No one should doubt that you have now succeeded the Ushiromiya Family Headship."`
`Eva stared closely at the ring.`
`...It certainly wasn't a fake.`
`...Without a doubt, it was the real thing.`
`She'd dreamed of receiving this ring someday, `
`focused on this day over and over again, and it was now finally a certainty.`
`'!s0`
`had now designated her as the Head...`
`and had been handed over to her...`
`'!s0`
`timidly, `
`...she put it on the middle finger of her left hand...`
`In that instant, ...she felt a deep emotion welling up inside her that she'd never felt before.`
`Her mind grew blank.`
`Both eyes were opened.`
`That ring...was on her own finger.`
`Not in a dream, but in reality......!`
`"That ring is also pleased.`
` After all, it managed to reach you, one who dreamed of putting it on their finger for so long."`
`"...The ring...`
` ...Father's...`
`...ring......!"`
`"How many nights have you dreamed of putting that on your finger as you have done now?`
` ...The strength of those feelings became your magic and materialized itself.`
` Now, you are worthy of calling yourself a Great Witch."`
`"......W-Who are you?`
` ...Are you really...Beatrice...?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` I am the Golden Witch, Beatrice!`
` The Ushiromiya family alchemist!`
` In accordance with my contract with Kinzo, I will now pass everything on to you.`
` ...All of the gold I entrusted Kinzo with.`
` And all of the wealth he built up through that.`
` And the honor and Headship of the Ushiromiya family.`
` And, I will pass on my power and the title of the Endless Witch."`
`"...The title...`
`of the witch..."`
`"I will pass on all of my magical power...and the titles of the Golden Witch and the Endless Witch.`
` ...Following my Predecessor's example, I will hand over my name, Beatrice, along with that title.`
` ...You may now call yourself by that name!"`
`Eva gulped.`
`The chandelier light, which had seemed dim, now felt too bright.`
`"By my name, I shall now commence the succession of the Golden Witch...!"`
`The instant Beatrice made that proclamation, everything was buried by a golden sparkle...`
`and changed into a majestic place that looked like an audience hall.`
`In the audience hall, there was a crowd of Beatrice's minions and brethren, `
`as well as countless gold butterflies celebrating this first succession ceremony in a thousand years.`
`When she looked, she saw Beatrice in the throne that only the Endless Witch was permitted to sit in, holding a golden staff, `
`reigning with a dazzling dignity.`
`Without being ordered by anyone, Eva automatically kneeled, hanging her head...`
`A goat attendant respectfully handed Beatrice a golden staff in the shape of the One-Winged Eagle.`
`After Beatrice stood up and received that staff, `
`she lay the tip of it on Eva's shoulder and spoke.`
` It was a proclamation one thousand years in coming.`
`"Ushiromiya Eva.`
` You have spectacularly solved the riddle of the witch's epitaph and reached the Golden Land.`
` ...I praise that accomplishment...`
`and hand over all of the Endless Magic as well as the titles of the Golden Witch and the Endless Witch."`
`"From this point forth, you may call yourself by my name, `
`Beatrice...!`
` Come, raise your face.`
` Then stand and accept this staff...!"`
`"...I-I am most grateful..."`
`Eva stood up dizzily and took the magic staff from Beatrice's hand.`
` Her hand was trembling slightly.`
`As soon as she grasped that staff, `
`...she was wrapped up in the brilliant sparkle of gold.`
`As though gold butterflies were flowing out from inside of her.`
`In the instant she succeeded the Golden Witch, Eva felt something in the depths of her soul be reborn.`
`To describe it in a word, it was energy.`
`Energy with a gold color.`
`It felt like she was waking up, `
`...as though she had been half asleep ever since she had been born and was opening her eyes for the first time.`
`It felt as though her true eyes inside her eyes were opened for the first time in her life.`
`"......Indeed.`
` A fitting and beautiful outfit for the Golden Witch.`
` Come, you may show yourself to all of these people.`
` Let them know that the new witch is indeed you...!"`
`Eva...no, the new Beatrice turned around timidly.`
`When she did, the witch's minions, which filled the vast audience hall,`
` honored her with an applause that sounded like the roaring of the sea...`
`"Come, everyone.`
` Replace all of the portraits of Beatrice with the new Beatrice!`
` Lift up words of celebration for the new Beatrice...!!"`
`"New Beatrice,`
` congratulations on the succession of the Golden Witch.`
` ...I hope that you will become able to stand on your own as a proud Golden Witch, and as the Endless Witch."`
`"...Y-Yes, ...I will do my best..."`
`"I expect a composure befitting the Endless Witch from you, unlike your naughty predecessor.`
` Hohohohohoho."`
`"Teacheer, we're in the middle of a serious ceremony, so please, enough of that."`
`"Congratulations on the succession of the Golden Witch,`
` new Beatrice-sama.`
` ...I am called Ronove.`
` I am one of the 72 demons permitted to serve the Golden Witch."`
`"If you are ever inconvenienced in the slightest, `
`please let me know at once."`
`"...Th-Thank you..."`
`"Ronove is rude, but reliable.`
` If anything confuses you in your new days as a witch, speak to this man, and he should be able to help you."`
`"......Predecessor Beatrice-sama,`
` it is a shame that I was not permitted to serve you further, even though we have finally been reunited like this.`
` ...These last thousand years have been very entertaining for me.`
` You have my deepest gratitude."`
`"Indeed.`
` ...One thousand years with you wasn't boring.`
` ...Please, take care of the new witch."`
`"Yes.`
` I, Ronove,`
` ...will obey the final order `
`of the former Beatrice."`
`"You'd better thank me, okay?`
` I gave my signature to recommend you for the succession of the witch, got it?`
` In other words, if I hadn't signed, you wouldn't have been able to become a witch.`
` So thank me a little, okay?!"`
`"This is the Witch of Certainty, Lady Lambdadelta.`
` The recommendation of a witch from the senate was required for your succession as an Endless Witch.`
` Lady Lambdadelta recommended you and became your guardian."`
`"...Th-Thank you..."`
`"...Heeey, Beatooo!`
` This kid isn't grateful enough!`
` I think I'll take back that recommendation!"`
`"A person making these recommendations shouldn't act like a child, right?`
` If you've signed, make sure you take responsibility."`
`"Lady Lambdadelta is also the Witch of Certainty.`
` ...The Witch of Certainty prefers to make fate firm, to create a fate of Certainty.`
` She really liked and highly valued your efforts until today."`
`"Well, you had that unfortunate childhood, all that unrewarded effort... I can sympathize juuust a bit with that.`
` It's not like I felt sorry for you or anything, so don't be so full of yourself!`
` Tsu-n!"`
`"...From my point of view, your succession...well, it was more of a coincidence than a miracle.`
` It isn't worthy of my recommendation."`
`"*cackle*`
` This is Lady Bernkastel.`
` She's quite hard to please.`
` Still, you could say that just having her participate in this celebration makes you exceedingly lucky."`
`"......I only came because this is a rare, once-in-a-millennium event.`
` And I heard there'd be some good sake."`
`"New Beatrice-sama,`
` please, come greet us as well."`
`"Huh? ...Oh, ...I'm pleased to meet you..."`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory were gathered in a line.`
`The eldest sister, Lucifer, took a step forward and kneeled.`
`"This is furniture that serves me.`
` As a gift to celebrate your inheritance, I will send them to you.`
` ...Once you succeed the position of Golden Witch, you will need to carry out the resurrection ceremony for yourself.`
` The Seven Sisters of Purgatory perform an essential role in that ceremony.`
` ...They're a villainous bunch, but they serve their purpose.`
` Have them do whatever you wish."`
`"We will always be by Beatrice-sama's side.`
` Please order us to do anything you desire.`
` We'll accomplish our tasks without fail...!"`
`Even after that, many nobles and minions visited and offered words of congratulation for the new witch.`
`As she responded to them confusedly,`
` she felt as though she was growing light-headed due to lack of oxygen.`
`...She couldn't tell if this was something real or unreal.`
`But there was just one thing she could understand.`
`A feeling of achievement at being permitted to call herself the Golden Witch.`
`...That alone was a truth she could definitely understand...`
`"......What...is all this?`
` Of course, I'm not gonna swallow this story, ...but what in the world does it mean?!`
` Aunt Eva is the new Beatrice?`
` Are you saying she's turned into a witch?`
` ...What the hell...?!!"`
`"I was also surprised.`
` To think that someone would be able to solve that riddle.`
` ...However, that is the rule.`
` I must follow it...and pass on the position of Golden Witch and my name."`
`"It is hardly something to be surprised about.`
` At the very beginning, you wrote that rule in a letter and announced it.`
` ...Eva-sama was simply the first to be successful.`
` That is all there is to say."`
`"...Virgilia, are you there?!"`
`"Yes, here I am..."`
`"What does this farce mean?!`
` Even if this depiction of strange witches showing up one after another is some of her bullshit...!`
` ...Isn't this almost like Aunt Eva turned into a witch?!"`
`"Calm yourself.`
` She has simply received the title of 'Endless Witch'...and might call herself that in the future.`
` ...This succession ceremony is certainly nothing more than an act to promote that child's 'explanation'.`
` Don't fall for the same move over and over again."`
`"Th-That's right...`
` That whole grand ceremony was all phony.`
` But it's at least a fact that Aunt Eva solved the riddle of the epitaph.`
` ...And at the same time, that means she succeeded the Ushiromiya Family Headship."`
`"...And after getting 10 tons of gold, `
`...Aunt Eva might as well call herself the 'Golden Witch'... ...Is that it...?`
` Damn, it's as complicated as ever...!!"`
`"...My, my.`
` Is a boorish Human unable to comprehend the grandeur of this ceremony?`
` ...Oh, well.`
` Being unable to read between the lines is what makes you Human.`
` I pity you, but I do not blame you."`
`"Damn it...`
` Don't look at me like you feel sorry for me...`
` ......Still, for the time being, there's something I need to check."`
`"And that's regarding this younger version of Aunt Eva...`
`in other words, the definition of this new Beatrice.`
` ...What is that?!"`
`"Even if I tell of it, you will just persist in your disbelief in magic and witches, correct?`
` So there's nothing in particular for me to explain.`
` Feel free to believe in whatever it seems to be to you."`
`"...What it seems to be to me...?!`
` Then...then how should I interpret this...?!"`
`"For now, it might not hurt to view it as a visualization of a separate entity inside Ushiromiya Eva."`
`"...Of course, you cannot blindly accept that answer, but it is probably a reasonable theory to hold for the time being."`
`"......I-In other words, I should think of Aunt Eva and her as the same person, right?`
` ...Damn, ...I don't like where this is going..."`
`"In any case, from now on, my name is no longer Beatrice.`
` I have passed it on to Ushiromiya Eva.`
` ...Which means that I am nameless!`
` Battleer, don't you have some name that'd be fitting for me?`
` I shall accept your recommendation!`
` How about a name that's refined, full of elegance, and a little cute too, if you can...!"`
`"...Just 'Beato' is good enough for you.`
` There's probably a big enough difference between Beato and Beatrice to keep people from getting confused."`
`"...N-Nngg.`
` So, the same old Beato, is it?`
` It doesn't feel wrong, but it's boring for some reason.`
` Nggg."`
`"Pu ku ku ku ku...`
` They say the temperature of black tea and a woman's heart are difficult to gauge in any era."`
`"......Battler-kun,`
` at any rate, stay calm from this point onwards.`
` The fact that we can now tell her and Ushiromiya Eva apart works to our advantage, `
`compared to the time when that child was still Beatrice."`
`"...And that's exactly...`
`...why I like it even less.`
` ...What's she thinking,`
` that Beato......?"`
`Over there, the witches formed a long line to bless Aunt Eva,`
` who had the figure of her younger days and who now possessed the name Beatrice.`
`It was like a witch's coronation.`
`The countless gold butterflies flapped their wings, directing this fantastical, gold-sparkling space.`
`They were all praising her.`
`As I stared from the distance, `
`I looked at the newly born Beatrice, who had a slightly embarrassed smile on her face.`
`...Her expression, which had been lost and confused at first,`
` seemed to be full of the happiness that she was finally starting to recognize.`
`That expression didn't look at all like someone laughing insanely while standing before the gold.`
`There was just the innocence of a person basking in their own joy.`
`As a person who denied the existence of witches, I couldn't view this witch succession ceremony with a joyful expression and accept her...`
`...However, when I looked at that innocent smile, `
`I felt like I wanted to offer my blessings, just for that moment.`
`It's always beautiful when strong efforts bear fruits and are rewarded.`
`Aunt Eva, who had always yearned to succeed the Headship, and who had worked hard since her youth without reward,`
` ...had spectacularly taken hold of the chance given to her by the riddle of the epitaph...and had finally gained that position.`
`How divine is the smile of a person whose childhood dreams have been granted?`
`I definitely won't accept witches.`
`But, ...Battler put his hands together, making a small sound.`
`*clap*. *clap*.`
`...It didn't reach her ears, ...but it did bless her.`
`"......Congratulations, Aunt Eva."`
`You spectacularly solved the riddle of the epitaph before anyone else.`
` It's your victory without any complaints.`
`......I won't accept all that about the Golden Witch and so on, but I will accept you as the new Head of the Ushiromiya family, and I'll celebrate that sincerely.`
`"......Hmph."`
`As though urged on by Battler's applause, Beato also clapped.`
`...It was a slightly odd scene.`
`Battler and Beato, who opposed each other, were standing side by side and applauding the same person.`
`"I'm not applauding for a witch.`
` ...I'm clapping for all of Aunt Eva's efforts up until now."`
`"As am I.`
` I offer my sincere applause as a blessing to Eva, who spectacularly solved that epitaph."`
`"......Hmm.`
` ...I don't like applauding with you.`
` ...But, well, I've decided that I won't worry about it now.`
` ...Divine punishment won't fall on me just because I clap with you every once in a while."`
`"Hmm.`
` It's not so bad every once in a while.`
` ...Still, it is fun to applaud.`
` Even though it was Eva who was successful and not me, for some reason, I'm starting to feel happy too."`
`"That's because blessing someone means the same thing as sympathizing and sharing with them."`
`"I see.`
` Then, I have even shared this irrational happy feeling with you.`
` ...Since we are a pair of enemies trying to make each other surrender, it is an odd experience."`
`"Well, ...just for now, let's have a truce and clap, okay?"`
`Beato laughed impishly, playing around and applauding even louder,`
` as though eagerly trying not to lose to Battler as she clapped.`
`Battler went along with her and clapped even louder.`
`When he did, as though some ceremony had ended, everyone applauded and highly praised the reborn Beatrice.`
`It was just as though Battler's and Beato's applause had been the final thing needed for her succession...`
`Rosa returned to the lobby.`
`It was still her turn to rest,`
` but her expression made it look as though she couldn't sleep deeply with all this tension.`
`"...Take it easy and lie down.`
` Keep this up and you'll have it pretty rough later on."`
`"Thanks for the concern.`
` I just couldn't fall asleep.`
` ...I've already taken a shower, so I'm good for now.`
` The next person can rest."`
`"What about you two, Kyrie-san? Rudolf-san?"`
`"...What will we do, Rudolf-san?`
` Shall we rest?"`
`"You can rest.`
` I'll stay awake.`
` That's the only manly thing I can do right now."`
`"Then I'll stay awake.`
` Staying awake with my husband is the only womanly thing I can do right now."`
`"...*giggle*`
` You two truly are close."`
`"You should talk.`
` *giggle*."`
`"It seems Eva and Hideyoshi-san are out cold.`
` It appears that, unlike Rosa, they can't fight against their age."`
`As though in response to those words, the door to the hall clunked open.`
`Eva and Hideyoshi returned from the guest room.`
`"That's none of your business.`
` ...Oh, Rosa, are you sure you don't need to rest yet?"`
`"You should talk, Nee-san.`
` Why not take it easy and sleep?"`
`"......I just can't get to sleep.`
` Taking a shower shook my drowsiness off.`
` Rudolf, Kyrie-san, you can rest if you want."`
`"Sure, thanks.`
` Well, for now, let's say I appreciate the sentiment.`
` Why don't you go first, Aniki?"`
`"How kind of you.`
` But I cannot rest first.`
` That is the most I can do as the oldest brother right now."`
`"Do not worry, the two of us will stay awake until the very end."`
`"...*giggle*`
` ......More importantly, Eva nee-san,`
` are you okay?`
` You look a little pale."`
`"...Come to think of it, you're right.`
` ...Hmmm?`
` Could it be a bit of a fever?"`
`Hideyoshi put his hand up against Eva's forehead.`
`...It seemed that Eva wasn't feeling her best.`
`"That goes without saying.`
` ...That's what happens you break your sleep cycle at your age.`
` ...Is it a cold?"`
`"...Natsuhi,`
` could you call Doctor Nanjo down?"`
`"Y-Yes."`
`"...I'm fine, you don't have to make such a fuss over it.`
` I have some medicine, so I'll be okay.`
` ...I tend to get fevers when I'm tired.`
` Don't worry."`
`"...Nee-san, take it easy, okay?"`
`"......Thank you.`
` ...If the siblings gathered without me around, I get the feeling everyone would start talking behind my back.`
` ...It's a persecution complex from long ago.`
` Sorry, okay?"`
`"......Well, I won't say anything.`
` As if I'd say bad things about you behind your back, Nee-san."`
`"............"`
`"...What is it?`
` Nee-san, you've been acting strange for a while.`
` Shouldn't you get a little rest now?"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"......You're right.`
` Just thinking about `
`~ib~raising money by March~ib~`
` makes my headache hurt even worse."`
`"That isn't good.`
` Rest.`
` ...And I'll hold back too, so that your headache doesn't get worse.`
` I've had a bad headache myself for a while now."`
`"......Thank you.`
` ...Well then, I'll take those words to heart and rest for a while."`
`"What is it, Eva?`
` Why so angry all of a sudden?`
` ...Sorry, please let us rest a bit longer.`
` Sorry, sorry..."`
`After apologizing several times as though praying, `
`Hideyoshi followed Eva out of the lobby.`
`"......I don't like this atmosphere.`
` It's all so strained."`
`"That's no surprise.`
` ...There was a murder early this morning.`
` And since then, we've been eating canned food and carrying guns around.`
` ...It's natural that we'd start to build up stress."`
`"I wonder if the kids up there are building up stress too.`
` ...I'm worried about Maria.`
` She tends to throw tantrums at times like this."`
`At that moment, they heard the sound of wild footsteps coming from the second floor.`
`The guesthouse wasn't a cheap building, so they wouldn't normally have heard the sound of footsteps.`
`It was like the sound of someone stamping their feet in frustration.`
`And an instant later, accompanied by what seemed to be the sound of her running out into the second floor hallway, `
`they could hear Maria calling uu-uu-uu- over and over again, sounding displeased.`
`Rosa grabbed her head, her hair flying, and she voicelessly moaned in anguish...`
`The adults conscientiously turned their backs to her, pretending not to notice.`
`The noisy clamor came down from the second floor and flew into the lobby.`
`It was Maria, who was sobbing, along with the other children and Nanjo.`
`...In other words, they had all come downstairs because of Maria's tantrum.`
`Rosa couldn't hide her dizziness at this new annoyance her daughter was bringing to everyone...`
`"S-Sorry, Aunt Rosa...`
` We tried to calm her, but she just wouldn't listen..."`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"...What is it, Maria?`
` Could you be a little more quiet?`
` Everyone's watching."`
`"It's that rose of hers from the rose garden...`
` She suddenly started saying that she was worried about it."`
`"...I think she's half asleep.`
` She suddenly woke up and started going on about how worried she was about that rose.`
` ......Maria-chan, calm down.`
` That was just a dream..."`
`"Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!`
` That rose belonged to Beatrice and me!!`
` So if I don't take care of it, Beatrice is gonna get mad!!`
` It might get snapped off again!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`'!s0`
`@:dwave_eng 0, ros_3e383:`
`The sudden rise in the tone of Rosa's voice surprised the children.`
`But Maria's crying just grew louder, and her tantrum just grew fiercer.`
`"R-Rosa-san,`
` you mustn't scold a child so unsparingly...`
` ...At times like this, it's best to give them some warm milk or something."`
`"...Is there any here?"`
`"The milk we just had for breakfast is empty now..."`
`"Doesn't anyone have a sedative to use on kids...?`
` You know, those silver pill things?"`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, ros_3e385:`
`Without hiding her displeasure, Rosa grabbed the handbag that had been set on the sofa and fished around for some medicine.`
` ...It seemed she had brought some child-use sedatives for Maria's tantrums.`
`She found it and opened the bottle, but it must have been empty.`
`Irritated, Rosa shook the bottle several times, but that didn't change the fact that nothing was in there.`
`...As she did that, Maria's crying grew even more intense...`
`At that time, Eva was lying on her bed, covered by the bedding.`
`Hideyoshi returned from the washroom, folding a handkerchief soaked in water.`
`"...Whoo, this is one nasty fever...`
` ...I'll bet it's the poisonous air at this family conference that got you...`
`...For now, you can forget all about the other relatives.`
` ...Okay?"`
`As Hideyoshi spoke to her kindly, he set the soaked handkerchief on Eva's burning forehead.`
`Eva rested her own hand on top of his.`
`"......Your hand...`
`feels nice and cool."`
`"If my hand feels nice, your fever must be pretty bad.`
` Don't worry, the medicine'll start workin' soon.`
` Plus, my hand is a magic hand.`
` I just put it against your forehead like this, `
`and any fever'll melt right away."`
`"You're right.`
` ...Your hand always makes my fevers fade..."`
`"Yep.`
` No need for a doctor when you've got my hand.`
` Don't worry and close your eyes.`
` ...My magic'll make that fever fade away..."`
`"Yes, I know...`
` ...I can feel your magic."`
`Hideyoshi was about to say it was just a placebo effect, but he stopped.`
`...If Eva said she could feel magic coming from his hand, then that was fine for now...`
`"......I wonder if magic really exists."`
`"Yeah.`
` It does.`
` Only those who believe can tell, though.`
` ...There's actually a lot of magic like that out there in the world."`
`"...If magic actually exists, ...then I wonder if witches actually exist too."`
`"Oh?`
` You mean that witch of the forest, Beatrice?`
` She probably does exist for those who believe.`
` Just like the gods.`
` They don't show themselves except in front of those with strong faith."`
`"......I did it too, you know?`
` ...Long ago, I was able to use magic."`
`"Oh?`
` Really?`
` Then you were a witch too."`
`"...I...had dreams that I wanted to come true no matter what.`
` After wishing strongly and trying hard, they always came true without fail.`
` ...With my magic, my grades were always the best, and I even became the student council president...and worked hard to get into the university I wanted.`
` ...Everything I wished for was granted."`
`"That's right.`
` Your magic was always a thing to be reckoned with...`
` You're definitely a witch.`
` ...And you work harder than anyone.`
` ...I know all about it."`
`"......When...`
`I was a kid, the whole time, there was another me inside myself, who always supported me.`
` ...And that other self was a witch."`
`"......I didn't believe in Beatrice, the witch of the forest.`
` I always believed that if a witch of Rokkenjima did exist, it was the witch inside my heart.`
` ......I was so grateful to that witch inside myself.`
` ...I was always grateful...that she brought me to you..."`
`"......You get too timid when you're sick.`
` ...Don't say anythin' for now.`
` ...I'll stay like this the whole time, until your fever's gone down."`
`"...Yes.`
`'!s1`
`no matter what.`
` ......Somehow,`
` ...I feel like I'm becoming something that isn't myself,`
` ...and I've been scared for a while now.`
` ...I get the feeling that the witch inside me...`
`was provoked by Beatrice...and is growing stronger and stronger.`
` ...Somehow, it feels like she's going to swallow me whole."`
`"It's okay.`
` As long as I'm with you, there's nooothin' to be afraid of!`
` Remember the time we went to that dangerous country and the whole bus got robbed?`
` I drove 'em off!"`
`"...Didn't you just hand over your gold watch and beg them to go away?`
` ...It was pretty lame, ...but it was cool..."`
`"......Don't move your hand away...`
`no matter what...`
` ...Not even if I fall asleep.`
` ...And if something creepy sneaks in here, `
`...protect me..."`
`"Yep, leave it to me.`
` ...That's why I'm tellin' you to stop worryin' and get to sleep.`
` Because the medicine and my magic'll start workin' real soon..."`
`Eva finally calmed her heart and closed her eyes.`
`...At that time, there was the sound of a door being opened violently from the direction of the lobby.`
`It seemed that Maria was having a tantrum, `
`and screams of uu-uu- could be heard, along with Rosa's rebuking yells.`
`...That probably hurt Eva's ears.`
`Or maybe it was giving her a headache.`
`Eva moaned as though in pain and buried herself in the covers.`
`It was easy to guess what was happening.`
`Maria had probably had a tantrum for some reason, gone down to the lobby,`
` and started arguing with Rosa, who then scolded her daughter.`
`...And then, maybe that got too embarrassing to be shown in front of the other relatives, so Rosa had taken Maria out into the corridor.`
`...Hideyoshi had no desire to butt in on Rosa and Maria's problem.`
`...But just for now, since Eva's condition was so bad, he wanted them to take their ruckus somewhere else.`
`"...Wait just a sec.`
` I'll ask them to keep it down."`
`"......C-Come back quickly..."`
`"Don't worry, I won't leave this room."`
`Hideyoshi removed the chain, opened the door, and stuck his face out into the corridor.`
` He immediately met Rosa's gaze.`
`"...Everythin' okay, Rosa-san?"`
`"I'm sorry, did all this noise wake you...?"`
`'!s0`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"...Maria-chan, sorry.`
` Aunt Eva isn't feelin' well, and she's tryin' to sleep.`
` Could you quiet down a bit...?"`
`Maria's tone didn't change after Hideyoshi's request.`
`Rosa slapped Maria's cheek, lifted her up while covering her mouth,`
` and dragged her towards the entrance, trying to at least put some distance between her and Hideyoshi's room.`
`...She would still probably be noisy for a while, but he had warned Rosa for the time being.`
`Relying on Rosa's actions as a mother, Hideyoshi closed the door.`
`"......Is Maria-chan having a tantrum again?"`
`"Looks like it.`
` ...It's tough for Rosa-san too.`
` ...Come to think of it, our George is almost too good to be true.`
` We should be grateful."`
`"......You're right.`
` ......Nng, `
`...hand."`
`"Oh, sorry, sorry.`
` ...Look, it's the magic hand."`
`He put his hand on Eva's forehead again.`
`...Maybe there really was magical power in that hand.`
`A truly peaceful look rose to Eva's face, and bit by bit, she began to drift off into the land of sleep.`
`As he had promised, Hideyoshi kept his hand on her forehead...`
`By the entrance, with her hand still against Maria's mouth, Rosa was at a loss at what to do next.`
`She hadn't been able to withstand everyone's gazes in the lobby,`
` and had yelled at the children to go upstairs, dashing out of the lobby.`
`Then, she had gone out into the corridor, only to have Hideyoshi say that she was too noisy.`
`Where should I go now?`
`...Where should I take this child who's having a tantrum?`
`She felt as though tears of frustration were about to come out...`
`As Maria kept struggling in an attempt to scream, Rosa put her mouth up to Maria's ear...`
`and tried to persuade Maria in a properly calm voice.`
`"......Maria, do you really want to see the rose that much...?"`
`Maria nodded her head several times, moaning uu-uu-.`
`"...Why do you want to see it so much?`
` I'll listen as your mother, so will you tell me quietly?`
` I'll hit you if you scream."`
`"......My rose...`
` Beatrice revived it.`
` ...It might have snapped off again...`
` ...I'm worried about that...`
` I can't sleep until I'm sure..."`
`Apparently, she was still upset about that marked rose from yesterday.`
`Rosa felt her headache throbbing again,`
` but she was at least a little relieved that Maria had now stopped her screaming.`
`"Anyway, everyone is having a hard time right now.`
` So don't bother Mama and everyone else.`
` ...You can worry about that rose all you want tomorrow, when it stops raining.`
` So for now, listen to me...!"`
`"No.`
` ...No no no no.`
` It's my Beatrice's rose...`
`...uuuu, ...uu-uu-.`
` Waaaaaaaaaaahh!!"`
`Rosa reflexively covered Maria's mouth.`
`She had spoken a little too harshly and gotten her agitated again...`
`Rosa realized that it was partly her own fault and clicked her tongue in self-hatred.`
`But Maria thought that was directed at her, and her crying grew even fiercer...`
`"...Please, just be quiet...`
` What can I do to make you stop crying?`
` What should I do to make you listen to what your Mama says?"`
`"......"`
`Suddenly.`
` Maria stopped crying so fast that it seemed unnatural.`
`...Then she turned around...and muttered.`
`"......`
`If I get to see my rose, I'll stay quiet until tomorrow."`
`"Really?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...If we go to the rose garden and see my rose, I'll calm down."`
`"........."`
`"I mean it, Mama."`
`"............"`
`If it would keep Maria quiet for the time being, Rosa thought that even going out into this wind and rain would be a small price to pay.`
`She thought it might be a bit reckless.`
`......But in the end, no murder or anything of the sort had actually occurred.`
`All of that clamor since this morning had been a farce set up by Kinzo.`
`If you carefully thought about that chain of closed rooms, it clearly had to all be an act...`
`"...Will you really listen if you get to see the rose?"`
`"Yes.`
` I mean it, Mama.`
` ...Kihihi."`
`"............"`
`"Ouch."`
`Rosa didn't overlook that creepy laugh, and lightly hit Maria with her fist.`
`And she shrugged, as though giving up.`
`"...Understood.`
` If it's just one look, then I'll agree.`
` Will that work?"`
`"Yes, Mama.`
` I promise.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi."`
`Once again, Rosa tested the weight of her gun.`
`...It'll be okay.`
` It's only an act.`
`There was never a murderer on this island in the first place...`
`"Damn it, wait, Aunt Rosa...!!`
` Are Aunt Rosa and Maria...the sacrifices for the second twilight?!`
` Damn it, damn it, damn it, someone, notice them, tell them to stop!!`
` What are those guys in the living room and us kids doing?!!"`
`"Indeed.`
` They are being considerate of Rosa's pitiful relationship with her daughter...and are forcibly changing the subject.`
` The group that includes you went up to the second floor...and is talking about something else while watching TV."`
`"You bastards!!`
` Someone, notice them!`
` Who's the closest, is it Uncle Hideyoshi?!`
` Please, notice that those two are leaving through the front door, aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"It won't reach, it won't reach, *cackle*!`
` Don't disturb their precious time together.`
` Fuhahahahahahaha...!"`
`Hideyoshi kept talking kindly, his hand on Eva's forehead.`
`He didn't notice at all that Rosa and Maria were going outside through the front door.`
`In that case, there was no way the others in the lobby, which was even further away, would notice.`
`Much less those in the cousins' room on the second floor...!`
`"Why are you so panicked?`
` Didn't you defeat me with that bold move, saying that the culprit died in an accident on the first twilight?"`
`"...Doesn't that mean there's no longer a culprit on this island...?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle* What is there to be so worried about...?"`
`"Shut up, I can see right through you!!`
` Someone stop them, those two'll be killed!!`
` Someone, stop theeeeeeeeeeeeeeem, aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`...There was no way that Battler's voiceless scream would reach Rosa or Maria.`
`The two of them could be seen in the rose garden.`
`The rain was still awful, but fortunately, the wind had died down a little.`
`...No, maybe that wasn't fortunate.`
`Because maybe, if the wind had been a little fiercer, Rosa might have hesitated to go outside...`
`"...Uu-, uu-, uu-...`
` ......Here it is...!"`
`Maria found her rose with the gold lace and stared at it lovingly.`
`Rosa had accepted the promise under the condition that Maria would only get one look at it, `
`but she didn't want Maria to complain that it hadn't been enough later on, `
`so she decided to go along with Maria until she was satisfied.`
`...She believed that there wasn't a culprit,`
` but on the off chance that she was mistaken, they were now in an extremely dangerous position.`
`Rosa realized that faintly herself.`
`If things got bad, she would throw away her umbrella and ready her gun.`
`...After glancing at Maria's innocent happiness, Rosa gazed warily in all directions.`
`..................?`
`...Were her eyes just tired?`
`Even though no one should have been there, she thought she saw something glitter in the dark rose garden.`
`...Gold-colored...?`
`It had to be her imagination.`
`Because, to Rosa, it seemed as though gold butterflies were dancing through the rose bushes...`
`"...Are you okay, Eva...?`
` ...Just take it easy... Should I call Doctor Nanjo after all...?!"`
`"I......I'm fine.`
` ...Don't take your hand away...`
` ...I'm begging you, ...don't take your hand away..."`
`Eva was breathing wildly.`
`Beads of sweat were appearing on her forehead.`
`It certainly was true that she had stayed up all night last night, and that things had been rough since early this morning.`
` It wasn't odd that her body wasn't keeping up.`
`...Even though he understood that,`
` Hideyoshi suspected that this sudden fever was the sign of some serious illness.`
`Several times, Hideyoshi decided to call for Doctor Nanjo, but Eva resisted firmly, `
`...pleading with him and saying that it was even more important that he didn't take his hand away...`
`"I understand...`
` But you've gotta have Doctor Nanjo look at you by lunchtime.`
` If you can promise me that, I'll stay here the whole time, grippin' your hand.`
` Tightly, like this."`
`"...Thank you...`
` ...I'm fine...`
` The magic of your hand will definitely take this fever away..."`
`Even as she said that, Eva's harsh breathing didn't improve in the slightest.`
`'!s1`
`...haah, `
`...haahh...`
` ...Don't let go, `
`...don't let go, `
`...haah, `
`...haahh, `
`......aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!"`
`"...Wh-Who is it...?!"`
`She saw an umbrella moving from beyond the rose bush.`
`Rosa threw away her umbrella and wildly lifted her gun...`
`When she did, the shadow of a person beyond the bush...showed itself.`
`"......Uu-?`
` ...Aunt Eva......`
` ......?"`
`"...You scared me.`
` It's you, Nee-san?`
` ......Do you have some business with me?`
` ...Do you want to continue our earlier discussion?"`
`"............`
`...Yes, that's right.`
` Our discussion about Father's gold."`
`"...Please, restrain yourself in front of Maria.`
` I will keep my promise, okay?`
` I won't get in the way of your conspiracy."`
`"......Conspiracy?`
` What's that?"`
`"......Whatever you're thinking, that's up to you.`
` I have no desire to get in the way.`
` So please, not in front of Maria.`
` As long as I get my share, that will be enough."`
`"Your share?`
` Heheheheh, ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha."`
`Eva started laughing in a creepy voice...`
`Rosa was startled, but Maria stared blankly.`
`......Then Maria said just one thing.`
`"...Uu-...?`
` ...Auntie, `
`...who are you...?"`
`"Hahahahahaha, ahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Your share?!`
` Who would give that to you...?!`
` All of that is mine!`
` It all belongs to me, the Golden Witch, Beatrice...!!!"`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!"`
`"Eva! Are you okay, Eva?!`
` Eva!`
` Eva!!"`
`"Hold on...!!`
` Don't let go!!`
` Don't let me be dragged away by someone who isn't me...!!`
` Hold onto my hand...`
` Don't let goooooooooooooo...!!!"`
`"When did you ever work hard?!`
` You never worked hard for anything!`
` You were always hiding in our shadows!`
` You always escaped from shadow to shadow without fighting, `
`and yet, you really think yourself qualified to make demands of me over the Ushiromiya family gold...?!"`
`"All of that is mine!`
` It's all mine alone, as the Head of the Ushiromiya family and the new Golden Witch, successor to the name of Beatrice!!"`
`"......Beatrice.`
` ......It's Beatrice!!`
` Mama, Beatrice!"`
`Maria jumped at her mother in ecstasy.`
`...Rosa treated Maria coldheartedly and raised her gun high.`
`"...Hey, you're Nee-san, right...?`
` ...You are Nee-san, aren't you...?"`
`"Wrong.`
` ...I am no longer the one who was your sister."`
`"Then who are you?!!`
` Are you trying to say that you're Beatrice?!`
` That's impossible!`
` You died 19 years ago!!!`
`"Yes, you were definitely dead, after all, I clearly saw how your head was split open.`
` I can remember the insides flowing out like it was yesterday!`
` How can you be alive and here right noooooooooow?!?!"`
`"The concept of death does not exist to a Golden Witch.`
` The Golden Witch and the name of Beatrice will be handed down for all eternity."`
`"Maybe the Beatrice you knew met with death, but that name is mine now...!`
` And therefore, it's eternal!`
` The concept of death does not exist for Beatrice!!"`
`"......All I can see is that the gold has driven you mad.`
` ...How pitiful, Nee-san...!"`
`"Come on, you know I'm not your sister anymore.`
` ...Well then, as the new Beatrice, I have been tasked with my own resurrection ceremony."`
`"......Ronove!`
` What should I do?!"`
`"That is up to you.`
` You already have the power to make whatever you think reality.`
` You should grow used to it once you've tried it out a little."`
`"...You worthless former sister.`
` You should consider it an honor to have been selected as the first sacrifice I offer as a witch.`
` On the second twilight, I'll tear the two who are close apart with my own hands...!!"`
`The first thing the new Beatrice wished for...`
`no, the first magic she tried to use, was to surpass the limitations given to humans.`
`...In particular, gravity.`
`She wanted to become fully aware of her transformation into a witch by being released from those shackles.`
`As the witch and Rosa stayed as they were...`
`...The ground retreated all by itself...into the distance below them.`
`By now, their feet were no longer attached to the ground.`
`Rosa finally realized that the earth wasn't retreating into the distance below them, `
`but that she and the witch were being sucked up into the rainy sky.`
`"......Huh...?`
` .........Eeeek...?!"`
`"Wh-Whoooooooooaaaa... Awesome...!"`
`For a human shackled to the ground by gravity, there is nothing more unnerving that having their feet stop sticking to the ground.`
`...However, to Beatrice, who, in becoming the new witch, had learned the joy of being released from gravity,`
` it was enough to make her whole body shake with delight.`
`"...Hey, Rosa.`
` Do you remember, long ago, when we were small, when we used to talk about what it'd be like to become witches and fly around the sky?`
` ...That dream has been granted, hasn't it?`
` I became a real witch and granted it for you."`
`"...S-Stop it, ......if this is a dream, then wake me up..."`
`"You said it yourself.`
` You said you flew through the sky in your dream.`
` And you also said you didn't want to wake up.`
` You even got mad at me when I woke you up, right?`
` ...Don't worry.`
` This time, you won't wake up, okay?`
` Heheheheheheheheheheheheh!!"`
`Come, dance with me in the vast, rainy sky.`
`Didn't we both wish we could fly like seagulls in the sky...`
`and escape the cramped and boring island of Rokkenjima...?`
`Now, I'll make that dream a reality for you.`
`I only want to share this joy with you, and no one else...!`
`"Ahhahaha, ahhahahahaha!!`
` It's so fun, Rosa, it's so fun!!`
` Take a look below you!`
` Look at how small our mansion is.`
` I wonder how much time we spent in a place that small.`
` ...Now I'm especially shocked at how cramped and tiny it is."`
`"So feel.`
` Enjoy.`
` Rejoice...!`
` That power we yearned for, the power to move through the sky at will!`
` Come on, let's dance, Rosa!`
` Through the rain, through the wind!`
` Let's fly around like we're dancing!`
` The lightning will shine on us and bless us!!`
` Ahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`The witch and Rosa were like leaves fluttering around in a whirlwind.`
`As the rain pounded upon every part of their bodies, as the lightning occasionally shone upon them, they shook with the joy of being released from the ground.`
`...However, it was only that way for the witch.`
`Rosa was holding onto her head, voicelessly screaming over and over.`
`"Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiitt!!`
` Forgive meeeeee, let me doooooooown!!"`
`"...You're right, it's more fitting for Humans to crawl on the ground.`
` Then why not go back there?"`
`A slightly displeased expression rose to the witch's face when she realized that her own joy was not being shared.`
`Then, she decided to listen to her former sister's request.`
`"......?!`
` ......Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!"`
`The whirlwind that had been making Rosa dance around grew weaker, then stopped.`
`In other words, Rosa was once again bound by the restrictions of gravity, as a Human.`
`...Following the laws that were originally correct, Rosa began to descend towards the ground upside-down.`
` No, she began to fall.`
`"Oops...`
` That's right, if I don't take her down the right way, this is what happens!"`
`The witch hadn't intended to send Rosa plummeting.`
`But she still wasn't used to using magic.`
`After plummeting about 100 meters into a rose bush, `
`as a very, very natural result, Rosa died instantly.`
`But the witch hadn't intended to kill her.`
`So she wished that Rosa hadn't died.`
`When she did, gold butterflies coiled about Rosa's body, reviving that life just as the witch had wished.`
`Rosa's body, which should have been spread out like a carpet of fresh blood, rapidly returned to normal.`
`The broken and crushed bones returned to normal.`
`The torn and smashed flesh returned to normal.`
`...How easy it is to break things in this world, and how difficult it is to fix them...`
`Anyone can take a life.`
`But no Human can revive a lost life!`
` By surpassing the irreversable, one proves that they have surpassed Humanity.`
`...This surely gave her a much, much greater realization of her position as a witch than flying through the sky had.`
`"......Awesome...`
` I can even revive...an ended life...!"`
`"Of course.`
` Beatrice-sama is the Endless Witch.`
` ...To live and to die.`
` To bring to life and to kill, all of it repeated endlessly.`
` Beatrice-sama, the Endless Witch, is the queen who controls the cycle of life and death."`
`"Ahaha, aha.`
` One time, I knocked over a fishbowl.`
` The fragile and beautiful bowl broke, and I couldn't put it back together again.`
` I'd never see that cute pop-eyed goldfish swim again after it landed on the floor."`
`"......No matter how much I cried, the servants shook their heads, saying that broken things and dead things could never be revived."`
`"...That's when I learned something.`
` You must not break things, you must not kill people.`
` After all, you can't fix them!!"`
`"So, if you can fix them, `
`...then you won't get in trouble for breaking them, right...?`
` Haha, ahahahaha, ......awesome...`
` Awesome, awesome, awesome...!!`
` Ahhahahahahahahaahahahahahahaahhahahhahhahhahhaha!!"`
`For a while, the witch became intoxicated with how terrible and wonderful the power she had inherited was.`
`Her laugh was pure, innocent, and cruel.`
`"......Uuuuuu...au..."`
`Even though Rosa had been revived, she let out a cry of anguish at the pain from her fall.`
`At that point, the witch landed and held out her hand.`
`"Hahahahahahaha, sorry about that, Rosa.`
` I didn't think flying in the sky would be so much fun.`
` Sorry, I'm real sorry."`
`"And I didn't know Humans could die so easily.`
` But I've brought you back to life, so we're even.`
` So get up, okay?`
` Play with me some more, okay?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle* Hehehehaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`What were those dreams you told me about when you were a kid...?`
` Go ahead and tell me all of them without holding back.`
`As I am now, I can make anything come true, no matter how absurd...!`
`Even drowning you in a sea of jelly!`
` Even having you get sucked into a mountain of cake!`
` I can even even make you sprout butterfly wings and flit around the garden, okay?!`
`I'll do them one after another. Let's start with the ocean of jelly, all right...?!`
`"S-Stop it, `
`......urgg!!"`
`Rosa was once again thrown high into the rainy sky.`
`However, the sky wasn't filled with raindrops, but with drops of orange juice.`
`When she looked down, Rosa had to doubt her eyes.`
`The rose garden had disappeared, and the ground spread out beneath her was like a pastel-colored jigsaw puzzle.`
`...It was an ocean of jelly, like the one she had spoken of from her dreams when she was young.`
`The black part was coffee jelly.`
` The red was strawberry,`
` the yellow was pineapple,`
` and the green was melon.`
`What was the white part, apple...?`
`......Did Rosa even have the time to think stuff like that?`
`Rosa fell towards that multi-colored ocean...`
`...And she sunk deep into a purple grape-flavored sea.`
`It really was an ocean of jelly.`
` It had no bottom.`
`As Rosa sank, she was shocked to see a school of transparent fish swimming through the grape jelly ocean.`
`They were probably made of grape skin.`
`Then she sunk on and on, deeper and deeper, as deep as the Marianas Trench,`
` ...crushed by the water pressure of the jelly ocean...`
`as her ribs snapped, as her spine snapped.`
`...In the end, she became a small, frail meatball.`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahaha!`
` What a truly wonderful experience, to drown in an ocean of jelly...!!`
` It's a dream no one else can imitate!!`
` I made it come true for you, ahhyahyahyahya!!"`
`The instant I snapped my fingers, the meatball that had been Rosa was launched up into the sky.`
`And after being wrapped up in a golden sparkle, she returned to her original form.`
`It was as simple and easy as returning dried seaweed to its original form, and anyone could do it.`
` If they were a witch!`
`That absent-minded look on Rosa's face has to be the joy from having that dream she gave up on as a child come true.`
` Definitely. Probably.`
`Next is the mountain of cake.`
`In an instant, the sky was covered...and became black and white in the shape of a chessboard.`
`That almost transparent white part was her favorite rare cheesecake.`
`The elegant black part was a slightly bitter Gateau au chocolat.`
`That became the ceiling, became a mountain, ...and several billion cakes were thrown down towards Rosa.`
`If you piled those cakes up, they would surely be taller than Mount Everest.`
`So they probably weighed...`
`...I'm not too sure, but I'll bet it was heavier than all the cakes across Japan put together.`
`It fell down like a ceiling and swallowed Rosa up, `
`...so as a very, very natural result, Rosa was crushed to death.`
`In less than a second, `
`her bones broke throughout her body and her insides were all smashed and forced out, `
`*squish*pop*slop*.`
`Even so, an even greater number of cakes piled up on top,`
` ...and Rosa ended up as a layer of jam wedged between them.`
`She became as thin as a single hair...and was probably spread out over the area of a tennis court.`
`That world swallowed up by cake was once again absorbed by a gold flash.`
`Then, as though it had all been a dream, Rosa was revived once again.`
`...Of course, it definitely wasn't a dream.`
`She had been revived after dying.`
`By that point, death, which most Humans only have to experience once after they are born,`
` had already been experienced repeatedly by Rosa.`
`In other words, she gone through that which Humans cannot, the precious experience of dying more than once.`
`"Ahhahahahahahahaha, kyahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Isn't this fun, Rosa, isn't this fun?!`
` Next is the butterflies, look...!!"`
`"P-Please, have mercy, ......aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"No wa-y!`
` Let's play more, let's play more...!!`
` Kyahihihihahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`Laughing innocently, she pointed her gold staff at Rosa as she begged for mercy.`
`When she did, Rosa glittered gold and rapidly began to shrink.`
`She shrank down to the size of a real butterfly.`
`Then, gold wings sprouted from her back, ...and she joined her fellow gold butterflies.`
`However, while a human body could withstand that wind, it was a different matter for a butterfly's body.`
`The gold butterfly Rosa...was invited to dance by each gale of wind, and she spun in circles around the rose garden.`
`"No, ...nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!`
` ......Ah...!"`
`As her dance wore her out, she was caught by a gentle bed.`
`It was a soft, knit hammock in the shadows beneath the roof of the arbor.`
`...The owner of that hammock lumbered into view, welcoming its rare guest who had wandered in on the night of a storm...`
`That owner, which should have been small enough to crush in the palm of your hand,`
` now looked as big as the top of a canopy bed to Rosa.`
`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`"Kyahhahahakyahhahahahahaha!`
` What a klutz, you got caught in a spider's web!`
` Ahhahaha, ahhahahahahaha!!"`
`"This time, it's a dance with a spider.`
` That takes me back. Remember the times we'd find a spider's web and play around by throwing pebbles at it?`
` I've heard that spiders don't chew their prey, `
`but insert their venom, and when the insides melt into a sticky soup, they suck them out."`
`"...Hey, Rosa, remember?`
` Remember how we'd throw butterflies into the spider's web on purpose, and play around by seeing how the spider would attack?"`
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha, `
`I guess you don't remember, do you? This happened before you got into grade school...!!`
` Make sure you watch closely this time, okay?`
` Very closely.`
` Kyahihihahahahahahakya-hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`'!s1`
`have mercy, Nee-san, `
`help me, Nee-san!!`
` Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekk`
`gaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh`
`errrrrrrrrkkk`
`bwaagh`
`ahggggg`
`ergorblahgehmolgeeaaarg ga, `
`ga...`
`ga...`
`gyuuboh!!"`
`"This girl's not bad. She truly can use magic at will!`
` Hiihyahhahahahahakkuhihiehiehyahyahya!!`
` Amusing, amusing, how truly amusing!`
` You feel like laughing too, right, Battleeeeeeer?!"`
`"Don't fuck with me!!!`
` Stop it alreadyyyyyyyyyy!!`
` What's so fun, you're insane, you're insane!!!`
` What's so fun about doing something like this?!?!"`
`"Doesn't she look like she's having a blast?`
` What do you expect, magic is fun!!`
` I remember, when I first became able to use magic, I played around a lot!`
` ...Aaah, I understand, I understand, I understand that kind of game from the bottom of my heart!"`
`"...Looks like I won't be able to share this joy and passion with you, Battler. Aah, what a shame, what a shame!!`
` If you accept me, I'll teach you magic anytime you want, see?!`
` It's hard to describe the joy you receive in the instant you're freed from the shackles of Humanity!"`
`"I want to teach you about it, that joy, that passion!`
` I'd deeefinitely like to see the world of magic you'd give birth to, just once!`
` Kihhihihihhihhi, hyahhyahhahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"Isn't this starting to get fun?`
` You've started wanting to use magic, haven't you?!`
` It's pretty fun to be a witch, isn't it?!`
` Just for you, I'll teach everything!`
` About the joy of flying together in the sky, about the joy of diving together through the sea!"`
`"I want to show you the passion that starts the instant you surpass the bounds of Humans `
`and see how wide your world stretches!`
` Wouldn't that be fun, `
`wahhyahhyahahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`There was no malice in Beato's expression.`
`...It was hard to believe, but she was genuinely enjoying this cruel show.`
`And she wanted to share that appreciation with Battler.`
`...Battler was shocked by that hopelessly different sense of values.`
`"You're insane!!`
` Stop it already, damn iiiiiiiiit!!`
` Virgilia, make them stop this insane farce!!`
` What should I do?!!"`
`"......We exist outside the board.`
` We cannot touch the board itself."`
`Virgilia shook her head apologetically.`
`...Her body had already been 'killed'.`
`Did that mean she couldn't interfere in any way...?`
`As Beatrice continued to look amused in an insane sort of way, Battler lifted her up by the collar and yelled at her.`
`"Stop it stop it stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!`
` Quit messing around, witch!!`
` Are you trying to tell me that's Aunt Eva?!`
` That's impossible!!`
` The Aunt Eva I know might be a bit mean at times,`
` but it's completely impossible that she's the kind of person who'd do something this cruel!!"`
`"This is all part of your deception!!`
` Don't toy with Aunt Rosa!!`
` Don't toy with Aunt Eva!!`
` Stop this farce right nooooooooooooooooow!!"`
`"I told you, I'm not the one playing with Rosa anymore.`
` Like I said, that's the new Beatrice."`
`"Is it really so terrible that you have to squeal like that?`
` You're also pretty fond of stuff like this, aren't you?!`
` You actually have just a bit of interest in magic and`
`'!s0`
` Wh-What are you doing...?"`
`For the first time, Battler slapped Beato's cheek.`
`...Beatrice didn't know why he had done something like that to her, and a surprised expression rose to her face.`
`Battler especially couldn't forgive that expression, and he roared.`
`"Aaaaaaaaaaahh?!`
` You call this amusing?!`
` What's wrong with your head?!!`
` Die!`
` Go slice your head to bits and look inside, you'll see there's nothing there!!!`
` Stop it right now, stop this disgusting farce!!`
` I won't forgive you!!`
` How could you do something so cruel?!!`
` I've sometimes thought you could be a bit funny, but I'll never make that mistake again!`
` You're just a monster who's cruel on all levels!!!`
` Don't show yourself in front of me!!`
` Never again!!`
` I won't accept you, I won't talk with you, I don't even want to look at your face!!`
` Did you hear me?!!`
` Don't show yourself in front of me, `
`DISAPPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAARRR!!!"`
`The instant Battler screamed, the power that resisted the witch became a red wall and knocked Beato back onto her butt.`
`"...Owowowow...`
` ...What are you talking about, isn't it an interesting show...?"`
`She spoke defensively, but the target of those words, Battler, was no longer there.`
`His figure had suddenly disappeared into the darkness...`
`...But Beatrice looked displeased and continued trying to explain herself.`
`"...I-It's not as though I'm completely blind to where you're coming from,`
` ...but this is nothing more than an innocent prank, isn't it...?`
` No matter how you kill them, they'll always be brought back to life in the end, right?`
` ...I thought Humans were creatures who say all's well that ends well...?!"`
`"H-Hey, Teacher,`
` there was no reason for him to get so angry, right...?!"`
`She was hoping for approval, but Virgilia simply faced her with an indifferent expression.`
`...To Beato at that moment, even an exasperated look would probably have been better.`
`"......I have nothing in particular to say.`
` If you think this is fun, you can keep watching as long as you want.`
` ...Call me when it's over.`
` I will vanish until then."`
`Following Battler's lead, Virgilia vanished into the darkness...`
`Beato, who was now completely isolated and didn't have a clue what was going on, felt that they were making her out to be the bad guy.`
`"............`
`...What's wrooong?`
` Isn't it an amusing show...?!`
` I-It might be a little vulgar, ...but it's quite interesting, isn't it...?!!`
` Hey, Ronove...?!`
` It's nothing to get so mad about, right...?!`
`"Pu ku ku ku.`
` ...Something interesting for you, Milady, may not necessarily be interesting for Battler-sama."`
`"Does he really...hate me that much?`
` ...Well, certainly, we are enemies and opponents in this competition, `
`...but is our relationship really so bad that we can't laugh together at this display...?!`
` ......Since I applauded together with Battler, I thought I could at least laugh together with him...`
` ...Does he really reject me so much that we can't even do that...?"`
`"...He doesn't have to accept that I'm a witch.`
` We're challenging each other in this game, after all.`
` And yet, he won't look at my face, he won't talk to me,`
` ...and he'll probably do all he can to ignore me...`
` Am I really hated that muuuuuch...?!"`
`"The moves you've made up to this point have been more than enough to earn his hatred.`
` Even a demon such as myself can understand a bit of Battler-sama's feelings."`
`"...Perhaps you cannot understand because you are especially thickheaded, Milady.`
` Pukukukukuku."`
`"Sh-Shut up shut up shut up shut up!!`
` Why don't you disappear too?!!"`
`"Yes, certainly.`
` ...Then, if you would excuse me."`
`Even Ronove hid himself in the darkness, and Beatrice was left alone.`
`The only one in the rainy rose garden.`
`No one ever plays with a lonely witch.`
`And the fact that no one ever does is what makes them a lonely witch.`
`"......`
`...What's going on?`
` ...Why won't anyone play with me...?`
` ......Am I really that weird, that cruel...?`
` ......Someone, answer meeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha, isn't this fun, Rosa, isn't this fun?!`
` Hey, how should we play next?`
` Of course, we should play with Maria too, right?`
` Let's all have a friendly walk together, okay?`
` Let's swim in a pot of boiling chocolate, let's have a picnic in a cake-rising oven!`
` Ahahaha, *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"......H-Hey, new Beatrice."`
`Behind the witch that was continuing her mad banquet, Beato showed herself.`
`...That expression was very rare for her.`
`It was somehow restrained, unreliable, miserable.`
`"Oh, it's the Predecessor Beatrice-sama.`
` Were you watching?`
` The power of magic is truly wonderful!`
` Until now, I never thought it'd be so fun to be reborn as a witch.`
` It's like playtime that never ends...!`
` Come on, let's play together, Predecessor-sama...!!"`
`"But first, wait for a second, okay?!`
` I cooked the two of them to death in an oven, so I have to revive them again! `
`They're like bread rising from yeast!`
` Like cookies expanding in an oven!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"L-Listen to what I'm saying...`
` ...Umm, well, `
`isn't that enough for the sacrifice of the second twilight?`
` ...Of course, there are no rules regarding how you kill them, but,`
` umm, `
`...maybe you shouldn't toy with them any more than that..."`
`"What are you saying, Predecessor-sama?`
` I heard from Ronove a short while ago.`
` Wasn't your magic much, much more wonderful, cruel, and crazy?!"`
`"That Halloween party where candies poured out of six people's stomachs was truly wonderful!`
` So maybe I'll act out Alice's tea party...!`
` I'll invite everyone to a tea party in celebration of a completely pointless day, and entertain them one by one with my magic!"`
`"I wonder if I can do it as wonderfully as you?`
` I wonder if I can be cruel in my own pop, cute style?!`
` Now that I think about it, all fairy tales are cruel, aren't they?`
` Now that I'm a witch inside one of those fairy tales, I finally understand.`
` Kyahhahahahakukyahyafuhyahahahahaha!!"`
`"......I have also, umm, `
`...sometimes thought that, in the past, `
`...I might have gone a little too far.`
` ...Well, I think that as the Golden Witch, it's probably best to show a little elegance..."`
`"......???`
` I don't get what you're saying, Predecessor-sama.`
` But there's one thing I do understand.`
` No matter how hard I try now, I'm no match for how cruel you are.`
` I've gotta try much, much harder.`
` I've gotta become more cruel, and become an excellent Golden Witch...!"`
`"L-Like I said, you've already done enough here...!`
` A-Anyway, this is an order from me as your predecessor.`
` That's enough for the second twilight.`
` I'll show you how it's done.`
` Stand back and watch..."`
`"Yes, Predecessor-sama.`
` I can't wait to see what brutal, cruel, and disgusting method of killing you use."`
`The new witch grasped the sides of her skirt and gave a graceful bow,`
` stepping back as an expectant gaze rose to her face.`
`...She was expecting an even more cruel magic that surpassed even herself.`
`"......Well, speaking of that...`
` You're only half a witch if you can only kill with methods like that.`
` ...I shall show you an elegant way to kill, worthy of the Golden Witch..."`
`When Beato waved her pipe, seven colors of smoke poured out, reviving Rosa and Maria.`
`...Compared to how the new Beatrice had done it a short while ago, it was slightly gentler.`
`...It was probably gentler than how Beato had done it herself up until now.`
`Rosa's consciousness had already grown dim from the pain of so many repeated deaths.`
`...But even so, she pleaded that her daughter be spared...`
`"...Please...have mercy...`
` ...Even...if it's just Maria, ...have mercy..."`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, Mama, Mamaaaaaa!!"`
`"......Sorry.`
` My disciple just...umm...acted without restraint for a bit.`
` ...Umm,`
` ......forgive me."`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, mar_3e149:`
`When Maria realized it was the real Beatrice, she jumped onto her.`
`"...You promised, right, Beato?!`
` You promised you'd take me to the Golden Land, right?!`
` There, I'll be friendly with Mama, and everyone will laugh together...!`
` You promised you'd take me there, right?!"`
`'!s1`
`About that.`
` ...I can no longer...`
`keep that promise.`
` ......Because someone appeared who could solve the riddle, `
`...I am no longer the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
` ...So, sorry.`
` ...I can no longer keep my promise with you..."`
`"Why...?`
` Why...?`
` You promised..."`
`"...I'm sorry.`
` ...I'm truly sorry...`
` ......So at least...in apology for not being able to keep my promise..."`
`......I'll give you a quiet...`
`sleep that will never be disturbed again...`
`Beato embraced Maria with a loving expression on her face...`
`Then, ......softly, a red bruise appeared on Maria's neck.`
`It was a very gentle bruise.`
`...Its redness grew bit by bit, ...and when it distinctly formed itself into the shape of a hand...`
`...Maria's neck tilted suddenly.`
`...Peacefully, as though she had fallen asleep.`
`"M-Maria...`
` ...Mariaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"...Sorry.`
` ...I won't apologize that you were the sacrifices for the second twilight.`
` That is simply your fate.`
` However, I must apologize for the vulgar way in which you were offered as sacrifices...`
` ...This is your final sleep.`
` ...Never again will it be disturbed..."`
`Beato softly, gently lifted her finger, as though touching the empty air in front of her nose.`
`...When she did, a light breeze lifted up, making Rosa's body dance lightly like a feather.`
`Then, Rosa's body floated softly...`
`...and right there was the garden fence, with its spear-shaped prongs.`
`The spear of the fence pierced Rosa's medulla oblongata.`
`...Benevolently, without toying with her, in a single blow.`
`Rosa's life was snapped out.`
`Compared to the earlier innocent yet cruel events, it seemed to be over much too fast.`
`...It just looked like a doll shaped like Rosa was leaning against the fence.`
`...But, she had passed away.`
`"......W-Well, something like that should do the trick."`
`Beato acted proud, but the new witch wore a blank expression, almost as though this was an anticlimax.`
`Then, she said it out loud.`
`"It's kinda plain...`
` ...Not at all like the Predecessor-sama Ronove told me about."`
`"...Well, ...you must use magic with dignity, right...?`
` If it's too...umm...undignified, that isn't very elegant..."`
`"............`
`...Even though you're lucky enough to have the magic to do wonderful things endlessly...`
` ...How boring."`
`"Hey, don't complain...!`
` The path of the Golden Witch cannot be completed in a day.`
` You are still incomplete until you finish the tenth twilight...`
` For now, stay quiet and follow my instructions.`
` ...Got it...?!"`
`"............"`
`"Wh-What happened to your answer?`
` Your answer...!"`
`"............`
`......Su-re."`
`"...Very well, that will do.`
` ...Well, there is still much to do for the resurrection ceremony.`
` You still have to kill five people...`
` You should do it without toying with them too much, with beauty and dignity, `
`...and with at least a little restraint, okay...?`
` What Ronove told you about how I did it...that was a bad example.`
` You mustn't use that as a model.`
` Engrave that into your heart."`
`"......Yes, Predecessor-sama."`
`"A good answer.`
` ...Ronove, the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, arise...!"`
`"...Yes, Milady.`
` I, Ronove, am here."`
`"Lucifer of Pride, right here."`
`"...Up until this point, umm, I've been a little flashy, but...`
`umm, `
`...well, the dignity of the Golden Witch is also important, `
`and about that..."`
`As Ronove laughed at Beato's uncharacteristically flustered speech, he summed it up for her.`
`"Certainly.`
` From now on, we will be careful to act in a graceful manner, suitable for the name of the Golden Witch.`
` ...Even the Seven Sisters of Purgatory will reform their bad behavior up until now,`
` and we shall espouse to perform our task in the quickest possible manner.`
` ...Would that be acceptable, Milady?"`
`"I-Indeed.`
` That's it, more or less.`
` Everyone, take it to heart!`
` Okay...?!"`
`"Yes.`
` Certainly."`
`"That is all I wish to say.`
` ...You may leave now."`
`"Certainly.`
` If you would excuse me."`
`"Excuse us."`
`"............"`
`"Well, ...that's all I want to say.`
` So, take care as you move forward, understand?`
` Act with dignity, and...umm, restraint, okay?`
` ...Give it your all.`
` I will be watching over you."`
`Acting awkwardly until the very end, Beato left that message and immediately became a cloud of gold butterflies, hiding her form in the empty air.`
`Maybe it'd be more accurate to say she vanished in a hurry because she couldn't keep up the conversation.`
`After that, all that remained was Maria's corpse, lying down and pounded by the rain,`
` Rosa's corpse, propped up by the fence and staring up at the sky...`
`...And the figure of the witch.`
`".........Show some restraint, ...you say...?"`
`Her expression looked just a little bored.`
`There was a popping sound.`
`...That was probably her clicking her tongue.`
`"..................`
`............What a boring person."`
`Leaving that last sentence behind, she once again vanished into the empty air...`
`".........zzzzz..."`
`".........Whew.`
` ...Looks like she's finally calmed down..."`
`Hideyoshi wiped his own forehead.`
`...For a time, Eva had seemed to be having a very painful nightmare, but it appeared she'd finally fallen asleep.`
`As promised, he still gripped Eva's hand.`
`...He'd thought it might be time to let go pretty soon, but he faithfully continued to hold on.`
`Every once in a while, his hand would get tired, and he would switch between his right and his left,`
` but even so, as promised, he didn't let go of her hand...`
`At that time, there was a heavy knock.`
`Eva had finally been able to fall asleep, so Hideyoshi grimaced for just an instant.`
`"...Aneki, Hideyoshi-san, sorry.`
` Is Rosa there...?"`
`It was Rudolf's voice.`
` ...What could it be?`
`Hideyoshi headed for the door, hiding his footsteps so that he wouldn't wake Eva.`
`...It was definitely Rudolf's voice, but just in case, he opened the door without removing the chain.`
`"What is it?`
` Somethin' happen to Rosa-san?"`
`"We can't find Rosa or Maria-chan.`
` I thought they might be with you."`
`"...I heard her scolding Maria-chan in the corridor.`
` They got quiet after that, so I thought they'd gone back to the lobby, ...but did they...?"`
`"......That idiot..."`
`Rudolf clicked his tongue.`
`Other people could be seen in the corridor.`
`Rosa hadn't returned for a while after going out into the corridor, so they'd begun to worry.`
`Near the front door, Natsuhi pointed at the unset chain.`
`"...The chain isn't set.`
` They must have gone outside to see that rose after all."`
`"How extraordinarily careless, to go out and leave the door unlocked.`
` What a troublesome person."`
`"...I'm more worried about Rosa-san and Maria-chan themselves."`
`"Right.`
` ...Hey, brats.`
` Where was this rose of Maria's?!"`
`"I'm pretty sure...it was in the flower bed right in the middle of the rose garden..."`
`"If that's where they are, we should be able to spot them pretty quickly if we go."`
`"...Dad, shouldn't we bring them back here as soon as we can...?"`
`"Of course.`
` We'll bring them back and give 'em a good spanking.`
` I'll dash out there and come back.`
` Lock the door as soon as I go out."`
`"...Dad, I'll go with you."`
`"Don't be stupid.`
` It's obviously a brat's job to watch over the house with Mama."`
`"......What is it...?`
` Did something happen...?"`
`"Sorry, did I wake you up...?`
` ...It seems Rosa-san took Maria-chan outside.`
` ...How reckless of her."`
`"Rosa and Maria-chan are...`
`...outside...?`
` In the rose garden...?!"`
`"That's right.`
` ...Oh, did you hear?`
` Maria-chan was causin' a ruckus because she wanted to see this rose."`
`"...Th-They mustn't...`
` ...They mustn't go to the rose garden...!`
` Tell Rosa to stop...!"`
`"Th-There's no tellin' her to stop now, it looks like they left a while ago.`
` ...Seriously, how reckless of them."`
`"......That's not it...`
` ...Not the rose garden...`
` ...There's a witch there, `
`...and she's waiting for a sacrifice...!`
` Rosa, you mustn't go, `
`...ooooooooooohhh..."`
`...Eva cowered again, holding her head.`
`...Her complexion looked very bad.`
`"What is it?`
` Did the fever make you dream somethin' bad?"`
`"......It's a dream, `
`...yes...`
` ......In the rose garden, the witch, doing that to Rosa and Maria-chan...`
` ......That's right.`
` ...It's a dream...`
` It must be..."`
`"Calm down.`
` I'm here in this room.`
` And the chain is set.`
` The shutter's closed on the window, and we've even got a gun.`
` This room is just like a fort.`
` There's nothin' to be afraid of."`
`Hideyoshi beat his chest, trying to calm her, but Eva's insecure expression didn't change.`
`...Under the covers, Eva kept praying that the grotesque nightmare she'd just had was only a dream...`
`"In the center of the rose garden, Rudolf identified the corpses of Rosa and Maria.`
` After that, he returned to the guesthouse, called for help, and carried both of them into the guesthouse."`
`"If we can trust Nanjo's examination, the cause of Rosa's death was a stab to the medulla oblongata with the pointed gate of the fence.`
` It is thought that Maria's death was due to strangling with bare hands.`
` However, due to the 'Devil's Proof', we cannot discount a misdiagnosis."`
`"...I will say it in red.`
` #ff0000Rosa and Maria died#ffffff.`
` #ff0000The causes of death were as Nanjo diagnosed#ffffff.`
` ...She wasn't eaten by a spider, nor was she crushed by a mountain of cake.`
` Don't worry."`
`"......So, you argue that even though you toyed with their deaths so much, it's all fine because the corpse is neat and clean...?`
` I definitely won't forgive you."`
`"...I definitely won't forget all of that brutal treatment you gave Aunt Rosa,`
` so I won't forgive you..."`
`"...L-Like I said, that wasn't me...`
` ...I believe I gave them a much more peaceful death than the way she treated them..."`
`"Shut the hell up.`
` I'm not talking to you."`
`"......It was stated that there are no more than 18 people on this island, and now that eight people are already dead,`
` we can narrow the field of suspects down to ten.`
` One of them probably killed those two."`
`"...Or could it also be an accidental death?`
` Like Maria was having a tantrum,`
` and when Aunt Rosa tried to stop her crying, she misjudged how much power she was using and accidentally killed her.`
` Then she was so upset that she slipped and fell, landed on the fence, and unluckily, died."`
`"...How's that?`
` That way there's no need for a witch or magic."`
`"...Well, that's not quite true.`
` Actually, Rosa and Maria..."`
`"Shut up.`
` Didn't I say I wasn't talking to you?`
` You're an eyesore, so disappear.`
` You monster."`
`Battler said that without rage, ...but with a horribly cold voice.`
`...That strange behavior was something Beato had noticed right off the bat.`
`In a fight, both of them could go at each other without restraint.`
`However, he wouldn't even step into the ring.`
` She could feel that coldness.`
`Beato didn't find that amusing.`
`...She thought about flaring up, but she held back.`
`Maybe even though she was innocent and childish,`
` she had enough sense to realize that she shouldn't pick fights.`
`"......`
`......Is that so?`
` Then I'll vanish.`
` ...Ronove, continue for me."`
`"Certainly.`
` ...Will that be satisfactory, Battler-sama?"`
`"......There are no problems with her proposal.`
` If Battler-kun doesn't want to see Beato's face, perhaps that will do."`
`"Do what you like.`
` ...If I can live without seeing that monstrous face, I don't care about anything else."`
`"...Hey, wait a second.`
` ...You keep saying monster, monster, but isn't that a cruel way to speak of me?`
` ...Why do you instinctively hate me so much, Battler?`
` Even though none of that was me, even though it was all the work of my disciple..."`
`"......It's not like I'm only mad about what happened just now.`
` It's been like that from the very beginning."`
`"Hey, Battleer.`
` Don't misunderstand, okay...?`
` Aren't we just a pair of players confronting each other through a game?`
` ...We look for moves to make things painful for each other, but..."`
`"Don't get the wrong idea.`
` I don't hate you because you're my rival in this strange game about whether I accept you as a witch or not.`
` ...I just can't forgive how senselessly cruel you are."`
`"Well, serial murders are a part of this game...`
` It's probably impossible to avoid a little cruelty..."`
`"I'm not just talking about what just happened.`
` There was the last time, and the time before that too.`
` ...Tearing everyone's stomachs open and stuffing them with sweets, plowing their faces...`
` What was the point of all that?"`
`"......That's...`
`well..."`
`"When it comes to closed room murders and tricks and alibis,`
` I'm willing to give you a pass.`
` You want to claim that this is a murder done by magic,`
` so I'll grudgingly accept that those complicated crimes need to occur."`
`"...But what exactly is the point of all those grotesque murders?"`
`"......Well, umm, `
`......nothing much..."`
`"That's right.`
` They don't mean anything.`
` You're just fooling around by mangling the corpses for fun.`
` That has nothing to do with whether you're a witch, or whether it could or couldn't be done with magic."`
`"You're just exploring the depths of cruelty for fun.`
` This isn't about whether you're a witch, or anything like that.`
` There are just some things I can't forgive as a human."`
`"......Wh-`
`What do you mean, as a human...?"`
`"For example,`
` ...the six people of the first twilight for this game.`
` ...Well, other than Grandfather being burned black,`
` the other corpses were killed in a normal way, without any unnecessary shaming of the dead.`
` ...It wasn't clear whether the weapon was a spear or a gun, but anyway, as far as killing goes, that was acceptable.`
` It was much better than the nonsensical grotesqueness and cruelty from the first twilight last time, or the time before that."`
`"And this time, there were six closed rooms tied together to make a closed room chain.`
` ...That was sort of interesting."`
`"When we were going back and forth with each other that time, to be perfectly honest, I thought it was just a little fun."`
`"...You were frantic to make me accept your existence, and I was frantic trying to deny it.`
` ...We were both frantically doing all we could."`
`"This may sound weird, but I've felt a faint sense of sportsmanship between the two of us.`
` ...We exist in conflict, `
`but I faintly thought that we might not be completely unable to understand each other's existence."`
`"......But just now, that feeling was blown away without a trace."`
`"Th-That's what you're misunderstanding...!`
` That wasn't me-"`
`"That's not it.`
` That's not what I'm talking about!`
` ...You watched Aunt Rosa being killed horribly over and over, `
`and you sneered at it like it was an interesting show."`
`...When I saw that, I was deeply disappointed in you.`
`When I realized that your decision to kill them in a slightly better way this time was nothing more than a faint whim,`
` ...and that nothing had changed in your cruel character, I was deeply disappointed.`
`On the contrary, you were even genuinely enjoying those brutal deaths.`
`You weren't just acting as cruel as you could to bully me.`
`...You truly, genuinely enjoy cruelty.`
`Your character lets you enjoy it.`
`You said I'd probably think that Aunt Rosa being brutally killed over and over was fun.`
`You weren't joking.`
` You enjoyed it from the bottom of your heart, wanted me to sympathize, and said that I'd probably think it was fun.`
`...In that instant, I lost respect for you and realized the truth.`
`"The problem isn't whether you're a witch or not.`
` ...I will not forgive that cruelty of yours.`
` And I can't understand it!`
` I can't forgive it, either!`
` Still, I'll continue this game of whether to accept or deny witches.`
` I won't step down and accept my own defeat."`
`"However, your pointless cruelty is absolutely unnecessary for that game.`
` So I've decided that I won't accept you as my opponent.`
` Ronove is a hundred times better.`
` He doesn't have the same cruel hobby you do.`
` Even if he does, he doesn't have the awful taste to show it off in front of me."`
`"...That's right, you have awful taste.`
` You're heartless and cruel, so you can't understand.`
` That's unpleasant in an opponent.`
` So I don't want to see your face again."`
`As Battler went on and on by himself, Beato was shocked into silence for a long time.`
`Maybe she couldn't understand what she was being told,`
` and this was a sign that she was doing all she could in an effort to understand.`
`For a while, she kept switching between angry expressions, frustrated expressions, bold expressions,`
` ...as though even she herself didn't know what attitude she should take.`
`In the end, she made her face into a candid expression, as though she had come to her senses, `
`and shrugged her shoulders as though she was tired.`
`".........`
`......In that case, do as you like.`
` From now on, I will continue this game through Ronove.`
` ...You have no complaints as long as I don't show myself, right?"`
`"...For the time being.`
` But I definitely won't forgive all of your cruel actions up until now.`
` And I definitely won't accept you.`
` For that reason as well, I won't back down from this fight you've picked.`
` And I definitely won't lose.`
` ...That's all there is to it."`
`"......Beato,`
` no matter how many more excuses you give, his impression will not waver.`
` ...I have something to talk about later.`
` Until then, stay back."`
`".........I-Indeed...`
` ...Understood.`
` ...Then I'll vanish until you call..."`
`Looking lonely, Beato turned her back to them and vanished.`
`...Battler watched, a slightly displeased expression on his face.`
`He thought his argument had been valid, but for some reason, his mood didn't clear up.`
`"...She's...`
`an idiot."`
`"......That's true.`
` An idiot, and a straightforward one."`
`"That idiot watched Aunt Rosa get killed horribly with me,`
` then turned around with a huge smile on her face.`
` ...She really believed that she could laugh with me at that cruel show.`
` ...She really believed that I could sympathize with that emotion..."`
`"Looking at that innocent smile, I felt just horrible.`
` ...It would've been much better if she'd said it with her normal bullying face...`
` ...Damn it..."`
`"Milady has never had the experience of having a friend.`
` ...In addition, she has probably never had something spoken to her that strongly."`
`"Madam and I are her attendants.`
` No matter what we say, it will not reach her ears.`
` For Milady, this is also-"`
`"Don't screw with me.`
` I don't remember ever becoming her friend."`
`"...That's true enough.`
` My apologies."`
`".........`
`...There is one thing I would like to thank you for.`
` ...Thank you for not backing down from that child's game."`
`She spoke words of gratitude, but for some reason, Battler made a displeased face.`
`Then as though in self-derision, he chuckled.`
`"Now that I've even got witches and demons thanking me, I'm screwed.`
` ...Let's resume the game.`
` Of course, I don't intend to go easy on you."`
`"I wouldn't have it any other way.`
` Unlike Milady, I do not get agitated."`
`"...I've already made my move.`
` If we suppose that Aunt Rosa is the culprit and died in an accident, I can deny the witch.`
` ...I don't want to suspect Aunt Rosa, but I think I can bear to accept that premise if it'll beat the hell out of Beato."`
`"I will deny it with red.`
` #ff0000Rosa's and Maria's deaths were homicides#ffffff."`
`"Okay.`
` ...Let's start from there.`
` ......Damn, I'm just not getting fired up."`
`With Rosa's and Maria's deaths, it was now clear that the culprit was still hiding somewhere,`
` trying to add even more murders to this chain.`
`As he shed tears, Rudolf scolded Rosa's corpse for being reckless several times,`
` but Rosa would never respond to that again.`
`They decided to place the two corpses in one of the guest rooms...and to seal it until the police arrived...`
`The second murder...no, the murder of the second twilight had delivered a heavy blow to everyone.`
`It had blown away the optimism that some of them had held,`
` the thought that 'a crime didn't actually occur, and it was all a game or a farce by Kinzo and the servants'.`
`Trying to distract themselves from the loss of the people they liked, `
`George and Jessica had spent the whole time since morning talking about every possibility.`
`...And, they had distracted their hearts by supposing that these murders might actually have all been an act,`
` and that Shannon and Kanon were only pretending to be dead.`
`When the next murder occurred, it destroyed that thought,`
` ...and they were once again struck by the fact that the person they liked had most definitely been killed...`
`The tears that they'd thought had died away began to drip down once more, and Battler couldn't think of anything to say to them...`
`After that, all of the adults checked that all of the rooms were safe and locked, just in case.`
`They made certain that the shutters on all of the windows were down and locked, and they confirmed that no one suspicious was hiding anywhere.`
`On top of that, they checked their weapons once again...`
`and checked with each other to make sure they were mentally prepared, so that they wouldn't hesitate to fire off a preemptive shot if they saw the shadow of a mysterious person.`
`Rosa's gun had been found near the scene of the crime.`
`Someone had gone out of their way to leave it there, so everyone suspected that it was some kind of trap, `
`but when Hideyoshi delicately used a fire iron to fire off test shots, it was able to discharge without incident.`
`So, since the five shots loaded into it had discharged without any problems,`
` they reloaded it with bullets and handed it over to the only adult male who wasn't armed, Hideyoshi.`
`However, the fact that it had been able to fire off five shots gave rise to a certain paranoia.`
`This short barrel Winchester could hold only five shots.`
`In other words, Rosa hadn't fired even once.`
`And yet, the two had probably been killed by someone with their bare hands.`
`This meant there was a possibility that the crime had been committed by someone whose face they knew...`
`"...When the first murder occurred,`
` I privately thought of the possibility that it was all an act.`
` ...My apologies to Doctor Nanjo, but if he had actually been an accomplice, `
`I thought the deaths of all the servants might possibly have been a massive, elaborate act by Father."`
`"...After all, the closed room situation they were in couldn't have been created unless we suppose that it was all an act."`
`"...We also...`
`suspected that.`
` ...No, `
`...I still want to believe that's the case."`
`"......My apologies, ...but that is not so.`
` ...I am quite old.`
` I might possibly make a misdiagnosis.`
` ...However, I would never mistake whether they were alive or dead..."`
`'!s0`
` Don't go out of your way to say it out loud, Doctor Nanjo...!"`
`"...My apologies..."`
`They had no way of knowing,`
` but Beato had already used the red to proclaim the deaths of the six...`
`no, the deaths of all victims so far in this game.`
`That faint dream that it was all a farce, that the victims were actually alive...`
` I'm sorry to say it, but that's impossible...`
`"...In that case, it makes more sense to assume it's someone familiar with the mansion,`
` someone hiding around and carrying out a really well-polished crime.`
` So, ever since the typhoon came to this island and sealed it off from the outside world, there's been more than 18 people here."`
`Of course, there was no way for them to know about that either.`
`That claim of Rudolf's has also been denied in red.`
`There are no more than 18 humans on this island...`
`"I might have a way to look at it that keeps things consistent, at least a little.`
` ...Simply put, this person in hiding is someone who shouldn't really be on this island right now.`
` And yet, there's a likelihood that they were someone Rosa-san knew, someone she'd let her guard down around."`
`'!s1`
`So, for example, `
`could it be...a servant who wasn't on this two-day shift...?"`
`"Hmm...`
` ...It's hard to be certain about that one.`
` When our servants finish their work and leave the island, it isn't as though we punch their ticket or something to make sure.`
` If we're supposing that a servant on a shift from a few days ago only pretended to leave the island and actually stayed here,`
` that would be hard to deny..."`
`"...I don't think Rosa-san is such a fool.`
` If a servant who wasn't supposed to be here popped up in front of you, who wouldn't be on their guards...?"`
`"......I'm not even sure we should be assuming that it was someone she recognized.`
` ...Maybe they suddenly attacked Rosa from the darkness and were about to steal her gun.`
` Then Rosa fell, hit her head against the fence, and stopped moving.`
` The guesthouse was nearby and they wanted to avoid the sound of gunfire, so they killed Maria-chan with their bare hands..."`
`"...There's also that possibility.`
` ...Still, even if that is the case,`
` would they really intentionally leave Rosa's gun at the scene of the crime?`
` We don't know what the culprit's armed with, but they've got to feel insecure about our guns.`
` ...Wasn't that a perfect chance for them to thin out our supply?`
` Why would they intentionally leave it at the scene of the crime?"`
`"At first, I thought that gun was a trap.`
` ...That's what chessboard thinking says it should be.`
` By purposefully leaving it, they wanted to make one of us touch it.`
` And they must have wanted to make us pull the trigger.`
` ...I was sure that something dangerous had been done to it...to make it explode and cause massive injuries."`
`"But, it was actually okay.`
` ...The culprit probably panicked.`
` I'll bet that right now, they're regrettin' that they missed their chance to steal a gun...!"`
`"......I don't like it.`
` It ticks me off, like it's a message from the witch, saying she isn't even scared of guns."`
`"...However, in any event, this is truly a fearsome opponent.`
` Even at a glance, they should have been able to tell that Rosa had a gun.`
` To think that they attacked her despite that.`
` ...The fact that they are unafraid of guns should not be taken lightly."`
`"Indeed...`
` It's as Natsuhi says.`
` ...We should probably be even more cautious than we have been."`
`"This is just for peace of mind, but...`
`...at the time we think Rosa-san was attacked outside,`
` where was everyone...?"`
`"Natsuhi and I were here, along with Rudolf and Kyrie-san.`
` I can guarantee their alibis."`
`"Eva and I were together.`
` I can guarantee that."`
`"George-aniki, Jessica, and I were together.`
` ...When Aunt Rosa yelled at us to return to the second floor, `
`we retraced our steps back to the cousins' room, all dejected."`
`"...Back then, `
`...if we hadn't let Maria go..."`
`"Saying that isn't going to change anything..."`
`"......Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"I-I was reading a book in a room on the second floor.`
` ...I was by myself, so no one can verify my alibi, `
`but I believe everyone saw me return to the second floor with the children."`
`"...Once I say this, it'll never end, `
`but what if you jumped out the window, attacked Rosa,`
` then climbed back up using a rain gutter or something...?"`
`"D-D-Don't be absurd...`
` How could I perform a feat such as jumping down from the second story or climbing up with this old body...?"`
`"...Let us stop suspecting each other...`
` It's more important that we trust each other and, for the children's sakes as well, defend this place until the very end."`
`"You're right...`
` ...It's like Natsuhi-san says.`
` ......For now, let's stop suspecting each other."`
`"That's right.`
` We may be useless as far as searching for the culprit is concerned.`
` ...We can only stay alive until tomorrow, inform the police, and follow their instructions.`
` Because the police will definitely expose who the culprit is."`
`"......What is it, Eva?`
` ...Is your body still feelin' bad...?"`
`"M-Mother, what's wrong?`
` Are you okay...?"`
`"...Sorry.`
` ...It looks like my fever is still strong.`
` I'll be fine, so leave me alone..."`
`When they looked, they saw Eva staring at the floor, her breathing harsh again.`
`...She had been able to act firm for a time, due to the urgency of their situation, `
`but it seemed her body wasn't at its best after all...`
`"Yeah.`
` I killed those two.`
` Now, we're the only ones who know about the gold.`
` I won't give up even a scrap to the other siblings."`
`"......What have you done...?!`
` There was so much of that gold, right?!`
` Giving Rosa and the others their share wouldn't have been a problem at all, right...?!"`
`"It would.`
` ...That gold is to be passed on only to the Head of the Ushiromiya family.`
` That's because it, as a whole, represents no more or less than the honor of the Head."`
`"...To wound that even a tiny bit...`
`is definitely not something that I, the new Golden Witch, Beatrice, will permit.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"...Do you plan to continue these murders according to the witch's epitaph...?`
` Do you actually plan to become a murderer five more times...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` If I don't finish that annoying ceremony, it seems my power as a witch won't become complete.`
`...Hey, 'me'.`
` ...The power of the witch is really awesome.`
` It really can make all the crazy things we imagine become reality.`
` The power to make dreams more than just dreams...!`
` Now that I've learned of this power, I can no longer stop being a witch.`
` If I can finish the ceremony and make my power complete, I'm sure I'll be able to teach you that feeling too.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Stop acting like an fool...!`
` Haven't you played at being a witch enough?`
` We found the gold.`
` And we've even been promised the position of the Successor.`
` We'll probably need to tightrope walk just a bit, but by now, that's a dream that will definitely come true.`
` ...Beyond that, what more could you wish for...?!"`
`"I wanted to become a witch."`
`"I don't give a damn about that dream...!"`
`"That's right.`
` Because I kept holding onto that dream, I've lived at this age forever.`
` ...When you became an adult, you threw that dream away."`
`"...No matter how long you wait, the rabbit holding a clock won't visit you,`
` and you won't be able to meet Humpty Dumpty.`
` Of course, you definitely won't be invited to the land of cards.`
` Because you gave up and accepted all that, you became an adult."`
`"So you don't want to become a witch or anything like that anymore.`
` ...You've even forgotten that it truly was your own dream at one point."`
`"...Anyway, stop it!`
` I've already gotten my hands on two dreams!`
` The gold and the position of Head.`
` That's more than enough!`
` So please, your dream has nothing to do with me!`
` Stand down...!!"`
`"......No waaay.`
` Magic's too interesting.`
` ...Also, those two dreams of yours both came true because of my magic.`
` It wouldn't be fair if my dream didn't come true too."`
`"I'm grateful for your magic, and I acknowledge that you're a real witch.`
` ...So just stand down and return to the inside of my heart!`
` And never appear again!!"`
`"No wa-y.`
` ...We're both misunderstanding each other, aren't we?`
` That's right, I am not you anymore.`
` You are Ushiromiya Eva.`
` I am the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
` So it's not my responsibility to go back inside your heart.`
` ...I guess I feel like a butterfly who's broken out of her cocoon, meaning you."`
`'!s1`
`...haah...`
`...urg, `
`...the fever...`
`is making my mind cloudy..."`
`"My inexperience with magical power is forcing me support it with your vitality.`
` Until I finish the ceremony and become a full witch, you might have to bear the burden.`
` I'll take that as payment for making two of your dreams come true."`
`"...It's fine, don't worry, okay?`
` For the remaining five sacrifices, I'll avoid your family."`
`"Let's see, Rudolf, Kyrie, Krauss, Natsuhi.`
` ...After that, what about that old geezer Nanjo?`
` Perfect, I'll kill those five people.`
` *giggle*giggle* Could you call this a murder announcement revealed only to yoouu?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`Eva finally crouched down.`
` Hideyoshi rushed up to her and lent her his shoulder...`
`"...Are you okay?`
` ...Let's take it easy and rest!"`
`"Are you all right...?`
` Doctor Nanjo, take a look at Eva...!"`
`When Nanjo and George tried to approach, Eva made a gesture to stop them.`
`"...Thank you.`
` I'm fine, Doctor Nanjo.`
` I'm taking medicine.`
` ...I apologize for saying this during such an extreme situation, `
`...but let me rest a little longer..."`
`"Mom, ...I'll lend a hand too..."`
`"Thank you,`
` but I'll be fine as long as your father watches over me.`
` ...Go back to the second story cousins' room and don't come out no matter what.`
` ...Understood...?`
` No matter what happens, you must not leave the guesthouse...`
` ...Outside, `
`...that...witch will...`
`uuuu..."`
`"Don't talk anymore...!`
` Sorry, everyone, but I'll be watching over Eva in our room.`
` Tell us if something happens."`
`Hideyoshi and Eva retreated from the lobby.`
`...However, Eva wasn't the only one who wasn't feeling good.`
`They hadn't gotten a wink of sleep since the previous night...and had been pressed by tension since that morning.`
`...They were mustering their energy to protect their families,`
` but if they relaxed even a little, surely everyone would be down and out...`
`"...Everything has gone as planned until now, but from here on out, it will become difficult, you see?"`
`"Difficult, meaning...?"`
`"Indeed.`
` Normally, as the ceremony progresses and the victims increase in number, they begin to tighten their guard,`
` and in most cases, they hole up in one place and stop moving.`
` That is extremely inconvenient for us."`
`"...Are you saying that we witches are inferior to a bunch of Humans in a group...?"`
`"Witches are never inferior to Humans...`
` However, perhaps you could say that times change, and that Humans have gotten their hands on a poison...`
` ...This wasn't a problem long ago, when people believed in witches,`
` but just like that annoyance Battler, people in the current era deny magic on a fundamental level."`
`"In other words, their existence itself is anti-magical.`
` As a result, at some point, they grew to possess a toxin inside their bodies that denies magic."`
`"In other words, you're saying that the more Humans there are, `
`the stronger that magic-resisting toxin gets, and the greater the disadvantage is for us witches?"`
`"...The combined amount of power in their hearts that denies magic...in other words, their magic resistance power, becomes the denominator in the equation of your magic's power...`
` Understand?`
` Is that a bit too difficult for you...?"`
`"You're joking.`
` Actually, I understand it easily.`
` ...In other words, you're saying that the more people there are who don't believe in magic,`
` and the stronger their will is, the more the effects of our magic are divided.`
` ...Yeah, if it's so formulaic, I'll have to rethink my method of attack."`
`Fundamentally, magic possesses a vast power.`
`It can even make a rain of fire fall from the heavens or divide a sea, and reviving a lost life isn't impossible either.`
`However, that power is extremely weak against the toxin that rejects it.`
`And that toxin started piling up in Humans since the time they forgot to respect things sacred,`
` ...until finally, this earth was covered with enough toxin that the miracles of magic could not be displayed.`
`Thus, witches from across the world were chased from their dwellings.`
`...They had been forced to choose to throw away their magic and live as Humans, or else live in hiding in remote areas where the toxin of Humans didn't reach.`
`In that sense, Rokkenjima, with its population of only a few dozen humans, was extremely favorable for witches.`
`And even more favorable was the existence of the ghost story about the witch who lived in the Rokkenjima forest.`
`...In other words, by permeating the island with the fear that a witch might exist,`
` the magic-resisting toxin from the Humans was weakened.`
`A small population...and room for them to acknowledge magical beings.`
`In other words, minds that were only weakly anti-magical.`
`...Only by existing in the valley where those two converged...could a witch live in modern times...`
`"I see...`
` ...So, using this formula, we can arrive at several rules for how a witch can use her power efficiently."`
`"The first is presentation.`
` Create a murder scene that couldn't conceivably have been done by Humans, decorate it in an occult way, `
`make it look very much like a witch exists, and permeate people with fear to make them believe that witches exist.`
` As a result, the anti-magic power and the denominator for our magical power will be decreased.`
` ...I see, so this is why the creepy magic circles of the first twilight were created?"`
`"Th-That's right, exactly...!`
` The gaudy scenes for the first twilight in each game are all for that reason.`
` It's definitely not as though I like being cruel or am doing it for fun..."`
`"...In that case, Predecessor-sama,`
` you failed this time around.`
` You killed them in a very plain way.`
` It doesn't look like anything more than a simple mystery."`
`"......I heard about last time and the time before that from Ronove.`
` You should've damaged the corpses more grotesquely, like you did then, making it look more like fantasy and instilling fear in those people."`
`"......W-Well, about that.`
` ...I thought it wouldn't be artful to do that every time, you see...?`
` Don't think too deeply on it, it's just a whim...!"`
`Actually, it really had been her whim.`
`After what Battler had said to her, she couldn't say it out loud anymore,`
` but she really had decided her methods of killing based on mere whims.`
`No, would it be better to say that she had halfheartedly let Ronove decide?`
`After all, she left the closed rooms of this game's first twilight to him.`
`But if she'd had a cruel idea, then she would surely have explored the limits of atrocity even worse than in the previous game...`
`"............`
`You told me to show some restraint when deciding Rosa's and Maria's deaths too,`
` but that wasn't a course of action beneficial to us witches either, was it?"`
`"In actuality, by now, none of them believe one bit that a witch actually exists.`
` They're totally sure that it's a mystery, not a fantasy.`
` This turn of events is a failure from a witch perspective.`
` ...For some reason, you keep doing things in a kinda lukewarm way, Predecessor-sama."`
`"Aah, ...l-like they say, things you learn when you're young will definitely help you out in the future...!`
` This is a test passed on from my predecessor to you.`
` Take it on with respect.`
` Wahahaha...!"`
`Beato tried to laugh heartily,`
` but it was obviously the fake laugh of someone trying to cover something up, `
`and the new witch shrugged with a sigh.`
`"............`
`...At this stage, it's probably too late to create a scene and reduce the anti-magic power.`
` ...In that case, there's another move.`
` Getting the Humans to split up should work."`
`"Indeed, that is probably the most effective way.`
` The smaller the number of Humans, the more the denominator shrinks.`
` As a result, the magical power functions instantaneously.`
` In other words, it all begins from one point: how to destroy this barricade situation and have them split up into small groups."`
`"However, they are already very cautious.`
` The barricade won't be destroyed easily, right...?`
` Both the barricade in Kinzo's study two games ago and the barricade in the parlor last time were very stubborn.`
` Furthermore, most of the cunning adults still remain this time."`
`"The situation is more difficult than all the ones before it, understand?`
` ...If you wish, I could give you some special advice..."`
`In a closed circle, when the first murder case occurs, the survivors always hole up, `
`gathering together to observe each other and ensure their safety.`
`...Funnily enough, not only do mystery authors and murder culprits worry about how to break that situation apart, `
`but so do witches, who supposedly exist at the other end of the spectrum.`
`For a while, the new witch poked her cheek with her pointer finger, `
`and after acting as though she was planning something, she spoke.`
`".........`
`...No, I'm fine.`
` After all, it is a test.`
` ...I won't borrow your moves."`
`"Nn, ...really...?`
` ...Still, it will be rather difficult to defeat this barricade, right...?"`
`"I've already made my move.`
` I'm pretty sure it'll work.`
` And it'll definitely work on someone smart."`
`"I-Is that so...?`
` You really are excellent...`
` I'm pleased to see that my disciple won't be causing me much trouble."`
`"My motto is to study things myself before asking other people.`
` ...Then, if you would excuse me.`
` I have to wait for my prey to get lured out."`
`"Indeed.`
` ...Well then, handle it with care."`
`As the new witch lowered her head, her face blank, she turned into gold butterflies and vanished.`
`...Beato didn't look happy at all.`
`She seemed to be lonely because of how little she was being relied on.`
`"......Not one of them gives a fig for me.`
` ......Hmm.`
` You witch apprentice, acting so smart...`
` ...I'll bet she makes some painful mistake and starts crying."`
`"Then, without a doubt, she'll finally realize my greatness and beg me to teach her!`
` *cackle* Until then, I shall watch from on high."`
`She laughed loudly on the outside, but a laugh no one can hear is completely pointless.`
`Beato gave up and quickly stopped laughing.`
`...Ronove chose that time to show himself.`
`"Excuse me, Milady.`
` ...The game of the second twilight with Battler-sama has ended."`
`"...Nn, I see.`
` Good work.`
` What was the result?"`
`"My sincere apologies.`
` I was forced to resign.`
` ...By saying in red that 'both deaths were homicides', `
`I made Battler-sama revise his claim of 'Rosa strangled Maria to death, then died in an accident',`
` ...but I could not repel his chain of moves placing Eva as the principal offender."`
`"Wasn't Eva sleeping in her room the whole time as Hideyoshi cared for her?"`
`"...He put forth the possibility that Hideyoshi was an accomplice, and that the two worked together to create an alibi."`
`"He even suspects Hideyoshi...?!`
` Couldn't you have struck back by saying in red that he was in the guest room at the time of the murder?"`
`"...I also thought of that, but multiple important pieces might have been taken several moves later.`
` ...And, because this move might be connected to the new Beatrice-sama's strategy,`
` I acted out of respect to her.`
` ...My apologies."`
`"Strategy, you say?`
` ......Her mind does seem to be sharp.`
` ...Hmph, we can let her do as she pleases.`
` It will be quite a show to see how far she can go."`
`"Pukukukuku.`
` I thought you would say that.`
` ...I see that the un-cuteness of your disciple has left you in a bad mood."`
`"That's none of your business.`
` I wonder how that one plans to destroy this barricade going forward.`
` I shall keep a close eye on her.`
` ......Oh, and...`
`...h-how was Battler's mood?"`
`"It appeared as though he had calmed himself down.`
` He did say that he couldn't get fired up after all, without you as his opponent."`
`"R-Really, well that's no surprise, no surprise at all!`
` If I don't return for the fourth twilight and after, Battler will probably be lonely himself...!"`
`"Pu ku ku ku...`
` And with that, if you would excuse me.`
` ...I need to go bake some delicious cookies.`
` I must at least enliven the discussion between you and Battler-sama, Milady."`
`"Indeed!`
` That guy really was munching your cookies, wasn't he?`
` It's no surprise that a boy can eat so much.`
` Make a lot of them...!"`
`"Certainly.`
` I shall make enough cookies to bury the table."`
`"That sounds great...!"`
`"...What's going on?`
` What did you want to talk about...?"`
`Kyrie called Rudolf out into the corridor.`
`It was obvious that she wanted to talk about something that she didn't want the others to hear.`
`"Umm, I..."`
`"Yeah?"`
`"......I want to go outside."`
`"...Certainly, the body cannot last with nothing more than a small breakfast, but..."`
`"Of course, we understand.`
` Still, as time passes, it'll get darker and darker out.`
` It's probably at its brightest now.`
` It's the most convenient time."`
`"Only about an hour has passed since Rosa-san was attacked.`
` This is simply too reckless...!"`
`It was only natural that Natsuhi was yelling about recklessness.`
`...After all, Rudolf had said he was going to the mansion to get food.`
`Certainly, on top of their fatigue, their hunger was tormenting them.`
`In the beginning, a mild level of hunger had been just what they needed to fight off drowsiness.`
` However, it now just made their minds hazy, since it was still only midday, and their bodies felt like they were reaching their limits.`
`The thought of going to the kitchen in the mansion and bringing back some food certainly was attractive.`
`"I am opposed to this.`
` It may be a little rough, but we definitely shouldn't leave this place."`
`"...Don't worry about us,`
` but it would pain my heart to keep the children hungry...`
` I must be responsible as a parent."`
`"D-Dear...!`
` Now that Father is dead, you are the Ushiromiya Family Head.`
` It is not permissible for you to take on such a danger...!"`
`"......You're right.`
` It's like Natsuhi-san says.`
` Krauss-san, you should remain here, as our leader."`
`"...Then who will go to the mansion?"`
`"I think it should be Kyrie and me, and Hideyoshi-san too.`
` Hideyoshi-san and I have guns.`
` They shouldn't be able to lay a hand on us that easily."`
`"Rosa-san also had a gun, but she was attacked.`
` ...Won't it be dangerous?"`
`"...When I went out to check on Rosa and Maria-chan, I had a gun, but I was alone.`
` And yet, I wasn't attacked.`
` ...Maybe they'll be cautious if their opponent is a man."`
`"We'll have two men.`
` And even two guns.`
` Those two will act as guards, and I'll transport our cargo using a cart.`
` I believe the situation will be significantly different than it was for Rosa-san."`
`"If you're countin' on me 'cause I'm a man, I'd be happy to help.`
` I may not look it, but I'm built up pretty strong from pushin' food stands around.`
` Leave the heavy liftin' to me!"`
`"You men can devote youselves to guarding.`
` There's a folding cart in the servant room, and using that, I should be able to handle carrying the food.`
` ...Of course, we'll be careful.`
` And if we can succeed in this adventure just once, `
`there won't be any need for us to take risks again."`
`"......Is there any way I can get you to rethink this?`
` It may be painful for everyone to deal with empty stomachs, ...but even so, we do not know what is happening outside now..."`
`"We'll take care.`
` ...And Eva's feelin' pretty darn bad right now.`
` We can't let her stay hungry.`
` If her stomach's empty, she can't take her medicine.`
` I have to go out for Eva's sake as well."`
`"How is Eva?"`
`"Looks like she's finally gotten to sleep.`
` ...She has a high fever.`
` If we just leave her be for a while..."`
`"...You can't just stand still when it comes to your wife's health...`
` ......Understood.`
` I'll give you permission to go outside."`
`"Then, we'll take a little trip there and back.`
` A speed contest.`
` Canned food's okay, right?`
` You at least have a can opener here, don't you?"`
`"Y-Yes.`
` We have a can opener and a bottle opener..."`
`"There's running water in the guesthouse, so we won't need anything to drink.`
` We need to get ten people's worth, so no being picky about what you get."`
`"All right!`
` Why don't we dash out and bring it back quickly?`
` There's no time to open umbrellas...!"`
`"See you, Aniki.`
` I'll trust you to look after this place."`
`"...Take care.`
` ...Under normal circumstances, I'd want to go too.`
` ...Being a man, I despise how this title of the oldest brother prevents me from lending a hand in an emergency like this."`
`"This is about the only time we get to show off.`
` Sit back and take it easy every once in a while, Aniki.`
` Okay, Natsuhi-san.`
` Wait here and get some towels ready or something.`
` We aren't using umbrellas, so we'll be soaked to the bone when we get back."`
`"U-Understood.`
` ...Take care."`
`Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi, `
`each leaving their own brave words behind, left the lobby...`
`Compared to the time Rosa and Maria had gone outside, the winds were much stronger.`
`Rudolf's group of three people jogged through the rose garden without umbrellas, holding their guns and a folded cart.`
`If everything had been still and quiet, without the wind and the rain, they would probably have kept their ears open and moved with caution.`
`But in this rain, even if some suspicious person was hiding nearby, it would be difficult to notice them.`
`Because of that, it had been Rudolf's plan to instead dash through the dangerous area.`
`...If there was a chance that their opponent was equipped with a gun, `
`then walking slowly with their guard up would only make them targets.`
`Taking swift action was probably the correct choice.`
`"......The rose garden.`
` It feels like we're just askin' to be attacked...!"`
`"Please, let nobody come out of there..."`
`Even as Rudolf and Hideyoshi continued to run, they looked around restlessly, vigilant of their surroundings.`
`Rosa and Maria's deaths had not been caused by a projectile weapon.`
`...However, it was easy to suspect that the servants had been killed in such a manner.`
`Will they come flying out of the dark?`
`Or will they take careful aim and snipe from the shadows?`
`...Either way, they couldn't relax their tension for even an instant.`
`But even so, when they reached the overhang in front of the entrance to the mansion and escaped the reach of the raindrops,`
` they felt themselves breathing a sigh of relief.`
`"No problems for the first step.`
` ...Unlike how it was for Rosa-san.`
` Maybe they can't get their hands on us easily."`
`"I'd like to believe that.`
` Kyrie, unlock the door while we keep a lookout."`
`"Sure.`
` Returning home to the mansion with a pair of SPs makes me feel just like an executive."`
`"Wahahahaha.`
` If we had a welcoming party of servants with a red carpet, it'd be perfect."`
`"A welcoming party, huh?`
` ...You never know.`
` Be careful."`
`As the two cautiously surveyed their surroundings, `
`Kyrie unlocked the entrance with the master key she had been given.`
`"It's open."`
`"Hideyoshi-san,`
` could you take the front?`
` I'll keep an eye on the rear."`
`"Understood.`
` Kyrie-san, try not to move from my shadow.`
` ...Okay, let's break in!"`
`"Rear guard, roger that. Covering...!"`
`"...Ah, men.`
` Even in a situation like this, you're just playing around, aren't you?"`
`"Give it up, that's how men are.`
` ...Seriously though, that stench is awful."`
`...It felt like the air in the mansion was stagnant with a gloomy silence.`
`And on top of that, it was still thick with the stench from Kinzo's burnt corpse in the boiler room, `
`and they were struck with an uncontrollable desire to leave the mansion.`
`"No problems in the front.`
` Just a short dash to the kitchen."`
`"Let's finish this quickly and head home.`
` This suit'll get fumigated with Dad's stench."`
`The three of them dashed towards the kitchen...`
`And after they disappeared from the entrance hall, ...the new witch appeared there.`
`"They were lured out just as planned.`
` ...Just as planned, they got caught in my trap."`
`The witch grinned.`
`...Thinking about it now, no matter how unbearable their hunger had grown,`
` it hadn't even been a few hours since Rosa and Maria had been attacked and had lost their lives.`
`In that case, why had they needed to recklessly leave the guesthouse...?`
`Until that question could be dealt with, the only answer was that they had been called out by the witch's magic...`
`"What reckless people.`
` ...They'll never leave this mansion alive.`
` Seal yourself, lock. Seal yourself, mansion!"`
`The instant she proclaimed that...`
`The mansion was sealed off into a separate world.`
`...Unless her barrier was undone, no longer would anyone be able to exit this mansion or enter it.`
`"...Spectacular.`
` To think that even though barely half a day has passed since you succeeded the Endless Witch, you can use magic this well.`
` ...That talent surprises me.`
` It's almost as though you were born a witch."`
`"Well, I have been a witch since the time of my birth.`
` ...Who taught you how to blink?`
` That's what using magic is like for me."`
`".........`
`...What a fearsome person."`
`The witch's face twisted with brutality.`
`...She just couldn't help looking forward to toying with someone's life again.`
`"Well then...`
` ...Gehehehehhihhihihihihihihyahya!`
` First up is Rudolf and Kyrie, but in what cruel way should I kill them...?!"`
`"...If you don't mind me saying,`
` your Predecessor-sama has left instructions that you are to restrain yourself from committing murders of unnecessary cruelty.`
` And, there is an etiquette for offering the sacrifices from the fourth twilight onwards.`
` For that, you must borrow the power of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory."`
`"...Oh, really?`
` Now that you mention it, that's right.`
` I could only play as I like with that second twilight.`
` .........Boring.`
` Just when I thought I could play to my heart's content like I did with Rosa."`
`"...But, that only counts for how they're killed in the end, right?"`
`"Meaning...?"`
`"I could just kill them however I want over and over again, revive them,`
` and then follow the epitaph during the last time I kill them, right?"`
`"...So, in the end, no matter how I play, it isn't a problem.`
` ...Who'd act well-behaved with an entertaining power like this...?!`
` Kuhhihihihihihihi!"`
`Her absurd argument was, for an Endless Witch, an extremely valid one.`
`The etiquette that controlled the manner of killing the sacrifices of the fourth twilight and onward was represented by lines like 'gouge the head'.`
`However, that referred to the way those people died in the end.`
`In other words, ...in the process leading up to that, she was free to tease and kill them however she wanted.`
`She just had to keep on reviving them...and follow the rules only when she killed them the final time.`
`Though Ronove felt that her innocent cruelty was part of her talent as a witch,`
` he was beginning to notice a innately brutal side of her.`
`"...They do say that apprentices are the most brutal of witches, and now I see this may be true.`
` ......Do as you wish...is what I would like to say, `
`but here, it may actually be wiser to show restraint.`
` They have guns.`
` Weapons with a high anti-magic power, such as guns, are the natural enemies of witches and demons."`
`The witch stared blankly at this demon butler, who was surprisingly afraid of guns.`
`"......That can't be right.`
` Shouldn't witches be able to take a shot from a bullet easily?"`
`"No.`
` It would be just as fatal for a witch as it would be for a normal Human.`
` ...To prevent that weak point from being noticed, `
`most witches rigorously strengthen their guard with a defense of protective barriers and furniture."`
`"Do I have any of those protective barrier things?"`
`"...Constructing a barrier to make even gun bullets ineffective requires much in the way of preparation and ceremonies.`
` I am afraid to say that Beatrice-sama currently has none of those.`
` Furthermore, you are currently ill prepared to summon furniture strong enough to block a bullet."`
`"So even though I've become a Great Witch with this much magical power, I really do have to be afraid of lead bullets.`
` ......It's annoying, but I don't have a choice.`
` So, in that case, should I call some furniture to act as my arms and legs?"`
`"Yes.`
` Leaving everything to your servants while not exposing yourself to danger is also a part of a witch's refined tastes.`
` Beatrice-sama, leave this to the furniture and hide in a safe place."`
`"......I get it.`
` ...I call on the Seven Sisters of Purgatory.`
` I don't care who, any two...!"`
`Leviathan and Belphegor responded to that call.`
`"Leviathan of Envy, right here."`
`"Belphegor of Sloth, right here."`
`"Show me your power.`
` Your targets are Rudolf and Kyrie.`
` Don't attack Hideyoshi.`
` ...Come on, show me just how cruel you can be, furniture."`
`"...My apologies,`
` but we've received orders from the Predecessor-sama to refrain from unnecessarily cruel actions."`
`"Buuut, I think the Predecessor-sama's order does give us some leeway to tease them.`
` Do you still wanna go through with it?"`
`"Hmph.`
` I get it, I'll compromise.`
` ...Don't let them die easily.`
` Thoroughly corner them and let them taste the fear of death before killing them.`
` ...Will that be okay, Ronove?"`
`"Yes. Depending on the degree, I do not believe there will be a problem."`
`"......Then, go!"`
`""Yes, leave it to us...!""`
`"Your opponents are armed with guns.`
` ...For those such as you, dodging them should be easy, `
`...but if you are hit, the wound will be fatal.`
` Proceed with an appropriate level of caution."`
`"Don't worry.`
` We aren't that incompetent."`
`The two Sisters of Purgatory vanished.`
`Ronove bowed and vanished himself.`
`"......There are even rules on how to kill them.`
` ......Why do I have to be constrained by my Predecessor-sama?`
` ......It's so rigid and boring."`
`As the witch looked up at the portrait of the Predecessor Beatrice hung in the hall, she cursed...`
`The three people had already arrived at the kitchen and were gathering food supplies.`
`Considering the possibility of poison, they gave up on the alluring fruits and vegetables...`
`and gathered a whole cardboard box full of only the safe canned foods.`
`It was very heavy, but by piling it on the cart, they could carry it well enough.`
`This should be more than enough for ten people to hold out until tomorrow's breakfast.`
` That should carry them until the boat arrives.`
`The two men were supposed to be focused solely on guard duty, but the weight of the load was tough on Kyrie even with the cart.`
`Hideyoshi, who wanted to show off his power, switched to be the cart-pusher, and Rudolf and his wife took up the task of guard duty.`
`"With all this, even George and the kids will be full.`
` The trip back'll be a picnic, so let's go...!"`
`When Hideyoshi vigorously announced their departure, Kyrie frowned and seemed to be gazing into the distance.`
`...There was a wall in that direction.`
`...No, if her gaze could go through that, there was the main hall beyond it...`
`"......What is it, Kyrie?"`
`"...It's vague,`
` ......but I've got a bad feeling gnawing at me."`
`Kyrie stopped walking and narrowed her eyes even further.`
`"......Women's intuition?"`
`At times like this, Kyrie's intuition often rang true, even when she didn't have a logical reason.`
`...Rudolf believed in that intuition.`
`"Yes.`
` Someone's probably waiting to ambush us.`
` ...I didn't sense them before,`
` ...but just now, I felt it.`
` ...Just now someone...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~set up an ambush for us~ib~`
`."`
`"...Then there's no reason to go back the way we came.`
` There's a back door over there, right?`
` Let's leave that way."`
`Rudolf made to unlock the back door.`
`When goods were carried into the kitchen, they never passed through the part of the mansion that the family came and went from.`
`So outside the back door, there was probably a ramp used to carry things in.`
` Surely, they would be able to leave through there with the cart.`
`"...What the heck?`
` ...It's stuck.`
` ...Damn, what's going on?"`
`"Can't you open it?"`
`"Nope.`
` Is it broken?`
` It isn't giving an inch..."`
`Rudolf tried various things, first using force, then coaxing it,`
` but the lock was as hard as stone and didn't even budge.`
`"...Don't force it. Let's leave through the front entrance.`
` Right now, it'll be even worse if we stand around wasting time."`
`"............"`
`"...You think this is a trap?"`
`"...I don't know.`
` Be careful."`
`With strained expressions, the three of them returned to the hall again and headed for the entrance...`
`"Wh-Who is it?!!"`
`The instant they exited into the hall, Rudolf noticed a suspicious shadow right in front of them and yelled...`
`In that instant, a storm of gold leaf started blowing, and gold butterflies covered the area with a gold color.`
`"......I can't believe it.`
` A lowly Human predicted our ambush?"`
`"I-It isn't my fault.`
` I was hiding my presence...!"`
`"Don't hesitate!! Fire!!!"`
`The two guns spouted fire.`
`The lead bullets blasted right through the magical defense of the pair as easily as though it were a wet paper wall,`
` ...but the two figures that should have been there had disappeared.`
`Certainly, guns were frightening objects for them.`
`...But there was no need to fear as long as they weren't hit.`
`They at least had enough speed to dodge those.`
`"Wait a sec!`
` You won't even give us a chance to say our names?!`
` This is why I hate Humans!"`
`Leviathan was a full 10 meters from where she had supposedly been, popping her head out from behind the pillars in the shadow of the staircase and protesting.`
`"In accordance with Beatrice-sama's orders, we will hunt you down!`
` Our orders tell us to make it take some time and to tease you.`
` You are free to resist, but know that it will be useless...!"`
`That voice came from overhead.`
`Belphegor could be seen on top of the hall chandelier.`
`Elegantly looking down upon them, she proclaimed their execution with a cruel smile.`
`"...Wh-`
`What are these girls...?!"`
`"Forget the cart!!`
` We have two opponents, so if we split up, they can't chase all of us!"`
`All three of them were well acquainted with the inside of the mansion.`
`In case of a crisis, they had planned to run off in separate directions,`
` returning to the guesthouse by breaking windows or leaving through a back door.`
`Fighting was forbidden.`
` ...As long as they could fully escape.`
`"Hahaha, in a tight spot, escaping is victory...!"`
`The three of them ran into the depths of the mansion at full tilt.`
`That pair of furniture calmly watched them go.`
`"...I'll kill the woman.`
` You take the man!"`
`"Understood."`
`The furniture in the shadows of the pillars and on the chandelier made their figures explode,`
` and, leaving behind only the sound of a hopping beetle knocking against the wall, they pursued their respective targets.`
`Their speed was overwhelming, and they easily blocked the others' paths of retreat.`
`"......Let's see what this furniture's got.`
` I hope they're at least able to amuse me..."`
`"Beatrice-sama, it may not be prudent for you to reveal your form unnecessarily..."`
`"And you don't unnecessarily move your king away from the center.`
` That's part of a monarch's...`
`...and a witch's dignity!"`
`Belphegor was already blocking the way in front of Rudolf, who had boldly tried to escape to the second floor.`
`"It's useless to try and resist or escape.`
` ...You don't need to think about anything.`
` Just close your eyes.`
` I'll gently end it all for you."`
`"You'd make a good wife.`
` Husbands love to hear that kind of thing when they come home all tired."`
`"To think you're still relaxed enough to speak with such insolence at a time like this...!`
` Beatrice-sama, thank you for this excellent prey!`
` Die!!!"`
`Rudolf shot first.`
`But even before that bullet could hit her, Belphegor had already moved behind Rudolf's back.`
`She then raised a purple curve springing out from her arm...`
`However, incredibly, before that arm could decapitate Rudolf, he had swung his gun behind him.`
`The barrel remained pointing behind his back...from the same motion with which he had reloaded the sawed-off gun one-handedly.`
`It was pointing right at Belphegor's chest...`
`*click*, *cha-clunk*...!`
`It was the sound of the ejected empty cartridge finally hitting the wall after the reload.`
`In other words, it meant that the next shot was already fully loaded.`
`Without turning around, his gun pointing right at Belphegor's chest, Rudolf grinned.`
`"......Not bad......`
` ...For a middle-aged man...!!"`
`"Don't look down on the generation that loves old Westerns, okay?`
` You brats don't know anything about the refinement of a lever-action."`
`Just like Rudolf, Kyrie was also confronting a demon stake in the first floor corridor.`
`"What a moron.`
` You could've just escaped with your husband.`
` You do know that was your final farewell just now, right...?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"Don't worry.`
` This kind of thing is my husband's specialty.`
` I'm sure he'll come for me on a white horse soon.`
` Because he's never failed to come and save me when I'm in trouble.`
` ...Not even when Asumu-san was around.`
` Heheh."`
`"Heheheheheheheh!`
` What a happy couple.`
` I'm jealous.`
` ......I am Leviathan of Envy...!`
` Envy itself is my power.`
` My anger, my lifeblood!"`
`"I agree.`
` Envy is the source of a woman's power.`
` ...And if that is power, I won't lose to a girl like you."`
`"Hahhahahahahahahahaha!`
` Imagine saying that to the one who governs envy!`
` You actually think I'd let you two be reunited...?!!`
` Ahhahahahaha, I'll give you a tragic farewell!!"`
`The arm Leviathan swung was trailed by a purple curve.`
`It was a magic blade that cut with the power of malice.`
`Kyrie blocked it with her gun.`
`...Even though the magic blade should have cut through the metal like butter, the 'gun', with its extremely high magic resistance power, `
`was able to block the blade as easily as if it were a rolled up newspaper.`
`Rapidly, two times, three times.`
` It blocked all of them.`
`And, without missing the opening created when that purple curve took a swing upward,`
` Kyrie kicked Leviathan in the stomach with her heel.`
`Leviathan was knocked away like a lightly dancing feather.`
`...Before the demon stake's feet touched ground again...`
`Kyrie was already pointing her gun directly at Leviathan in midair.`
`From that position, the two women who had called envy a form of power met each other's gaze.`
`"...C-Can you do it?`
` Can you pull that trigger...?!!"`
`"I can be brutal when my husband isn't around."`
`"Owowowowowowow!!"`
`Rudolf tumbled down the staircase.`
`He'd been gradually cornered by Belphegor...and had been pushed back into the main hall they'd started from.`
`"......The Predecessor-sama's furniture is pretty good.`
` They aren't very flashy though!"`
`"Beatrice-sama...!`
` It isn't over yet, and it's dangerous to show yourself...!"`
`".........Don't tell me you're...`
`...Eva?"`
`"That used to be my name.`
` But it's different now, Rudolf."`
`"You don't have to tell me.`
` You're gonna say you're the Golden Witch, Beatrice, right?"`
`"Ehheheheheh, ahhahahahaha!`
` How did you know?"`
`"...Since the time Rosa was killed, I had a vague idea.`
` ......Rosa, forgive me.`
` Forgive me for sending the sister you hated down to the hell you're in...!!"`
`"Beatrice-sama, look out!!!"`
`Rudolf mercilessly pointed the barrel of his gun at the witch who claimed to have once been his sister.`
`But Belphegor would not permit that and attacked savagely.`
`She dashed, disappeared, and headed for Rudolf's back...`
`...She dodged that shot and again headed for Rudolf's back...`
`...And vanished over and over, instantly moving into Rudolf's blind spots.`
`It was almost like she was a fairy.`
`As she blinked in and out of vision, Belphegor incessantly drove towards Rudolf.`
`"Maybe this is kinda fun.`
` Rudolf, let me sit back and watch to see how long your brave efforts last you.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`At that time, there was a dull tearing sound, along with Rudolf's cry of anguish.`
`Rudolf's reaction to the dance of the purple curve that pressed upon him had finally been too slow,`
` and he'd let it lightly cut his flank.`
`That single wound slowed him down just once.`
`That led to a new wound, which slowed his actions again.`
`Belphegor's dance began to swallow Rudolf whole...`
`Watching Rudolf's body gradually get carved up, his former sister let out a shrill laugh.`
`Leviathan could no longer hide her irritation that Kyrie hadn't suffered a single fatal wound.`
`"......I really am a moron.`
` ...Among the Seven Sisters, I was always the slowest to grow.`
` I was always slow, always weak, always stupid."`
`"...That inferiority complex became envy, `
`and when I convert that into power, I gain a strength greater than that of any of the sisters."`
`"It's important for young girls to have a moderate inferiority complex.`
` It teaches women about cosmetics and hard work."`
`"I don't like having to use the limits of my power against mere Humans,`
` ...but I can turn my envy of your ability to trust completely in your husband into power."`
`"...I don't like it.`
` Why are you so relaxed when you're fighting for your life?"`
`"...*giggle*`
` I wonder?"`
`"......I get it.`
` You're fully convinced that your husband will come to your rescue and save you.`
` ......Isn't it incredible, that trust of yours?`
` It's enough to make me jealous."`
`What kind of trust did we sisters have for each other?`
`The sisters are always looking down on each other, trying to thoroughly lambast each other when things already look bad...!`
`"I've always been bullied by my sisters.`
` I've always wanted just one person to take my side.`
` ...So when I see you with a single ally who's completely trustworthy, `
`I feel the strongest envy..."`
`"......Aaah, that confident expression of utter belief in your husband...!`
` I can feel it giving me power...!!`
` ......I might even surpass that.`
` The speed of sound!!!"`
`Leviathan turned herself into a stake, and the speed of her flight as she attacked was proportional to the strength of her envy.`
`"Since the day my sisters looked down on me,`
` I was jealous from the bottom of my heart of the other six, who grew quickly!`
` I was jealous for seven days and seven nights!!`
` You can see the power I gained as a result in my speed...!!`
` Die, Ushiromiya Kyrieeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`The demon stake exposed her true form, leaping about at a terrible speed.`
`The noise from her bouncing off the walls sounded like a machine gun.`
`By now, Kyrie probably couldn't tell if it was a single stake or a swarm of beetles flying and bouncing around.`
`Leviathan was over 100% certain of her victory, believing in it from the bottom of her heart...!`
`Then, Kyrie spoke with an unbelievably calm voice.`
`"......I was the one who went out with Rudolf-san first.`
` ...Asumu-san blatantly cut in between us...`
`and shrewdly got pregnant."`
`"...I don't blame Rudolf-san.`
` That woman used her body as a weapon to seduce him, and then acted even more repulsively,`
` cornering Rudolf-san and forcing him to get engaged to her."`
`Asumu-san had been carrying Battler-kun.`
`And at the same time, I was also carrying a boy.`
`...As fate would have it, our delivery dates were on the same day.`
`"Then, Asumu-san gave birth to Battler-kun.`
` ...But I had a miscarriage.`
` ......I think about it, sometimes.`
` What if Asumu-san had had the miscarriage...and I had been the one to give birth?`
` ...Would Rudolf-san have broken off his engagement and married me?`
` ...But I couldn't give birth to my child.`
` So until Asumu-san died, `
`and until I got pregnant with Ange, I cursed Asumu-san and was jealous."`
`Let Asumu-san die.`
`Then, I want him to marry me. In my envy, I kept cursing like that, over and over, until Asumu-san finally died.`
`I was certain.`
`I was certain that I'd used the power of magic to curse and kill Asumu-san.`
`But that didn't quell the flames of my envy.`
`Don't tell anyone, okay?`
`Every time I look at Battler-kun, I remember that woman.`
`Every single time I look at him,`
` ...I think that if only my child had been born, he would be the same age.`
`I'm still jealous of her, tormented by her.`
`Even now, and from now on.`
` Into the future, for all eternity.`
`"You say you were jealous of your sisters for seven days and seven nights...?"`
`"...Th-That's right..."`
`Don't make me laugh, little girl.`
`'!s1`
`and who's burned with envy for 18 years...?!!"`
`'!s0`
`If Leviathan had the power of 24 hours x 7 days, or 168 hours of speed...`
`'!s0`
`was 24 hours in 1 day, `
`365 days in 1 year, `
`and 18 whole years...`
`Even without counting leap years, `
`that was 157680 hours.`
`...Compared to Leviathan's power and speed, `
`it was more than 938 times greater.`
`So then, even if Leviathan could soar at the speed of sound, 1225 km/h,`
` ...to Kyrie's eyes, it only looked like `
`1/938 of that.`
`'!s0`
`...a speed of...`
`1.30 km/h.`
`...They say a human's walking speed is 4 km/h, so it was even less than half of that.`
`This is almost the same speed as a baby crawling on the floor.`
`Which means, which means, which means...!`
`In the time it took the demon stake to move at a pace so slow that you could count all the bits of dust floating through the air, `
`Kyrie looked at it with pity.`
`She pitied the slowness at which it came towards her.`
`Then, she lazily raised the barrel of her gun.`
`Almost as though she was trying to swallow the demon stake up with the gun barrel.`
`'!s0`
`...Try harder next time, little girl."`
`"Rudolf, what happened to all that vigor from a couple seconds ago?`
` You're supposed to slice up a fish while it's still flopping around.`
` After it dies, it isn't interesting anymore.`
` That's enough.`
` Why not kill you now?!"`
`"......Nng, ...damn it..."`
`"I'm surprised you managed to endure this long after being carved up.`
` ...That's enough.`
` From now on, you don't need to think about anything.`
` I'll steal away your life painlessly...!"`
`"Wait, ...there's a favor I wanna ask.`
` At the very end, I wanna do one of those..."`
`"...What do you mean, one of those?"`
`"You know, that thing you see in all the Westerns.`
` We start with our backs together, walk three steps, and then *bang*."`
`"......Ah, a duel.`
` Very well.`
` If that will satisfy your regrets in this world, I'll accept."`
`Rudolf moved his wound-covered body and turned his back to her.`
`Belphegor responded and turned her back to his.`
`...Belphegor had an honest nature that was uncommon in a witch's furniture.`
`"Let me warn you.`
` Even if you press the barrel of your gun between my eyebrows,`
` I can move instantaneously, even faster than you could pull the trigger and have the bullet reach my skull."`
`"...Yeah, I can feel that already.`
` ...You're faster than a bullet."`
`"I have agreed to this out of respect for your courage in challenging me to a duel despite that knowledge.`
` Thank me."`
`"...Well, you're an honest and principled person.`
` And a good woman.`
` You might just steal my heart away."`
`"Let's begin.`
` Three steps will do fine, yes?`
` ......First, one step."`
`"...Two steps."`
`"...Three steps.`
` Is that okay?"`
`"Yep.`
` ...And, since you still haven't noticed after walking three whole steps,`
` ...it's my victory, miss."`
`"What...?!`
` ............Ah...!"`
`Rudolf turned around and fired a bullet.`
`...However, Belphegor could easily see through the speed and trajectory of a bullet like that.`
`It should have been no problem at all to dodge it.`
`But a spray of fresh blood flew about.`
`...Belphegor had set up an adequate magical defensive barrier.`
`But before an incarnation of anti-magic power such as that bullet, it was completely meaningless.`
`"......What are you doing?`
` Why'd you get hit...?!"`
`The bullet had hit Belphegor right in the chest.`
`...The pain from the lead caused her to grimace, as did the pain from the denial of magic...`
`"...Forgive me.`
` I'm a coward of a man."`
`'!s1`
`...ggghh..."`
`"Wh-What a killjoy.`
` To think that furniture of a witch could be defeated by a Human...!`
` Know your shame.`
` Worthless, pathetic...!`
` If only you'd just grovel and die!!"`
`"......Quit it, Aneki.`
` ...She could've dodged it.`
` But she didn't."`
`"...She realized that you were in the line of fire, Aneki.`
` So this faithful girl took it without dodging, protecting you.`
` At the very end, she saw that I was pinning the rook and the king."`
`"...S-Spectacular......"`
`"Don't hate me for it.`
` ...I planned to resign if you noticed it while you were taking those three steps."`
`'!s1`
`out of consideration...`
`...for me, didn't you...?`
` ......I didn't even try to think about it.`
` ...I...`
`was...`
`lazy......"`
`"...You were a good woman.`
` Go to heaven before me and get yourself all made up.`
` I'll definitely come and chat you up."`
`As Belphegor slowly fell over, ...she lost even the power that kept her in human form,`
` and she grew small, like gold dust, melting into thin air...`
`At that point, Kyrie dashed in.`
`It seemed that she had somehow defeated her pursuer by her own hands.`
`As she pointed the barrel of her gun straight at the witch, she ran up to the wound-covered Rudolf.`
`"...Are you okay?`
` Were you chatting someone up just now?"`
`"Yep, a good woman.`
` ...No match for you, of course.`
` ......Sorry, Aneki.`
` It's checkmate."`
`The two of them pinned the witch down the barrels of their guns.`
`"......Worthless furniture.`
` ...To think they'd be beaten by Human opponents.`
` ...Worthless.`
` Stupid.`
` ...Boring...!"`
`"Beatrice-sama, we should retreat for now.`
` ...There is no furniture or barrier to guard against bullets here."`
`"Eheheheh, `
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch began to let out a muffled laugh.`
`...It surprised not only Rudolf and Kyrie, but Ronove as well.`
`......Because a situation like this, with two guns pointed at her, `
`was not one that even a witch could just laugh off.`
`But the witch laughed with pleasure.`
`"......Well, it's only natural that the Predecessor-sama's worn out furniture couldn't do it.`
` ...I need to get new furniture that's suitable for me.`
` I used them out of obligation,`
` ...but I've always hated second-hand stuff."`
`As she said that, she looked down at Belphegor's remains, which had already finished turning into a pile of gold dust, with disgust.`
`"I don't know what you're talking about.`
` Be a good girl and put your hands up."`
`...Then, the witch obediently raised her hands.`
`But instead of raising her hands because a gun was being pointed a her,`
` it looked more like she was a conductor facing an orchestra, waving her conductor's baton.`
`"Come, arise, furniture suitable for me...!!`
` Not that cheap furniture, much stronger ones!`
` Cruel ones!!`
` Ahhahahahahahahahahahahyahhyahhya!!!"`
`"Stop this bizarre act...!`
` I'll pull the trigger..."`
`In response to the witch's call, the hall was once again buried with the color of gold.`
`As the brilliantly radiant gold butterflies danced,`
` ...it felt as though they were being sucked into an ocean of gold leaf.`
`Ronove was shocked at that upsurge in magical power...`
` After all, it far surpassed that of his former master.`
`As their eyes were dazzled amidst this golden flash, a gunshot could be heard.`
` Either Rudolf or Kyrie had fired a round.`
`...Then, when the golden flash subsided, at the very least the witch was standing there, looking cool and composed.`
`The bullet?`
` Kyrie must have fired it into her.`
`But the witch had not been hit anywhere on her body.`
`There it is.`
` ...The bullet had been fastened in midair right in front of the witch's chest.`
`"...A-A bullet-proof barrier......!"`
`In an instant, a barrier that would require a significant amount of preparation even for the Predecessor had been...`
` Ronove's face was twisted in shock.`
`And, the surprises did not end there...`
`The cloud of gold butterflies had created two humanoid forms.`
`...It was a furniture summoning.`
`The butterflies peeled off and flew away, and beneath them, furniture in the shape of girls showed themselves.`
`".........The Chiester Sisters Corps...`
` ......Even the Predecessor...`
`...wasn't able to summon Pendragon's Memorial Troops on a moment's notice, and to do it so easily...!"`
`"Chiester 410. Riiight here."`
`"Chiester 45. Right here."`
`"...You two are suitable furniture for me, I take it?"`
`"From reading a picture book out aloud, to going on a date, to shooting down meteorites,`
` we'll take care of anything. Nihihi."`
`"I-If we don't take care of it, Pendragon-sama will get mad at us...!`
` Please, your orders, Great Lady Beatrice!"`
`"......Rudolf-san,`
` let's run for it.`
` We're no match for these ones...!"`
`"...S-Sure!"`
`Kyrie definitely heard warning sirens going off in her head, `
`thanks to the same feeling that had alerted her to the ambush by the Seven Sisters of Purgatory.`
`Without hesitation, they escaped.`
`As the witch elegantly watched them leave, she commanded her new furniture.`
`"...This is an order.`
` Kill the two who ran away.`
` Then bring the corpses back here.`
` I'll bring 'em back to life and play with them over and over.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`The witch's expression twisted into an evil smile.`
`Even though she feared that expression, Lucifer appeared and spoke.`
`"F-Forgive my presumption,`
` ...but the Predecessor-sama asked that you avoid brutal actions of that sort..."`
`When the witch stared at her with those terrifying eyes, Lucifer was struck dumb.`
`...She was frustrated.`
`It was so boring, not being able to let her own power and cruelty run wild.`
`...This annoying furniture of the Predecessor kept telling her to show restraint, bringing her irritation to a peak.`
`"Oh, it's Lucifer of Pride.`
` Long time no see nyeh, how ya doin'?`
` Let's play together again sometime.`
` Nihhihihihihihi!"`
`"Y-You mustn't whisper, 410, you'll get in trouble...!`
` Let us carry out the Great Lady Beatrice's order at once...!"`
`"Nihi.`
` Well, yeah, we are on the job right now nyeh.`
` ...410, roger that.`
` Preparing for Sniping Pursuit Combat."`
`"Accumulating Terrain Data, Accumulating Data for Firing.`
` Data Link with 410."`
`"410, Data Received.`
` Target Lock Acquired.`
` Commencing Terrain Calculation Error Correction.`
` Formulating Firing Curve, Supplemental Control Point Calculations Complete.`
` Data Link to 45."`
`"45, Data Received.`
` Checking Hazard Zone...ah, that's no good!"`
`"Lucifer-chan, better get out from behind us, `
`or you'll get roasted by the backblast. Nihi!"`
`"......Nng..."`
`Thanks to their paired measurements, `
`the Chiester Sisters were able to instantly calculate the terrain throughout the mansion and the coordinates of their targets,`
` as well as a firing curve to reach them.`
`...That's right, their shots could be guided to follow a curved line.`
`None could escape.`
`The precision guidance used by the Seven Sisters of Purgatory was nothing more than a cheap knockoff of the ability these two held.`
`"45, Firing Preparations Concluded.`
` Ammo Type Selected and Loaded."`
`As the two of them faced each other,`
` it was as though they were both pulling back a bowstring together...`
`...A dazzling gold arrow was readied there.`
`"410, nihi.`
` Firing."`
`After giving that announcement, they released a single arrow together.`
`As the path taken by the gold-sparkling snake of light drew a curve,`
` it followed the direction that Rudolf and Kyrie had escaped to in rapid pursuit.`
`It turned through the corridors, crawled over the floor, chasing them as it drew a beautiful curve.`
`No one could block the guided shots of the Chiester Sisters.`
`No one could escape from them.`
`And their strength could pierce all physical and magical defenses.`
`...It was quite a merciless guided weapon of certain death.`
`However, among mythical-class soldiers, it was a weapon used by pretty much everyone.`
`It was very commonplace for them...and very extraordinary for those of the everyday world.`
`"Wh-What the...?!"`
`When he noticed something rapidly chasing them and turned around...`
`The exact position of Rudolf's heart was pierced by the gold snake.`
` It all happened in an instant.`
`"R-Rudolf-san...?!"`
`After the gold snake pierced Rudolf, `
`it swooped down to the floor, drawing a beautiful spiral, coiled itself around Kyrie's legs, and crawled up to her chest.`
`And just like Rudolf, it pierced the exact location of her heart.`
`...And all of that happened in an instant.`
`It pierced Rudolf, and then Kyrie.`
`So they died, dropped to their knees, and fell over at almost the exact same time.`
`"...What's thiiis?`
` Talk about overwhelming, ahhahahahahahahahahahahaha!`
` Ridiculously easy, isn't it?`
` Kuhhihihyahyahyahyahya!`
` This is the kind of furniture I need.`
` Way different from Predecessor-sama's second-hand furniture!"`
`"Come on, bring their corpses here.`
` I'll keep reviving them until I'm bored, and I'll try killing them in as brutal a way as I can think of.`
` Aaah, to think being a witch could be so much fun, `
`that taking a life could be so much fun, ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!"`
`...From the time humans are born, the most shunned action they can take is the murder of another human.`
`It's only natural that humans can't understand how pleasurable it can be to break this taboo.`
`...But she was no longer a Human.`
`She was a witch.`
`...And there were some pleasures that only witches could understand.`
`By now, she had tasted those pleasures...and was totally immersed in them.`
`...After learning that the contents of the forbidden pot were honey, she could no longer live without them.`
`...No, maybe the contents were honey because they were forbidden.`
`Anyway, by killing Humans gruesomely, `
`and doing it over and over, she could feel the drug-like pleasure even now.`
`As the witch rolled over laughing, `
`the gold snake that had just been shot returned as though being reeled in.`
`At the tips, two people were pinned and dragged along.`
`The witch's order had been fulfilled.`
`...Rudolf and Kyrie had been killed instantly, and their corpses had been carried back.`
`"Chiesters 45 and 410, Order Execution Complete.`
` We await your next order, Great Lady Beatrice.`
` Please, your orders...!"`
`"From babysitting, to playing online games with you, `
`to shooting down a space shuttle, we'll take care of everything.`
` Nihihi!"`
`"......It looks like these two are the sacrifices for the fourth and fifth twilights.`
` So in the end, I'll need those worthless Seven Sisters...`
`or are they the Five Sisters now?`
` I need those guys to pierce and gouge the forehead and the chest."`
`"...But I can do that at the very end, and I'm free to play in any way I want until then, right?`
` Heheheheheheheheheh!"`
`"Wait wait wait waait.`
` ...Have you already forgotten what I've told you?!"`
`"Oh, it's you, Predecessor-sama.`
` Do you have any complaints?"`
`"Of course I do...!`
` You're doing whatever you please, aren't you?!`
` Why haven't you followed my directions?!"`
`"What's wrong with doing as I please, Predecessor-sama?`
` Anyway, I don't plan on deviating from the rules of the ceremony in the slightest."`
`"I'll definitely clean these two corpses up later and drive stakes into their forehead and chest."`
`"I'm telling you, that is not the problem...!`
` If you act so undignified and cruel...`
`umm, some people might take it badly..."`
`"............`
`...You mean your opponent in that game, the one you're supposedly fighting against somewhere?`
` Ronove told me."`
`"...D-Damn that blabbermouth.`
` ......Well, to be perfectly honest, that's how it is.`
` If you go a little too far...umm, `
`...that person will object, you see?"`
`"Why can't this person just complain to me directly, instead of making you take a message?`
` ...That coward."`
`"......Well, this is a resident of a different world from yours.`
` There's no choice but to use me as an intermediary.`
` Well, that's beside the point but-"`
`".........`
`...Which means that this person couldn't interact with me even if they wanted to.`
` And I can't interact with them even if I want to either.`
` Simply put, this is a completely unrelated person from a world that distant, right?"`
`"I-Indeed.`
` ...For example, perhaps you could say these worlds are like very close parallel lines.`
` The distance between them is quite small, but because the lines are parallel, they will never cross.`
` For now, that should be a convenient way for you to view that world."`
`"They never cross.`
` Which means...`
`...that world has nothing to do with me.`
` ...If you're speaking for that person when you tell me to show restraint, please pass this message on to them."`
`"To them?`
` What should I say...?"`
`"It's none of your business, so disappear, you old hag.`
` If only you'd just give up and die..."`
`".........Wha..."`
`"...Oh, I'm sorry.`
` Since it was a friend of yours, I just assumed she'd be a woman.`
` By 'old hag', I'm definitely not talking about you, Predecessor-sama, so please don't get mad at me.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`When she spoke, the witch was looking straight into Beato's eyes.`
`...Anyone present would be able to tell what she meant by it.`
`"......Predecessor-sama,`
` there's something I find really strange.`
` ...Why do you have to play a game with someone from another world...`
`and have him accept that you're a witch?"`
`"Well, as to that,`
` ...it's because making all humans accept the existence of witches is a prerequisite of perfect control.`
` There was a single holdout who simply wouldn't accept me as a witch."`
`"......Why would you need the approval of a Human?`
` Witches are witches and can use magic, so why should we need to be acknowledged by Humans?"`
`"...Nnn...... Well, like I said earlier, magic is..."`
`"I am a witch.`
` I can use magic without anyone's approval in particular, so what's your point...?"`
`"In this world, right?`
` However, since that person won't accept it, umm, `
`...nnnnn, how should I explain it..."`
`"...I don't need you to.`
` After all, isn't all this about a different world that never crosses this one?`
` In other words, that world might as well not exist."`
`"......You fighting a game in another world is absolutely no different from you telling me about stuff from your imagination.`
` ...I'll say it again.`
` It has nothing to do with me.`
` And, I am already a witch."`
`"Predecessor-sama, somehow or another, it seems that you can't become a witch as long as this person doesn't acknowledge you, but I'm different.`
` Even though no one has acknowledged me, I'm an excellent witch already.`
` ......Since you are my predecessor, I will formally pay you respect,`
` but that's out of kindness, not out of duty."`
`"...I won't ask for your advice anymore...`
`because I clearly know what I should do and how I should play from now on."`
`"......So I will carry out the murder of 13 people as a final act of respect for you.`
` However, there is absolutely no reason for you to interfere with the methods I use...`
`or what I do afterwards.`
` .........Therefore, I'll be counting on you in that regard."`
`At a glance, those words seemed obedient, but they contained within them a clear parting of ways.`
`...She was no longer under Beato's care in any way.`
`That's why she was clearly saying nothing more than 'Don't get in the way of my fun'.`
`Beato understood that...`
`and was dejected, realizing that no matter how she explained it, she wouldn't be able to make the witch understand.`
`"...I......I see...`
` Then it is no longer my problem...`
` Go and learn with your own body how magic ceases to exist when you lose your respect for it."`
`"...I wish you'd tell me where the respect was in that carefree rampage of yours up until now."`
`After hearing that, Beato could not respond.`
`...Because she remembered hearing exactly the same thing from her teacher.`
`"Okay now.`
` Chiester Sisters?`
` See off my predecessor on her way back."`
`"Nihihihihi.`
` Predecessor-sama, please leave this place."`
`"I-If you don't, we'll be scolded...!"`
`Throughout her body, Beato felt something unseeable from the Chiester Sisters...which could only be described as an oppressive sensation.`
`...Most likely, they were initiating firing calculations.`
`It was an action much like taking out a gun and cocking it.`
`Even Beato could not escape from the Chiester Sisters' attacks without any preparation.`
`...In the past, she had placed her greatest trust in them, so she knew how terrifying they were down to her very soul.`
`"......Predecessor-sama, if you would retire.`
` ......I would not recommend damaging Beatrice-sama's mood any further."`
`"...Predecessor-sama..."`
`"...I-I understand.`
` ...I shall leave for now.`
` ...I'll watch over the end you eventually reach at my leisure!"`
`It was almost infinitely close to a parting shot.`
`...So, after Beato vanished, the witch and her furniture doubled over laughing...`
`"......Well, I do understand.`
` The endless power is fun.`
` ...The joy of freely toying with an extremely limited life cannot be explained to those who have not tasted it.`
` ...I can understand that feeling of being possessed with a pleasure similar to drugs."`
`"...It must have been quite fun,`
` judging by your antics in the past."`
`"Are you saying...it's just like when you tried to admonish me in the past, over and over, and I did not listen...?"`
`"......Why have you started trying to scold that child for her actions?"`
`"Nnn, ...umm, well.`
` ........."`
`"...There's a single large difference between you and that child.`
` That child may already be a witch.`
` Of course, you are also a witch.`
` ...At least, in the world on top of the game board."`
`"...However, to be acknowledged as a witch in the world outside the game board,`
` you need to have Battler-kun, your opponent in this game, acknowledge you.`
` ...You must have understood that when you started the game."`
`"...I thought that if I could show off a whirlwind of proof that I am a witch,`
` blow away his desire to deny me, and make him surrender, `
`......he would acknowledge me as a witch.`
` ...It all went my way last time, so I thought I was just a breath away..."`
`"It's actually the opposite.`
` Battler-kun was disgusted by your brutality.`
` He did not step up to the plate as a player because he acknowledged you as a worthy opponent.`
` It was based on a strong animosity, his resolve to completely deny the existence of a brutal witch."`
`"......In your foolishness, you probably felt that Battler-kun's acceptance of his role as your opponent was a first step `
`towards making him acknowledge you as a witch.`
` However, it was actually the opposite."`
`"Battler-kun challenged you in this game because he was absolutely determined not to acknowledge you.`
` ...No matter how hard the thoughtless north wind blows, the traveler only wears his cloak even tighter.`
` You were committing a huge error from the very beginning."`
`"......This game is not torture to make Battler-kun surrender.`
` It is a test, in which you must try to make Battler-kun accept you."`
`"......`
`...Uu...`
` ...I've vaguely...`
`noticed that..."`
`"The last game was a tough one for Battler.`
` But, as it seems you've already noticed,`
` ...this game is a tough one for you."`
`"Wh-What should I do from now on?"`
`"Think about it for yourself.`
` ...Fortunately, you have already given up your pieces on the game board to the new witch.`
` You should have plenty of time to reflect upon your own self."`
`"......But Battler's already a mass of hostility to me.`
` He won't accept witches, so he won't accept me.`
` ...In that case, what can I do to make him accept me...?`
` Are you saying that if the north wind doesn't work, ...then I should shine on him as the sun from now on...?`
` Me, after all this time...?"`
`"It's October now.`
` The Halloween season.`
` ......It's the month of rebirth, when the sun dies and is revived again.`
` When the sun is weak right after reviving, it may not reach far through the cold winter winds."`
`"However, it slowly grows...and is eventually able to hail the coming of spring.`
` ...At that time, the traveler may even fold up his cloak."`
`"......Are you saying...`
`that I've been mistaken......?"`
`...The beautiful hall of the Ushiromiya mansion was covered with a golden sparkle like gold leaf...`
`and stained deep red with thick spurts of blood.`
`The number of deaths given to Rudolf and Kyrie had long surpassed anything you could count on both your fingers and your toes.`
`The witch was breathing so hard her shoulders shook, but it wasn't because she was tired.`
`...She just couldn't hide her ragged breaths caused by her still uncontainable excitement.`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahaha!!`
` How fun it is to do as I will with people's lives and deaths!`
` With the power of the Endless Witch, the endless everything I paint with my mind becomes reality!`
` No matter how sloppily I mash them, `
`I can revive them, returning them to normal with just a snap of my fingers.`
` Because in the end, I just have to restore the corpses and follow the epitaph as an afterthought.`
` Ahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"...Hey, you guys,`
` have you ever sliced a stuffed animal's stomach open?"`
`"Never, nihi.`
` What about you, 45?"`
`"N-No...!`
` I have never done it, my apologies...!"`
`"That's understandable.`
` Normally, you wouldn't.`
` Especially not if it was a stuffed animal you liked.`
` But I've always thought about it."`
`"I always thought about peeking in...`
`and seeing what was packed inside this fluffy stuffed animal I loved."`
`If you cut it and looked inside, your curiosity might be quelled, but the stuffed animal would be broken.`
`...So, even though you want to see, you can't.`
`You understand that feeling, right?`
`"...The power of the Endless Witch can truly grant that wish.`
`  ...As I am now, I can slice the stuffed animal all I want."`
`"...And yet, with a bit of magic, I can return it to normal and revive it.`
` ...In other words, it means I've broken all limitations in this world.`
` ...As I am now, I don't have to hesitate or give up an idea or anything."`
`"That joy...aah, there's probably no one who can understand it.`
` No one other than me, the Golden Witch!!"`
`As the witch let out a mad war cry, she revived Rudolf and Kyrie again,`
` and faster than they could realize it, she killed them right away.`
`...And she made it known that something other than cotton was stuffed inside those two.`
`"...Q-`
`Quit it, Eva...!"`
`"Huh?`
` ...Ah, it's you.`
` How long have you been there?"`
`In that gruesome hall, Hideyoshi appeared with his gun readied.`
`The witch had sealed the mansion with a barrier, so Hideyoshi had nowhere to run.`
`...He'd probably picked up Rudolf's or Kyrie's gun and come back.`
`The gun, which should have been something to be feared, was apparently no longer an object she took seriously now that she was overflowing with magical power.`
`Her bold expression didn't flinch in the slightest.`
`"......Why did you have to kill Rosa-san and Maria-chan, `
`...and Rudolf-kun and Kyrie-san...?!"`
`"Huh?`
` I am the Head of the Ushiromiya family, the witch of Rokkenjima.`
` Everything that occurs on this island is all up to me.`
` ...Whether they happen to be alive or dead at any particular moment in time is meaningless to me."`
`"...You went mad after finding Father's gold...!`
` Just how high must that gold have been piled?`
` I can't even imagine it.`
` It must have been enough to steal away your sanity..."`
`"...But if there was that much gold,`
` ...why didn't you think of graciously splittin' it up...?!!"`
`"You misunderstand.`
` ......All of that belongs to the Golden Witch.`
` No one is qualified to touch it except me.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle* Ahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`"...What are you?`
` Don't tell me you're that thing Eva told me about long ago, ...the witch Eva from when she was young?"`
`"That's right.`
` I am the 'me' from my years as a girl, who's been living in the heart of your wife, Ushiromiya Eva, this whole time.`
` ...And I'm a witch.`
` ......Eva became an adult by forgetting me.`
` So she can't use magic."`
`"...All kids get their heads filled with innocent but cruel ideas sometimes.`
` When I was young, I'd sometimes go around steppin' on ants and pullin' the wings off dragonflies.`
` ......However, I learned the importance of life, and graduated from that cruel childhood age."`
`"...Right now, you really are a child!`
` ...A personality that I know Eva graduated from!`
` That personality isn't Eva.`
` It's a completely different human!!"`
`"That's right.`
` I am not Ushiromiya Eva.`
` I'm the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
` It's so fun, not being bounded by any limitations, and the pleasure of being able to do as I will with life and death is truly wonderful...!`
` I don't have to apologize for breaking a goldfish bowl,`
` and I can tear stuffed animals up as much as I want!`
` I-"`
`There was a crisp sound.`
`...It was the sound of Hideyoshi slapping the witch's face.`
`Looking at the hall stained deep red with fresh blood, he should have been able to imagine how terrible the witch was.`
`But without fear, without even hesitating, Hideyoshi had walked determinedly up to her and hit her on the cheek.`
`"............!"`
`'!s0`
` Don't act like you're cruel, not when you're really a coward and a weakling!`
` I'll correct that evil nature of yours again if I have to!!`
` You fool!`
` Fool!!"`
`'!s0`
`...ouch, `
`...hey...!"`
`"You're a woman who understands how important, how fragile a life is, aren't you?!`
` I'll make you remember...!!`
` What are you calling a 'witch', you stupid fool?!!`
` You're my wife, Ushiromiya Eva!`
` If anything, you're witch of the kitchen, who can always make the perfect snacks out of refrigerator leftovers in a flash!!`
` Won't you open your eyes, you fool...?!!"`
`"Didn't I just tell you...`
`that I'm not Ushiromiya Eva...?!"`
`"You stupid fool!!`
` You!`
` You!!"`
`As tears dripped down his face, Hideyoshi kept hitting the witch's head.`
`He wasn't even pointing the gun at her anymore.`
`Therefore.`
`That sound of gunfire couldn't have come from the gun Hideyoshi was holding.`
`...The gun, which had fallen in the corner near Rudolf's corpse, was floating in the air,`
` ...and smoke lingered near the barrel.`
`And the bullet?`
`......A red stain was slowly spreading across the chest section of Hideyoshi's vest.`
`Even though his back was facing the barrel of the gun, ...the bullet had driven through Hideyoshi's chest.`
`'!s1`
`va......`
`......uu..."`
`"...Like I said, I'm not Eva.`
` What a stupid, annoying man.`
` ...You're a pain, so I'll switch the sacrifice of the sixth twilight to you.`
` ...If only you'd just hidden under some bed shaking or something, I planned on letting you go.`
` ...But no, you went to all the trouble of coming back.`
` You really are a stupid man."`
`*thunk*...`
` There was a dull sound as Hideyoshi fell to the floor.`
`Even though death would have allowed him to escape from that pain, he resisted until the last second,`
` and staring straight into the witch's eyes, ...he passed away.`
`Because he had died without closing his eyes, the witch didn't realize that he was dead for a short while...`
`and remained pinned by that gaze.`
`"Should we make this one a new toy and play?`
` Nihi."`
`At those words, the witch finally realized that Hideyoshi was dead.`
`"......Nng, ...yeah.`
` ...Right, what'll we do..."`
`The Chiester Sisters waited for instructions.`
`On the inside, they imagined the sorts of even more brutal orders their master might give.`
`But the expression that rose to the witch's face looked as though she'd gotten over her excitement.`
`She looked down at Hideyoshi's face, which still had tears dripping down it...`
`"...It's such a killjoy, and it's all this guy's fault.`
` I'm done.`
` ......Ronove, are you there?"`
`"Yes, right here."`
`"Take care of the cleanup.`
` ...I'll bet the Predecessor-sama makes a fuss over this one.`
` Please make it clean enough for that old hag to accept. ...I guess I'll follow the rules of the ceremony, out of a sense of obligation to my Predecessor-sama.`
` Treat these three corpses as the fourth through sixth twilights.`
` Lucifer, it's your turn."`
`"Lucifer of Pride, right here."`
`"Dig into these three corpses and gouge them."`
`"...I-Into corpses?"`
`"That's right.`
` Got a problem with that?"`
`"N-No..."`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory had their own sort of pride.`
`It was the pride of a hunter, the pride of gouging prey that they had brought down themselves.`
`...However, being told to gouge a corpse that someone else had brought down ran contrary to that sentiment.`
`Of course, the witch didn't mean it that way, but for the Seven Sisters, it was horribly humiliating.`
`...However, they had already screwed this up, with two of the Sisters defeated, so they had no right to question her.`
`Only Ronove appreciated this, and he rested his hand on her shoulder in understanding.`
`"...This is an order from Beatrice-sama.`
` Lucifer, carry these three and dispose of them in accordance with the etiquette of the ceremony.`
` Then, when you are done, lend me a hand with the cleanup."`
`"Certainly..."`
`The witch looked down upon Hideyoshi's corpse, as though implying that the now delicate atmosphere was all Hideyoshi's fault.`
`"......Stupid man.`
` And you didn't even have to die."`
`"Dear...!!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!`
` Dear, where are you?!`
` You're there, right?`
` Answer me!!"`
`The crash of a thunderbolt woke Eva from her nightmare.`
`If Hideyoshi had been gripping her hand at that time, her fearful heart would probably have been instantly healed.`
`However, Hideyoshi, who had supposedly sworn that he wouldn't leave even for a moment, was nowhere to be seen in the room.`
`"Dear, `
`...answer me, `
`......dear...!!`
` Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!"`
`...30 minutes had already passed since Rudolf's group had left the guesthouse.`
`By any measure, their return was too late.`
`...And Krauss and Natsuhi, who waited by the entrance, were reaching the limits of their patience.`
`The chain was set on the door.`
`That was a precaution in the event that Rudolf's group was attacked and the master key stolen from them.`
`For that reason, they needed to wait by the entrance like this for the others to return...`
`"...They really are too late.`
` Don't you think something might have happened to them...?"`
`"......Indeed..."`
`Krauss glanced between his watch and the door, struggling to keep his composure.`
`"If...something happened to prevent them from returning..."`
`"...A terrible thought, but it seems we should ready ourselves for that possibility.`
` ...So, it really was too reckless after all."`
`"Th-That is what I said...!`
` Why did they go outside when they knew it was this dangerous...?!`
` How foolish!`
` Why go outside, even though Rosa-san had just been attacked...?!!"`
`"......Nothing will come of saying that now.`
` ...At any rate, there are now three adults in the guesthouse.`
` Me, you, `
`...and Eva, who's asleep with a high fever."`
`At that time, the forceful sound of a door being opened came from the hallway, and they heard Eva's panicked voice.`
`...That voice kept calling out Hideyoshi's name.`
`...It seemed as though she'd had a bad dream or something due to her fever...and was calling for her husband.`
`"Eva-san, `
`...what is it, are you okay...?"`
`"...Wh-Where is my husband?!`
` My husband isn't here!!`
` Even though he promised that he'd stay with me the whole time!`
` Even though he promised that he'd grasp my hand the whole time!!"`
`...Krauss was struck dumb by this attitude of hers, which she had never shown in front of him before, but Natsuhi understood her feelings.`
`"...C-Calm down...`
` Hideyoshi-san is with Rudolf-san and Kyrie-san, and they're outside right now."`
`"Outside?!?!`
` Wh-Wh-Why, `
`why did he go outside, `
`after he promised that he'd stay with me the whole time?!`
` You mustn't go outside, the witch is outside, you mustn't go, you'll be killed!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`"...Eva, calm yourself.`
` ...Hideyoshi-san returned to the mansion with Rudolf and Kyrie-san."`
`"Why did he have to go to the mansion?!!`
` Why did he go outside, even though it's safe here?!!`
` Why did he go back to the mansion?!!"`
`"............`
`...They went to get enough food to last until tomorrow.`
` ...Hideyoshi-san was worried about your health...and said that was partly why he wanted to go..."`
`"When will they come back?!`
` When will they come back?!`
` Don't go outside, don't go to the rose garden, don't go to the mansion!!`
` The witch is there, the Golden Witch is walking about!`
` If she finds you, you'll be killed, you'll definitely be killed!!`
` When will my husband come back?!"`
`"......They left here thirty minutes ago.`
` We are waiting for their return."`
`"Th-Thirty minutes ago?!`
` Isn't that strange? Why would it take so much time for them to go to the mansion to get food and come back?!`
` And why are you two just standing around here?!`
` We have to go get them!!`
` We have to hurry to where they are!!`
` Eeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!"`
`Eva probably had quite a nightmare.`
`...And, because it had continued even after she woke up, she could no longer hide her panic.`
`Natsuhi tried calming her down, but all it did was make Eva's emotions explode even more.`
`...Maybe they heard that disturbance.`
`Battler and the kids, who had supposedly been on the second floor, were peeking their faces through the crack of the lobby door.`
`Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva.`
` And Battler, George, Jessica, Nanjo.`
`...Everyone in the guesthouse had gathered by the entrance...and understood the current situation.`
`"I agree with Mother.`
` We should go to check on Father and the rest."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` It's even possible that their load's too heavy and they're having trouble carrying it.`
` They should welcome some extra hands."`
`"...Th-This happened right after Rosa-san was attacked.`
` ...This may have been a secondary disaster connected to that.`
` We should act with caution here and..."`
`"Don't be a fool!!`
` What do you mean, caution?!`
` Are you saying we should let my husband die, even though he might be begging for help?!`
` I'm going to look, and the cowards can stay here!!"`
`Looking agitated, Eva raised her gun.`
`Judging by her face, it would be useless for anyone to try and stop her.`
`...George, who realized that first, raised his head.`
`"I'll go as well.`
` You will too, right, Battler-kun?`
` The more people, the better...!"`
`"S-Sure!!`
` Aunt Eva, we're coming even if you tell us not to."`
`"...I-I'm coming too...!`
` I can't be the only one to hide in a safe place...!"`
`"Jessica, you must not go outside!!`
` Stay here with me.`
` Got it?!"`
`It was like they were implying that those three had already been killed anyway, so going outside would be pointless.`
`Natsuhi realized that Eva felt like her heart had been gouged out, but she spoke out strongly as Jessica's mother.`
`".........You're right.`
` That should be fine.`
` Let's have Nii-san's family keep an eye on the guesthouse.`
` This is a problem for my family and Battler-kun's.`
` And I wonder if Doctor Nanjo would mind coming too.`
` Just in case."`
`"......In the hall of the mansion, Battler, Eva, George, and Nanjo...`
`found the corpses of Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi."`
`"......The fourth through sixth twilights?`
` Then, the corpses were pierced through the forehead, chest, and stomach with those demon stakes?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...The demon stakes were buried into them: one in Rudolf's forehead,`
` one in Hideyoshi's chest,`
` and one in Kyrie's stomach."`
`"The disorder of the clothing on all three suggests that they were fighting or running away.`
` Since the three corpses were not found right next to each other, it is hypothesized that after coming into contact with the culprit, they attempted some form of resistance."`
`"......And they had stakes in the forehead, chest, and stomach.`
` ...Horrible, just like usual..."`
`"............"`
`Even though Ronove knew it would be superfluous, he contemplated telling Battler the truth.`
`...Normally, the witch would have killed them in a much, much more horrible way.`
`...The corpses had been left in this manner only because Beato had suggested to the witch that she show restraint.`
`The new witch, thinking it would fit well enough as long as she gouged them with stakes,`
` ...would probably have just stuck a stake into a lump of meat that wasn't even shaped like a Human.`
`Rosa's and Maria's corpses were a particularly striking example.`
`...If they'd been killed as the Golden Witch had wished, just how gruesome would the corpses have been?`
`Beato had changed that into the 'still better' kind of killing Battler had mentioned earlier.`
`Wanting to have Beato's small bit of thoughtfulness appreciated, he thought of telling Battler about this.`
`...But judging by Battler's eyes, that might do more harm than good.`
`To humans, the gap between being alive and being dead is very large.`
`Saying that she'd given them better deaths might have made it possible for a demon to understand her feelings and pardon her,`
` but there was no way a Human would be so accepting.`
`Understanding this, Ronove remained silent despite knowing of Beato's modest efforts...`
`"Just like usual, let's start by checking whether the corpses are dead.`
` ...Ronove, please declare it in red."`
`"............"`
`"Hey, can't you hear me?`
` ...Please declare it in red.`
` Repeat it.`
` 'Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi are dead'."`
`"......My apologies.`
` Allow me to decline from repeating that."`
`"The hell...?`
` What are you planning, all of a sudden...?"`
`By now, proclaiming that the victims were dead in red was almost a given in this battle.`
`Refusing to do that was almost like losing by default.`
`...So when Ronove refused as part of his first move, Battler was dumbfounded.`
`"My apologies.`
` As of this moment, I relinquish my position as Milady's representative.`
` ...Accordingly, 'I' cannot repeat that in red.`
` ...The only one qualified to repeat that...is Milady."`
`"........."`
`"...His point is a valid one.`
` Ronove is only a representative for Beato's side.`
` ...If he steps down from that position, and if you will not accept Beato as an opponent,`
` ...a new representative must be named."`
`"...No new representative exists.`
` ...Please, Battler-sama.`
` Please accept Milady as your game partner once more."`
`"......Sorry, `
`but that's advice I can't listen to.`
` ...I definitely won't accept that unpleasant, cruel bastard as my opponent.`
` ...My refusal to accept her is why I can't step down from this game."`
`"As to her being unpleasant, I apologize in Milady's stead.`
` Allow me to pledge that Milady will not undertake such unpleasant actions again."`
`".........`
`...I wonder about that."`
`"...Battler-kun,`
` I also want to apologize as that child's teacher.`
` I'll give that child a good talking to, so please offer your forgiveness just this once."`
`"...Hey, hey, enough of that.`
` You're making it sound like I'm the bad guy.`
` ...And no matter how much you guys apologize, it won't reach my ears.`
` ...If Beato can say that from her own lips, `
`......well, I might listen to her."`
`"......Understood.`
` If that is your only condition for acknowledging your opponent again, let us have that child apologize.`
` ......Ronove,`
` call for that child.`
` Will that be all right, Battler-kun...?"`
`"......Sheesh.`
` ...Do whatever you want.`
` Still, don't expect me to forgive her.`
` ...Go get that irritating witch."`
`"...You have my thanks, Battler-sama.`
` ...I shall summon her here.`
` ...Milady, Battler-sama is calling for you."`
`After a few heartbeats, gold butterflies gathered together in midair and created Beato's form.`
`...It was a much more docile appearance than the one's she'd made before.`
`"......Did you call, Ronove?"`
`"...I believe you heard.`
` ...Is there something you have to say, from your own lips...?"`
`"............"`
`"............"`
`It looked as though Beato shrunk slightly under Battler's cold gaze.`
`Several times, Beato made an effort to get the words out of her mouth, but that didn't work so well,`
` ...and she was just as awkward as someone trying to light a match during a freezing winter with icy hands...`
`Even as she did that, the game board was advancing...`
`In the hall, they had just found the corpses of the new victims and had broken down crying...`
`'!s1`
`...Kyrie-san, `
`...oooooooooooooooooohhhh, `
`...nnngaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh..."`
`"Dear, ...deeeaar, ...whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh...!!"`
`"...Mother, `
`...hang in there...`
` ...Even for me it's...`
`...so crushing...`
`...so sad...!!"`
`".........They probably died instantly.`
` ...I'm sure that, even if we had arrived immediately after they fell, it would have been too late..."`
`"No, that's wrong!!`
` They were definitely alive!!`
` His chest was stabbed with something like this...!`
` My husband must have died in extreme pain...!!`
` If we had come faster, ...surely they would've been saved!`
` They would definitely have been saved!!`
` Uuuuuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh..."`
`"...It must be tough...for you too, Battler-kun, ......but stay strong..."`
`"......I'm okay, ...it's okay, Aniki...`
` Let me cry just a little bit longer...`
` ...I've got it the best...`
` I should be the least sad...!`
` So if you let me cry just a little longer, ...I'll be fine..."`
`"That isn't true...`
` ...I can understand how much it must hurt your heart to have lost both parents...`
` ...I still have Mother.`
` ...That's much better than what you're going through, Battler-kun..."`
`"No, that's wrong!!`
` It's got to be toughest for you, George-aniki...`
` ...I understand, Aniki...`
` ...In this group, ...you're the saddest...and the one who has it toughest!!`
` I understand that, `
`...so I can't keep on sobbing like this...!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaggghhhh!!"`
`"...Why...do you say it's toughest for me...?"`
`"To me, Dad and Kyrie-san...were people I'd eventually split up with when I grew up and became independent.`
` Since they're parents, it was fated that they'd die before their kids.`
` ...It just happened a little early, that's all...!"`
`"......But it's different for you, Aniki.`
` You didn't just lose your parents, who would've parted ways with you eventually.`
` ...You also lost Shannon-chan, `
`...someone you should've spent the rest of your life with...!!"`
`"............"`
`"You can't value human lives differently.`
` Whether it's a baby or an old person, they should all be respected the same...!`
` ...But still, the more life that person has ahead of them,`
` ...the longer the future you're building together is, ......the sadder the fact of their death is...!!"`
`"Aniki, you were engaged to Shannon-chan, right?`
` You promised that you'd build a life and a home together in the future, right?!`
` ......Compared to how huge that future was, ...compared to how huge that happiness was,`
` ...stuff like my pain doesn't even come close...!!"`
`"......So you should be allowed to cry much, much more, Aniki...!!`
` And yet, ...just because you act like a big brother to us cousins, `
`......you force yourself to act like you're so calm...!"`
`"......Stop it, ...Battler-kun."`
`George was trying to make a calm smile.`
`...But already, ......he couldn't stop a single hot tear from leaving a streak down his face.`
`"...There's no way I wouldn't...`
`...be sad, right...?`
` ......Together with Shannon, I painted a picture of many futures in my mind.`
` We talked of dreams that couldn't all come true even if we lived a hundred years.`
` ...Of those dreams, `
`even the very first one, `
`......having her move into my family register, could not be granted, `
`......so there's no way I wouldn't...`
`...be sad, right......?"`
`"Compared to that, I...I...!!`
` Like I said, I have no right to cry any more!`
` When even you're struggling to hold it in, I have no right to shed any more tears!!"`
`"...We're the same.`
` ...We both feel the same sadness from losing those close to us.`
` ......So there's no rule that says you can't shed any more tears than me, Battler-kun."`
`"......And,`
` ...for me too, ...there's no rule...that says I have to hold back my tears any longer, is there?"`
`"...Aniki, ...Anikii...!!!`
` Aaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!"`
`"Shannon, the one who shared my dreams for the future, is dead.`
` Father's dead too.`
` ......It's so sad, ...so sad...`
` ...Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!"`
`As Battler and George hugged each other tightly, they cried a waterfall of tears over each other's shoulders for the people who had been so precious to them...`
`"......Do you understand why I said that George-aniki has it the toughest...?"`
`"...I-I was listening, so I understand.`
` ...Your sadness is proportional to the length of time you would have been able to spend with that person afterwards..."`
`"...Of course, you can't calculate it just like that though.`
` ......We Humans aren't like you witches.`
` ...From the time we receive life to the moment we die, we live within that limited period as strongly as we can manage."`
`"......I can't forgive anyone who makes light of that.`
` ...And I definitely can't forgive anyone who sneers at people and toys with them.`
` ...A person like you, whose very concept of death is all screwed up, probably can't understand that."`
`"............"`
`"...I'm not just mad because of the length of time they would've lived afterwards.`
` It's...sneering at the lives of people living with all they've got...`
` That's what I can't forgive the most."`
`"George-aniki lived his life by recklessly doing his best.`
` ...He must have approached this day with a grim resolve to marry Shannon-chan no matter the challenges.`
` ...That's completely different from me, since I was happy just to be able to meet my cousins after a long while."`
`"...B-But still..."`
`"Beato.`
` For now, stay silent and listen."`
`"......I-Indeed."`
`"......In a way, I understand your point.`
` ...You say you need to continue murdering according to the epitaph for your own resurrection."`
`"...So, considering your circumstances, `
`...I can just barely bring myself to understand your murders.`
` ...Because to you, it's a necessary course of action.`
` ...But that means all unnecessary actions you take beyond that...are due to your meaningless and brutal tastes."`
`"...In other words, if killing the six people for the first twilight was a 'necessary action' for you, `
`...then all that show of crushing their faces and splitting their stomachs and stuffing them full of sweets was completely unnecessary,`
` and caused by nothing more than your brutal hobby.`
` ......That's an aspect of you that I definitely cannot forgive."`
`"......I-Indeed..."`
`"When you saw Aunt Rosa getting repeatedly killed in that horrible way,`
` ...you apparently said something like `
`'If they're going to be brought back to life in the end anyway, it doesn't matter how they're killed.'`
` I heard from Virgilia."`
`'!s1`
`...well, `
`...umm......"`
`"That idea that you can kill them as many times as you want, as long as you bring them back to life in the end...`
` Isn't that a completely unnecessary action, with no purpose other than to toy around with someone's life?"`
`"......If you're going to kill, do it instantly!`
` Don't toy with them!!`
` If you won't kill them, then don't bully them!!`
` You're taking advantage of the fact that you can do as you will with people's lives, and you've forgotten the sanctity of life.`
` So I can't accept or acknowledge you...!`
` I definitely can't accept as my opponent a person who doesn't know the value of a life...or the sadness felt when lives are lost!"`
`"......That is why the Endless Magic is known as a black art.`
` ...The Endless Witch has no concept of limitations.`
` ...She has no concept of the limitations and losses caused by breaking and killing."`
`"...For that reason, Endless Witches sometimes start playing by jumping over the gap between life and death `
`like it's a game.`
` ......That is a very, very frightening thing.`
` So as an Endless Witch, and by my own choosing, `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~I never reached your level~ib~`
`."`
`It was something Virgilia had been trying to tell Beato for a long time.`
`But Beato had been too young to obediently listen to those words.`
` She had been too wild.`
`...She had been possessed by that detestable pleasure.`
`"...I have been told not to break vases.`
` ...But that's why I wanted to break them.`
` ......Then I gained the Endless Magic.`
` ...When I knew that I could fix them back to normal no matter how badly I broke them, `
`...I was surprised at how fun it could be to break a vase..."`
`"That is what's known as the forbidden honey.`
` People are not captivated by what's inside.`
` They are captivated by the sealed lock.`
` ......It is truly regrettable."`
`"......I want to ask you, Virgilia.`
` Why does this thing called the Endless Magic exist?`
` ...For what purpose does it exist in this world?"`
`"It is not limited to the Endless Magic.`
` ...All magic exists to bring happiness to the human world.`
` ...After everything that has happened, it may be difficult for you to believe, Battler-kun, ...but in order to bring blessings to the human world, `
`we witches are supposed to become bridges between humans and nonhumans, and that is why we train so hard."`
`"...How does reviving the dead and torturing them to death over and over again help the human world?"`
`"When a vase that was an important memento is broken, `
`if by fixing it, everyone will regain their smiles, I would repair it with magic as many times as necessary.`
` However, I would not be fixing it in order to break it again.`
` ...I would be reviving it to give humans happiness."`
`"In that case, `
`......Beato,`
` you fail as an Endless Witch."`
`"............I-Indeed..."`
`"...There's this thing I've been vaguely thinking about.`
` ......Why do I keep playing this strange game against you?"`
`"...Maybe this game isn't about making me surrender.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ...Maybe it's a test for you to be accepted as an Endless Witch...~ib~in the truest sense~ib~."`
`"...I-I don't know about that.`
` ...The reason I proposed this game to you was...umm...simply as a way to kill time...`
` There were no ulterior motives at work."`
`"Just now, I heard the definition of a witch from Virgilia.`
` By that definition, you, Beato, `
`are not even a witch.`
` You're an apprentice who's still in training...and who misunderstands her own power."`
`"...This was supposed to a fight between a witch and a human.`
` If you aren't a witch, then you aren't qualified to be my opponent.`
` ......Understand?"`
`"...You say...`
`...I am still...`
`...only an apprentice...?`
` Then, when will I be accepted as your opponent once again?`
` ...When can we resume this game?"`
`"......Who knows.`
` ...At the very least, it isn't now.`
` ...When you fully understand what I've said and become a real witch,`
` ...I'll probably accept you as my opponent in this game once more."`
`"I-I can't understand if you say it so abstractly like that...`
` Clearly tell me what I should do to earn your forgiveness..."`
`"No, I've said enough.`
` You think about the rest.`
` ......That's all I want to say.`
` ...If you can't figure it out, try talking with Virgilia and Ronove.`
` ...A brat like you should start off by listening to what the adults say."`
`"......Virgilia,`
` suspend the game for now.`
` Now that Ronove has stepped down as a representative, `
`all we can do is wait for Beato to gain the qualifications of a proper opponent."`
`"...Understood.`
` ...Until Beato has been acknowledged as having earned those qualifications, the game will proceed without an opponent.`
` Is that all right with you too, Beato?"`
`"...I-I have no objections.`
` ......I want time...and a place where I can think at a leisurely pace.`
` ...May I leave my seat for that?"`
`"......Yeah, that's fine."`
`"...Well then, see you...later."`
`"Wait.`
` ...Don't make that dejected face."`
`"............Sorry about that.`
` Letting everything inside my heart show up on my face is part of my personality.`
` I cannot deceive."`
`"Then maybe there's still some hope for you.`
` ......Let me promise you one thing.`
` In this game with you, I might win, and I might lose.`
` ...If you don't come back, it might be my victory by default."`
`At that point, Battler stopped talking for a second.`
`...Then he spoke forcefully.`
`"......However, I definitely won't be the one to step down.`
` I definitely won't give you a victory by default.`
` ...I'll keep on waiting here for you to sit there again as my worthy opponent."`
`"...Battler-sama..."`
`"......Thank you, `
`Battler.`
` ...I will definitely...come back and be accepted by you."`
`After showing a hopeful smile for a very short while, Beato vanished.`
`...After seeing her expression as she left, Battler was absolutely convinced that her face could tell no lies...`
`The seven survivors returned to the guesthouse once again.`
`By now, it was clear that those who went outside would not return alive.`
`Rudolf's group had gone out with two guns and a master key.`
`But those had been lost.`
`It was already clear that those had been stolen by the culprit.`
`Because the shutters were closed on the windows, they couldn't be opened even if the culprit had a master key.`
`The front and back doors that led to the outside were all sealed by chains,`
` and they were further blocked with sofas and tables.`
`Even if the culprit decided to break in through violent means, it wouldn't be easy for them.`
`"...At this point, the typhoon may actually be fortunate.`
` If it were clear outside, it might have been possible for them to set fire to the guesthouse."`
`"If there wasn't a typhoon in the first place, the boat would have arrived before noon.`
` That's not much of a silver lining."`
`"...Eva-san, how do you feel?`
` Please, try to take it easy."`
`"Thank you.`
` ...I still feel like I have a fever, but this is no time to complain about that.`
` ...For the children's sake as well, this is no time to be bedridden."`
`After crying so much in front of Hideyoshi's corpse,`
` Eva had felt a strong self-awareness of her position as a mother, and her expression conveyed a strong will.`
`...In actual fact, her fever still hadn't gone down.`
`And she was aware of that.`
`If she didn't keep a strong hold on herself, she felt as though the fever would make her mind hazy again.`
`By this point, the first floor formed a final line of defense set up by Krauss, Natsuhi, and Eva.`
`The children and the guest, Nanjo, had been strongly warned not to go downstairs without taking great care.`
`If the culprit used a ladder or something, it probably wouldn't be impossible for them to attack from the second floor.`
`But it wouldn't be easy for them to break those sturdy shutters from such an insecure position.`
`The second floor was relatively safe compared to the first.`
`Battler and George had also wanted to remain on the first floor so that they could fight if the worst happened, but Eva had put a stop to that.`
`In her mind, George was now the only member of her family.`
`It seemed that she didn't even want to expose him to the danger of coming downstairs to the first floor.`
`Krauss and Natsuhi could understand that feeling.`
`...Also, a great deal of time had passed since the siege began.`
`In the second floor cousins' room, Battler, George, and Jessica sat dazed...`
`and didn't even listen to the TV that had been left on.`
`For a while, Nanjo had been with them and had tried to lend them words of encouragement,`
` but when he realized that he might actually be having the opposite effect, he hid himself in his own room on the same second floor.`
`George kept looking dazedly at the photographs inserted in his notebook.`
`...It was from the time he'd taken a vacation to Okinawa with Shannon.`
`Shannon's happy smile was contained in those photos.`
`...George could remember the temperature and the humidity, the warmth and strength of the wind, `
`and even what he had been talking about with her at the time those photos had been taken...as clearly as though it had been yesterday.`
`So to George, they weren't simply photos,`
` but a door to bring back warm memories...`
`In this room, even though the sound of the typhoon and the TV should have entered George's hearing,`
` ...it was the scenery of Okinawa he had seen with her and her laughing voice that reached his eyes and his ears...`
`George had strived to be reborn after meeting Shannon.`
`He had sworn to separate himself from the timid person he had once been, `
`easily caught up in the atmosphere, unable to refuse a request, `
`and easily used by those around him.`
`...He had resolved himself to become a strong man who could make her life more joyous.`
`Therefore.`
` ...If he hadn't met Shannon, `
`...the man called Ushiromiya George would probably have lived a very different life.`
`And the George of that different life surely wouldn't have been as excellent a man as he is now.`
`The person I am now exists for Shannon's sake...`
`...Now that Shannon is gone, `
`...why do I exist?`
`It's completely meaningless, isn't it?`
`...He felt a deep, deep sadness, as though he himself had become empty.`
`That feeling must have been tormenting him this whole time.`
` ...However, until Battler mentioned it, he hadn't been aware of the feeling himself.`
`...He'd finally managed to remember...that it should have been all right for him to cry much, much more.`
`So he cried.`
`Just like Battler had, he cried himself dry.`
`...By now, his eyes were bright red and swollen, and he couldn't cry any more.`
`So George did his best to change his way of thinking.`
`He was not meaningless now, ...and he should be grateful to Shannon for giving him such a character.`
`The dead don't come back to life.`
`He would have to get over being separated from his most beloved person.`
`If he were to chase after Shannon and kill himself, she would surely be deeply dejected.`
`...It worked the other way around, too.`
`If he had died, and Shannon had chased after him, throwing away her own life, he wouldn't have been able to forgive himself.`
`...So he chose to surpass his sadness and anger...`
`...and decided to thank her instead.`
`After meeting Shannon, she made his days rich and full...`
`and taught him the meaning of working hard for other people's sakes.`
`As a result, she had shaped him into the kind of person he had wanted to be.`
`...He wanted to thank her for that.`
`He tried to quell his sadness in this way,`
` but each time he did, he remembered Shannon's smile...`
`......He understood it logically.`
`He knew that grieving any more than this would only make her grieve in heaven, `
`...but that didn't bring a stop to his sadness...`
`"Why is it...`
`...that when people die...`
`it's so sad like this...?"`
`Battler muttered.`
`...It was as though he was speaking on behalf of all humans.`
`His question probably hadn't been directed at anyone, but Jessica answered.`
`"...It's always sad when you have to say goodbye.`
` ...But when the person's old or there's some time,`
` ...when you know beforehand that it's coming, sooner or later, `
`that sadness gets spread out over a long period of time.`
` ...When misfortune comes suddenly, it's sad...because you don't even get that time..."`
`"......I see.`
` So, if they get sick or something and end up bedridden in a hospital, you might be able to ready yourself for it bit by bit, `
`...but when it happens suddenly someday, you don't get that luxury."`
`"...The sadness that's usually spread out over several years...closes in on you all at once.`
` ......That's pretty tough.`
` ...Sometimes, it makes you feel a sadness so deep, it can leave scars for life..."`
`"...Scars for life, huh?"`
`"...Like Grandfather's occult hobby.`
` People say that's what caused it.`
` ...That Beatrice, his mistress, died a long time ago, and he was so sad that he couldn't pull himself together.`
` ...Some people whisper...`
`that this is why he started sacrificing the rest of his life to occult research, in order to revive the dead."`
`"If that's true, Grandfather succeeded in that miracle in his last moments.`
` ...The culprit is the revived Beatrice, and Grandfather was reunited with her at the moment he was killed.`
` Pretty ironic that he revived her, and then got killed by her."`
`"......Even so, Grandfather probably managed to meet her.`
` ...He gambled half of his life and, even though it was only for a short time, `
`he was reunited with the woman he wished to see once again."`
`"...Then he got totally roasted though.`
` Feels like that result doesn't quite add up to the cost of researching for half his life."`
`"That's not true.`
` ......Even if it was only for an instant,`
` ...Grandfather must have been happy to be reunited with the woman he loved."`
`"......And that would be true...even if his crime of going against divine providence was punished by God,`
` and his body was burnt and sent down to hell, `
`...even if that reunion only lasted a very short time, right...?"`
`"George nii-san..."`
`"...I wouldn't care I met with the wrath of God and had my body burned.`
` ......Even if it was just for a short amount of time, `
`...if I could revive Shannon again,`
` .........I would sacrifice the rest of my life to the same research as Grandfather.`
` ...I want to talk with Shannon again, `
`...even if it's only for five minutes...`
` ...Even one minute would be fine...`
` ...In exchange, ...I wouldn't mind...sacrificing the rest of my life...!"`
`"......Aniki..."`
`When Battler and Jessica realized that their pointless discussion was causing George pain, they could do nothing more than shut their mouths...`
`...George directed his thoughts to Kinzo's life.`
`He sacrificed half his life to research that no one understood.`
`...And, on the last day of his life, he revived the person he loved most, `
`...and probably succeeded in his reunion in his final moments.`
`George didn't know how much time they'd had together.`
`...He didn't know if they'd been given an hour...or just five minutes.`
`However, ...that moment must have been enough to reward him for all those months of research.`
`...Even though he spent dozens of years to achieve it, that small amount of time was probably more than worth it to him.`
`Until today, I never believed in the occult or magic or anything.`
`Somewhere in my heart, `
`...I even made fun of Grandfather's research, thinking of it as nothing more than a pastime.`
`However, `
`...I won't make fun of it anymore.`
`...No, to the contrary, I'll believe strongly that it's real.`
`...If the power of belief can create miracles, `
`I'll probably throw away all of my studies up until today, `
`spending the rest of my life from today onwards studying magic.`
`......Give me the power of magic.`
`...And give me a miracle that'll let me see Shannon again...`
`"............`
`...Haha, ...ha.`
` ...Sorry, you two.`
` What am I talking about?`
` ...If you could revive the dead with magic, `
`...people would probably be researching it everywhere around the world.`
` ...But things like that don't exist in reality.`
` No one researches it.`
` ......That's because...they know the dead can't be revived with magic.`
` ......Sorry for saying something so weird.`
` It's my fault that the atmosphere here has gotten so strange.`
` ...Sorry for making you tiptoe around me, even though this is tough for us all."`
`...Even if I did it to divert myself from my sadness, maybe I did say something strange.`
`If I keep talking about stuff that's so weird, I'm sure it won't do anything good for their sadness...`
`But...that doesn't mean I can bear this silence.`
`"...I'll go downstairs and get another cup of coffee.`
` ...Mom's very particular about how she likes hers.`
` Does anyone else want a refill?"`
`Battler-kun and Jessica-chan lightly shook their heads.`
`Without pressing them any further, I took my mug and left the room.`
`The shutters were all closed in the hallway, so the corridor was very dim.`
`I tried visiting Doctor Nanjo's room and asking if he wanted more coffee,`
` but he said he didn't need any either.`
`...It seems my mother's orthodox method of making coffee isn't universally appreciated.`
`One time, I made some for Shannon, `
`...but she told me that while it was delicious, it was a little strong...`
`......Shannon......`
`That's no good...`
` ...Even though I left the room to change my mood, `
`...that image of Shannon's face filling my head hasn't faded in the slightest...`
`I keep seeing those fun days with her, more and more vividly, `
`......and it's saddening that I never even got a chance to see her dead face.`
`According to our parents, she was apparently killed with something like a gun or a spear.`
`...I'm sure they were just trying to console me, ...but they had said her dead face had been very beautiful and peaceful.`
`I wonder if she had the engagement ring I gave her last night...on her finger.`
`...If she accepted my engagement, she should have had it on the ring finger of her left hand...`
`Last night, we were both on the edge of losing it and not calm at all.`
`Shannon accepted my engagement pretty courageously, `
`but she might have regretted that as a rash action once she cooled her head.`
` She might have taken the ring off.`
`...I wonder if she has the ring on now.`
`...I want to be sure of at least that much.`
`I want to know how she felt...at the very end...`
`But...even if I do confirm that, ...it doesn't mean she'll come back.`
`......I wonder what will happen to her body.`
`After the autopsy, ...it will probably be immediately cremated.`
`Then, I'll never be able to see her face, ...even her dead face, for all eternity...`
`"......`
`...Haha, ...has the shock of losing Shannon...`
`made me go a little crazy...?"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`I don't want...her body to be burned.`
`If she's burned and turned to ash, ...never again ~ib~will it be possible for her to revive~ib~.`
`They say cremation is frowned upon in Western tradition.`
`...Because on the day of resurrection, there would be no body to revive.`
`Because of that, it seems that great criminals in Western history were often cremated after execution as a punishment,`
` and their ashes were sometimes scattered in rivers and such...`
`In other words, to Western people, death is nothing more than a sleep until the resurrection.`
`It is essential that the corpse is left after death.`
`'!s1`
`that's because...`
`...Western people...`
`......knew of a miracle that can revive the dead.`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, geo_3e140:`
`Now I understand.`
` ...I understand why Grandfather idolized the Western occult.`
`That was his only reason from the very beginning.`
`...Just to revive the person dear to him, ...Grandfather spent the rest of his remaining life researching the Western occult.`
`......The situation surrounding us now is abnormal.`
`Grandfather did revive his beloved Beatrice.`
`...And, that Beatrice has carried out a terrible serial murder, `
`with linked closed rooms that force us to conclude that magic was used.`
`...The Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
`The incarnation of the miracle of the Western occult.`
`......And also, the culprit who killed Shannon...`
`She's an entity I should hate, ......and yet, for some reason, I want to cling to her.`
`I wonder...if Shannon could be revived with the magic of miracles, which Grandfather bet his life on...`
`According to the legend of the Ushiromiya family, Grandfather met with her long ago and was given a vast quantity of gold.`
`...Then, if I also met with her, `
`...instead of gold, would she give me Shannon's life?`
`As collateral, I don't care what sort of devil's contract she imposed.`
`I wouldn't mind sacrificing all of my remaining life...`
`George probably couldn't believe or realize that his voiceless wish...`
`was heard by the witch herself, who stood right behind him.`
`Beatrice had been listening to that entire discussion between the children just now in the cousins' room.`
`...Battler had told her that she didn't know the value of a human's life,`
` ...and wanting to understand that in her own way, she had stealthily visited, listening in on their discussion.`
`".........`
`...That is your wish, you say...?`
` If I could grant that, would I be accepted as a witch...?"`
`Beato looked at the palms of both of her hands.`
`...She had handed over most of her once-surging magical power when the new witch succeeded the name of the Endless Witch.`
`Of course, her current power still made her worthy of being called a witch, `
`...but it could not begin to compare to her previous strength.`
`"...Hmm.`
` Even without the Endless Magic, I am a Great Witch whose name has been thundered for a thousand years.`
` Reviving the dead will be no trouble at all."`
`Inside her head, she thought about several magical steps she could take to revive the dead.`
`...Even magic that should have been easy in the past would be difficult with her current power.`
`She thought of something, then clicked her tongue, then did so again, over and over.`
`In the end, ...she finally thought of a single spell.`
`But that was a spell that she couldn't use by herself.`
`It was a spell that witches with weak power used, one that relied on the aid of others.`
`...In the past, Beato had looked down upon that type of magic.`
`Therefore, she frantically tried to search for any conceivable alternative, `
`......but in the end, she couldn't think of one and slumped over in self-derision.`
`Then, ...careful not to surprise him, she softly called out.`
` Softly, to George's heart...`
`"......Ushiromiya George,`
` ...can you hear my voice...?"`
`"...I can hear you.`
` ...Who are you...?`
` Are you really the witch, Beatrice...?`
` ...Or are you an illusion created by my sorrow...?"`
`"......If it's the former, please hear my wish.`
` ...And if it's the latter, just leave me alone..."`
`Their conversation in a mental world was a lot like having one in a dream.`
`When you dream, haven't you ever had the experience...`
`of casually accepting something that would've been absurd in the real world?`
`...The conversation in this world was like that.`
`So even though a witch appeared and started talking to George, he was not surprised...`
`"Indeed.`
` ...I am...the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
` ......Normally, you and I would not be able to talk together in this manner.`
` ...However, you are strongly conscious of me and wish to have a discussion, `
`...so both of our channels are able to match like this."`
`"......I don't care if the person who killed Shannon was you...`
`or someone else using your name.`
` ...As long as you exist as a real witch..."`
`"......I'll pay whatever cost you ask for.`
` If you desire my life, take it right now.`
` ...Please, I want you to bring Shannon back to life...`
` ......If that's impossible, I'd be satisfied if you'd just let me talk to her for a short while...`
` ...Please......"`
`"......I ask for nothing in return.`
` I shall grant that wish."`
`"...Really...?`
` Really, you'll revive Shannon......?"`
`"Indeed.`
` ...However, my current magical power is not sufficient to use the magic of resurrection.`
` ...Therefore, I must rely on your help."`
`"......If there's anything I can do, I'll do it.`
` ...Even if that means taking my heart out right here and now, I will not hesitate..."`
`"...I told you, I don't need anything like that.`
` ......I will chant the magic.`
` Then, a gap will open in the door to the Land of the Dead."`
`"...But as I am now, I do not have the power to bring Shannon's soul up through that gap.`
` ......However, you have strong feelings for Shannon, `
`and those feelings will surely become magic that can bring her soul out without fail."`
`"...What do you say?`
` Will you help me...?"`
`"...I will.`
` ......If Shannon's life will be restored, `
`...there's nothing I'm afraid to lose...!"`
`George's fists shook in silence.`
`...Then, he slowly came to his senses.`
`He had been absent-mindedly standing near the window in the hall that whole time, his mug still in his hand...`
`And...`
`......the witch from his dream...was still there.`
`"Wh...What the... ......I-It isn't...a dream......"`
`"...Be quiet.`
` I am very fragile now.`
` If any more Humans appear, I will not be able to preserve this form.`
` ...I shall grant your wish, so stay silent for now.`
` ...Understand?"`
`George covered his mouth with both hands, nodding enthusiastically several times.`
`In that instant, he almost dropped the mug he was holding.`
`George frantically juggled it around and caught it.`
`...He was afraid that if it fell to the floor and made a loud sound,`
` the witch's form might disappear like a bubble popping.`
`He softly set the mug on the floor...and stared at the witch in front of him again.`
`......Her form didn't disappear.`
` It wasn't a dream...`
`"Come, let us go to the parlor where Shannon sleeps.`
` With the power of your feelings, we will bring back her soul."`
`"Y-You say go, but how...?`
` My mother and the rest are downstairs.`
` There's no way they'd let us go outside.`
` ...And...didn't you just say that you wouldn't be able to preserve your form if another Human appeared?"`
`"...Come to think of it, that is true.`
` So, Krauss and the rest are downstairs.`
` ...In that case, we definitely cannot go down.`
` ...Well then, we just need to go to the mansion without going down to the first floor, right?`
` It's simple."`
`Beato laughed, as though she had thought of a pleasant prank.`
`...And with her golden pipe, she lightly tapped a window with its shutter closed.`
`When she did, three gold butterflies appeared from the pipe and opened the lock on the window as though melting it.`
`Then, the window opened without a sound.`
`The shutter beyond it was exactly the same.`
`The clasp unset itself, also without making a sound, and it quietly opened.`
`The window opened, exposing the wind and rain outside the mansion.`
`...Perhaps because of the direction or something related to the construction of the building, the wind did not blow inside.`
`Because of that, for a while, `
`George felt as though this entrance that opened to the outside was a dream or an illusion, and he couldn't accept it as real.`
`"Come, let us go.`
` Come with me."`
`Beato gently floated upwards.`
`It was a natural action, like that of a diver enjoying an underwater stroll.`
`...It made it easy to believe that if you acted like she did, `
`you too might be able to float in the sky just as though you were swimming through the water.`
`...No, George did believe that.`
`...So without thinking, just as she had done, he also...`
`...gently, `
`...as though swimming in the water, lifted his feet...`
`"...Ah, ......aaaaaaahh......"`
`"Hoh.`
` ...Not bad.`
` So, you learned how to dance in the sky faster than I could explain it."`
`George was shocked to find himself floating in midair like he was swimming.`
`...Of course, Beato was also shocked that George, who shouldn't have been able to use magic, had figured out how to do that just by instinct.`
`"......To be able to...`
`...fly in the air, `
`...to swim in the air..."`
`"...You mustn't be bound by reason.`
` Accept it as a natural thing.`
` ...You mustn't fall back to your Human doctrines, such as those of Newton and Einstein."`
`"Especially when flying high in the sky.`
` ...Inexperienced witches sometimes plummet to the earth."`
`"...I-I accept things for what they appear to be...`
` I-I accept things for what they appear to be..."`
`George repeated those words over and over.`
`...He must not deny magic, no matter what.`
`Denying that would be like throwing away what might be his first and last chance to revive Shannon.`
`However, compared to Beato, who was elegantly drifting like smoke, George's movements clearly resembled someone underwater.`
`...Therefore, if he didn't act like he was kicking his feet in water every once in a while, he'd be caught by the force of gravity bit by bit.`
`"I must say you're doing better than when I first danced through the sky.`
` ...Here we go.`
` Come with me."`
`When Beato beckoned to George, she gently flew into the stormy sky.`
`...It was just like a scene from a fairy tale.`
`The scene unfolding before George's eyes felt entirely like an extension of his dream.`
`"...Being able to fly is...incredible, ...but so is the wind and the rain..."`
`"What's this? Are the wind and rain tormenting you...?`
` ...I could teach you magic to block against that, `
`but it may be too early for you, and it may be a misuse of time right now."`
`".........Yes.`
` ...The magic I need...isn't that."`
`George wore a strong-willed gaze, refusing to let the wind and rain get to him.`
`"The mansion is coming into sight.`
` ...Hold out just a little longer.`
` If you fall now, you'll hit the bushes in the rose garden."`
`The undulating rose garden was spread beneath the witch and George's gazes.`
`This illusion-like scene no longer surprised George.`
`Only the gradually approaching mansion was reflected in his eyes.`
`"Shannon, ......wait for me...`
` ...I will definitely...revive you...!"`
`At that time,`
` ...the cruel new witch could be seen staring at the guesthouse from a different location.`
`"......Now, all that's left is the seventh and eighth twilights.`
` Just two more, and my obligation to that old hag Predecessor is finished.`
` ......I'll kill Krauss and Natsuhi.`
` Let them die together like the good couple they are."`
`"Nihi.`
` Where's the target nyeh?"`
`"...In the lobby on the first floor of the guesthouse, two targets and Ushiromiya Eva identified.`
` Measuring Anti-Magic Power Levels.`
` Data Link to 410."`
`"410, Data Received.`
` Anti-magic power levels are extremely low.`
` If Eva just goes outside, they're tuna and abalone on a chopping board.`
` Nihihihihi...!"`
`"What do you think, Great Lady Beatrice?`
` When you give the order, we shall snipe right away...!`
` Please, your orders...!"`
`"...You guys reeeally are convenient furniture.`
` Not at all like that old, second-hand furniture that's only useful for gouging corpses.`
` Right?"`
`"............Nn..."`
`"Chiester Sisters, please show me your skill once more.`
` ...Prepare to fire!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!`
` And carry out the corpses again, got it?`
` 'Cause I'll play with them a lot.`
` No complaints from you, right, Ronove?"`
`"...Correct.`
` As you command."`
`"Nn..."`
`At that moment, the witch noticed something.`
`...It was as though some presence had disappeared...`
` ...Was it her imagination...?`
`"......Was that someone's presence just now?`
` Did anyone feel it?"`
`"M-My apologies, I haven't noticed anything, ...so please forgive me...!!"`
`"We were in the middle of observing the guesthouse, so our peripheral surveillance was set to off. Nihi.`
` ...What about you, Lucifer-chaaan?`
` Did you feel any presence?"`
`"......Nn-"`
`For just an instant, Lucifer glanced at Ronove, asking whether she should answer honestly or not.`
`Ronove gave a small nod in response.`
`"No.`
` ...My apologies, Beatrice-sama.`
` We noticed nothing.`
` ......Forgive us the stupidity of us second-hand furniture."`
`"............"`
`"............"`
`"............`
`...I see.`
` If a great demon like you says that, then it must've been my imagination."`
`The witch persistently stared in the direction the presence had disappeared to.`
`...That was where the rose garden lay.`
`And beyond that, she could see the mansion's dark silhouette creating by lightning.`
`...It took quite some time before she pushed her unsatisfied feelings aside...`
`and once again faced the guesthouse.`
`The guesthouse lobby was wrapped in silence.`
`The strings of tension binding Krauss, Natsuhi, and Eva had already loosened, and they were completely worn out, with their minds beginning to waver.`
`Every once in a while, they would stand up and walk around pointlessly, as though fighting their drowsiness.`
`"......Are you okay, Eva-san?`
` ...Please, do take it easy and rest."`
`"I told you, I'm fine...`
` ...The three of us are now the only adults...`
` There's no time to rest...`
` No matter what the cost, we must guard this place until the end...`
` ...Haah, ...haah..."`
`She spoke bravely, but she couldn't hide her rough breathing.`
`...It seemed that the fever, which had been calmed with medicine for a short time, had returned.`
`It was very obvious that Eva's health was not good.`
`"Take it easy.`
` At least close your eyes.`
` If something happens that you need to be awake for, we will definitiely wake you."`
`"I'm telling you I'm fine...!`
` Leave me alone...!!"`
`"............"`
`It seemed she was already unwilling to budge.`
`...Krauss and Natsuhi realized that even if they talked to her any more when she was like this, it wouldn't reach her ears.`
`So without saying anything more, they decided to let her be.`
`To Eva right now, even having an argument like that would be burdensome.`
`It would probably be better for her body if she just sat there with her mouth closed.`
`In truth, Eva was just a step away from being beaten down by drowsiness.`
`...Perhaps she shot back at them with a temper because she was trying to rouse herself and throw off her sleepiness.`
`The clock would be pointing to 6:00 in the afternoon very soon.`
`She'd had several snacks to distract herself from her drowsiness, so she didn't feel hungry, `
`but now her lack of sleep made it feel like it was 6:00 in the morning, not the afternoon.`
`...Even supposing that the boat came at precisely 9:00 in the morning tomorrow, `
`...they still had more than 12 full hours to go.`
`...It was an overwhelmingly long stretch of time.`
`......Long.`
`......Painful...`
`...Hot...`
`Even the sound of the clock torments my body now.`
`In times like this, ...when that person puts his hand on my forehead, the fever fades at once.`
`...But that person no longer exists......`
`As Eva's mind grew foggy, she was once again gripped by a deep sadness...`
`She had already cried herself dry.`
`Even so, the sadness of losing her beloved husband had not been exhausted...`
`"......I...`
`...was wrong..."`
`"...What do you mean?"`
`The new witch and Eva were fundamentally the same being.`
`...If Eva talked to her, she would always respond...`
`"...I thought that if I could gain the position of the Ushiromiya Family Head, ...that alone would be enough.`
` ...But then, as soon as I saw that mountain of gold, my greed grew.`
` ......I was struck by a desire to have that mountain all to myself..."`
`"That's nothing to be ashamed of.`
` After all, it's your natural right as the Ushiromiya Family Head.`
` How could you give up even a bit of it to anyone else?"`
`"......I was gripped by that temptation, ...which is why you were born.`
` ...While you are a young girl version of me, `
`...at the same time, you are also my self-centered evil heart.`
` ...Because of my foolish greed sprouted by that mountain of gold, `
` ...the shell of the egg that is my heart cracked, ...and you were born into this world...`
` ......I am responsible for your birth...!"`
`"In that case, when I killed Rosa and Maria, `
`and then Rudolf, Kyrie and Hideyoshi, you were responsible for that too."`
`"Why did you kill my husband too...?!`
` Why...?!!`
` Aaaaaaaagggghhhhh!!"`
`"...I didn't want to kill Hideyoshi.`
` He was just so annoying and persistent.`
` ...And that's our...no, your fault.`
` It's your fault for choosing a husband like that."`
`"A child like you cannot understand what made that man so wonderful!!`
` Oooooooooooooooohhhh, ...dear, ...aaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!"`
`"......What the heck?`
` Our dreams were made real with magic, right?`
` We solved the riddle of the epitaph.`
` Then we found the gold and got the Head's Ring.`
` All of our dreams came fully true, right?`
` What more could you want...?"`
`"Those weren't all of my dreams...!!`
` What about living a wonderful life with that person and giving George an excellent life...?!`
` I still have many dreams that haven't come true...as a wife, as a mother...!!`
` And yet, ...and yet...!"`
`"...Those are just extra dreams you added after becoming an adult.`
` They aren't my dreams."`
`"That's because you're a child...!!`
` Do you only care about what's best for yourself?!`
` ...That's right, everything is my fault...!!`
` Back then, why did I resist doing what Rosa told me to?`
` Why couldn't I announce to all of the siblings that I'd found the gold...?`
` ...It's all because I'm so hideous!!`
` My evil heart, which sprouted from my desire to have all that gold for myself, ...caused you to hatch!!"`
`"......Looks like you really hate me.`
` Even though we're both Ushiromiya Eva."`
`"No, that isn't true anymore.`
` And it was you who said it.`
` I am Ushiromiya Eva.`
` And you are the Golden Witch, Beatrice...!!`
` So just disappear!`
` Witches are imaginary, illusions that only exist in fairy tales...!!`
` Things like you should just disappear!`
` Never appear in front of me again!!"`
`"...Yeah, ...you're right.`
` ...I understand.`
` I'll disappear from in front of you.`
` ...And I am no longer Ushiromiya Eva.`
` From now on, I'm the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
` ...So now I can play however I want."`
`"I don't even care about you.`
` If only you'd just give up and die!"`
`After having a very childlike tantrum, the witch who had once been another Eva vanished.`
`...Only Eva was left behind in the darkness.`
`And she questioned herself...`
`"Me...?`
` I...killed them...?`
` Did I kill...that person...?`
` ...Did I...kill...him......?"`
`She could no longer answer that question herself...`
`'!s0`
` *cough*cough*cough*!!"`
`It seemed that, half-asleep, she had gotten some saliva caught in her windpipe just as she was dozing off.`
`...Eva suddenly started coughing.`
`"Are you okay, Eva?`
` ...Please Natsuhi, some water."`
`"Y-Yes..."`
`"I-I'm fine, okay...?`
` *cough*cough*cough*!`
` *co-ugh*cough*!!`
` I just...choked a bit...!`
` *cough*cough*cough*!"`
`Eva pushed away Natsuhi's hand as she tried to rub her back...and unsteadily rose to her feet.`
`"......I'm going to go wash my face.`
` ...Sorry, I fell asleep.`
` ...When I get back, I'll make some more coffee.`
` ......Extra strong, so that I won't get drowsy until tomorrow morning."`
`"Yes, please do.`
` ...Your coffee's more to my tastes than what Gohda makes."`
`"I'm glad to hear it, even if it's flattery...`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, eva_3e883:`
`Eva exited the lobby, heading for the bathroom.`
`Krauss and Natsuhi watched over her frail back...`
`"...So, you sometimes do show concern for Eva-san, even though you've always been so much at odds with her."`
`".........`
`...Isn't this how an older brother is supposed to be...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` I believe you're right."`
`"It isn't just Eva.`
` ...There's Rudolf and Rosa too.`
` ...Instead of acting like an older brother to them, all I ever did was speak arrogantly and bully them."`
`"......In my own way, I was frantic in my desire to be like Father.`
` ...But I could never match up, and I always vented my feelings on them...`
` But that is no excuse.`
` ...I probably gave Eva scars so deep that they still have not healed.`
` ...I regret it, but even if I apologized after all this time, it would do nothing to heal those wounds..."`
`"......If you can hold onto that feeling, instead of only letting it last for this moment,`
` ...I'm sure your siblings will come to see it sooner or later."`
`"...Though, by now, Eva is the only sibling I have left."`
`"......If only...you and your siblings hadn't been born into the Ushiromiya family, `
`...you might have had a more normal, a more fun sibling relationship..."`
`"...You mustn't say that...`
` ......Eva will probably continue to hate me for her whole life.`
` And she has a right to.`
` ...I...intend to resign myself to that fact and accept it."`
`".........Dear..."`
`"...Eva, `
`......I'm sorry.`
` ...Of course, you don't have to forgive me..."`
`Of course I won't forgive you. What are you talking about, after all this time?`
`"Oh, so now you're feeling guilty? If only you'd just give up and die right now!`
` Do it, Chiester Sisters!!"`

`"410, Data Received, Firing Permission Confirmed.`
` Nihihihihi, Firing!"`
`Together, the sisters released the magical bowstring they had readied.`
`A beautiful tail trailed behind the gold arrow, and it drew a lovely curve as it flew.`
`It was just like a gold snake.`
`It skillfully avoided a grove of trees and flew towards the front door of the guesthouse.`
`Then it flew into the keyhole of the door and snuck into the guesthouse without any problem at all.`
`The gold snake raced down the hall smoothly, yet as fast as an arrow.`
`Right before it was the door to the lobby.`
`When it flew into the key hole, Krauss and Natsuhi were already...`
`For an instant, Krauss thought he saw a gold-colored sparkle in the keyhole on the door.`
`However, at the same time as he strained his eyes to see what it was, that sparkle bent like a whip and attacked, `
`wrapping itself around Krauss's neck.`
`"......Ack, ......ah, nn-"`
`Just looking at it, the gold snake seemed very supple.`
`However, it was as though a wire had tightened around Krauss's neck.`
`And while that snake choked Krauss, it extended even more, and also tightened around Natsuhi's neck.`
`Without even a chance to scream, their eyes bulged as they went into convulsions and then collapsed.`

` We got both of 'em nyeh, nihi!"`
`The gold snake began to drag Krauss and Natsuhi's bodies back.`
`...They slipped through the door to the corridor, dragging the bodies, gradually increasing in speed, `
`and rapidly pulled them outside the guesthouse.`
`So, the lobby was silent, as though nothing had happened.`
`...As though Krauss and Natsuhi had not been there since the beginning.`
`Only the sound of the wind and the rain remained, as if they were playing dumb and pretending to be the only ones there...`
`"...Sorry, I'm fine now.`
` ...I'll go make some coffee."`
`Eva returned from the bathroom.`
`But no one was in the lobby.`
`Even though they had supposedly been in that sofa until the moment she had choked and gone to the bathroom, `
`they were gone, as if they'd been an illusion from the very beginning.`
`"...How careless of them...`
` ...Where did those two go off to together?"`
`Eva put her hand on the sofa as though acting out a scene from a detective novel.`
`...She felt a warmth that meant that they'd been sitting there until a short while ago.`
`Maybe they went to do the rounds or something.`
`For the time being, Eva sat down and waited for their return...`
`Beato and George could be seen in the parlor of the mansion.`
`George was kneeling near Shannon's body as though praying...`
`His face was serious, and there was even sweat on his forehead.`
`However, Beato was the same.`
`Now that she had handed her name over, most of her previous power had been lost.`
`...Of course, she still had more than enough power to be called a witch, but compared to the past, it was a very faint thing.`
`"...Good.`
` Don't talk to her, don't touch her with your hand.`
` ...Call to her with the voice of your heart, and seek her with the hand of your heart.`
` ...Only your strong feelings can make my magic reach Shannon's lost soul."`
`"............!"`
`George kept praying earnestly and silently.`
`He kept frantically yelling inside his heart, trying to call back the soul of the person he loved.`
`...He strongly envisioned his soul leaving his body...and searching for her as she wandered through the Land of the Dead.`
`...Beato turned that strong force into magical power that supplemented her own magic.`
`This was magic that, in the past, she could have performed easily, without anyone's help.`
`...But now, if she didn't rely on someone's assistance, she wouldn't be able to finish the chant, much less succeed.`
`"......I'd forgotten for several centuries...`
` ......Was magic...`
`was resurrection...`
`always this difficult...?"`
`Beato was wearing an even more strained expression than George.`
`...It had slipped her mind, but originally, the magic to revive a life was the ultimate hidden art.`
`The abnormal thing was her previous magical power, which could be used over and over with a snap of her fingers.`
`So, the heavy burden on her body and mind was, fundamentally speaking, extremely natural...`
`"...However, ......this man's power...`
` ...Even though he doesn't know magic, it's nothing to be laughed at.`
` ...I see, so he truly is Kinzo's grandchild..."`
`The strong energy pouring from George was large enough to act as magical power.`
`...At first, Beato thought it must be the blood of Kinzo, the sorceror.`
`...However, that probably wasn't it.`
`...She had a feeling that Battler had already told her what it was.`
`It had been born from the power of George's sadness at the death of the person he loved, ...and from the way he had tried his hardest throughout his life, `
`from the warm time spent together with Shannon, to the size of the dream they swore to protect in the future.`
`Is it really possible for humans to take life so seriously, even though they only have a single one?`
`...It was only natural.`
`To her, a life didn't mean anything more than the difference between the top and bottom of an Othello piece.`
`If the black represented death, then she thought all you had to do was flip it over again and make it white.`
`However, it was just like that broken vase.`
`...To humans in a world without magic, where they cannot return things to their original form,`
` ...it is very, very natural for them to bet their life and soul.`
`"......So, is an Endless Witch, who can do as she pleases even with life and death...`
`inferior to a limited Human who can't even surpass the mountain of death...?"`
`This time, the witch acknowledged it.`
`He was able to hold a magical power that could never reside in witches who didn't understand the value of a life.`
`...Why does this thing called the Endless Magic exist?`
`...Even though I called myself the Endless Witch,`
` did I forget what the Endless Magic means for a thousand years......?`
`She looked at George's expression again.`
`......His surging earnestness was like a lightning bolt.`
`...Right now, even if George's body had been burned or smashed by a waterfall, `
`he would probably continue to pray for his beloved without minding it, without noticing it.`
`For the first time, ...she showed respect for that power.`
`So in that instant, all magical resistance was lost, and the enormous power of George's feelings turned into magical energy in its complete form...`
`The vase was very beautiful, rich with history and value.`
`Even as young as I was, it still forced me to take a deep breath when I witnessed its beauty.`
`...But that just made me want to touch it.`
`But the vase easily fell and smashed into pieces.`
`...Like a bubble that had popped,`
` it felt as though the time it possessed a form had been just an illusion.`
`Lives are just that fragile, just that easily...lost.`
`I realized that my foolish curiosity had led to something that couldn't be undone.`
`No matter how much I regretted it, no matter how much I apologized.`
`The smashed vase wouldn't return back to its original form...`
`A lost life will not return to normal no matter what happens.`
`I was frightened that, even though my actions had been thoughtless and careless, `
`...they had stolen away a life that could never be revived again.`
`Then, I pitied that lost life and cried.`
`I was frightened of myself, the one responsible for its loss, and cried even more.`
`I'm sure Grandfather will also cry at the loss of his precious vase.`
`I'm sure that all the people who love Grandfather and see him like that will cry.`
`With the loss of a single life, the whole world can be filled with so much sadness.`
`...I cried even more at how terrible that was.`
`Beatrice appeared...and spoke.`
`"Then, Milady,`
` let us revive that vase with magic.`
` If that will make everyone happy, the vase and the magic and the spirits...`
`will happily lend you their power and return it to its original form.`
` Come, Milady.`
` Close your eyes and chant with me..."`
`"Come, try closing your eyes.`
` And try to remember.`
` What form did you have?`
` It was surely a very, very beautiful form.`
` Please, show me that form one more time..."`
`Those words of power knocked forcefully on the door to the Land of the Dead.`
`The magic of her old self had performed that same forceful knock.`
`...However, doing it that way was horribly violent...and earned the displeasure of the peacefully sleeping dead...`
`But this time was different.`
`...It was very forceful...and yet gentle and loving.`
`The dead near the door opened their eyes...`
`and called out to the others that there was a voice calling for someone to come back.`
`...The sadness of that voice calling from the outside touched the hearts of the dead, `
`and, trying to respond as quickly as possible, they searched for Shannon's lost soul...`
`And then, `
`......they found it.`
`They found the casket in which Shannon was peacefully sleeping.`
`It truly was Shannon's soul, sleeping in the land of the dead.`
`...Inside the casket that was covered with rose flowers frozen with frost, she was sleeping in peace...`
`The dead silently lifted that casket up.`
`...While at a glance, it looked like a funeral march, it had the complete opposite meaning.`
`It was solemn, but filled with joy.`
`...The long-forgotten dead were made to remember that they were loved after their deaths,`
` ...and they were all given a warm sense of peace...`
`Then, ...as though guided by a warm light from the heavens, ...Shannon's body floated up out of the casket...`
`The dead watched her go.`
`...They squinted at that warm light, `
`offering their respect to this unknown member of the living...who had not lost his love for a person even after their death...`
`Shannon's body was enveloped in the light from the heavens and began to disappear...`
`In the jet-black darkness of the land of the dead, the faint flickering of gold butterflies could be seen.`
`...It reminded them of the gentle stars in the night sky, which they had long forgotten...`
`"............!"`
`George remembered being told that he must not say anything, and he hurriedly covered his mouth.`
`However, it felt like his heart was trying to jump into his throat.`
`...Because he had seen Shannon's eyelids shake slightly.`
`Then, ...those eyelids slowly opened.`
`Shannon's eyes were there, but they were still wrapped in the fog of the land of the dead.`
`However, ...the human world's warmth...`
`...No, her lover's warmth, which had called back her soul, slowly dissolved that fog,`
` ......and her eyes gradually regained their sparkle.`
`Then, ......her eyes moved...and recognized George.`
`"...George...san......"`
`As her lips shook weakly, `
`...Shannon definitely said that.`
`The words were very faint.`
`So much so that they normally wouldn't have reached his ears.`
`...However, George clearly heard them.`
`......He heard the person he cared for, his fiancée, the one he loved most and who should have been dead,`
` call his name once again...`
`'!s1`
`......Shannon, `
`...do you...`
`...know who I am......?"`
`"...George-sa...n, `
`......is this...a dream......?"`
`"No.`
` This isn't a dream.`
` ...C'mon, see here... ...Even if I pinch you, you won't wake up."`
`As George said that, he softly pinched Shannon's cheek.`
`...It was how George had always responded in the past, when Shannon had been surprised by something and had asked if she was dreaming.`
`When Shannon felt the warm touch of George's finger on her cheek...`
`...And when George realized that the warmth of the living had already returned to his beloved person's cheek...`
`...They both cried.`
`...What words should a pair of lovers separated by death celebrate with when they are reunited?`
`...The words of the human world are not enough.`
`In short, they had no need of the words of this world...`
`George simply hugged Shannon, who was sitting up, without talking.`
`Shannon's strength was still feeble...and putting her arms around George's back took all she had, `
`...so George hugged her tightly to make up for that.`
`To stop each other from going once more to a place the other's hand couldn't reach,`
` they hugged each other so tightly, and yet so gently...`
`As Shannon's fingers curled around George's back,`
` ...on her ring finger, the engagement ring George had given her definitely shone.`
`That strong glint certainly wasn't just the sparkle of diamond.`
`...There definitely was a magical power that only the two lovers could possibly feel.`
`It was because that strong light existed...that they had been able to find her casket in the land of the dead.`
`Beato understood.`
`...That ring, ...no.`
`......The feelings of the pair, embodied in that ring, were a miracle made real.`
`In that moment, George definitely used magic.`
`Beato had done nothing more than help him along.`
`That magic had a power that could only reside in those who knew of the importance of life, who knew what it meant to try with all one's might.`
`It was the power of a miracle, one that the Endless Witch couldn't possibly know of...`
` A miracle that only the power of the finite could give rise to.`
`By now, she had no choice but to accept it.`
`...She had to accept that true magic, true magical power...`
`...Exists in the place furthest away from she who called herself a Great Witch.`
`"......Beatrice...sama..."`
`"...She brought you back to life...`
` Thank you, Beatrice...!"`
`"No.`
` I did nothing.`
` ...What revived Shannon...was your magical power.`
` It was your magic.`
` ......The Ushiromiya blood, which makes miracles come true, ...surely saw you through."`
`"......George-san...revived me...?"`
`"...Indeed.`
` ......It was an incredible display of magical power, one that I could not hope to compete with.`
` ...So, I am still nothing more than an apprentice.`
` ...Now I finally know my place."`
`Beato staggered backwards.`
`...Her physical strength was clearly exhausted.`
`She had humbly said that George's power alone had revived Shannon, but Beato had also used all of her magical and physical strength.`
`...And she reflected upon how difficult it was to revive a single life, something she'd been able to play around with however she wanted to in the past.`
`The couple kept on embracing each other tightly.`
`...By doing that, those feelings that couldn't be communicated with a billion words...were shared...`
`"Thank you, Beatrice.`
` ...We're in your debt..."`
`"...Thank you very much, Beatrice-sama.`
` ...I'll never forget the debt I owe you for bringing me to George again."`
`"...Stop that, stop that.`
` Being thanked by a pair of lovers is far too embarrassing for one who has been feared as a monster of a person.`
` ...Don't worry...about me.`
` ...Celebrate your reunion together......to the fullest......"`
`Beato, who was leaning with her back against the wall, slid down the wall and sat.`
`How many centuries had it been since she last grew this tired from using magic?`
`...I probably haven't been this tired since the time I first succeeded in magic.`
`......Didn't Teacher praise me that time?`
`Oh, but didn't I kill that same Teacher who praised me?`
`...Don't be so naive, Beatrice.`
`...Isn't that what killing means...?`
`"...Finally.`
` ...It seems you've finally remembered how to use magic."`
`"......My head...feels parched and suffocated, ...and I can't even remember...`
` ...More importantly, ...didn't I kill you?`
` You shouldn't be appearing..."`
`"You are still allowing me to live even now.`
` That is why I can appear like this.`
` ...However, I did not come just to pat your head."`
`"...Did you come to sneer at how pathetic I am?`
` ...Anyway, ...if I have my head patted by a retired witch after all that's happened, the other witches will laugh at me..."`
`"That's right.`
` ...According to your bragging, you were not only a full adult, but a retired one,`
` and yet only now have you learned how to use magic. That certainly does sound too embarrassing to tell anyone."`
`"......Yeah, tell me about it.`
` ...Keep it a secret, okay, Teacheer...?"`
`Beato gazed at the couple hugging each other with a sense of pleasant despondency.`
`"Love, is it?`
` ......I'm no match..."`
`"45, Data Received.`
` Firing Preparations Concluded.`
` Ammo Type Selected and Loaded."`
`"410, Firing.`
` Nihi!"`
`The gold snake arrow fired by the Chiesters...`
`'!s0`
`weaved its way through the hedges, `
`and climbed the stone steps towards the mansion's entrance, `
`aiming for the keyhole.`
`It weaved through the corridors...`
`and flew into the keyhole on the door to the parlor...!`
`"...Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh?!?!"`
`It happened in an instant.`
`...One could hardly blame Beato, who was completely worn out, for not noticing it beforehand.`
`Right before Beato's eyes, the gold snake flew in through the keyhole,`
` ...surrounded the two lovers, `
`and pierced the two hearts in a blink of an eye.`
`...Furthermore, the gold snake faithfully pierced a hole through Shannon's chest once more...`
`The two hearts were pierced by that gold snake...`
`no, by that gold sewing thread of the new brutal witch's furniture,`
` ......and it had happened in an instant, mocking the amount of effort it had taken to revive Shannon...!`
`Before Beato's shocked eyes, the two fell over and landed on the floor...`
`'!s1`
`George, `
`......Shannon......"`
`'!s1`
`...Beatrice...`
` ...For letting us meet, `
`...even just for a short while, `
`...thank you......"`
`George spent his last breath thanking Beato...and died alongside the one he loved.`
`The gold snake, which still sewed the two in place, spun like a large cyclone, revolving around the inside of the parlor.`
`......It was searching for further prey in that room.`
`Then, the tip of the snake met Beato's gaze...`
`In that instant, Beato was prepared to die.`
`At that moment, Virgilia stood in front of her, the fingers of both her hands drawing a seal.`
`Instantly, gold-colored gold leaf buried the inside of the parlor.`
`It was like a blizzard of gold...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"Beato, run while you can!!`
` ~ib~No one can escape~ib~`
` from the Chiesters' golden bow!!!"`
`"410, Target Lost!!`
` Nihyah, it's magical chaff!!"`
`"45, roger that...!`
` Modifying Search Algorithm, Switching to Anti-Personnel Image-Based Tracking.`
` Target Lock Reacquired, Data Link to 410."`
`"410, Data Received.`
` Too slow, Predecessor-sama!`
` Coming, coming, coming, `
`...impact!!"`
`Prey targeted by the Chiester Sisters' golden bow did not escape.`
` It could not be blocked.`
`...No magical barrier could even dream of blocking it without being multilayered.`
`The gap opened during that instant of confusion caused by Virgilia's deception magic was Beato's only chance to escape.`
`And, it was the only chance to make the sisters confuse Virgilia for Beato.`
`As Virgilia spread her arms wide, blocking the way to her beloved disciple, the gold snake pierced straight through her heart...`
`After sneaking in through the keyhole, the snake shot through George, Shannon, and then Virgilia in an instant, `
`completely failing to notice Beato as she used that instant to escape...`
`As soon as Virgilia saw that Beato had gotten away, she died.`
`...The strength left her body, and like gold dust drifting with the wind, her form was erased...`
`Beato completely erased all traces of her magical power,`
` became gold butterflies, and passed through the wall, escaping to the wind and rain outside...`
`".........Damn it, `
`......damn it, damn it...`
` ...You bitch, `
`...you biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch...!!"`
`Beato felt regret from the bottom of her heart.`
`Why?`
`Because she had been attacked by the new witch?`
`Probably not.`
`Of course, she hated losing her teacher.`
`And even more importantly, Beato was enraged at the barbarism that had boorishly stolen away the reunion between two lovers.`
`...Beato had poured out almost all of her magical power to reunite them.`
`...Even though the result had been a miracle, `
`...the time it took to steal that away had been so ridiculously short...!`
`Beato trembled at the barbarous cruelty that had brought about such an abrupt end.`
`...Besides, ...this was the true form of the acts she herself had committed up until that point...`
`So just as strongly as Beato hated the new witch, she also looked at her previous self with disgust.`
`But now, she had to escape...`
`...If she was targeted next, she would probably lose her life.`
`To think that a chess player had descended, thinking they were like a god,`
` ...only to be attacked by the pieces.`
`"45, Impact Confirmed, Target Scattered.`
` ...W-Without a doubt, we crushed the Predecessor-sama...!"`
`"Looks like our pile of kill medals is gonna get bigger again nyeh.`
` Nihi!"`
`"What was that about loving couples?`
` You get to enjoy tearing the two apart by death, reuniting them, and then tearing them apart again, right?`
` *cackle* Hihihihihihhihi!"`
`"And along with that, I get to say goodbye to that damn fussy old hag.`
` ...Ronove, you don't have any complaints, right?"`
`"...I do not, `
`Beatrice-sama."`
`"That person interfered with the ceremony of the witch's epitaph, you see?`
` She revived a sacrifice from the first twilight without permission, obstructing my ceremony.`
` She's got no right at all to complain."`
`"Kuhhihihihhyahyahyahya...!`
` But it sucks that she didn't leave a corpse behind.`
` ...And I thought I'd be able to torture that old hag to death over and over again endlessly.`
` Kuhhihihyahyahya...!!"`
`"............"`
`"G-George did...?!`
` No, I didn't see him. When did he come down?!"`
`"...Wh-When, you say...?`
` Uh, what hour was that, again...?"`
`"I think...it was probably around 4:00 or 5:00.`
` ...At the very least, it was more than an hour ago..."`
`"We got sleepy...and probably dozed off after that...`
` But I think it's probably like Jessica says.`
` About one or two hours ago."`
`"I-I also remember something from around that time.`
` I was asked if I wanted more coffee..."`
`Something hard to believe had happened...`
`Apparently, when Aunt Eva had left for a second to wash her hands, `
`Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi had disappeared.`
`There's no way they went hiding somewhere.`
`Of course, the doors and windows had all been rigorously checked, and all were locked from the inside.`
` Not one of them was broken.`
`And that wasn't just true for the first floor. The second floor was the same.`
`Again, all the doors and windows had locks built in a way that made it impossible to lock them from the outside.`
`...In other words, there was no way that Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi had gone outside.`
`...And yet, they couldn't be found.`
`Furthermore, they weren't the only ones who had disappeared. ...So had George-aniki, of all people.`
`George-aniki had left saying he was going to get more coffee, `
`and had gone downstairs more than an hour earlier.`
`We'd assumed that he was having a conversation with Aunt Eva and the rest, `
`...but Aunt Eva, who had been in the lobby the whole time, said that no one had come down.`
`Since all the doors and windows were locked from the inside,`
` ...it was unthinkable that they had gone outside.`
`...However, three humans had evaporated from this barricaded guesthouse, which had become a perfect closed room...`
`In a situation like this, we couldn't imagine that this was because they were playing hide-and-seek and trying to scare us with a prank.`
`...It was probably reasonable to assume that they'd been caught up in this crime...`
`When Aunt Eva had learned that her only son was missing,`
` she had gone half insane, running from room to room and yelling his name.`
`...And Jessica, who had suddenly lost both of her parents, had chased after her.`
`Cries of 'George, George' and 'Mom, Dad' had continued to echo through the guesthouse for some time...`
`I think George said something about wanting to see Shannon's dead face.`
`...It would be reasonable to assume that he snuck out of the guesthouse and went to the mansion.`
`...But I didn't have a clue about Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi.`
`...Did they see him leave...and then go to the mansion to search for him...?`
`Without even telling Aunt Eva...?`
`At this rate, it's only a matter of time before we start planning to leave the guesthouse to go search for them.`
`......When that time comes, I'll agree.`
`We'd thought staying holed up in the guesthouse would be safe,`
` which was why our big, happy group of 12 people locked themselves up here this morning.`
`And yet, now there's only four of us left.`
`...That means staying here is no guarantee of safety...`
`However, ...there's one thing we can't afford to forget.`
`All the doors and windows were locked from the inside.`
`...This is a closed room.`
`How did they manage to vanish from this place?`
`We searched around thoroughly.`
`However, we couldn't find any traces of someone hiding.`
`...The three of them had almost certainly been taken outside the guesthouse.`
`"......I wonder how it was done...`
` You don't think...there might be something like a hidden door?"`
`"A hidden door...?"`
`"...The doors and the windows were built in a way that makes them impossible to lock from the outside.`
` Even using a fish line, it would probably be impossible with the way they're constructed.`
` So, it may be reasonable to assume that they left via something other than a door or a window..."`
`"......You're right.`
` That does make logical sense.`
` ...No one can be sure that no hidden doors exist."`
`"...However, before leaping to that conclusion, I suspect a much simpler possibility."`
`"And...what would that be...?"`
`For some time, Battler had been opening windows, opening shutters, and checking outside,`
` repeating this for each window.`
`"......Hmm.`
` ...This window's pretty quiet.`
` ...I see, unlike the other windows, because of how the building's shaped, the wind doesn't blow into this one."`
`"It appears that way...`
` It feels strange that no wind or rain comes in, even though there is so much of it outside."`
`"Doctor Nanjo,`
` ...when I opened the window just now, did you hear a sound?"`
`"Huh?`
` ...No, I did not notice it...`
` I believe it is well oiled."`
`"In other words, `
`it's possible to slink through a window in the hallway when no one is looking.`
` Furthermore, the wind doesn't blow in through this window, `
`so the air pressure wouldn't cause the curtains or a door to make a sound.`
` It'd be quiet."`
`Battler leaned forward and looked at the ground below.`
`...He was searching for some sign that George had jumped down.`
`...But at a glance, he didn't see any mark like that on the grass in the middle of the pouring rain.`
`"...There might also be a window like this on the first floor.`
` It'd be possible to go outside without anyone noticing."`
`"However, not only the doors, but the windows too are all locked, and the shutters are even down as well, correct...?`
` It may be possible to go out through them, but you couldn't lock them afterwards..."`
`"Sure you can lock them.`
` Just like this, *click*"`
`Battler closed the window and locked it, as though this was perfectly obvious.`
`"......B-Battler-san, you aren't saying........."`
`"If someone inside locked it afterwards, this closed room is as easy as pie."`
`"B-But that means`
`......that means, `
`...ooooooohhhh..."`
`Nanjo turned pale and shook his head several times.`
`...Because the thing Battler had said had forced him to face a fact that was frightening even to imagine...`
`"...That's only if the trick I'm thinking of actually happened, okay?`
` However, with this trick, only a very limited number of people can be suspected."`
`He didn't want to say it in front of Nanjo, ...but after eliminating Jessica, who had been with him the whole time, `
`only Nanjo...and Eva could have done it.`
`"I-I did not do anything of the sort...!`
` Y-Yes, I swear it...!!"`
`"...In this case, it becomes a battle between Aunt Eva and Doctor Nanjo for an alibi.`
` ...We just have to suspect both of you, `
`and confine the two of you separately."`
`"......To say it the other way around, the more survivors there are, the more effective this trick might be, `
`but since our numbers have shrunk so much, it isn't effective at all."`
`...No, on the contrary, there'd be a chance of having your own neck strangled by using it.`
`...It would have been more advantageous to make it look like the culprit was outside,`
` to intentionally leave a door unlocked or break a window...`
`"......If this disappearance drama had taken place midday today,`
` I'd be able to claim this theory with full confidence.`
` ...However, at this stage, I'm not confident at all.`
` ......What's going on here?`
` ...What in the world does it mean?`
` ......This 'closed room'..."`
`"...Y-You don't think, umm......"`
`"Hmm?`
` What is it, Doctor Nanjo?`
` ...Even if it's just a thought, please say it."`
`Nanjo looked like he was trying to swallow his words, even though he'd thought of something, so I urged him on.`
`After Doctor Nanjo refused several times, saying that it was just a foolish idea, he finally said it out loud.`
`"...Well, umm,`
` ......don't you think this might actually be...`
`...the work of the witch...?"`
`"R-Ridiculous.`
` There's no way witches exist."`
`"...The witch is trying to make her case to us.`
` ...Specifically because she's doing things that humans cannot do, `
`...she must be trying to make us accept her as a witch.`
` ...To me, this disappearance from the closed room of the entire guesthouse...feels like that kind of message from the witch...`
` ......It's something I must not think of.`
` Surely, it cannot mean anything.`
` ...Oooh, ...I...I am frightened..."`
`As Doctor Nanjo shook with fear, it looked like he was he was trying to erase the fearsome thoughts that he kept imagining one after the other.`
`...When we went down the stairs, Aunt Eva and Jessica were enraged, `
`and were each persistent in their desire to leave this place and search for their respective families.`
`It was a desire that naturally hits those who can no longer see their family.`
`Aunt Eva told Doctor Nanjo and me to stay here, but I shook my head and started walking.`
`"......I've been shut up inside for a long time already.`
` ...I've started wanting to breathe some outside air."`
`"Yeah, if we're going, let's go quickly...!!`
` There's no way I'm gonna keep myself shut up in a place like this any more...!!`
` Let's go and find Mom, Dad, and George nii-san right now...!!"`
`The blood had all risen to Jessica's head.`
`...I hope it doesn't set off her asthma.`
`"If anyone wants to stay, go ahead and stay.`
` We'll be searching outside...!"`
`"What about you, Doctor Nanjo...?`
` Will you watch the place by yourself...?"`
`"N-No...`
` Allow me to join you..."`
`Rather than holing up alone in a guesthouse whose security was by no means guaranteed, `
`it would be better to enter a danger zone as a group of four people.`
`Aunt Eva had a gun.`
`Moving separately from her was almost like asking to be made into the next victim.`
`In this way, the four of us decided to leave the guesthouse.`
`...Even though it should have been safe to barricade ourselves here, ...we lost eight people after doing so.`
`It was almost as though it this was a holding cell from which the sacrifices could be killed one after another.`
`We removed the chain, unlocked the front door and opened it.`
`It was already pitch black.`
`While there were some lights outside that dimly lit the pathway, `
`...they didn't have enough power to pierce the darkness that some suspicious person might be hiding in.`
`"I'm going...!`
` If you fall behind, you're on your own, okay...?!"`
`Still holding her gun, Aunt Eva dashed out without an umbrella.`
`Jessica followed after her.`
`After glancing at each other, Doctor Nanjo and I chased after them.`
`...What in the world is happening in this mansion, on this island?`
`I've just been shut up in the guesthouse with the rest of the cousins since yesterday.`
`So I don't know anything about what's going on outside.`
`Just what is happening that I don't know about...`
`outside this room, in the mansion, on this island?`
`...Everything is happening, everything is proceeding, `
`...and everything is ending without my knowing it.`
`Somewhere in my heart, I've already started giving up.`
`...Most likely, ...not one of us will see tomorrow morning.`
`When the seagulls cry, nobody will be left alive...`
`"Dad, ...Mom...!!`
` Who would do something like this...?!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`Jessica's woeful voice echoed throughout the rose garden...`
`Perhaps it was the intuition of a person who lived on this island.`
`...After checking the part of the rose garden where Aunt Rosa and Maria had fallen and seeing nothing, `
`Jessica went to look in the arbor next.`
`Normally, the arbor was probably a wonderful location to enjoy tea peacefully while appreciating the roses on a good sunny day.`
`...Maybe even Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi...`
`had days when they relaxed and enjoyed their tea together here.`
`...In that arbor lay their corpses.`
`At least they aren't drenched in the rain like Aunt Rosa and Maria had been, `
`but there was no way I could say that out loud to Jessica at the moment...`
`"...What do you think, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"...St-Strangulation, I believe.`
` ...Come, take a look at this.`
` On their necks, there are distinct markings that something thin was used to strangle them."`
`"Right. `
`...I doubt those things were the primary cause for their deaths."`
`Right there...lay two stake-like weapons decorated with an occult design, `
`which had been found driven into Uncle Krauss's thigh area...`
`and near Aunt Natsuhi's calf.`
`When we found these sticking out of my parents' forehead and chest, `
`we decided to preserve the crime scene and leave them for the police, `
`...but Jessica didn't care about such matters and immediately pulled the stakes out of her parents' forsaken bodies.`
`"...By now, bodies gouged in the head, chest, stomach, knee, and leg have been found."`
`"Aaaaaaaaahh, damn it, damn it, damn it!!`
` I'll kill that murderer, kill him!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`"...With this, the eighth twilight has been completed.`
` ...Is this going to continue onto the ninth twilight?`
` ...The witch shall be revived, and none shall be left alive."`
`"Bring it on...`
` ...If the witch revives, `
`...that means the culprit is gonna make his grand appearance, right?!`
` No one's going to be left alive? Bullshit...`
` ...I'll kill him...!`
` I'll definitely kill the culprit who killed Dad and Mom with my own hands...!!"`
`Jessica let her emotions flow out as she howled furiously.`
`...To avoid being crushed by grief, she could do nothing but resist it with anger.`
`"...We still...haven't found George.`
` ...Jessica, you children had better stay here.`
` I'll go into the mansion."`
`"E-Eva-san, we mustn't split up...!! `
`It's dangerous if we do not all stick together...!"`
`"There's nothing we can do for Nii-san or his wife.`
` But George may be still alive somewhere...!`
` I have no time to waste here...!!"`
`As Aunt Eva screamed this, Jessica glared at her.`
`...Eva had no more time to bother about the dead.`
`She was more concerned for the safety of her only son, who had yet to be seen.`
`"Jessica-chan, you should stay by your father and mother's side.`
` I'll make a short trip to the mansion.`
` Battler-kun and Doctor Nanjo, you two can stay here as well."`
`After arbitrarily saying this, Aunt Eva rushed out of the arbor.`
`I called out to stop her, but there was no way she would listen.`
`...However, being alone in this situation meant nothing short of death.`
`If we silently watched her leave, it would be the same as letting her die.`
`Since Aunt Eva was unwilling to stop, we had no choice but to follow her.`
`...And, while it may be cruel to say so, `
`Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi were already dead, `
`so there was nothing more we could do for them...`
`In the end, we had no choice but to console Jessica and head for the mansion together.`
`...Fortunately, Jessica stood up.`
`Perhaps she had been able to break free from her grief.`
`...But...what had surfaced in its place was an expression like a demon's.`
`"...I'll kill that person with my own hands, ...I'll definitely avenge them......`
` ...Let's go, Battler.`
` If we find the culprit, don't get in my way.`
` I'm definitely gonna kill them...!!"`
`"......I've got my own parents to avenge.`
` Sorry, but this is first come, first serve."`
`"...Yeah, ...that's right...`
` ...Let's kill them!"`
`At my words, Jessica finally seemed to feel like we sympathized with her emotions.`
`She still had that dark expression, but I felt that Jessica had regained some of her sanity.`
`We took off.`
`Chasing after Aunt Eva.`
`Through the rose garden, `
`up the stone steps, `
`running at full speed towards the mansion, ...whose large, intimidating shadow flashed in the lightning.`
`...With this, the murders of the epitaph have reached the eighth twilight.`
`And then, on the ninth twilight, the witch shall revive.`
`...None shall be left alive.`
`I will most likely lose my life.`
`...But at the very least, I want to burn the truth into my eyes.`
`That's the only thing motivating me to move right now.`
`We were able to meet up with Aunt Eva, who was having trouble with the lock to the front door.`
`It seemed that all the blood had risen to Aunt Eva's head.`
` That was probably making her fingers clumsy.`
`It looked like she couldn't even handle the simple task of inserting the key into the lock.`
`...Then, there was a faint sound.`
`The sound of the door unlocking.`
`Just as though it had waited for all the survivors to unite before opening.`
`It felt to me as though the malicious mansion...`
`was trying to swallow up all the remaining humans at once...`
`Perhaps the stench that erupted outwards the instant the door opened...`
`couldn't be described as just a smell.`
`It wasn't just the charred smell from Grandfather.`
`...I think it also may have contained the regrets of the servants and Dad's group,`
` ...all of the dead.`
`...What did it mean as it floated out, overwhelming us?`
`...Was it the cry of the dead, telling us not to enter?`
`However, Aunt Eva didn't even flinch at something like that.`
`...And we who had to chase after her...`
`were forced to step into the mansion, even after receiving that message...`
`"George?!`
` George!!`
` If you can hear me, answer!`
` Geoooooorge!!"`
`Aunt Eva shouted at the top of her lungs.`
`...Considering the situation, it's probably far too optimistic to imagine that he's alive.`
`In the hall, I had heard myself say that Dad's corpse was there.`
`I wanted to see his face, `
`but stealing George's lunch money came first.`
` It's not like he needs it anymore...`
`When we started following Aunt Eva's example and calling out George's name in loud voices...`
`...Aunt Eva spotted something...and stopped walking.`
`She was standing in front of the door to the parlor.`
`"......What is this......?`
` D-Doctor Nanjo, could you come here for a second...?"`
`"Wh-What is it...?"`
`I'd heard about the eerie magic circles written on doors, like the one on the parlor, from the adults.`
`...Eerie is the only word to describe that thing, `
`which was scribbled with a deep-red paint, reminiscent of blood, so that it slowly dripped down.`
`However, that had supposedly been there since this morning.`
`...Wondering why Aunt Eva, who had supposedly seen it already, `
`would think it odd now, Jessica and I stared at the door...`
`"...Certainly, ......I have no memory of numbers such as these being written here."`
`"Right, they weren't.`
` ...Eerie magical characters were written here, but not numbers."`
`From what the two of them said, only the magic circle had been there this morning.`
`However, right now, there were eight digits written near the upper part of the magic circle.`
`07151129.`
`...I didn't know what it meant, `
`but I didn't even want to imagine what someone had been thinking when they wrote it.`
`It was drawn with the same paint as the magic circle,`
` ...but it had clearly been written very recently.`
`The way it had dried and the condition of the color was completely different from the magic circle part.`
`"......Heh.`
` I'm sure it just has some magical meaning.`
` No point wasting time thinking about it."`
`Jessica intentionally spat those words out in an attempt to push aside the eerie feel it gave off.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"It...could be a magic`
`~ib~ square~ib~`
`.`
` ...The idea that a ward against magic can reside in a certain sort of number play.`
` I believe everyone has heard of the one where adding all of the numbers in each row leads to the same sum..."`
`"Wasn't that a group of numbers buried in a rectangle?`
` This is just a single row.`
` I don't have a clue what it could mean.`
` ...What Jessica-chan said is probably correct.`
` There isn't any point in us wasting time thinking about it..."`
`Even though she said that, she probably suspected that it actually meant something.`
`Aunt Eva was deftly writing that number down on an old receipt or something with a short ballpoint pen.`
`Unless it had some obvious pattern, it'd probably be tough to memorize a code made up of an eight-digit number.`
`............`
`'!s1`
`...this be a date, `
`...or something?"`
`"A date...?`
` What are you talking about...?"`
`"Well, ...it's probably a coincidence, `
`but my birthday......`
`is July 15.`
` ...Once I thought that 0715 might refer to July 15,`
` I figured that if 1129 stood for November 29, maybe that'd fit perfectly..."`
`"......Why would your birthday be written in a place like this? And what's up with November 29...?"`
`"That's what I wanna know...`
` Still, ...it's probably just a coincidence.`
` When I thought about it, it started to feel a little creepy.`
` ...What if someone's birthday was November 29?`
` That's not the birthday of anyone else in my family, not Dad or Kyrie-san or Ange.`
` And of course, it isn't my Mom's either."`
`"Nothing comes to mind...`
` ...I don't believe it's Kinzo-san's or Genji-san's birthday."`
`"It isn't from my family either.`
` And it isn't Rosa's or Maria-chan's."`
`"It can't be anyone in my family...`
` And it isn't Kanon-kun's or Shannon's.`
` ...I always give the servants presents on their birthdays, so I know it for all of them,`
` but I don't know anyone who was born on November 29..."`
`Once we started imagining that the eight digits weren't meaningless,`
` but actually two dates written together, it really started to look that way.`
`...However, its true meaning may be something completely different, or there may be no meaning at all.`
`Anyway, since we don't have any real clues, it's probably pointless to stand around here worrying about it.`
`...The inside of the parlor's much more important.`
`This morning, behind each of the doors with a magic circle drawn on them...had been the body of a victim.`
`...So, if something new has been added to this door, `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`does that mean something new `
`~ib~has been added~ib~`
` inside the parlor?`
`When Aunt Eva tried to open it, she felt the resistance of the lock.`
`She immediately took out a master key and put it in the keyhole.`
`As soon as she opened the door, ...Aunt Eva let out a high-pitched scream and ran inside.`
`That alone was enough to tell us what had happened inside the room...`
`Doctor Nanjo and I looked at each other, and I shook my head slightly as we entered the parlor...`
`'!s0`
` Geooooorge!!`
` Hang in there...!!`
` Geoooooooooorge!!`
` Doctor Nanjo, quickly!!"`
`George-aniki lay there crumpled alongside Shannon-chan's corpse.`
`His chest was stained bright red.`
` And judging by his still-opened eyes,`
` ...I'd hate to say it to Aunt Eva, `
`...but I couldn't pick up any signs of life.`
`After moving to take George's pulse, `
`...Doctor Nanjo shook his head, wordlessly reporting that George was dead.`
`Brushing him aside, Aunt Eva once again crouched beside George-aniki...`
`and started crying at the top of her lungs...`
`With Aniki's death, ...one thing is certain.`
`The murders hadn't ended on the eighth twilight.`
`The epitaph was being carried out in its complete form, including the ninth twilight, 'And none shall be left alive'...`
`I was really starting to lose track of things.`
`...For some reason, Aunt Eva's half-crazed cries actually made me cool down...`
`...Crestfallen and exhausted, I flopped onto the sofa and plunked my feet on top of the table.`
`Maybe all these murders numbed my heart.`
`Instead of just being frightened, I felt completely confused.`
`Dad and Kyrie-san are dead, and people have been killed off one by one, starting with the servants.`
`...And there's been a hell of a lot of them by now.`
`I don't know when the first murder happened,`
` ...but they might have been killed at a rate of about one person per hour by now.`
`We believe that the boat will come for us around 9:00 tomorrow.`
`...There's still a full 12 hours until then.`
`...How many more sacrifices to the witch will there have to be for us to survive...?`
`With the four of us, if one goes each hour, ...we won't last any longer than four hours.`
` We don't even know if we'll last until midnight tonight...`
`...Yesterday, after lunch, we came into this parlor.`
`Just as they started talking about serving some tea Aunt Rosa had bought, `
`we kids decided to take a walk.`
`...Maria was jumping around, wasn't she?`
`...Didn't Shannon-chan bring us some cookies?`
`She said Kumasawa-san had baked them, or something.`
`...It would've been hilarious if she'd baked some mackerel into them, wouldn't it?`
`......That's right, I'll never hear Kumasawa baa-chan's mackerel jokes again, will I...?`
`...Oh, right, if I only remember stuff about Kumasawa baa-chan, that wouldn't be fair to everyone else...`
`......Why did Dad and Kyrie-san...even go outside?`
`It's not like going without food for a day would kill us.`
`...So why did gluttony get ahold of them and make them go out for food?`
`...I'll bet that fearless dad of mine just started complaining about being hungry...`
`Kyrie-san, you were supposed to be the brakes for my reckless dad...`
`Why didn't you stop him?`
`......And...what about your daughter, Ange...?`
`She's still just six years old.`
` Don't tell me you planned to leave her in my care...`
`After all, it's doubtful now whether even I'll be able to leave this island alive......`
`"S-Stop...!!`
` Why are you fighting at a time like this...?!`
` Jessica-san, stop...!!"`
`...It's been kinda noisy for a while.`
`By the time I looked up to see what it was, Jessica and Aunt Eva had suddenly started fighting each other.`
`...No, maybe I should say that Jessica was grabbing at Aunt Eva.`
`"...Aunt Eva killed Dad and the rest!!`
` There's no other explanation!!"`
`"How foolish!!`
` Why should I know anything about what happened to your parents?!"`
`"Who was on the first floor of the guesthouse?!`
` Aunt Eva!!`
` Dad and Mom were in the first floor lobby, along with her!`
` And who was left alive?!`
` Only Aunt Eva!!`
` Why?"`
`"It's obviously because you're the culprit!!`
` You killed Mom and Dad, carried them outside, and then shamelessly locked the door,`
` trying to make it seem like it was the witch's doing...!!"`
`'!s0`
` He never came down to the first floor!`
` So, did he disappear from the second floor?!`
` And who was on the second floor?!`
` You people were, right?!!`
` You knew, didn't you?!`
` You knew that George slipped out of the guesthouse!!`
` And you brazenly acted as if you didn't know anything!!`
` If you'd stopped George, he'd be...he'd be...!!!"`
`"I said stop...!`
` Jessica-san was in the cousins' room the whole time!`
` And Eva-san was in the first floor lobby the whole time!`
` Neither of you is responsible for anything!`
` What we have here is simply the sadness of losing family members...!!`
` The culprit is no one, nowhere...!!`
` It is all......just the witch's fault!!`
` So stop hating each other, you two...!!"`
`...The witch's fault, huh...?`
`I wonder if that's a good way to cool down the situation right now.`
`Yeah, ...I finally understand why three people evaporated from the guesthouse...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`when all the doors and windows were ~ib~locked from the inside~ib~...`
`This is what they were after.`
`...Making us think the culprit was inside...and sparking this ugly, mutual hatred...`
`has to be the culprit's...the witch's goal.`
`......But if that's the case, how did the culprit`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~lock it from the outside~ib~`
`...?`
`When Dad's group was attacked, their master key was definitely stolen.`
`...But the doors and windows to the guesthouse were built so that you couldn't lock them from the outside, no matter how hard you tried.`
`So that master key should have had nothing to do with the guesthouse closed room...`
`Jessica and Aunt Eva were turning their sadness at losing their blood relatives into anger at the person in front of them.`
`Doctor Nanjo was trying to step between them.`
`......And I sat in the sofa, staring up at the ceiling, `
`...thinking about things that didn't even matter anymore with a worn out expression...`
`......I just couldn't believe that this was the same parlor that had been so warm and pleasant midday yesterday,`
` ...for just a short time before the typhoon hit...`
`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaahhhh, `
`...uwaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!"`
`The sudden sound of a gunshot shook me out of my half-asleep trance.`
`...Smoke was rising out of the barrel of the gun Aunt Eva held.`
`Jessica had fallen to the floor and was covering both her eyes.`
`Aunt Eva and Doctor Nanjo were looking down at her in shock...`
`"A-Are you okay, Jessica-san...?!`
` Jessica-san...!!"`
`'!s1`
`it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, `
`...rrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggghhh..."`
`"...I-It wasn't my fault...`
` ...Th-This happened because you came at me even after I told you to stop...!"`
`"H-Hey, wait a sec, what's going on...?!"`
`So, did Jessica grab at Aunt Eva, which turned into a scuffle...?`
`Did they start fighting over Aunt Eva's gun?`
`Did some kind of impact cause the trigger to be pulled...?`
`I didn't know if the bullet had grazed her or if she'd been burned by the discharge,`
` but either way, Jessica was covering both of her eyes, screaming 'It hurts, it hurts' and rolling around on the floor.`
`"...Don't worry, calm down...!`
` It is not a serious wound, so get ahold of yourself...!"`
`'!s1`
`...I can't see, `
`...I can't see...!!"`
`Doctor Nanjo let Jessica borrow his shoulder, saying that he would tend to her in the servant room.`
`...The servant room in this mansion had a bed and a first aid kit and was able to function as an infirmary.`
`"Damn iiiiiit!!`
` You killed Mom and Dad!!`
` I'll kill you, I'll kill you...!!"`
`"...I-It wasn't me, ...it wasn't me...!!"`
`"Jessica-san, you'll aggravate the wound, so don't move about...!`
` Come, let us go to the servant room..."`
`Jessica continued to curse Aunt Eva as her parents' murderer.`
`It seemed that Aunt Eva couldn't conceal her trembling at the fact that she had pulled the trigger, even if it had been an accident.`
`"...It wasn't my fault, ...it happened because that kid jumped at me...`
` ...I didn't kill anyone...`
` ...More importantly, ...who killed George?`
` That's right, who killed George?!!`
` George, Geooooooooooorge!!`
` It isn't my fault, it isn't my fault...!!"`
`"W-Wait a sec, Aunt Eva...!!`
` Don't go off on your own!!"`
`I didn't know if it was because Aunt Eva couldn't bear her mistake...`
`or if she'd given up control of her body to anger at the person who had killed her only son...`
`or if it was both of those all mixed together.`
`...At any rate, she ran out into the corridor, yelling, fearful, and screaming.`
`I was also worried about Jessica's condition, but right then, I couldn't leave Aunt Eva alone.`
`Why would she go off on her own in this mansion, of all places? Is she suicidal...?!`
`Doctor Nanjo took Jessica towards the servant room.`
`...I chased after Aunt Eva, dashing into the depths of the mansion...`
`After sitting Jessica on the servant room bed,`
` Nanjo told her several times not to touch her eyes and examined the affected area.`
`The barrel had probably been near her eyes.`
`There was a possibility that the flames from the discharge had injured her corneas.`
`...There was no threat to her life, but it would probably be necessary to take her to a doctor as soon as possible.`
`Nanjo applied emergency first aid, covering the affected area with gauze and wrapping it with a bandage.`
`As a result, Jessica completely lost her field of vision...`
`"Is that okay...?`
` The wound may hurt or itch, but you mustn't scratch at it or rub it.`
` When tomorrow comes, let us go to an ophthalmologist as soon as possible."`
`"...That bitch, she really was trying to kill me...`
` If the angle had been just a little bit off, I'd have been killed by now...`
` I'll definitely turn her in to the police...!"`
`"...Eva-san would not do such a thing.`
` That was an accident."`
`"You call that an accident...?!`
` She killed Dad and Mom.`
` There's no way any 19th person or witch exists on this island...!!`
` She's behind everything.`
` She was the only one on the first floor of the guesthouse!"`
`"George nii-san must have seen her kill Mom and Dad, and she killed him to keep him quiet!!`
` It's the same with Grandfather and the servants.`
` I'm sure she snuck out of the family conference last night and killed all of them...!!"`
`"...I-If that is indeed the case, then we'll find out about it as soon as the police investigate.`
` The police are incredible, and with their powers of discernment, there is nothing that cannot be understood.`
` ...There is no need for us to suspect or hate anyone.`
` The police will resolve everything."`
`"So for now, Jessica-san, you should devote yourself to resting your body and keeping your eyes safe.`
` ...Of course, if you wrinkle your forehead too much, it will do nothing good for your eyes, not to mention your beauty."`
`When Jessica's abuse of Eva had reached a crescendo, `
`she actually had started glaring instinctively, and the pressure on her eyes had hurt her.`
`Jessica herself realized that the more she talked, the more the wound would hurt,`
` and regardless of whether she'd overcome her suspicions of Eva, she regained her composure for the time being...`
`"......She killed them, `
`...Dad and Mom.`
` ...And Shannon...`
`...and Kanon-kun...`
` Kanon-kun......"`
`She'd heard that Kanon had been killed in the chapel.`
`...Jessica still hadn't seen his face after he had died.`
`Jessica was now less fearful about the fact that she was blinded,`
` and more frightened that the police would carry Kanon's body away while she still couldn't see,`
` and that she would have to say her final farewell without being able to look at his face.`
`Her anger at the culprit...and her sadness at the death of the person she'd liked.`
`...Those mixed emotions started her crying.`
`But right now, tears were actually painful for her,`
` so she wasn't even permitted to leisurely remember his face in bygone days...`
`Jessica could do nothing but sit on the bed and let her head droop, withstanding the pain...`
`"......`
`...Well then, now I am worried more about Eva-san.`
` I hope she isn't too shaken by this."`
`Realizing that Jessica had calmed down for the time being and letting out a sigh, `
`he stuck his head out into the hallway to look for any sign of the others coming back.`
`"......!"`
`Then, their eyes met.`
`Nanjo, unable to understand who this person was, was bewildered for an instant.`
`"I hear that people who have lost the power of sight have zero anti-magic power and magic resistance power.`
` In other words, you're an isolated pawn right now.`
` Understand what that means?"`
`"...Wh-What did you say...?"`
`Nanjo had no way of understanding who the person in front of him was,`
` much less what she had just said.`
`"......Doctor Nanjo?`
` What's going on...?"`
`Unable to see, Jessica had to rely on voices alone to make out the situation.`
`...But since she heard Nanjo say something in an uneasy tone,`
` she tightened up, thinking that something bad might have happened.`
`"...S-Stop, please...!`
` Please don't kill me...!!`
` I have a sick grandchild...!`
` I mustn't die here...!`
` Please, spare me...!!`
` Eeeek!!!"`
`"...Doctor Nanjo...?`
` Doctor Nanjo?!"`
`Jessica couldn't do anything except call out from the bed.`
`...Judging by the tone of his voice, Nanjo was in the corridor, confronting someone.`
`And he was scared.`
`His life must have been threatened just a second ago.`
`"No, stop it!!`
` Eeeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!!"`
`"On the ninth twilight, the witch shall revive, and none shall be left alive.`
` Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!"`
`The witch pointed the end of her gold staff at Nanjo.`
`...Even though he didn't know what she was planning to do, `
`Nanjo assumed that she must be trying to take his life.`
`"Doctor Nanjo!!`
` Doctor Nanjo!!`
` Is someone there?!`
` Answer me!!"`
`"Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit, ahiiieeeeeeeeehhh!!"`
`*bang*!`
` A sharp sound echoed.`
`And just as sharply, the tip of the golden staff tapered and stretched, slicing into Nanjo's forehead...`
`Jessica, who could only try to grasp what was happening with her ears, had no clue what was going on.`
`...But even so, she was able to realize that with that sound, Nanjo had died.`
`And, ...she could tell that that person was now in the corridor, right in front of the servant room.`
`...Furthermore, since she couldn't see, she wouldn't be able to run away, much less resist.`
`...Knowing that she was a mouse in a trap and in a life or death situation, Jessica shuddered...`
`"...Oh, Jessica.`
` Too bad, your eyes got injured.`
` ...Now you can't even escape.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*`
` ...I'm gonna play a whole lot with Nanjo's corpse now.`
` ...When I get bored of that, I'll kill you next and play a bunch more."`
`"...No, wait, if I've got you here blind already...`
` ...I won't wait until you're dead.`
` I'll have a lot of fun with you before I kill you too.`
` ...Kuhhihyahyahyahya...!!`
` So wait there shaking for a while, okay?`
` As you try to imagine all the ways I'm playing with Nanjo's corpse!!"`
`'!s0`
`Jessica was struck with fear and let out a frail scream.`
`...She wanted to scream in a much louder voice, trying to get someone to help her.`
`But she couldn't.`
`When faced with true fear, it clogs up a person's throat...`
`Right then, Jessica could barely even breathe.`
`'!s1`
`Help me, `
`...help me......!!`
` Eeeeeeeeeekk!!"`
`She searched around with her hands, trying to find some way to escape.`
`But even though she should have known this room well, just being unable to see made it like a closed room of darkness.`
`She ran into a shelf or something, and things like a candy jars and bottles fell down, hitting her on the head.`
`...As she was now, it would've been tough for her to even guard her head to block it.`
`...She was painfully aware of how powerless humans become just by losing their sense of sight.`
`Of course, she had no time to be impressed by this fact.`
`She crawled around at random, trying to escape from that place,`
` but she kept bumping into things that she didn't understand, getting hit by various falling objects,`
` and it felt like the entire room was alive, bullying her and refusing to let her escape.`
`Then, a footstep could be heard from that presence in the hallway.`
`And then, a voice.`
`...She'd probably poked her head into the room, since Jessica had been so loud.`
`"You really are noisy.`
` Act like a lady and wait there on the bed.`
` 'Cause I'll give you a wonderful blood-red death outfit fitting for such an honored daughter.`
` ...Something good enough to make the person who finds you faint, okay?`
` Gehheheheheheheheheheh!!"`
`"E-Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!"`
`Until just a second ago, she had sworn that she'd kill the culprit if she found them.`
`...However, she was now very powerless.`
`She couldn't do anything except let out a scream, crawling around on the floor and bumping her head into the bed and the legs of desks.`
`"Help me, ...help me...!`
` Someone, help me...!!`
` Dad, ...Mom...!`
` Battleeeer...!`
` Someone, coooooooome...!!`
` ......Help me, ...Kanon-kun......!!"`
`In the corridor, as the witch thought of how to toy with Nanjo's life...`
`...A single gold butterfly secretly watched that scene from the corner of the hallway.`
`...It was Beato, who had barely escaped with her life once before.`
`The gold butterfly softly returned to human form.`
`...It was faint and transparent like a lace curtain.`
`By now, her power was so weak that even maintaining this form was difficult for her.`
`Right next to her, Ronove also appeared.`
`"...It is unlikely that Jessica will survive.`
` ...Of course, there were to be no survivors from the very beginning."`
`".........She has grown feelings of love for Kanon.`
` ...I have toyed with them at times.`
` ......However, such behavior was shameful for a witch."`
`"...Love is the single element.`
` Romantic love is even more pure, more sacred.`
` ...Though for some reason, you seem to despise it thoroughly, Milady."`
`"............`
`...Teacher told me.`
` ...Magic exists to bring people happiness.`
` ...That's something I myself must have been aware of in the past."`
`"...Ever since I forgot that, I stopped being a witch.`
` ...And so, ...I lost the right to be Battler's opponent..."`
`"......I can hardly believe it, Milady.`
` ...Do you actually intend to rescue Jessica?`
` It will be dangerous."`
`"I know...`
` Even if I do save her, she will become a plaything of the witch's banquet when the door to the Golden Land opens.`
` ...But even so, ...that death would be far more compassionate than what that person would do to her.`
` ...The witch's banquet steals lives in a terrible way, but it does not do so more than once.`
` It does not toy with life and death."`
`"...However, that person is different.`
` She kills over and over.`
` She kills for fun!`
` There is not even a trace of compassion there.`
` ......I want to at least save Jessica from that kind of cruel fate."`
`"...Certainly, by carrying that out, you would probably be praised as a good witch.`
` ...However, the new Beatrice-sama already views you as hostile, Milady.`
` ...If you were to be seen by her again, ...you would not have any method of escape this time, correct?"`
`"..................`
`...When I reunited George and Shannon,`
` ......I finally understood what a witch is...`
`and what magic is."`
`"......I am a witch.`
` I must act as a witch.`
` And I must be acknowledged as Battler's opponent, ...and make Battler accept me as a witch this time around."`
`"...The road to that goal may be long and difficult.`
` ...However, if I do not take a step forward here and now, ...I won't be able to call myself a witch."`
`"I understand your feelings, but how do you plan to rescue her?`
` There are not many forms of magic that your body is capable of now, Milady.`
` Did you not have to borrow George's power even back when you revived Shannon?"`
`"...Indeed.`
` ...And for that very reason, I may be able to save Jessica.`
` ...Right now, she is begging for Kanon to save her.`
` ...If I can borrow the power of that emotion, my magic may be able to knock on the doors of the Land of the Dead once again."`
`"You may be able to knock.`
` However, you would use up all of your magical energy.`
` ...If you were to be spotted by the new Beatrice-sama, you would truly be without a method of escape.`
` ...I am no longer your butler, Milady.`
` ...Understand that I cannot assist you if the situation worsens."`
`"...I know.`
` ......By now, I have toyed with and taken more lives than I can count.`
` ...So, I may not be able to make up for it...except by saving the same number of lives, bringing them through that door."`
`"...I have had nothing to lose in the first place.`
` ...I am just a gold butterfly who has passed its name and magic power on, and who is no longer acknowledged as a witch."`
`"......What about Battler-sama?`
` You are partway through a game with him.`
` He has said that he would wait until you returned.`
` ...Are you truly satisfied to end it here?`
` ...You have a duty to return to the seat across from Battler-sama, Milady."`
`"For that very reason...!`
` If there's a life that only I can save, I will save it.`
` And I will be accepted as a witch.`
` ...I must become a witch...!`
` If this is training, it is a very childish thing, nothing that compares with the evils I have committed before now."`
`"...Vanish, Ronove.`
` Watch what may be the final magic of a single butterfly who used to be called a witch...!"`
`"...Certainly.`
` ...Please show me magic...`
`...that will not disgrace the name of the Golden Witch.`
` ...And I pray that it is not your final spell."`
`"Go, my friend.`
` ...If you can find enough ink, write down the story of my foolish life...and hand it over to some fool who is about to walk down the same path.`
` So long, Ronove...!"`
`'!s1`
`...where are you...?`
` Where are you...?`
` ...Help me, `
`...help me, `
`...aaaaaaaaahhh..."`
`......Milady,`
` I am...always there by your side.`
`"...K-Kanon-kun...?`
` Kanon-kun...?!"`
`It seemed to Jessica as though she'd heard Kanon's voice just then.`
`She looked around with unseeing eyes, but of course, she saw nothing.`
`...On the contrary, that action caused her head to hit the desk again.`
`"...Kanon-kun, ......Kanon-kun...`
` ...Help me, ......help me......"`
`Yes, Milady.`
` ...I will...help you.`
`"...K-Kanon-kun...?!`
` Y-You survived...?!"`
`This time, she thought she heard his voice clearly.`
`Jessica jumped up in surprise, banging her head against the desk once again.`
`...Milady, please, calm your heart and listen.`
`...Unfortunately, I am not alive.`
`"......Huh...?"`
`I have already...died.`
`...However, ...that witch came to me to tell me of your peril.`
`...And...she gave me just a little bit of time...so that I could save you, Milady.`
`Please, calm your heart even more.`
`If you do, ...my form will become visible even to you, Milady...`
`Jessica obeyed those words.`
`She chased all idle thoughts from her head and relaxed her breathing.`
`...Of course, her heart felt like it was going to explode after hearing the voice of the one she'd liked and had thought was dead.`
`She resisted the excitement with all her strength.`
`...When she did, ...she felt as though Kanon-kun really was right in front of her.`
`...Even though she shouldn't have been able to see him with her eyes, ...she was able to sense him clearly.`
`"...Can you...see me?`
` Milady..."`
`"Yeah...`
` I can see. ...I can definitely see you, Kanon-kun..."`
`"......I exist only as as a soul now.`
` So I cannot touch you, Milady.`
` I cannot do anything except talk to you like this.`
` ...With my current weak existence, I can do nothing more than that, ...but I should be able to be of some aid to you, Milady."`
`"...So, ...we can only talk...?`
` I can't...touch you, Kanon-kun...?"`
`"I am now more fragile than smoke from a candle.`
` ...So much so that if one of the living such as you were to touch me, I would be wiped away instantly.`
` ...So please, don't try to touch me.`
` ...Because I am also...holding back my desire...to touch you, Milady."`
`"Ah, ......o-okay..."`
`"More importantly, Milady,`
` ...please listen well.`
` ......The new Golden Witch has a cruel heart.`
` ...She surely plans to make you meet with a horrible fate.`
` ...You must escape from this room and hide."`
`"...H-How...?`
` I can't...see anything...!"`
`"Quiet...`
` ...I will be your eyes, Milady.`
` Please move in accordance with my instructions.`
` ...First, please crawl three steps from there, then stand up.`
` You are now under the desk, Milady.`
` If you stand there, you'll hit your head."`
`"...Th-That was under the desk...?`
` Okay, 1, 2, 3...`
` ...I'm gonna stand..."`
`"Well done...`
` Next, please turn to face towards 9 o'clock.`
` ......Yes, well done."`
`"Ha, ...haha...`
` This is pretty...embarrassing...`
` ...Ah, ...ack, ...owowow..."`
`"Are you okay? Does your wound hurt...?"`
`"N-No, ...I'm fine...`
` What next...?"`
`Jessica thought that if this was a dream, she didn't want to wake up.`
`...And, if she were allowed to, she would've wanted to take off the bandage covering her eyes and see him.`
`...However, if she did that, Kanon might vanish like frail candle smoke, just like he himself had said...`
` ...She was afraid of that.`
`So she satisfied herself with just listening to his words once more, `
`repressing her desire to see him, to hold him.`
`Therefore, what hurt her eyes now were tears of gratitude.`
`...Tears of gratitude for the god...or maybe the witch...who had given her this miraculous moment.`
`"...Is this okay...?`
` If we keep talking like this, won't we be noticed by her?`
` Won't our voices be heard...?"`
`"...I have erected a secrecy barrier.`
` As long as we don't make any loud sounds or speak noisily, no one will notice us.`
` ...That's why people can't tell when I'm around."`
`"...I-I don't really get it, ...but anyway, we'll be fine as long as we stay quiet, right...?`
` ...Wh-What should I do next...?"`
`"Please walk 10 steps in that direction.`
` You will touch the sofa.`
` Please continue along that.`
` ...Do it slowly.`
` ...Stay calm.`
` Believe in my words."`
`"...S-Sure.`
` ......Heheh, ...it's weird...`
` ...Even though it's so scary not being able to see, ......I'm not scared at all if you're with me, Kanon-kun..."`
`"......Yes, that is the sofa.`
` Trace it to the left while advancing slowly...`
` There is a table just to your left.`
` Be careful not to bump into it with your shins..."`
`...It was a very, very strange and bizarre team effort.`
`Even though she would have been killed in an instant if the terrible witch noticed her, `
`...there was no fear in Jessica's heart.`
`She was being protected and guided by Kanon, someone she thought she'd never be reunited with.`
`...It would probably be just a momentary miracle.`
`...Even so, Jessica was deeply grateful for it.`
`If she hoped for too much, she was sure that he would disappear, so she tried not to ruin this faint miracle.`
`And, trying to engrave this moment into her heart for all eternity, she slowly, slowly...continued to walk, obeying Kanon's voice...`
`"...Okay, if you walk 10 more steps, you will exit the servant room.`
` Then, please turn to face 9 o'clock, and keep walking very slowly.`
` Put your hand on the wall to your right, and keep on following that.`
` ...I will take you to a safe room."`
`'!s1`
`...will you...`
`leave, Kanon-kun...?"`
`"............"`
`Kanon didn't answer.`
`...But his lack of an answer was enough to tell her the truth.`
`"...Then, ...no way.`
` ......I don't want to go..."`
`"If you stay here, you will be killed by the witch."`
`"I don't mind...`
` If I'm killed, I can go to the world where you are, Kanon-kun..."`
`"...Milady,`
` please listen to me.`
` ...The human world is too bright and painful for the dead, like me...`
` So I cannot stay for long."`
`"So Milady, ...please allow me to use what time I am allowed...to guide you to a safe place.`
` ......Because after that, ......I will stay with you until my time runs out."`
`"......Is that...the very best you can manage, Kanon-kun...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` ......In exchange, I will stay by your side as long as possible.`
` ...I will stay with you...and talk with you, Milady."`
`"Talk...about what...?"`
`"......What do you want to talk about...?"`
`"...I don't care what, as long as you're willing to tell me, Kanon-kun..."`
`"...Well then...`
` ......I will tell you the story of a cowardly servant boy who lacked all courage.`
` ......The story of a foolish and pitiful boy who fell in love with a young lady as radiant as the sun. ...Even when the lady confessed those same feelings to him,`
` ...he lost to his cowardice...and was never able to be honest with his feelings while he still lived."`
`"......Yes...`
` Then, ...I want to tell you a story too.`
` ......It's the story of a cowardly girl...who couldn't muster the courage...`
`to tell the boy she loved how she felt...much, much more often.`
` ......The story of how that girl, after being reunited with that boy by a miracle from god,`
` ......used that chance to finally muster up her courage."`
`"......I also...want to hear that.`
` ...So, for that reason as well, let us go.`
` ...To a safe place."`
`"...Yeah...`
` If I could be with you, Kanon-kun, I would walk however far, however long it took...`
` I don't need eyes anymore.`
` If you tell me to step forward, I will take that step, even if it leads off a cliff."`
`"Thank you.`
` ...Come, Milady.`
` Let us go.`
` The first 10 steps."`
`"No, I don't like it.`
` ......I won't do it...unless you call me Jessica."`
`"...Understood.`
` .........Well then, Jessica.`
` ...Take the first 10 steps."`
`"Yes,`
` Kanon-kun..."`
`Very quietly, Jessica and Kanon slowly snuck out of the servant room.`
`Just around the corner, the witch could be seen cruelly looking down at Nanjo's corpse, `
`but she didn't even notice their presence.`
`However, Ronove, who stood at the ready by her side, met Kanon's eyes.`
`...Kanon thought 'Oh no', grimacing and blocking Jessica with his back.`
`"............"`
`However, Ronove did not inform his master.`
`He played dumb, just as though he hadn't spotted Kanon in the first place.`
`...No, maybe he did appear to chuckle.`
`From a finger on Ronove's hands, which were joined behind his back, a single small gold butterfly appeared,`
` flying in front of Kanon as though guiding him.`
`It went unnoticed by the master he served.`
`Kanon was surprised at the magic that butterfly held.`
`Because it was far more powerful than the secrecy barrier Kanon possessed.`
`...He may not have known it, but that power of his had originally been Ronove's.`
`...Kanon's ability was an imitation of that, which Kinzo had made and given to him.`
`As that butterfly of secrecy magic scattered gold scales, it grew smaller bit by bit.`
`...It probably wouldn't last long.`
`...But without a doubt, even that would buy them enough time to get them far away from the cruel witch.`
`"Okay, Milady...`
` Let's follow that wall and keep walking.`
` ...Keep going.`
` Keep going."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...If I can be with you Kanon-kun, ...I'll keep on going, on and on..."`
`Led and protected by the small gold butterfly,`
` ...the pair separated by the wall of life and death slowly walked away, towards the end of the corridor...`
`...There was no way that the evil witch could have had magic to notice their flight.`
`Until they disappeared at the other end of the corridor, the witch didn't realize that Jessica had vanished...`
`By the time the gold butterfly Ronove had sent evaporated completely, ...Jessica had reached the parlor.`
`Even though it would have been a quick trip if she'd been able to see, as she was now, it had been a very long adventure.`
`"...Come, Milady.`
` We've reached the parlor.`
` I will now take you to the bundle of curtains by the window.`
` If you hide in there, you'll surely be safe."`
`"Inside the curtains...`
` Not bad.`
` I used to hide in there a lot, long ago."`
`"......Beatrice-sama..."`
`"...Huh?"`
`Kanon called out the witch's name.`
`Jessica looked around in surprise, but she obviously couldn't spot the witch when she couldn't see...`
`Beato had appeared once again with a faint form.`
`Kanon squared off against the figure of the evil witch, but Beato's expression was soft, ...or even pitying.`
`"......I don't know what sort of whim led you to revive me, nor do I understand what you're thinking now."`
`"...Oh, it was nothing more than a whim.`
` ...No, ...this is how witches should be.`
` ...It took me a thousand years to realize that.`
` ...That is how...foolish it is."`
`"Wh-Who is it?!`
` Who's there...?!"`
`"...Milady, be quiet.`
` ...She is the witch, ...Beatrice...`
` ......I owe her, ...because she let me be with you one more time."`
`"......The witch, ...Beatrice..."`
`"...Forget about me.`
` More importantly, you should quickly hide that girl in the shadows of the curtains.`
` ......You probably do not have much time left.`
` You may spend it having a final conversation with Jessica."`
`"...A secret meeting inside a bunch of curtains? ...How clever you two are.`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`"U-Umm, ......thank you, Beatrice...!!`
` Thank you for letting me be with Kanon-kun...!!"`
`Jessica didn't know where Beato was, so she said that while facing in the wrong direction.`
`Perhaps because she found that funny, Beato snickered.`
`"I will now leave this room to the pair of lovers.`
` Evil witches have no need for tales of love.`
` Allow me to depart."`
`"...Beatrice-sama, `
`...thank you very much."`
`"Hmph, `
`......there is no need to thank me.`
` You know that something like this cannot compensate for all of the evil I have done."`
`"I offer my gratitude to this good witch as a parting gift.`
` ...I don't know what has happened before or what will happen later.`
` ...However, at this very moment, `
`...you are without a doubt...a good witch."`
`"...You flatter me, furniture.`
` The next time we meet, I may be an evil witch who doesn't betray your expectations.`
` ...And with that, farewell."`
`Beato left the parlor and closed the door.`
`And, mustering the last of her remaining magical power, she sealed the door.`
`The fact that those two had escaped into here would eventually be noticed.`
`...And now that the ninth twilight had been reached, no matter how much they struggled, their inescapable fate had already been decided.`
`However, until that final moment, they should be given the chance to speak with each other of their love.`
`The witch poured out all of her magical power to protect their time together.`
`...So that no one would be able to defile their time alone until the last possible moment.`
`At that time, ...Beato noticed something.`
`...Her body had been detected by a magical searching technique.`
`...The evil witch's furniture had sniffed this place out.`
`"......So, boorishness is the witch's way of doing things after all...`
` To think that she doesn't even intend to let those two young ones speak together of their love......`
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!!"`
`"45, Data Received.`
` Checking Target, Confirmed as the Predecessor Lady Beatrice.`
` Analyzing Parlor Defensive Wall.`
` 72-Layered Multilayered Defensive Wall, Attack-Proof Barrier and Anti-Magic Armor.`
` Sniping into the parlor will be impossible.`
` Data Link to 410."`
`"410, Data Received. Nihi!`
` Then we've just gotta kill Predecessor-sama first, nyeh.`
` Great Lady Beatrice, your Firing Permission please!"`
`"Go ahead and shoot.`
` ...Oh, and avoid her vital areas.`
` There's something I want to ask that old hag."`
`"410, Firing.`
` Nihi!"`
`The Chiester Sisters' gold bow released a gold snake.`
`...It crawled down the corridor starting from the front of the servant room, aiming for the parlor as it drew a soft, snake-like curved line trajectory, `
`...and pierced Beato's chest.`
`".........Gwaah...!!!"`
`Gold butterflies gathered, and the cruel witch appeared along with her furniture.`
`"...Predecessor-sama,`
` no further obstructions will be permitted."`
`"...Ugh...uu...... I didn't think they would be...`
` ...Still, the Chiester Sisters really have gotten rusty.`
` To think that they failed to bring me down.`
` ...And twice, at that...!"`
`Ronove spoke in a manner befitting the witch's butler.`
`As she pushed her pain aside, Beato grinned and spoke back.`
`"M-My apologies, Predecessor-sama...!`
` We were ordered to avoid vital areas...!"`
`"As soon as we get the order, we can pierce you at any time.`
` We can pierce a hole in your ears, a hole in your belly button, any hole you like.`
` Nihi!"`
`The gold snake that had pierced Beatrice grew even longer, drawing a funnel-shaped helix and awaiting its next order.`
`...It was prepared to pierce a vital spot as soon as the evil witch told it to.`
`"......For what reason would someone like you, who is no less brutal than I, `
`make them avoid my vital areas?`
` New Beatrice...!!"`
`"I wanted to ask you something.`
` ...I don't know what kind of trick you used to escape, but we thought we took you out, right?`
` Why is it that even though you could've escaped by hiding, you took the risk of appearing again?`
` ...It can't be that you came back just to protect those two young people, riight?"`
`"...Well, ...who knows?`
` ...*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"And just a second ago.`
` Why'd you do something as soft as reviving the lovers and reuniting them?`
` ...The more I hear about you, the more I learn that I don't even reach up to your feet as an incarnation of evil.`
` If you're like that, why did you suddenly start acting so mildly?`
` ...That's what I wanted to ask."`
`"......*cackle*cackle*!`
` I am brutal, therefore I am fickle.`
` What purpose could questioning that possibly serve?"`
`"Chiester Sisters, sew her."`
`When she ordered that, the gold snake that was curled in a helix and suspended in space...`
`moved as fast as a real snake going after its prey...`
`and pierced Beato's body multiple times from both sides, its gold tail drawing a x shape.`
`As the cruel witch had ordered, it drew a cross-stitch through Beato's chest.`
`The gold thread made a squeaking sound and tormented Beato...`
`Rather than a gold snake searching for its prey,`
` it waited for orders like a sewing needle ready to sew Beato.`
`"If it's you we're talking about, there's no way it could've been a whim.`
` ...I've heard about you.`
` And I've learned.`
` You're such an incarnation of evil that I don't even rise up to your feet.`
` I thought I was truly a fitting successor to you."`
`"...But you've always been in the way.`
` You always say warm, pleasant things that shock me.`
` ...What changed you?`
` You explored the depths of evil for one thousand years,`
` and I let you live...because I wanted to know what happened to make you change so much."`
`"...If you really want to know, then I suggest you waste a thousand years as well.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Sew."`
`"Gwaahhhh!!!`
` Ackkah, ...gah!!"`
`Beato's chest was once again sewn with a golden cross-stitch.`
`It tightened once again, squeezing fresh blood from Beato's chest.`
`The intense pain it caused ran in conflict with its beauty to the eye.`
`"......You might be one of those things that disappear when they die and don't leave a corpse.`
` So I'll kill you slowly.`
` But if you answer my questions honestly, I'll let you die easy.`
` I'll give you a splendid, gorgeous death, perfect for my Predecessor-sama.`
` I'll sink you in a coffin filled with water and roses.`
` Isn't that wonderful?`
` ...And you still won't talk?`
` About the reason for your change of heart?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!!`
` Not answering when she is asked is another one of an evil witch's pleasures."`
`"Sew. Twice."`
`"Gyoah, gwuaahh......!!"`
`"Of course, you don't have to answer.`
` After all, that way I get to torture you.`
` Kuukuhihihihihihihihihihi!!"`
`"The Endless Magic truly is wonderful.`
` ...When you think about it, this world is limited in every way.`
` The endless cannot exist in the human world.`
` Because gods are without limits, the human world is deprived of all limitlessness, so that they can be looked down upon."`
`"...So, in other words, this endless power is the power of the gods!`
` A wonderful power where, the more you play with it, the more fun ways of playing you find!`
` You used that power as you pleased for one thousand years and went on a rampage!`
` Why are you having a change of heart only now?`
` You aren't gonna say you regret handing it over to me, are you?"`
`"How could I regret it?`
` The Endless Magic you believe in is no magic at all.`
` ...True magic lies in a deep abyss that you most certainly cannot reach."`
`"And this is what you realized...?`
` Then what...is it?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Wander about for a thousand years without realizing, foolish witch."`
`"Sew. Three times this time."`
`"Gwoah, gyuooh, ...gu...!!!"`
`Beato's chest had been embroidered with the gold thread.`
`It tightened even more, causing Beato more and more pain...`
`"...Well, that's fine.`
` I'm no longer curious about what kind of revelations an old hag who refuses to die might've had.`
` I'm bored now, so I'll just kill you.`
` If I do, the barrier around the parlor will dissolve."`
`"...Then I'll torture Kanon and Jessica to death a whole bunch of times.`
` ...Being able to have two lovers as my toys at the same time...sounds pretty fun, right?`
` Kuhhihihhihhihihihhihihihihi!!"`
`"Kill her...!!!"`
`Without missing by a millimeter, the gold sewing thread shot through Beato's heart...`
`That intense pain was worse than all of the pain before that put together.`
`Beato finally remembered the actual feeling of dying, which she had forgotten over the course of a thousand years...`
`But......she couldn't die.`
` She must not die.`
`If she died, it would mean handing over the two in the parlor to the cruel witch.`
`So she definitely couldn't die.`
`She resolutely...refused to die...!`
`"......New Beatrice, `
`...I have a request.`
` ......The lover's meeting between the two in the parlor will not last long.`
` ......In the amount of time an hourglass can measure, Kanon will probably vanish into the Land of the Dead.`
` ...Would you please allow them at least that much time...?"`
`"No waay.`
` Isn't tearing apart two who love each other fun?`
` You said it yourself.`
` So I want to try it!"`
`"...*cackle*cackle*...`
` In that case, I mustn't allow you that pleasure...`
` *cackle*cackle* Yes, it can be fun, tearing apart lovers."`
`"Really?`
` I'm sure it is fun.`
` So don't get in my way!!`
` Sew more!`
` Sew, sew, sew!!"`
`"Nihi!`
` 410, Understoood!!"`
`The merciless gold sewing needle sewed the gold thread through Beato's heart over and over again.`
`...However, no matter how much it tightened, that heart did not stop...`
`"Nng, ...aaaaahhh, ...this isn't nearly enough...`
` I won't die by something like this...!!"`
`"What are you doing?`
` Make this old hag shut up.`
` Kill her quickly!"`
`"...W-We're killing her...!!`
` Even though we've sewn her heart in place several times,`
` ...this person's heart...w-won't stop...!!"`
`"...Are you...immortal?"`
`"Of course not.`
` ...I've handed the endless over to you.`
` My heart will not beat many more times."`
`"...However, if by making it beat just once more, I can give the two in this room a bit more time, `
`...I'll continue that resistance for all eternity!!"`
`"Sew!!`
` Keep sewing until her heart stops moving!!"`
`"Guuh, guooooh, gwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!"`
`"...Wh-Why doesn't she die?!`
` It's impossible...!!"`
`"Why...isn't her heart stopping...`
`even though it's been sewn in place?!"`
`"Who cares, we'll make the heart explode from the inside nyeh...!`
` How pitiful, and you could've died cleanly if you hadn't resisted us!!"`
`As they said that, even though the gold needle and thread made round trips over and over again, Beato still didn't die...`
`The cruel witch eventually grew pale at how bizarre that was.`
`"......What in the world...are you...?"`
`"...*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` ...You probably cannot understand.`
` ...Even I didn't understand.`
` ...And yet,`
` ...somehow or another, it seems that this is true magic.`
`'!s1`
`...I have now...`
`become it.`
` ...I have become...`
`a true witch!!"`
`"Fixing Explosion Center in Heart Interior.`
` Fuse Preparations Ready!"`
`"Explode!!!"`
`There was a terrible sound......and gold leaf was scattered around the area, along with a cloud of gold butterflies.`
`Beato's chest had opened wide from the inside, `
`...and from that, gold butterflies and gold leaf poured out, staining the surrounding area gold...`
`Then, Beato's flesh crumpled.`
`Like a puppet whose strings had been cut, ...she crouched down...and crumpled.`
`...However, a gold heart tied by gold threads floated in the air...and continued to beat...`
`"......Wh-What the......eeeeeek..."`
`"M-Monster, ...eeeeeeeeep...!"`
`When the Chiester Sisters saw that, they fell on their butts in shock.`
`...Somehow, even though Beato had become nothing more than a heart, it still kept beating, `
`continuing to protect the barrier to the parlor.`
`...It was an immeasurably vast magical power.`
`...Impossible to measure.`
` In other words, endless.`
`"......I-I'm the Endless Witch, right...?`
` ......Why is this old hag...still alive...after all this...?!!`
` Chiester Sisters!!`
` Smash that heart!!`
` Quickly!!"`
`"I-It's impossible, my apologies!`
` We can't do it!!"`
`"......Indeed, it probably will be impossible.`
` No number of people could crush that heart.`
` ...And certainly not the soldiers who serve under His Highness the Dragon King."`
`"In that case,`
` an Endless Witch like me should be able to crush it, right?`
` My power is that of a god!!"`
`"I am afraid to say...`
`that your power cannot`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` leave a single wound on the Endless of ~ib~Beatrice-sama~ib~."`
`"...Just what...do you mean by that...?"`
`"Just as there can be no light without knowledge of shadows,`
` ...there can be no infinite without knowledge of the finite.`
` ......Before Milady Beatrice's true endless power, your frail magic is quite, quite lacking."`
`"What is......that...`
`...aah-"`
`The cruel witch was surprised and stepped back.`
`It was thinner than a lace curtain...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`...no, ~ib~Beatrice~ib~'s form was still standing there.`
`Even after being laid bare so tragically like this, ...she refused to let evil through that door.`
`At that time, ...a shadow just as thin as Beatrice stood behind her.`
`It was Kanon.`
`"......Beatrice-sama,`
` ...thank you very much.`
` ...I won't forget what you've done for us."`
`"...Hmph.`
` ...I'll hear those words of yours once the number of my blessings has surpassed the number of grievances I have caused.`
` ...Was that long enough?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Truly, thank you very much.`
` ...And Beatrice-sama, `
`...you have also done enough.`
` ...Please, `
`...be at peace..."`
`"...Is that so?`
` ...Is this...enough...?`
` ......Ha, ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*..."`
`"What's going on...?`
` ...Why are you guys calling that old hag Beatrice?!`
` Beatrice is my name, right?!`
` It's got to be, since I'm the new Golden Witch and Endless Witch, right?!"`
`"......How rude.`
` How dare you claim Beatrice-sama's name."`
`"I am afraid to say...`
`that the name of Beatrice-sama belongs to the one crowned as the Endless Witch.`
` Right now, you are the Predecessor.`
` ...Pukkukukukuku."`
`"What...did you say...?"`
`"......Farewell, Kanon.`
` ...I'm sure I'll see you soon enough.`
` In a new nightmare."`
`"......In the nightmare of a new night, I will once again be your companion, Beatrice-sama...`
` ...With that, ...if you would excuse me..."`
`Kanon's form grew faint, ...and he disappeared into thin air.`
`After watching him go, ...Beatrice's form also grew faint, ...and before disappearing, it slumped over onto the floor.`
`Then, ...there was a *splat*.`
`The golden heart that had been floating in midair...lost its sparkle, became bloodstained flesh, and fell to the ground.`
`...How frail it was.`
`It was ragged and full of holes.`
`...But until a moment ago, it had sparkled so much, had continued to beat so forcefully.`
`That heart still just barely managed to beat.`
`...However, it was only a matter of time before it stopped.`
`Beatrice, whose form had become fragile and faint like incense smoke, lay on the floor,`
` ...steadily watching her own heart...`
`There, the cruel witch could be seen...`
`"...Wh-What do you mean, endless...?`
` Aren't you actually collapsed in a heap right there?!`
` How can there be a finite infinity? ...That's a contradiction, it couldn't exist!`
` This is the limit of your magic!`
` The endless is better than the finite!!"`
`"............"`
`Beatrice no longer even had the will to respond.`
`...No, on the contrary, it was doubtful that the words of the cruel witch even reached her ears...`
`"If you're a real Endless Witch, try standing up!!`
` How's it going?`
` You can't stand, can you?!`
` Why do you think you can't stand?!`
` It's because you aren't the Endless Witch!!"`
`The cruel witch poked Beatrice's heart with her fingernail.`
`Beatrice had no words with which to respond to that provocation.`
`...However, ...instead of words, she returned a single expression.`
`...It felt humiliating only to the cruel witch.`
`Because she had gently curved her mouth...and smiled.`
`...Footsteps were approaching that place.`
`There was no way she had misheard it.`
` ...That rough squeaking of heels was the sound of Battler's footsteps...`
`"......Battler, is it......?`
` ......Ha, ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*...`
` ...After talking so tough, ...I ended up like this..."`
`".................."`
`"......I've been trying to become...`
`...the true witch you talked about...`
`...in my own way..."`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...I was watching."`
`'!s1`
`...have I...`
`...been able to become...`
`...a witch...?`
` ...Have I earned...`
`...the right to become your opponent...?"`
`"It's useless."`
`Battler said it unbelievably bluntly.`
`As Beatrice breathed painfully, she saw this and sneered at herself, as though she should have expected it.`
`"......Ha, ...*cackle*...`
` ...I see.`
` ...Yes, the road to becoming a true witch will be much, much longer than this..."`
`"...However, ...I will not surrender...`
` ...Just like you never surrendered to my torture, `
`......I will definitely...become a true witch...`
`and be...accepted as your opponent..."`
`"Yeah, it's useless.`
` It's all useless.`
` You aren't my opponent."`
`The cruel witch raised her foot high...`
`...Below it was Beatrice's frail heart.`
`"Die, you old hag!!`
` Let's see how endless you are when you've been crushed to a pulp!!`
` I'm the witch!`
` I am the Golden Witch, Beatrice!!!`
` Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieee!!"`
`'!s0`
`"Wh-What...`
`...is this...?`
` ...Wh-Where is this...?"`
`"Get in your seat.`
` Beato isn't my opponent.`
` ......You are."`
`"...B-Battler...?!`
` What kind of magic is this?!`
` Who cares, it doesn't matter!!`
` Chiester Sisters!!"`
`"45, understood, attacking everywhere!!"`
`"410, understood. Die, Battler!!"`
`The Chiester Sisters each readied their own golden bows and fired golden arrows.`
`The two only pulled the bowstring together when using precision guidance.`
`If they were fighting against an enemy before their eyes, they fired their bows at the same time.`
`And their might did not suffer in the slightest.`
`"Wha, ......i-i-it was deflected?!?!`
` There's no barrier, it was deflected by resistance alone...`
` Uh, 45, Target Analysis!!"`
`"45, understood...`
` ......Huh, ...whaaaat...?!`
` D-Did I...break down?`
` Am I insane...?`
` A-Anti-Magic Resistance Power, Endless Nine...`
` E-Even mythical-class magical attacks won't be effective against the target!!"`
`Golden bow warheads could penetrate any magical armor through reciprocal corrosion.`
`When one tried to block them with anti-magic resistance power, even eight digits were not sufficient to prevent their penetration.`
`...By the way, even famous gods that appear in myths rarely reach as high as nine digits.`
`For that reason, nine digits were enough to measure pretty much all sensible values.`
`...Battler had buried all 9 of those digits with nines...`
`"...How foolish.`
` When Battler-sama gets serious, magical arrows and the like aren't enough to even make his hair tremble."`
`The Chiester Sisters dropped their golden bows in shock...`
`...To Battler himself, it was as though a pair of dragonflies had flown past his shoulder.`
`"......What are you doing?`
` Is that some kind of game?"`
`"...Eeeeeeek, `
`...m-monster..."`
`"Stay back, small fries!!`
` Get in your seat, fake witch!!`
` I'll tear off that mask of yours!!!"`
`""E-Eeeeeeeeeeeeeek!!""`
`The Chiester Sisters couldn't hide their fear at Battler's ferocity, and they backed up as though they'd been struck.`
`Beatrice watched this scene in shock...`
`"...B-Battler, `
`...what...is this supposed to be...?"`
`"Just like you see.`
` You aren't my opponent.`
` She is!!`
` That impostor over there, who's using your name!!!"`
`"Ack...!"`
`"...I'm fighting against a witch.`
` ...I face off against an opponent who claims to be a witch, and I deny witches by defeating them.`
` ...I've seen more than enough of your arrogance."`
`Then, Battler's eyes grew as sharp as blades as he stared down the cruel witch.`
`"...What are you calling magic?`
` What are you calling witches?!`
` You're no witch!!`
` I'll rip that mask off and tear it to shreds!!`
` Virgilia, get ready to fight!!"`
`"Understood.`
` Preparations are complete, so go whenever you're ready.`
` ...Beatrice,`
` stay back and rest."`
`"I-Indeed..."`
`Beato looked at Battler timidly.`
`...She still hadn't been acknowledged as his opponent.`
`Was she qualified to watch the game board from the sidelines...?`
`"Beato, stay back and watch!!`
` I'll tear it off!!`
` I'll thoroughly dismantle this fake witch!!`
` I won't let someone like this call themselves a witch!!`
` You protected the honor of true witches!"`
`"I-I, umm..."`
`"You don't need to say anything.`
` On your behalf, I'll teach her that the name of the Golden Witch definitely isn't that cheap!!"`
`"......B-Battler..."`
`"Those are the general rules."`
`"......Thank you, Ronove.`
` I get most of the rules now.`
` ...I see.`
` You can't win with magic, so you came to face off with me in a world where victory is decided by something other than magic."`
`"...Foolish people.`
` Do you really think you can win against me with twisted logic?!"`
`"Yeah, I do.`
` I'll crush all of your twisted logic, Aunt Eva!!"`
`"I-I am not Eva...!!`
` That is the name of the old shell I shed.`
` I am a true witch, born inside of her...!!"`
`"Don't try to trick me! Your true form isn't a witch or anything like it, but a flesh and blood human.`
` The human culprit, Ushiromiya Eva!!!`
` Virgilia, reconstruct the second twilight!!"`
`"Understood.`
` On the second twilight, Rosa and Maria were killed in the rose garden.`
` We begin by applying the 'Eva Culprit Theory' for that case."`
`"Huuh?`
` Ridiculous!`
` Come, arise, try to remember!`
` What form did Ushiromiya Hideyoshi have?!!"`
`"Whaat?`
` What's this supposed to be?"`
`"...It's a summoning of the dead.`
` A witch can easily bring even the dead up to the stand for testimony..."`
`On the opposing side, a transparent Uncle Hideyoshi was summoned.`
`...Talk about convenient.`
`He looked as though he couldn't see what was going on here, almost like a person on the other side of the TV.`
`"Witness summons.`
` Ushiromiya Hideyoshi's testimony.`
` Come, Hideyoshi, speak...!"`
`"...I was taking care of Eva in our room the whole time.`
` Of course, Eva didn't leave the room."`
`"Aunt Eva.`
` Around here, testimony that isn't red isn't worth crap.`
` I demand that he repeats it again in red!!"`
`"Oh yeah, that's right.`
` Sure, say it in red!"`
`"#ff0000I was in the room the whole time#ffffff.`
` #ff0000Both before and after the time of the crime#ffffff."`
`"See, look.`
` This makes it impossible for Eva to be the culprit, right?!`
` How will you counter this?"`
`"Ridiculous.`
` That move's so lame, I could yawn.`
` ...Beato never used such childish tricks, not even once."`
`"......Battler..."`
`"Repeat it!!`
` 'Aunt Eva was also in the room for the entire time before and after the crime'!!`
` Uncle Hideyoshi was just there to create an alibi.`
` You made him stay in the room and stealthily snuck out.`
` ...If that isn't true, this guy should be able to say so in red!!!"`
`"I-I refuse to repeat it...!`
` Hideyoshi's evidence is sufficient!!`
` There's no need for me to repeat that, right?!"`
`"...She has refused.`
` You need show no mercy.`
` This is check."`
`"Yeah, I'll take it. This opponent's slow!!`
` Check!!`
` Maybe Uncle Hideyoshi didn't leave the room the whole time.`
` But saying he was taking care of you the whole time...is a bright-red lie!"`
`"Therefore, no alibi exists for you!!`
` You had a chance to slip out of the room and kill Aunt Rosa and Maria!`
` If you think you can dodge that, try proclaiming in red that 'Aunt Eva didn't take a step outside of her room'!!`
` You can't, right?`
` Checkmate!!!"`
`"...Wh-What the hell...?!`
` ...I-I don't get it...!!"`
`"Sorry, Aunt Eva.`
` ...Even if you aren't used to the rules, beating your opponent down with all your strength is how this game is played.`
` ...Right, Beato?!"`
`"I-Indeed..."`
`"The witch side resigns.`
` Let us continue on to the next game.`
` Next is the fourth through sixth twilights."`
`It seemed that the witch still didn't understand how to make a winning move, and she lost her composure in irritation.`
`She was probably also angry that a shot had been taken at her while she still didn't get what was going on.`
`...However, I won't go easy on her at all.`
`Just like she didn't go easy on the victims at all, I won't go easy on her...!!`
`"Virgilia, next crime!`
` Let's reconstruct the case with Dad and the rest!!"`
`"Understood.`
` Three people: Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi, went to the mansion and were killed there."`
`"My move won't change.`
` Aunt Eva, you are the culprit!!`
` This time, you don't even have an alibi from Uncle Hideyoshi!!`
` You claim that you were sleeping in that room all by yourself.`
` But that's not true!!`
` If you can proclaim it in red, just try it!!"`
`"...I refuse.`
` ...So tell me!`
` Eva is just a woman.`
` And the people who died were three adults with two guns, right?`
` How did she kill them all by herself?`
` How did she do it with those stakes as weapons?`
` Like everyone keeps asking, how is this stake-shooting device constructed?!"`
`"Explain that!!`
` Unless you can explain it, even if Eva doesn't have an alibi, `
`that doesn't mean that it was possible for her to commit the murders!"`
`'!s0`
` It's a 'Devil's Proof'!`
` Just because I can't explain it, that doesn't deny the existence of an unknown murder technique, or maybe an unknown weapon!!"`
`"In short!!`
` Even if I can't explain how the stake-shooting device is constructed, that doesn't prove that it doesn't exist!!"`
`"Wh-What the hell?!!`
` Does that ridiculousness even count?!"`
`"...Your 'Devil's Proof' is valid."`
`"Agreed.`
` It's a valid 'Devil's Proof'.`
` ...Battler-kun can claim that a stake-shooting device exists without bearing the responsibility of explaining how it is constructed.`
` The witch side cannot object to this move."`
`"...N-Not bad...`
` How pushy..."`
`"Heh!`
` Well, there's this ill-natured witch who trained me well.`
` This is check, okay?!`
` Try saying in red that Aunt Eva didn't take a step out of that room!!"`
`"That's right, you shouldn't be able to say it!`
` If you can't say it, it's over, checkmate!!"`
`"...Th-That's so irrational......!`
` This is...messed up...!"`
`"Those are the rules of this game.`
` ...How about some black tea first?`
` And some delicious cookies as well."`
`"I don't need all that!!`
` Ah, that pisses me off...!`
` So you fight like a coward just because you can't win with magic...!!"`
`"Don't get irritated.`
` Drink some black tea or something.`
` I'll take mine straight.`
` What about you, Beato?"`
`"I-I am fine...`
` ......More importantly, Battler, don't let your guard down.`
` Your opponent is only unfamiliar with the rules.`
` ...This will only really start once your opponent gets the gist of it..."`
`"But I'll crush her.`
` I'll thoroughly crush her.`
` Because she isn't a witch."`
`"If I accept her as a witch, ...all your stubbornness will count for nothing!`
` I don't care what kind of irrational argument or twisted logic I have to use, `
`I'll crush her with all my heart and soul!!"`
`Battler's side then stuck with the 'Eva Culprit Theory' to explain Krauss and Natsuhi, `
`the seventh and eighth twilights, in the exact same way.`
`At the time, there had been no one on the first floor except for Eva and the victims.`
`...As before, no one could establish an alibi for Eva.`
`Back then, Eva had claimed that they'd disappeared while she went to the bathroom, `
`but there was nothing to support that, and the witch side couldn't repeat it in red either.`
`Using the same style of argument as that question regarding the stake shooting machine, `
`the witch side asked once more how Eva could have strangled both of them at the same time all by herself, `
`but of course, Battler splendidly counterattacked by refusing to explain because of the 'Devil's Proof'.`
`Under the storm and stress of Battler's spirit, the witch side was completely swallowed up,`
` having to resign three times during the short period of time she had to grasp the rules...`
`"......Kuhhihihihihyahhyahhhya...`
` Hah, I see!`
` I'm finally starting to get the knack of it.`
` I won't let you have things your own way any more!`
` This time, let me take the initiative.`
` Ronove, reconstruct the fourth through the sixth twilights!`
` Pick out Ushiromiya Kyrie!`
` ...For now, let me return to the murders of Rudolf, Kyrie and Hideyoshi during the fourth through sixth twilights."`
`"...Wh-What is she thinking?`
` Why would she return once more to a situation where she's lost?"`
`"I see...`
` ...This is an unusual attack, and one you do not use.`
` Be careful."`
`"At the time, the survivors were barricaded in the guesthouse.`
` They didn't have food, but out of concern for their safety, they were at least prepared to go without eating until the next day.`
` ...However, in the end, three of them went out for food."`
`"......That's right.`
` In the end, three people went outside to get food."`
`"It's a pain, so I'll add in some red and say it.`
` #ff0000Kyrie didn't think that they needed food#ffffff.`
` Since going without food for about a day wouldn't kill them, `
`#ff0000she claimed that they should not leave the guesthouse#ffffff.`
` And yet, she herself`
` #ff0000suggested that they leave the guesthouse to get food#ffffff.`
` ......Isn't that a contradiction?"`
`"Yes, a spectacular contradiction.`
` A contradiction exists in Kyrie's pattern of behavior."`
`"That contradiction `
`'was created by me with magic'!`
` In other words, I controlled Kyrie using magic and made her say that to lure the sacrifices outside!!"`
`"R-Ridiculous!`
` There's no way that kind of magic exists!!"`
`"It's a 'Devil's Proof', right?!`
` Just because you don't know about that magic doesn't deny its existence!`
` And I don't bear the responsibility of acting out that magic for you.`
` And yet, you have even less room to counter this argument!!`
` ......*giggle*giggle*!`
`"Yes.`
` It is truly a spectacular move.`
` ...Battler-sama, your response, if you please."`
`"That's a weird strategy she's taking.`
` ...So just what is this?"`
`"She has placed a piece attacking Ushiromiya Kyrie's pattern of behavior.`
` ...As has already been explained,`
` Kyrie's pattern of behavior had her saying that they should not go outside or head to the mansion in order to get food.`
` And yet, she herself took the initiative, `
`taking the contradictory action of going out to get food.`
` Unless you can explain this contradiction, she will use this violent move to claim that magic was the cause."`
`"...Well, that's probably what Kyrie-san thought in the beginning.`
` But she probably...uh...thought through a few things midway, `
`then changed her mind and decided that food really was necessary...`
` It'd be bad if, when things got tough, we were so hungry that we had no energy, ...and, well..."`
`"...She is claiming that this change of heart was due to magic.`
` In short, ...while it might be extremely difficult, you must explain the reason for Kyrie's change of heart."`
`"...Wh-What are you saying...?`
` ...You're talking about the inside of Kyrie-san's head, right...?`
` Can I also summon Kyrie-san's ghost and question her?!`
` Beato!`
` Can't you call Kyrie-san here or something?!"`
`"She cannot.`
` That is a move permitted only to the witch side."`
`"...S-Sorry..."`
`"...Aaaaaaahhh, fuck!!`
` She was probably...umm...thinking of us kids and...umm...on the whole, thought that food was necessary and..."`
`"You must present your claim through objective means.`
` ...You'll need concrete proof that Kyrie changed her mind and decided that food really was necessary for some specific reason.`
` ...For example, if someone heard her say that, or if it was written down somewhere."`
`"Too bad, `
`#ff0000the reason she changed her mind was not passed on to anyone, nor was it written down#ffffff!`
` Therefore, you can only speculate as to what was inside Kyrie's mind!`
` So it's impossible to explain!!`
` You don't have a single counter to my move!`
` Isn't it your turn to resign now, Battler-kuuun...?!?!"`
`"...It is possible to hypothesize endlessly as to the reason behind her change of heart.`
` And, it is impossible to crush all of those endless possibilities."`
`"A detestably spectacular move.`
` ......If Battler-sama were to have a method of countering, ...it could probably only be that move."`
`"...Wh-What move is that...?"`
`"...Well,`
` I wonder what kind of move it could be.`
` I have the feeling that it was Milady's specialty, but I cannot remember."`
`".........Nnggg...`
` Quit being stingy and tell me...!"`
`"Beatrice,`
` no answers will be given to those who stop thinking for themselves.`
` ...Think.`
` Think in your own way!"`
`"Why don't you resign right now?`
` And I'll corner you even more with red.`
` #ff0000Until the last instant before she died, Kyrie's behavior pattern of 'not going to get food = not going to the mansion' was maintained#ffffff!`
` And yet, she took the initiative and headed towards the mansion.`
` She was pushing a cart, ready to carry food.`
` Why that contradiction?"`
`"...`
`Because I controlled her with magic!!!`
` This is proof that my magic exists, and that I am a witch!!"`
`"......Shut the hell up...!!`
` A-Are you saying that she never even changed her mind?!`
` ...That the whole time until she died, Kyrie-san thought 'we don't need food', and 'we won't go to the mansion'?`
` Then why did she step forward herself and say that they should go to get food, and go to the mansion...?!!"`
`"Are you saying that Kyrie-san was being controlled with magic?!`
` That's stupid...!!`
` How...how should I break through this magic?!"`
`"...If only Kyrie were here, and just told us the reason behind her change of heart...`
` No, I've already been told in red that she never even changed her mind...!`
` What should I do...?!!`
` There's no move that the human side can counter with!!"`
`"The more I learn about this game, the more advantageous the rules seem for the witch, right?`
` Even if I lose in a lot of areas, if I can win in just one, that alone can display the existence of a witch."`
`"...In other words, Battler-kun has no way of denying witches other than a complete victory!`
` How truly funny that even though you thought you could corner me and call me Eva, `
`it's all been spun around by nothing more than the inside of your respected Kyrie-san's head, right?!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ahhahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Just do it, resign!!`
` If only you'd just accept it!`
` If only you'd just lose!"`
`"......Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiit...`
` It's impossible for a human to prove...`
` I can't do anything but guess at what the dead were thinking when they acted.`
` Furthermore, I can't deny the magic based on conjecture alone.`
` ...To break through it, I need objective proof as to why Kyrie-san had a change of heart..."`
`"...But damn it, `
`it's been said in red that no proof exists as to why she changed her mind and wanted food...`
` ...What should I do, damn it, damn it...!!!"`
`"......Battler-sama,`
` is this...your resignation?"`
`"............Nggg...!`
` 'Not going to get food = not going to the mansion'.`
` But then how should I understand Kyrie-san's thoughts, which actually do contradict each other...?!"`
`"You can't understand!!`
` It's impossible to understand, and impossible to interpret!!`
` That darkness is all of the witch!`
` Come on, it's useless to think, so quit, okay?!`
` You just can't deny witches!`
` After all, I exist right here."`
`"I am the Golden Witch!!`
` I stole that name from the former witch over there!!`
` You can't deny that I am Beatrice!!!"`
`"Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit...!!!`
` You have no right to use that name...!`
` ...And yet, ...I can't think of a move to deny it......!!!"`
`Battler could no longer counter this witch, who was laughing insanely in triumph...`
`He didn't want to give up, but no move appeared.`
`He ground his teeth, making fists with both hands.`
`...But even so, he couldn't think of a brilliant counterattack...!`
`"Battler-sama,`
` your time limit is over, so will you resign...?"`
`'!s0`
`"......The human side has no move in response.`
` It will resi`
`"Wait!`
` ...Th-There is...a counter."`
`"Wh-What did you say...?"`
`"Huh?!`
` What kind of move could possibly exist, Predecessor-sama?!`
` Won't you tell me what kind of move could deny this magic of Beatrice's?`
` You can't, it's impossible!!"`
`"...If the proposition that 'not going to get food = not going to the mansion' cannot be explained by itself, `
`...I will explain it with the contrapositive.`
` In short, you can also explain it with 'she still went to the mansion = she had a goal other than food'."`
`"...Th-This is less my specialty, 'Hempel's Raven', ...than it is Battler's specialty, 'chessboard thinking'.`
` ...If it was impossible for Kyrie to have gone to the mansion with food as a goal, `
`then we can only explain it by saying she had another reason that got her to go outside despite that.`
` In other words, if we can prove that she had such a goal, we can defeat this magic...!"`
`"I-I see...`
` So, she didn't go to the mansion with food as a goal, but she had a different goal,`
` and she said she wanted to go and get food in order to disguise her real goal..."`
`"...T-True enough, it might be possible to find an explanation that way.`
` ...But...how?!"`
`"Teacher, reconstruct the scene of Kyrie's death...!`
` We cannot summon a ghost, but inspecting the corpse ought to be a right allowed to the human side..."`
`"Yes, there is no problem.`
` I shall reconstruct the scene where Ushiromiya Kyrie died.`
` We cannot call Kyrie's ghost here, `
`but by finding out what Kyrie left behind, we may be able to use that as a weapon."`
`"Ha, hahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Fine, search as much as you want!!`
` There's no way you'll learn anything!`
` I just said it in red a short while ago.`
` #ff0000Kyrie did not leave anything written down#ffffff!`
` No matter what you find, how could you possibly figure anything out?!!"`
`"......We may find nothing...`
` ...But, ...Battler is grinding his teeth, fighting to think of a move to break through you.`
` ......This is all that I can do..."`
`Beatrice landed on her feet in the reconstructed hall,`
` approached Kyrie's corpse, and wandered around, observing.`
`"I-I am completely clueless when it comes to fighting on the Human side...`
` ......We need to find evidence, right...?`
` ...Then what should I search for?"`
`"The Great Lady Beatrice is getting down on her knees and crawling around!`
` And she's even indecently searching a corpse?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle* That look suits you...!!"`
`"...Say whatever you wish...`
` ...I cannot do any more than this...`
` ...I care not how I am despised...`
` ......However, I cannot throw Battler away, as he is fighting for my honor...`
` ...Even if I must crawl on the ground and search through dead flesh, `
`...I must answer to that responsibility..."`
`Bathed in the witch's sneers, Beato searched through Kyrie's corpse.`
`...She fished through the pockets, taking what was inside out and laying it on the floor...`
`Laid on the floor...`
`was a handkerchief,`
` tissue,`
` a key to her house,`
` the stub of a boat ticket,`
` a lighter,`
` a cigarette butt,`
` and a single hundred yen coin...`
`There was no special, suspicious object...`
`Although Beato was down on all fours and being sneered at, that was all she could find.`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` What's with that seedy looking trash?!`
` How do you think you can break my magic with that stuff?!`
` Worthless, worthless, are you a moron?!!`
` How can you be so lame, and right after you cut in between us, talking so tough?!`
` Aaah, how pathetic, how embarrassing!!`
` If only you'd just give up and die!"`
`The witch fell over laughing, lambasting Beato.`
`...Beato hung her head, trying to withstand this shame.`
`"...Milady,`
` are you finished with your inspection?"`
`"......I-Indeed...`
` ...I will not find any more than this..."`
`"Can you make any counter from this evidence?`
` If not, then the human side must resign."`
`"............Nnnnn......"`
`"Obviously, you don't have any room to argue back!!`
` I am a witch.`
` You cannot break through my magic!!`
` You're no longer anything but a former witch.`
` A loser who isn't even allowed to take the name Beatrice anymore!!`
` Come on, pile up as much trash and rubbish as you like, and just try to break my magic!!"`
`"...You can't, right?`
` You can't, can you?`
` Kuhhihihihihi, and why's that?`
` It's because I'm a witch.`
` ...It's because you're just a loser without a name!!`
` Kuhhihhyahhyahhyahhyahhyah!!!"`
`"......Something, ......something should be here...`
` ......I won't lose heart...`
` ...I will not lose heart...`
` No matter how much I am sneered at, ...Battler is fighting for my honor, `
`...so for the sake of his honor, ...I must not lose heart......"`
`As Beato held back tears at the words of humiliation she was being showered with,`
` she tried to find if Kyrie was holding something else, ...to find something that could save Battler from his plight, `
`...searching earnestly.`
`...However, nothing more came up...`
`"......Damn it...`
` ...Please, ...Ushiromiya Kyrie...`
` You must save your son from his plight... `
` ......Please, ...after death, lend me power for his sake..."`
`However, Kyrie's body did not answer.`
`...It was only natural that a corpse would remain silent.`
`No dead person existed that would answer Beato, who had lost the Endless Magic...`
`"It's pointless, pointless, pointleeess.`
` Toying with the dead is a privilege only for witches.`
` For you, who is neither a witch nor even a Human, no one exists who will lend a hand!!"`
`"You'll be alone for all eternity!!`
` You have no witch or Human allies, and no one will save you!!`
` If that's frustrating, why don't you cry?!`
` If only you'd just apologize, saying 'I'm sorry I'm so useless'?!`
` Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"......Sorry, ...Battler......`
` ...I...couldn't help you...at all..."`
`"............`
`...No, that's enough.`
` ...Thanks, Beato.`
` I won't waste your efforts..."`
`"I-I don't need consoling...!`
` Just how could you possibly argue back with this pile of rubbish...?!!`
` Just how could you possibly strike back with this rubbish I scraped together while she sneered at me...?!"`
`In front of Beato, who was still crawling on all fours and hitting the pile of objects Kyrie had left behind with her fist, Battler also crouched.`
`And, ...after patting her on the shoulder in thanks, `
`...he moved that hand to the ground, picked up the cigarette butt, and held it up over his head.`
`"......What are you trying to say with that trash...?"`
`"Kyrie-san doesn't smoke."`
`But Kyrie also had a lighter on her.`
`True, she didn't have an actual box of cigarettes, `
`but at a glance, it naturally looked as though Kyrie had a smoking habit...`
`"...Dad smoked, but Kyrie didn't.`
` ...But she did walk around with just a lighter to light Dad's cigarettes."`
`"Ha!`
` So what?`
` If the husband smoked, then even if the wife didn't, it wouldn't be strange for her to be holding a cigarette.`
` Maybe she just picked up the cigarette butt of her husband, who had bad smoking manners?`
` What are you trying to say?`
` What does this have to do with my magic?`
` Nothing at all!!!"`
`"I'll say more.`
` ...This is a different brand of cigarette than what Dad smokes.`
` ...Sorry, Beato.`
` Could you look in the pockets of Dad's corpse too?"`
`"......I-Indeed.`
` ...You mean this...?"`
`"...Checking the brand.`
` The brand is different from the cigarette butt.`
` ...The cigarette butt Kyrie is holding is not of the same brand that Rudolf smokes."`
`"And so what?`
` Maybe Kyrie is just a good girl who likes things to be clean, so she couldn't leave a fallen cigarette butt alone and picked it up?`
` I wouldn't though!!"`
`"...Beato, sorry, but one more time please.`
` ...Uncle Hideyoshi's pockets.`
` ......In this family, only Dad and Hideyoshi smoke cigarettes."`
`"...I-It's here...!`
` Is this it...?`
`Beato found a cigarette box in Hideyoshi's pocket, took a single one out, and held it up.`
`"...Checking the brand.`
` We acknowledge that the cigarette butt is of the same brand that Hideyoshi smokes."`
`"A-And so what?!!`
` How can you break my magic because you found Hideyoshi's cigarette butt in Kyrie's pocket?!!"`
`"......That's right.`
` This cigarette butt is a message from Kyrie-san.`
` No, ...this cigarette butt itself is the reason that Kyrie-san left the guesthouse.`
` Beato, thank you.`
` ...If you hadn't found this, I would've given up here."`
`"......Virgilia!!`
` Reconstruct the situation!`
` The guesthouse after it came to light that Aunt Rosa and Maria had been killed on the second twilight!!"`
`"Understood.`
` Reconstructing now.`
` ...After Rosa and Maria's deaths, the remaining survivors rechecked all of the doors and windows in the mansion.`
` They constructed a barricade.`
` They re-confirmed that their defenses were solid."`
`"There's nothing suspicious about that at all.`
` What are you trying to say?`
` Why are you bringing up the second twilight when we're talking about the fourth twilight and after...?!"`
`"Dad carried a portable cigarette butt holder with him.`
` I'm finally starting to see why Kyrie-san went out of her way to put a cigarette butt in her own pocket."`
`"......It was because that cigarette butt meant something.`
` That cigarette butt was itself a message left by Kyrie-san for us...!!"`
`"Th-Then let's hear it!!`
` How do you plan to deny me `
`with that single cigarette butt?!!"`
`"...As we've heard,`
` after the second twilight, an inspection was done of all the rooms in the guesthouse.`
` ......At that time, Kyrie-san found something that shouldn't exist, in a place where it shouldn't be."`
`"...S-Something that shouldn't exist...?`
` ...What do you mean by that?"`
`"It's this.`
` This cigarette butt.`
` This was set in the ashtray of the guest room that Uncle Hideyoshi was in."`
`"Whaah?!?!`
` What's wrong with there being a cigarette butt in an ashtray?!!`
` Are you sure there isn't something wrong with your head?!"`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, but_3e1646:`
`"However, there was a cigarette butt in the ashtray.`
` When she saw that, Kyrie-san noticed immediately.`
` ...Uncle Hideyoshi was lying.`
` She realized that Aunt Eva hadn't really been sleeping,`
` ...and that she'd snuck out of the room!!"`
`"Repeat it!!`
` 'This cigarette butt was crushed out in the ashtray of the room where Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi were resting!'"`
`"......I-I refuse...!"`
`"I've finally got it......`
` Thank you, Beato."`
`'!s1`
`Was I...`
`...of some...`
`use...?"`
`"Yeah, you were!!`
` Tear it, we'll tear the mask off of the fake witch!!!"`
`From that cigarette butt, Kyrie realized that Hideyoshi was creating an alibi for Eva's sake.`
`Hideyoshi had been tasked with watching over the room to create an alibi,`
` ...and during that time, he was unable to withstand the tension and smoked.`
`Then, Kyrie had confessed that to Rudolf.`
`She confessed that there was a good chance Eva was the culprit, and Hideyoshi was an accomplice.`
`"......Next, Kyrie-san proposed that they go to get food.`
` She then asked Uncle Hideyoshi to lend a hand!!`
` This could only mean one thing."`
`"Kyrie-san planned to isolate Uncle Hideyoshi and question him about the truth!!"`
`"Your 'Hempel's Raven' is valid.`
` Unless the witch side counters this move, the existence of the magic that supposedly controlled Kyrie has been denied."`
`"Wh-What did you saaaaaaaaaaaayy?!?!`
` I-I deny it, anyway, I deny it...!!`
` It wasn't me, noooo!`
` It wasn't Ushiromiya Eva, Eva was sleeping in her room!!!"`
`"Then try saying it.`
` Yeah, you can't say it!`
` You can't say it this time either!!`
`'!s0`
`@:dwave_eng 0, but_3e1666:`
`'!s0`
` I'm the one who was attacking, right?!`
` Why am I the one being attacked now?!`
` When did offense and defense get reversed?!`
` I'm the one questioning you, right?!`
` The witch, me, so whyyyyyyyyyy!!!"`
`"Again!!!!`
` Repeat it!!`
` 'Ushiromiya Eva did not leave the room'!!`
`'!s1`
`it's checkmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate!!"`
`"Does the witch side have a move in response?"`
`"...There cannot be one.`
` There is no truth that can be accepted from a false witch dressed up with truths and falsehoods."`
`'!s0`
` You aren't the Golden Witch!`
` You're a human!`
` Ushiromiya Evaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`'!s0`
`The witch howled.`
`Her entire body was burned with the tremendous heat that denied her own magic and existence, and she let out a howl like a dragon...`
`Her body flickered repeatedly, `
`flashing as though Eva's figure and the witch's figure overlapped.`
`However, that yell was sucked into the flicker, ...making it return to the original form of the cruel witch.`
`"...*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ...kuhhihhahhahahahaha...`
` ...Sure.`
` ...If you want to call me Ushiromiya Eva, then go ahead and do that..."`
`"...That's right, I actually can't repulse all moves related to Ushiromiya Eva being the culprit.`
` ...I may have been dragged down from the position of Golden Witch, `
`...and you might call me Ushiromiya Eva now...`
` ...But you know what? That by itself doesn't mean that witches and magic have been denied!!`
` ...I'll teach you starting now...`
` I'll teach you that I am not Ushiromiya Eva, nor a Human, `
`...but a real witch...!!!`
` Take a look at this red truth!!"`
`When the witch clapped her hands, time advanced in the world of the game board.`
`Battler and Eva dashed to the front of the parlor, calling out Jessica's name.`
`...They were searching for Jessica because they had gone to the servant room, found Nanjo's corpse, and didn't know where Jessica was.`
`"......So, what's your point?`
` ...What are you trying to say?"`
`"...Y-You couldn't be...`
` ...Oh no..."`
`Beato went pale.`
`...In other words, the move the evil witch was about to make was bad enough to make even Beato go pale...`
`"This time, `
`...I'll give you a fatal move that you won't be able to talk yourself out of.`
` ...No, I'll make this move against all Humans who support you.`
` Listen carefully to my move."`
`"...St-Stop it, ...that move is......!"`
`"Beato, stay back...!!`
` I'll take it!`
` Come on, you fake witch!!"`
`"#ff0000After Jessica was injured, `
`Eva was constantly under Battler's supervision.`
` Battler is neither the culprit nor an accomplice.`
` By this, we can establish a perfect alibi for Eva#ffffff."`
`"...Wh-Whaat......?"`
`"I'll seal you,`
` and Humans as well, `
`...in a red barrier that most certainly cannot be escaped from.`
` Farewell, lowly Humans.`
` Sleep for all eternity in a absolute closed room of magic with no exits.`
` ...Come on, listen carefully.`
` Listen to the red truth."`
`#ff0000There are no more than 18 humans on this island#ffffff.`
`Throw away your foolish thoughts of mysterious people hiding and committing crimes.`
`...But if I say it that way, you might also suspect animal culprits.`
`I couldn't stand to hear some irrational theory about how an orangutan trained to commit murder wouldn't count as a human.`
`So, I'll change it like this.`
`#ff0000No life forms other than humans have any connection to this game#ffffff.`
`That's how it is.`
` Next, I'll explain the situation of all 18 people who exist on this island.`
`#ff0000Kinzo is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Krauss is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Natsuhi is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Hideyoshi is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000George is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Rudolf is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Kyrie is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Rosa is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Maria is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Genji is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Shannon is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Kanon is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Gohda is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Kumasawa is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Nanjo is dead#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Those 15 are all dead#ffffff.`
`And.`
`#ff0000Battler is alive#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Eva is alive#ffffff.`
`#ff0000Jessica is alive#ffffff.`
`That's everyone, all 18 of them!`
`"Which means that when the last victim, Nanjo, died, `
`only three people, Battler, Eva, and Jessica, were alive, right?"`
`"......Wh-What did you say...?`
` ...D-Dammit, ...you don't mean......"`
`"#ff0000Eva was with you the whole time.`
` So committing a crime was impossible for her.`
` Of course, Battler-kun isn't the culprit.`
` He wasn't forging an alibi for her, and he took the possibility that she was the culprit into account, watching over her actions carefully.`
` No chance existed for her to do anything suspicious!`
` In short, at the time of the crime, only Nanjo and Jessica were in the servant room#ffffff."`
`"...And I know what you're thinking.`
` Your next move will be this, right?`
` There's also a chance that Jessica is the culprit!`
` But too bad, I'll slice it up in red before you try!!"`
`"#ff0000Ushiromiya Jessica has not committed murder#ffffff!`
` #ff0000She was not involved with Nanjo's murder#ffffff!!`
` #ff0000Her eyes were completely covered.`
` It'd be impossible for her to carry out a murder like that#ffffff!`
` And here's a bonus.`
` Neither Eva nor Battler killed Nanjo, nor were they involved#ffffff!!"`
`"W-Wait a second!!`
` That doesn't make sense!!`
` There were only three humans, then a murder occurs, ...and none of those three were involved?! That's insane!!"`
`"I'll state it clearly.`
` #ff0000The culprit who killed Nanjo was neither Battler nor Eva nor Jessica#ffffff!!`
` In other words, it wasn't one of the survivors.`
` Get iiit?"`
`"No, umm, ......th-that's right!`
` What about multiple personalities...?!`
` Just like how you were originally another personality of Aunt Eva's, `
`...let's say Jessica had another, witch-like personality,`
` which took the name of 'someone other than Jessica' and killed Doctor Nanjo...!!"`
`"Moron.`
` I've already said it in red.`
` #ff0000Jessica's eyes were completely covered, and murder was impossible for her#ffffff!`
` No matter what kind of personality she was possessed by, murder could not be carried out with her body!`
` I wonder if you'll be satisfied if I say it this way?`
` #ff0000No actions caused by Jessica's body had any relation to or influence on the murder of Nanjo#ffffff!`
` #ff0000This also applies to Battler and Eva#ffffff.`
` In other words, no matter how much you try to struggle and interpret it,`
` #ff0000neither Jessica nor Battler nor Eva is the culprit who killed Nanjo#ffffff!"`
`"Y-You've got to be kidding me!!!`
` I mean, everyone else is definitely dead, right?!!`
` Then...all that's left...is the 'Doctor Nanjo Suicide Theory', right?!`
` And the trap theory!`
` The culprit was already dead, but a trap that they had already prepared went off..."`
`"#ff0000Nanjo's death was a homicide#ffffff.`
` ...#ff0000Of course, it was with a direct method of murder, not a trap#ffffff.`
` #ff0000A weapon was readied, and he was killed with it from point-blank range in front of him!`
` The culprit appeared openly before Nanjo's eyes, and as they both looked at each other's faces, the culprit killed him#ffffff...!!"`
`"But wait!!`
` There are only three survivors!`
` You said in red that everyone else is dead!`
` You basically confirmed the life or death status of all 18 people.`
` Furthermore, the existence of a 19th person has already been denied in red...!!"`
`"In other words, no one can exist except the three survivors!!`
` And yet, a fourth person other than those three appeared before Doctor Nanjo!!`
` How could a person other than us appear and murder Doctor Nanjo when no 19th person exists?!?!`
` Insane!!`
` You're lying!!`
` You're lying with the red!!!"`
`"#ff0000The red only tells the truth#ffffff!!!`
` Isn't doubting that the same as betraying the honor of that witch who's behind you, shriveling up in fear of me and hiding behind your back?!"`
`"D-Damn it......!!!"`
`"Right now, `
`I'll state it clearly.`
` ...The one who appeared in front of Nanjo was me.`
` A witch.`
` ...The Golden Witch, who can't be explained away with the 18 humans!!"`
`"V-Virgilia!`
` Ronove...!!`
` Isn't there a contradiction in this situation?!`
` Is she really telling the truth with red?!"`
`"...Yes.`
` Her 'red truth' is valid."`
`"......What an...elaborate and precise cornering..."`
`"H-How should I make a move against her...?`
` Virgilia...!`
` Aren't there any moves...?!"`
`".........I...cannot think of anything..."`
`"...And you, Ronove?!"`
`"............`
`......My apologies.`
` ...However, in these last thousand years,`
` ...I have never seen...such an elaborately beautiful game board layout."`
`'!s1`
`......but it's beautiful......`
` ...What a...`
`beautiful...`
`checkmate made in red......"`
`The witch's teacher and the demon butler were both stunned, ...and an expression of ecstasy rose to their faces...`
`......Forget surrendering, `
`...they were impressed at this perfect checkmate, `
`...which simply had to be admired...`
`When people accept defeat from the bottom of their hearts...`
`...It gives rise to neither regrets nor humiliation.`
`...Nothing is born except feelings of respect...`
`I......no longer knew...what was what anymore.`
`There were absolutely no weak points in her red.`
`She had said in red that all of 15 people had died.`
`She had said in red that no people existed other than the 18.`
`In other words, no more than three people: me, Jessica, and Aunt Eva, existed.`
`And even though none of those three people were the culprit, Doctor Nanjo was killed.`
`And without a doubt, Doctor Nanjo's death was a homicide, he was murdered by 'that person' openly from in front of him...!`
`And she's saying that 'that person'...is a witch......?!!`

` Now, praise the resurrection of the Golden Witch, Beatrice!!`

`"Daaamn iiiiiiiitt......`
` ...I don't...understand...!`
` After...being so thoroughly immobilized by the red,`
` ...I don't...have a clue anymore...!"`
`"...B-Battler...`
` D-Don't lose heart...`
` ...You and I...promised that we would fight each other again, right...?`
` Will you surrender here...?!`
` Will you disappear in a place like this before fighting with me again...?!"`
`"I don't want to break that promise...`
` ......However, ...I can't think of any move to deny her...!!`
` In the first place, ...this isn't even a puzzle!`
` Nothing exists outside the suspects, and all of the suspects are innocent!`
` I was told that they were innocent in red, right?!`
` And also that it was a real homicide, and that the culprit was human, and that they did appear before Doctor Nanjo's eyes and kill him!`
` I give up, ...there's nothing I can do...!!!"`
`"Please, Battler, don't give up, don't lose heart...!`
` ...If you stop thinking, it automatically becomes your loss.`
` ...I'm begging you, don't lose heart...`
` ...I'm also cheering you on, ...so don't lose...!"`
`"I can't think of anything anymore...!!`
` I find myself thinking she's gotta be a witch, who must've done it with magic, which makes all thinking pointless...!`
` It's useless, my head hurts, my brain's tired...`
` I'm starting to think that thinking's pointless, so I should just stop...!!"`
`"Battler, listen...`
` ......In the game of chess, both sides do all they can to make the other lose, so a single game takes a long period of time.`
` ...However, if one side throws away victory from the beginning and makes moves harmful to themselves, the game can end in the blink of an eye.`
` ...That is called a fool's mate."`
`A fool's mate is, simply put, a strange way of playing chess, in which the fastest methods of losing are considered.`
`...Opening the area in front of your own king and inviting the opponent's queen in.`
`Even though the average game time in chess is several hours, a game can be resolved in a scant four moves.`
`...In other words, if both sides try to win in a fight, they are compelled to take a painfully long period of time,`
` ...but if one side decides to lose, the game can be ended far too easily, at any time...`
`"...When the human side stops thinking, it hands the problem before its eyes over to the witch, `
`and even an apple falling from a tree can be immediately resolved as the work of magic."`
`"......It is the same for the witch's side.`
` ...Witches use the red truth.`
` ...By using that, they can explain the true form of magic with humans...and immediately lose."`
`"......You don't have to tell me that...`
` ...You're telling me to not stop thinking, right...?`
` However, `
`......how should I counterattack that person's perfect bright-red move...?`
` For me, `
`...for humans, `
`......it's no longer possible......"`
`'!s1`
`...impossible...?`
` ...Is it really...`
`...impossible for you, Battler...?`
` ...Please, ...don't lose heart......"`
`".........Sorry......`
` ...I've...`
`...reached my limit......"`
`Battler scratched at the floor, crying heavily.`
`...Beato watched that with a distressed face...`
`Then she stood up and spoke to the witch.`
`"......I will make a move as a counter to yours."`
`"Huh?`
` I wonder just how you plan to cut up this perfect checkmate.`
` How can this checkmate, one totally impossible for Humans to break,`
` be defeated by the likes of you?!"`
`"......B-Beatrice, you don't mean to..."`
`"Indeed.`
` ...If a Human cannot make a move, `
`...I will assault you with a move I can use precisely because I am a witch..."`
`"A move you can use because you're a witch...?`
` ...Wh-What are you planning to do...?"`
`'!s1`
`to deny witches."`
`'!s0`
`The teacher and the butler were both startled.`
`...I also immediately understood what it meant.`
`To use the red that only witches could use.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`...`
`~ib~To use the red to deny witches~ib~`
`.`
`It was like using her own sword to slit her own throat.`
`"......Wh-Whaaat...?!`
` ...H-Hey, what are you saying?`
` Deny witches with red...?`
` ......Q-Quit talking like an idiot.`
` If you do that, ...you won't get away unscathed either...!!"`
`"......You are not a witch.`
` And I am not a witch either.`
` ...The road to becoming a true witch is difficult, and I have much, much farther to go..."`
`"......Very well then.`
` Right here, right now, there have never been any witches in the first place.`
` I will strip this deception away myself."`
`"Aren't both of us real, obvious witches?!!`
` Being able to use red is itself proof of witches!`
` I don't know what the definition of a witch is to you, `
`but if you think that you alone will be able to get away unscathed, then-"`
`"How could I make such a mistake?`
` I care not."`
`"Wh......What did you say...?"`
`"I never did manage to become a witch.`
` ...I've done nothing more than finally begin walking down the road to becoming a true witch.`
` ...If what I am right now is a witch, `
`...then I'm a false witch like you, one who is merely drunk on power."`
`"...Rather than existing in that shabby form,`
` I shall erase this form of mine along with you, `
`without any regrets...!"`
`"...A-Are you insane?!?!`
` S-Stop it...!`
` I still wanna be a witch! I hate being Human...!!"`
`"......Witch-sama, please return to your seat.`
` Please, receive the human side's counter from your seat."`
`"Wh-What are you doing?!`
` L-Let go of me!!`
`'!s0`
` Make her stop!!`
` Let gooooooooooooooooooo!!"`
`As the witch stood from her seat and tried to spring upon Beato, Ronove pressed down on both of her shoulders, forcing her back into her seat.`
`And, even after that, he didn't remove his hands from those shoulders.`
`Denying witches was the same thing as denying magic.`
`...That included demons such as Ronove.`
`However, instead of running away, Ronove chose to act as the facilitator for the game,`
` ...and to carry out that duty for his master's sake.`
`"...Beatrice,`
` ......you have...no regrets, right...?"`
`"That's my line.`
` ...Sorry, Teacher.`
` ...Even though you taught me so much about fun magic and magic that brings happiness,`
` ......I wasn't able to use it well at all.`
` ......So I'll study from square one...`
`and start over again.`
` ...I am truly sorry......that you had to suffer for your stupid disciple's misconduct."`
`"...I had a good disciple in the very end.`
` ...Go, do what you believe in."`
`"......I-I don't have a clue what you guys are talking about...`
` ...But I do understand one thing.`
` And I can say this...`
` ...Beato, I don't know what you're trying to do, `
`...but stop trying to do it...!"`
`"You have no moves.`
` But I have one.`
` ...If we let that move get away, she will be revived as a witch in the truest sense, and this time, she will control this whole island.`
` ...All nightmares will be hers to do with as she pleases,`
` and this island will fall into the deepest hell of the evil witch's repeating delusions, for all eternity."`
`"......Can you permit that?`
` ...Don't you care if your dear relatives are toyed with for all eternity in that witch's nightmare?"`
`"S-Still, ...you shouldn't have to sacrifice yourself...`
` Th-This is a game between me and her.`
` You shouldn't have to make your move and sacrifice yourself!`
` I-I'll think of something!`
` I'll surely think of a miraculous move...!!"`
`"So don't rush into it!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhh, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit,`
` I'll definitely think of one, ...so don't rush into iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`"......This game is cruel.`
` The time limit for your consideration has already run out.`
` ......I am now the only one who can do it.`
` ...Calm yourself, Battler.`
` ......I'll defeat her.`
` ...I'll defeat that cruel witch with my own hands..."`
`"W-Wait, Beato!!`
` Stop it, quit it!!`
` There's absolutely no need for you to sacrifice yourself!!"`
`"Weren't you fighting to deny me?`
` ...What a strange person.`
` Hahahahahahahaha."`
`"...Let that child do as she likes.`
` And please, watch her until the end."`
`"...B-But..."`
`"Battler,`
` ...there's only one thing I ask.`
` ...Would you...cover your ears?"`
`"My ears...?`
` Why...?"`
`"......Starting now, I will deny witches in red.`
` I will slice up the game board that she has laid out with her red.`
` ...By doing that,`
` ......I will probably lose my form as a witch as well.`
` ...If you also hear the red truth I speak, you will understand my true form."`
`"......If you alone cover your ears, that truth will not change at all.`
` ...However, `
`...even so, I want you alone to cover your ears.`
` .........I at least want to be a witch...in your eyes.`
` ...Please."`
`"...Beatrice-sama,`
` ...there are no problems on the witch side.`
` Please, your move."`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, ev2_3e1170:`
` She's insane!!`
` Do you plan on dying and taking us with you?!`
` Stop it, don't deny it!!`
` Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!"`
`"...How unsightly for a Golden Witch.`
` ......Okay, are you ready?`
` ...I will remove your check in Battler's stead.`
` What happened on the chessboard where 15 died and only three remained?`
` ...Starting now, I will expose it in red.`
` With that red truth, ...I will pierce and kill both fake witches!"`
`Beato turned around and smiled at Battler.`
`...Most likely, no one would believe that the witch who had gone to the limits of cruelty...`
`would try to leave a smile as the last expression she showed Battler.`
`And that smile signified her last wish, that she wanted him to cover his ears...`
`Denying witches in red...was the same as knowing her shabby form.`
`Battler put both of his hands against his ears...`
`...To protect her final...`
`bit of honor as a witch, he put his hands against his ears, ...rejecting the truth.`
`And he howled.`
`So that not even a bit of what she was saying would slip into his ears.`
`After that...was a world where Battler could hear nothing.`
`Beato was saying something in red.`
`Even the evil witch covered her ears at those bitter contents.`
`...That was...the red truth.`
` Words of power.`
`...Words that denied her own existence.`
`Unique words that only witches could use, which denied witches.`
`Beato spoke.`
`With the red truth, she cut up the bright-red game board that the witch had released.`
`She explained difficult problems that could not be solved by humans, with moves that could only be solved by witches, and began cornering the witch.`
`The 'truth' that Battler was not permitted to hear.`
`If Battler had broken his promise and sneakily eavesdropped...`
`...In an instant, Battler would probably have been able to become the victor in his game with Beato.`
`...He would probably have understood all the riddles on the island, all of the magic and tricks, closed rooms, spells, curses, legends,`
` ...and this entire tale of anger and sadness.`
`However, ...Battler would only learn what that was when he reached the truth by himself.`
`Yes.`
` ...From the beginning, ...Beatrice had wished that Battler would reach that truth by himself.`
`It was something one shouldn't reach by being told it.`
`It was a truth that Battler would have to drag himself to by his own power.`
`A brilliant light gathered with Beato and the evil witch at the center...and grew gradually stronger...`
`It was...the power of truth.`
`......Its heat and brilliance like the sun...`
`shone on all the falsehoods that hid in the darkness, trying to deceive, ...and burnt them to nothing.`
`"Gwoooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!`
` Why?!`
` Why can you die?!`
` Why can you throw away your life...when you have such incredible power?!`
` You who hold the power to control gold, magic, and everything at will, `
`why can you so readily throw that away?!"`
`"...Learn that even with a mountain of gold, `
`even with magic to split the sea, `
`there are some things you can never obtain.`
` ......Come, show yourself.`
` Show your true form, ...Ushiromiya Eva!!!"`
`When the sun exploded and blew everything away...`
`...Eva could be seen there, holding a gun.`
`"...Y-You're the culprit,`
` Aunt Eva...!!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle* ...Ahhahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Took you long enough to notice, Battler-kuun!!"`
`Without any hesitation or mercy, Eva raised her gun and pulled the trigger.`
`...As an explosive sound rang out, Battler's heart was shot through, and he fell to the floor.`
`'!s0`
` ...with blood dripping from his mouth,`
` ...Battler died...`
`But in his last moments, he realized without a doubt that she was a murderer.`
` And not just for killing him...`
`......There have been many murders, and I don't have a clue how they were carried out.`
`However, ...while my ears were covered, `
`...Beato exposed all of them with the red, blasting away all magic.`
`...In other words, ......even though I didn't understand it,`
` ...was that nothing more or less than proof that magic can all be explained with humans?`
`......Beato made me cover my ears.`
`...So I myself don't know the whole truth.`
`...However, ......now that it's been denied in red, `
`I can see one fact which is extremely unfair for us, ...that 'It is possible to deny all magic'.`
`So, in other words, .........`
`...No, `
`...I must not think of that.`
`......If I do, ...then the time I spent covered my ears would be made pointless.`
`If I'm going to regret, I can only regret my own actions.`
`...If, at that time, I'd thought of some move to spin things around and counter the witch's final move, `
`there would have been no need for Beato to sacrifice herself.`
`It was...my own worthlessness...that brought about this conclusion...`
`...Even though it was a pitch-black world where nothing could be seen,`
` ...for some reason, I felt Beato's presence right next to me.`
`...So I tried calling out to her.`
`...You can exchange words with someone whether they're a human or a witch.`
`...So even in a world where witches have been denied, ...I should be allowed to talk to her...`
`"......Beato..."`
`"...Battler, is it...?`
` .........It is done.`
` ...I...did it."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...I didn't hear it, `
`......but I watched you until the very end...`
` I definitely saw you...boldly stand up to that evil witch..."`
`"......With this, ...I am no longer a witch.`
` .........But I will definitely...become a witch again...`
` ...And then, `
`...I will make it so that I can be called the Golden Witch again,`
` ......and once again, `
`......return...`
`so that I can be accepted as your opponent......"`
`"No.`
` ......You...were a witch."`
`"......Huh...?"`
`"...I...saw it.`
` ......When you took that evil witch,`
` ...and blew her away with that awesome magic, exposing her true form, `
`...I saw it with my own eyes..."`
`"Th-That wasn't magic, `
`...but the red-"`
`"No, it was magic.`
` ......You were definitely...the Golden Witch.`
` ......Even if you deny it yourself,`
` ......I'll acknowledge it.`
`'!s1`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`'You are definitely...`
`the Golden Witch'."`
`...When Battler said those words...`
`In the world that had been dark, ...there was suddenly a single grain.`
`...A small grain of gold, like a wheat seed, shone brightly.`
`And...even though it was small, it had a strong, gold-colored sparkle.`
`Then, ...it shone on the two of them, sitting with their backs together...`
`So, they each became aware of their own form.`
`...They did not exist only as consciousness.`
`...They became aware that they had bodies and definitely existed.`
`...No, perhaps we should say that they each had been given an existence called a body.`
`When Battler looked at his own form, he wasn't that surprised.`
`...But when Beato looked at her own form, she was a little startled.`
`...From Battler's perspective, she looked just like normal,`
` ...but for a short while, she was surprised by that form...`
`"...What...`
`...is going on......?"`
`"The sparkle from that grain of light...is slowly getting stronger..."`
`That grain of wheat was no longer simply gold-colored, but was like the light of the sun.`
`Then, it softly......began to approach Beato's chest.`
`When that grain of the sun...was sucked inside her chest-`
`...The world was wrapped in a deep blue sky, and then a deep blue ocean was spread out below them.`
`An island rose up, trees sprouted and created a forest, walls surrounded us and a ceiling swallowed us.`
`And was adorned with more and more things, `
`...made to be like the hall in the Ushiromiya mansion.`
`In the middle of the fantastical hall where many gold butterflies beat their wings, `
`...many tables were set up with white tablecloths, like it was a party,`
` and beautiful cooking and fruits were set out.`
`...And over there...were a great many shapes.`
` It was everyone talking together and smiling.`
`"...E-Everyone......"`
`There was Dad and Kyrie-san, Uncle Krauss, Aunt Natsuhi and Aunt Rosa, and of course, even Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi.`
`...George-aniki, Jessica, Maria, ...wait, wait, even Shannon-chan, Kanon-kun, Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san are here.`
`Everyone, everyone was at the party, clapping their hands and celebrating our return...`
`"Wh-Why...?`
` Even though everyone was dead...!`
` Why are they alive...?!"`
`"...In the Golden Land, the souls of all the dead can be revived.`
` ...Welcome back, Beatrice.`
` And welcome, Battler-kun.`
` Welcome to the Golden Land."`
`"......I...made it?`
` ...I made it...`
`to the door of the Golden Land?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...Milady, you have finally managed to invite everyone here.`
` Welcome, Battler-sama, to the Golden Land."`
`"Battler.`
` ......So, you have finally made it this far."`
`"G-Grandfather, `
`......where in the world...am I...?"`
`"My...blood, which is incompatible with magic, runs most deeply in your veins.`
` ...Therefore, you were the only one who could not reach the Golden Land, and Beatrice has been searching for you this whole time.`
` ...She tried everything to bring you here."`
`"......What did you say...?"`
`"Battler-sama, if you would take your seat.`
` Tonight's dinner is my very best work.`
` If you would, please relish it."`
`"You should be honored!!`
` Normally, I would've eaten all of it, but I left you some out of gratitude!"`
`"...The Seven Stakes nee-chans..."`
`"In the Golden Land, all of those with minds are equal.`
` ...Here, there is no distinction between us furniture, Humans, and witches."`
`"...Battler-sama,`
` we were waiting for you.`
` Welcome to the Golden Land..."`
`"Shannon-chan, ...George-aniki...!!"`
`"...I still feel like this might be a dream...`
` We should have died.`
` ...But...I'm alive.`
` And everyone...everyone is here...and happy.`
` ...I can't believe it."`
`"That's right, this place must be a dream wooorld!`
` So it must be a dream that George is acting so friendly with a maid girl!`
` Whaaaaaah!"`
`"Could you give it a rest, Eva?`
` For now, you gotta stay quiet and bless the two young'uns.`
` The Golden Land is a city of bliss.`
` We should never quarrel here...!"`
`"Here, any people are free to love each other.`
` ...No one needs to hesitate over it."`
`"Jessica-chan, Kanon-kun, you look so wonderfuul!`
` I'm jealo-us!"`
`"...H-Hey, Battler...`
` I'm a little, umm, wahahahaha..."`
`"Battler-sama, welcome.`
` And welcome home..."`
`Jessica was probably embarrassed because she was holding hands with Kanon-kun.`
`Kanon-kun wanted to act humbly like a servant and bow, `
`but since neither of them could let go of the other's hand, he couldn't do it so well, and the whole scene looked fairly comical.`
`"With a servant child...?!!`
` You can't, our Jessica cannot do such a thing...!!"`
`"It's hardly a big deal, correct?`
` Let her at least choose the person she likes."`
`"She can't, she can't, aaaaaaaaaahhh, Jessicaaaaaaaaa!"`
`"You can't eitheeeeeer, Geooooooooorge!"`
`...As Aunt Natsuhi and Aunt Eva hugged each other, they cried tears of regret for their adorable children.`
`...Even though they had always been at odds.`
`...It was a very bizarre scene.`
`"...It isn't really a problem, right?`
` It doesn't matter who likes who."`
`"That's right.`
` It's proof that a parent's too attached to their child."`
`"Battleer, `
`no matter what kind of woman you bring home, I'll give her a warm welcome, okay?"`
`"Don't you dare introduce her to this man, okay?`
` He'll get his hands on her immediately.`
` They'll run off together right away."`
`"......Battler.`
` You finally came here.`
` Kihhihihihihihihihi."`
`"Maria, `
`......from the very beginning, `
`...you knew we'd be coming here...?"`
`"Uu-!`
` That's why I wasn't scared at all.`
` Everyone was being a coward and trembling.`
` It was funny!"`
`"...What the hell.`
` ...Even though I thought you were the most screwed up, `
`...you actually knew the truth from the beginning."`
`"H-How rude...!`
` I simply cannot forgive you for speaking of Lady MARIA in that way!"`
`"Formulating Firing Curve, Attack Preparations Ready.`
` Lady MARIA, we can attack at any time.`
` Nihi!"`
`"Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi...!`
`'!s0`
`"...Be quiet.`
` You are in the presence of Beatrice-sama."`
`"Come now, no need to be so stiff.`
` Let's be considerate of their desire to joke around and have fun.`
` More importantly, why don't we begin preparing for the toast?"`
`"Yes, preparations for my excellent mackerel cooking are complete.`
` I can serve it at any time."`
`"Hey!! You people!`
` Work a little more like furniture!!"`
`"Nooooo!!`
` I'm gonna stuff myself some mo-re!`
` Uu-aaah!"`
`"Come on, let's work.`
` Don't keep the guests waiting.`
` Let's work studiously and attend to them.`
` Don't let the guests do anything.`
` Make them lazy, make them slothful, fatten them like pigs.`
` Ahhahaha!"`
`"...Beatrice.`
` Battler-kun.`
` This way."`
`Grandfather and Virgilia were standing on the landing at the top of the staircase, beckoning to us.`
`Beato and I turned our heads to see what was going on, then climbed the stairs together.`
`From the hall, it looked like a very high stage.`
`A small table had been set up there, as well as a piece of parchment and an old-fashioned quill pen.`
`I saw that strange magical characters and Japanese were written side by side.`
`...And below it, many names were written.`
`There were 17 of them.`
`...Grandfather was the first, and everyone's names had been signed all over it.`
`The people who arrived at the Golden Land probably signed this one after another.`
`"Battler,`
` now that you are here, everyone is gathered.`
` Listen carefully."`
`"The Golden Land is not a world supported by the power of magic alone.`
` The cooperation and approval of all humans who receive happiness here is required.`
` For that sake, we must gather the signatures of everyone here."`
`"Last time, `
`the door to the Golden Land was finally opened, but you refused to sign.`
` ...Although you probably don't remember it.`
` Because you refused to sign, this world was once again sealed in darkness."`
`"...Just hearing it like that, ...it kinda sounds like I'm the only stubborn one, `
`and that I've been a bother to everyone in various ways..."`
`"That's because your stubbornness is the real deal.`
` It seems you received more than just blood from Kinzo."`
`Beato laughed amiably.`
`I should've felt like she was making fun of me, but without thinking, I went along with her, laughing and smiling.`
`"Magic is a miracle.`
` ...Miracles cannot be made complete unless everyone believes.`
` ...And, when you believed in the end, this miracle, ...the Golden Land, was completed."`
`".........It looks like I've been a real pain.`
` ...So, what should I do...?"`
`"First, sign here.`
` Then, Beatrice, you sign here."`
`"...Quill pens are pretty hard to use, huh?`
` ...Whoa, it shot."`
`"You klutz.`
` Shooting ink is a bad omen.`
` Can't you at least write your name quickly?`
` Your pen's wriggling all over the place like a worm.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"You should talk...!`
` Don't write it in #fefefekatakana#ffffff!`
` Beatrice is a stylish name, so write it in cursive!`
` You're making the quill and your name cry!"`
`"Sh-Shut up, in school, didn't they tell you not to use cursive on tests?"`
`"Hey, this is a solemn ceremony. Be silent."`
`"Very well.`
` We have gathered the two signatures, as well as the form for the covenant.`
` ...Both of you, your oath please.`
` We'll start with Beatrice.`
` Put your hand on the covenant and take the oath."`
`"...'As a good witch, Beatrice swears to continue her studies from this point forth to bring happiness to the people'.`
` ...Say it."`
`"...I-Indeed...`
` ...I-It's a little embarrassing.`
` ...As a good witch, `
`Beatrice swears to continue her studies from this point forth to bring happiness to the people.`
` ...Will that do?"`
`"Acceptable.`
` Battler is next."`
`"In the same way, Battler-kun,`
` put your hand on the covenant and take the oath.`
` ...'As a member of the Golden Land, Ushiromiya Battler swears to serve for the sake of his own happiness and that of his neighbor'."`
`"Ah, `
`...as a member of the Golden Land, `
`Ushiromiya Battler swears to serve for the sake of his own happiness and that of his neighbor.`
` ...I'm embarrassed too..."`
`"Listen, everyone...!!`
` Here and now, we have gathered the oaths of all 18 humans who accept the Golden Land...!!"`
`When Kinzo proclaimed that, everyone applauded at once, praising us.`
`...Since I had been the only stubborn one and had just been a pain, I felt a little bad about being the most celebrated one.`
`"And with that, in accordance with the ancient rites, we ask Battler-kun, the last to make the oath, to sign the invitation to the Golden Land.`
` ...This is something that invites the Golden Witch, Beatrice, to the Golden Land.`
` The Golden Land welcomes the Golden Witch through a consensus of those who have acknowledged it...and becomes complete."`
`"Battler, I will read it out loud.`
` Listen carefully.`
` ......'The 18 of us accept Beatrice as the Golden Witch and welcome her to the Golden Land'."`
`"What's going on with you? You won't be invited unless I send an invitation?"`
`"That does seem to be the ceremony.`
` It feels stiff even to me.`
` Why don't we end it quickly?`
` I've been so hungry for a while now."`
`"...Come to think of it, I've only been pecking at canned food and haven't eaten anything good.`
` Let's quickly finish this signing."`
`"What's this?`
` 'I acknowledge you as a witch'.`
` ......Huh?`
` That's pretty simple.`
` Damn you Grandfather, exaggerating it so much."`
`"Come on, come on, quickly."`
` "Sign, right here."`
`"......Huh...?"`
`"Quickly." `
`"Sign."`
`...With slightly weird and uncomfortable smiles, the two of them started demanding that I sign...`
`At that time, an incredible sound like that of a glass window breaking reverberated through the hall, `
`and the bustling tumult faded back into complete silence.`
`I dropped the quill pen and turned around, trying to see what had happened.`
`When I did, `
`......where had she come from?`
`...A human who clearly hadn't been there a short while ago was in the very center of the hall, ...looking up at us.`
`Who's that...?`
` ...A girl?`
`She's probably about the same age as Jessica and me.`
`...But I didn't know that face.`
`None of the other people here knew that face either.`
`"...Wh-Who are you?!`
` Who is this?!`
` Where did you come from?!`
` Those without invitations are not needed at my party.`
` Servants, kick her out!!"`
`"As you command!!`
` Surround her!!"`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory surrounded her from seven directions, taking out magic blades that drew purple curves and blocking her.`
`And from out of nowhere, shuffling goat-head servants appeared in great numbers, surrounding that girl.`
`On top of that, the Chiester Sisters stood in front of Beato like a wall, readying a golden bow and pulling back the bowstring...`
`"............"`
`But the girl didn't move at all.`
`...On the contrary, she was still staring at us on the landing, as though she didn't mind at all.`
`...Who is she looking at...?`
` Beato?`
` Grandfather?`
`......Could it be...me......?`
`Yes.`
` ...The girl was staring straight into my eyes, ...glaring.`
`Then, after our eyes met perfectly, she yelled.`
`"You mustn't sign that!!!`
` Are you going to accept your own defeat?!`
` Don't be tricked by the witch!!!"`
`"...Huh?`
` By the witch, `
`...huh?!"`
`At that time, something incredibly strong lifted me by the nape of my neck.`
`...Wh-What's going on...?!`
`And after being made to turn around behind me,`
` ...I saw Virgilia, with an eerie smile on her face, and the muscular forms of goat monsters...`
`A goat monster that looked about 2 meters tall was grabbing me with an arm as thick as a log...!`
`"Hohhohohohohohohohohohoho...`
` There is no need to listen to an uninvited guest.`
` Come, offer your signature as well.`
` On this written oath.`
` 'Ushiromiya Battler acknowledges the existence of witches'.`
` Come now, sign the written oath...!!"`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, but_3e1825:`
`As the goat monsters held me down with the power of a vise, they forced me to grab the quill pen.`
`...I couldn't even touch the floor with my feet, much less resist...!`
`"Battleer, why are you resisting?`
` Weren't you just about to sign willingly...?`
` Don't change your mind now, after all that, okaaay?`
` Didn't you think for an instant...that it might be okay to acknowledge witches?`
` You thought that, riiiiiight?`
` Kukkikikikkakkakakakakakakakakaka!!"`
`'!s1`
`I was...`
`t-`
`tricked...?`
` That's insane......`
` Beato isn't that kind of..."`
`"............"`
`"...H-Hihhihahhahhahaaaaaaaaah!!`
` Sorry, Battleer, I am that kind of persooooooooooon!!`
` Aah, it's useless now, it looks like sentimental sob stories don't suit meeeeeeeeeee!!`
` Teacher, I'm counting on you to use all your strength!!`
` That was such a plain role to play, and I got so bored!"`
`"I don't know who you are, girl,`
` but I'll beat you to death, mash you and crush you until threads start trailing, okaaaaaaaaaaaayy?!`
` I'll make you regret being born a womaaaaaaaaaaaan, `
`hyahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!"`
`As Beato waved her gold pipe, `
`the massive chandelier hanging in the hall was electrocuted, and from that, a terrible purple thunderbolt fell...!`
`It should have been a direct hit on the girl right below it, turning her to ash.`
`However, ...not a single hair was singed.`
`"Hoh...!!`
` So, your sudden appearance here wasn't just a fluke...!!`
` Tell me! State your name!!"`
`"I don't have any name to give you.`
` ......More importantly,`
` ...you idiot!!!`
`  How long are you going to be tricked?!!`
` You softy!!`
` Figure it out already!!`
` This is all the witch's trap!!"`
`Those words were aimed at me.`
`...This is all...`
`the witch's trap, she says...?`
`That can't be...`
`Beato reformed and swore to become a good witch...`
`"......Beato.........`
` ...All this about traps...`
` ...It's a lie, right...?`
` Please, ......tell me it's a lie..."`
`"...Sorry, Battleer.`
` It was pretty fun.`
` ...Sure, I just did what Teacher told me, but look how great it turned out!"`
`"Apparently, if you start out all hostile and needlessly brutal, then turn incompetent and soft at just the right moment, you can spark a huge bump on your affection meter, riiight?"`
`"I've heard villains who start all lovey-dovey and then freak the shit out are all the rage these days, riiiiiight?`
` Even I've studied a bunch of those manga, anime, and galge that've been so popular lately, you seeee?"`
`"And for you, just as expected, it was 'tears please', and you're down!!`
` Hihhyahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahaha, i-diot, what a truly simple person!!`
` I'll call this 'the North Wind and the Sun Strategy'.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"...That's not......`
`'!s1`
`Damn you, `
`...you bastard...`
`'!sd`
`"...............`
`...Yes, that expression suits you the most.`
` That caring expression of yours really doesn't suit me after all.`
` It made my back itch, and I was frantically trying not to let it get to me.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"Too bad, witches never refooorm☆`
` Hyaahhahhahhahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!!`
` You take care of the signature, Teacher!`
` This uninvited guest is my prey!!"`
`"Come, you can no longer refuse to sign.`
` ...Come on, look.`
` Sign it and offer your body, your mind, and your soul...!!"`
`When Virgilia lifted her chin as a signal, the goat monsters, with an even more vise-like power,`
` forced my arm to approach the parchment...!`
`Owowowow, ...these guys are trying to make me sign, even if it breaks my arm...`
`Then, a bright red light burst open with me at the center, knocking the witches and the goat monsters away.`
`Did that girl save me...?!`
` B-But who in the world is that? I don't have a clue!`
`"How long do you plan to keep playing in a place like this...?`
` Give it a rest.`
` I'm jealous of you."`
`"......I-I'm glad you saved me, but that's a pretty cruel way to say it.`
` ...Sorry, but who are you...?"`
`".........`
`......Witch of Rokkenjima!!`
` Give him back!!"`
`"Kuhhahahahahahahahah!!`
` Who would do that, you fool?!!`
` Battler is my toy.`
` My most favorite toy in the world...!!`
` I won't get tired of him, I won't throw him away, and I won't hand him over to anyone!!`
` Even Battler is enjoying this to the fullest.`
` Together with me, he is having so much fun playing.`
` No matter who you are, I won't let you get in the way...!!"`
`"Yeah, it looks like you're having a lot of fun. It makes me so jealous, it ticks me off!!`
` Here you are, in a place like this, guffawing and having a loud, noisy time with everyone!"`
`"With all these beautiful witches around to pamper you,`
` you must be having so much fun that you don't even want to go back!!"`
`"...A-Are you talking to me...?`
` Wait, wait, you've got the wrong idea...!`
` This is a pain for me too!`
` What do you mean, fun? You don't know what I've been through...!"`

`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` I'm sorry, but I'll have to turn you down there.`
` I am satisfied with the toy I have.`
` A rude toy like you is not fitting for my toy box!"`
`"Yes, I understand.`
` Who would ever play with someone like you?`
` ...But I will thank you just a little.`
` ...For letting me meet everyone like this."`
`"...Who...`
`...are you...?`
` ............You couldn't be..."`
`"I see, is that it...?`
` ......Yes, I understand, I know who you are!`
` ...I see,`
` so you are the piece Lady Bernkastel threw in.`
` How amusing!!"`
`"Why don't I formally invite you to my party?!!`
` I'll welcome you fully...!!`
` Along with Battler, I'll play nicely, break you, kill you, crush you, turn you to ash, mix you with bread dough and bake you until you're fluffy!!`
` Fuhhahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaahh!!"`
`"......Aaah, it's useless, it's all useless!`
` You can't do that!`
` On the Rokkenjima of 1986,`
` ...I'll expose everything that happened to the light of day!"`
`"I'll show you that before the truth, you're like an icicle scared of the coming spring!`
` Prepare yourself, Golden Witch!`
` Beatrice!!!"`
`"Wahahahaha, you all right, Battler-kun...?!`
` We're already on the ground, and you can't fall any further than that, wahahahaha...!"`
`"Uu-, hahahahahaha!`
` Faaall, faaall, hahahahaha!"`
`In the lobby of the Niijima airport, Maria dashed around in excitement.`
`Battler's uproar on the plane must have been hilarious.`
`"Hey, Maria!`
` Cut that out!`
` ...I'm sorry, Battler-kun.`
` Please don't take it badly."`
`"What a pathetic guy you are.`
` Even with that huge body, you still can't handle vehicles?"`
`"Ah, shut up...`
` All humans have one or two things they can't handle..."`
`"Battler-kun, why don't you come with your aunt on an overseas trip sometime soon?`
` How about Europe?`
` I'm sure you could manage a half-day trip on a plane.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"...Stop it, Mother.`
` Battler-kun's dislike for vehicles is probably genetic."`
`"Oh, you mean Asumu-san?"`
`"...For some reason, she just couldn't handle vehicles.`
` Pretty much anything other than a bicycle or a car.`
` Whenever we tried to go far away, that woman was so annoying with the 'not this, not that, `
`I'm scared, I'm scared, fall, fall, gyaah, gyaah'."`
`"Children tend to learn that things their parents can't handle are dangerous.`
` I'm sure Battler-kun saw Asumu-san doing something like that and learned that vehicles are scary."`
`"*giggle*giggle*`
` So it's Asumu-san's genes then, is it?"`
`"Who knows.`
` Those would be some pretty annoying genes.`
` ......That's enough talking about Asumu.`
` Right now, you're the one who's here.`
` Right?"`
`"...You're right, sorry."`
`"Heeey, the cars are here!`
` Exactly three of them.`
` Get in, get in!"`
`"Fall, faaall!!`
` Where's the parachuuute, where's the parachuuute?!!`
` Uu-uu-, *giggle*!!"`
`"Why you little!!`
` Hold on, hold on, stop right there!`
` I'll sentence you to the little girl tickle punishmeeent!!"`
`"Heheheheheh.`
` Being in high spirits is such a wonderful thing.`
` Without Battler-kun and Maria-chan, the atmosphere in that plane would have been pretty grim."`
`"Thanks.`
` I'll assume you mean that literally.`
` ...Hey, brats!`
` The taxis are here!`
` You can play around later."`
`"Uu-uu-!!`
` Taxiii, taxiii!!`
` I'm getting in fiiirst!`
` *giggle*!!"`
`"Hey!`
` Maria, and you too, Battler-kun, stop fooling around!`
` You'll bump into someone!"`
`The tone of Aunt Rosa's voice grew a little frightening.`
`When even Battler realized they were fooling around a bit too much, ...just as expected, he bumped into someone.`
`"Oh, sorry..."`
`"Battler-kun, you guys are going in that car.`
` You're keeping them waiting."`
`After George urged him to hurry on, Battler apologized to the person he had bumped into and ran up to his parents, who were telling him to come quickly.`
`With a clunking sound, the doors on the three taxis were shut one after another, and they departed for the harbor...`
`...As their taxis dashed away...`
`The entire world grew suddenly dull...`
`and slowed to a halt.`
`Voices, the wind, and even sound...`
` All of it stopped, and all the people who were trying to move froze like the instant someone takes a photo,`
` ...coming to a halt.`
`People and machines and clock hands, even the dust dancing in the wind, ...were frozen.`
`Some people who were walking froze with one leg still in the air.`
`Scraps of paper dancing in the wind were pinned in midair, frozen in place.`
`...Then, among the shadows standing still in this unmoving world, a single one stirred.`
`It was a girl.`
`The girl Battler had just bumped into...`
`Though she had moved, it was a truly subtle thing.`
`Her gaze dropped, her shoulders lowered a miniscule amount, and she sighed.`
` ...That was all.`
`In a normal world, that probably wouldn't even be taken as movement,`
` but in this still world, it looked very out of place.`
`...Then, something else moved.`
`It was a black cat wandering around the shadows near the taxi rank.`
`It came up right behind the girl...`
`and leisurely...changed its form into that of a Human.`
`This was no cat.`
` It was a witch.`
`Of course, the girl was also a witch.`
`As the witch stood still, her gaze still downwards, she muttered...`
`"......I can't...`
`stop everyone from going to Rokkenjima, can I...?"`
`"You cannot.`
` On October 4, 1986, you are not here."`
`"...If I were, would stopping everyone really have been possible...?"`
`"Well, I can't imagine what a six-year-old girl could do `
`to make them turn back.`
` ...Still, that's right.`
` If you were in this place, the probability wouldn't have been zero.`
` Whenever there's a probability greater than zero, I can seek out a miracle."`
`"...If I hadn't been sick, `
`...and they hadn't left me behind..."`
`With her head facing downwards, the witch tightened her fists...`
`...They were trembling very slightly.`
`"You were sick in bed starting October 3, 1986.`
` And Beato's game board is sealed off starting October 4.`
` ...You are not given a chance to avoid getting sick.`
` ...In other words, it would normally be absolutely impossible for you to enter her game board."`
`"Thanks for being patronizing.`
` ...I know that.`
` ...I know that just seeing Father, Mother, `
`......and Onii-chan healthy like this...`
`...even that alone...`
`is a spectacular miracle..."`
`Ange had tried to stand in the way of her family, attempting to stop them from leaving the airport...and heading towards Rokkenjima.`
`...However, it was impossible for her to exist in October 4, 1986, so she couldn't do it.`
`Even though her brother had only bumped into her and apologized...`
`'!s0`
`...it had been such a miracle...`
`that she could cry...`
`"......Sorry about the sarcasm.`
` I won't waste the miracle you've given me."`
`"I'm glad to hear it.`
` ...Come, let us go with them.`
` To Rokkenjima.`
` All of the pieces are already gathered.`
` ...The curtain will open on the fourth game.`
` By this time, Beato and Battler will already be seated."`
`'!s1`
`...no, `
`...to where everyone's fates changed, ...the Rokkenjima...`
`of October 4, 1986......"`
`...What happened on that day?`
`I'll expose it.`
` I'll learn what it is.`
` And I'll bring them back...!`
`As she stood there with her fists still clenched, she surely turned her face up to the heavens.`
`A single teardrop from the depths of her eyes dripped down into the air.`
`And when time started moving again, the two witches' figures were swallowed up by a blowing gale and erased in an instant.`
`"Good morning, Milady.`
` My, my, you do appear to be in a good mood.`
` What a pleasant awakening you seem to have had."`
`"What do you mean, pleasant awakening...?!`
` I was so excited, I couldn't sleep a wink.`
` After all, the curtain is rising on the fun, fun fourth game...!"`
`It seemed that she truly had been so excited that she hadn't gotten any sleep.`
`Did she show absolutely no signs of lacking sleep because she was young, or because she had the mind of a little kid?`
`Ronove chose not to say that aloud, and laughed 'pu ku ku' instead.`
`"I really ran that Battler into the ground last time!`
` Ah, the look on his face when he was like 'You tricked me'!`
` That was so patheeetic!`
` Even so, is that guy still feeling down?"`
`"Feeling down, you say...?"`
`"Hmm, well, that's right.`
` ...That man's a bit too trusting for his age, isn't he?"`
`"Indeed.`
` Although you could call that his charm.`
` Pu ku ku..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Ain't it the truth, ain't it the truth?`
` Well, speaking of which.`
` Didn't he totally fall for that one last time?"`
`"Yes, totally and splendidly.`
` ...You violated the purity of one never deceived since the time of his birth, as well as his rosebud-like innocence, all to your heart's content.`
` ......Even the joy of dashing across a field covered with beautiful new snow on a winter morning and trampling it completely wouldn't even begin to compare."`
`"Didn't you take Battler-sama's innocent heart,`
` and quite thrillingly, splendidly, atrociously, mercilessly, and unculturedly go just a little too far...?`
` And you insulted him to the highest degree, enough to make one uneasy.`
` Most people would be crushed after something like that.`
` Pukukukuku, so much so that they wouldn't want to see your face ever again."`
`"I-I know that much...!`
` I also...umm...thought that if he was too disheartened to join us at the table, `
`even though the fourth game is finally starting, that would be such a pain,`
` so I came to you, thinking that it'd be better to prepare a counter-measure for that case beforehand...!"`
`"Hmmmm...`
` In that case, perhaps it really would be best to prepare such a counter-measure.`
` I am sad to say that your 'North Wind and the Sun Strategy' gave Battler-sama quite a shock."`
`"H-Hoh...`
` ...A shock, you say? How bad of one...?"`
`Beato lowered her voice slightly, asking timidly.`
`Ronove followed suit...and lowered his voice in the same way.`
`"...In truth, he has been crouching and clutching at his knees for some time now.`
` I spoke to him several times, but he did not answer.`
` I also brought him some food, but he never even touched it."`
`"...Th-That is...troublesome...`
` Is he really feeling that down...?"`
`"Pukukukuku.`
` It is only natural.`
` ...After all, you `
`'!s0`
`rough・`
`ly`
`'!sd`
`@:dwave_eng 0, ron_4e29:`
`"Hoh, distrust of Humans? How convenient!`
` Let him give up on Humans and trust witches, wahahaha...`
` ......O-Oh, `
`*cough*.`
` Sorry, I shouldn't fool around too much."`
`Beato had tried to joke about it, but the situation seemed to be quite serious, so that even she took the hint and hid her laughter.`
`"...Is it really that serious...?`
` Sh-Should we wait just a little longer before beginning the fourth game...?"`
`"Lady Bernkastel's guest will be arriving,`
` so it may be best to open the fourth game quickly.`
` However, perhaps you ought to show a little concern for Battler's feelings, Milady."`
`"Concern!`
` Show concern, you say?!`
` How should I do that...?!`
` He is feeling down, so...`
`th-that's right, shall I cheer him up?!"`
`"When a person's heart is dark and closed off, interacting with them in a dark manner gains you nothing.`
` Your only option is to shine with a brightness stronger than the dark."`
`"Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiit, quit messing arooooooooouund...!!!"`
`"Kya-hhahaha!!`
` Battler-kuuun, over heeere!`
` A croissant baked by Ronove-sama would be wasted on the likes of yooou!`
` Why don't I enjoy it myself?"`
`Battler's stomach involuntarily growled at the fragrant smell of the croissant.`
`His breakfast plate was empty, but Battler hadn't eaten any of it.`
`...The biggest glutton of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory,`
` Beelzebub, had waited for Ronove to leave, and had then come to snatch the food away.`
`Battler had noticed, and they'd been really noisy ever since.`
`Even though Beelzebub only had to give it back immediately or else throw it into her own mouth right away,`
` she intentionally ran around in circles, making fun of Battler.`
`"Give my breakfast back, dammiiiit!!`
` If you give it back now, I'll let you off with a single flick to the forehead.`
` But just you try eating it!!"`
`"What, are you gonna eat me up insteeead?!`
` Kyaha!`
` If you think you can, just try it! I'll bet I'll be as sweet as honey pancakes.`
`'!s0`
`"Gotcha!!`
` Right now, I want to eat that bread even more than your thighs.`
` Be a good girl and give it heeeeeeeeere, `
`fugagigigigi...!!`
` So, you resist until the eeeeeeeeeend...!!"`
`"Ugugugugu!!`
` No way, no way, I won't give it to yooou!!`
` Even the croissant wants me to eat iiit!!!"`
`"Y-Yaay, yahooooooooo, g'moooooorning, Battleeeer!!`
` Are you still moping so early in the morniiing?!?!`
` It's the beginning of a new day, and a new game, so let's get our spirits uuuuuuuuuup!!"`
`...She flung the door open.`
`Like a marathon runner drawn on a certain caramel box, `
`with her hands held high and an idiotic cheeriness, `
`...Beato appeared.`
`For some reason, flags from around the world and confetti scattered about, perfectly completing this magnificent entrance.`
`...Battler and Beelzebub, who had been fighting over the croissant, completely forgot about their argument, speechless.`
`"K...Kyahahahaha!`
` Good morning, Beatrice-sama!`
` I'll just be on my way now!`
` Here, Battler-kun, say aaah!"`
`'!s0`
` Mmm mmm, *chomp*, ...*gulp*.`
` ...`
`...H-Hey, morning, Beato...`
` ...Glad to see you're cheery this morning."`
`............`
`Beato and Battler looked at each other.`
`...It seemed neither had a clue what was going on with the other.`
`"B-Battleer...?`
`'!s0`
`he looks totally fine, doesn't heeeeeeeeeeeee?!!`
` He isn't clutching his knees!`
` And he's answering!`
` Wait a sec, he was even in the middle of eating!!"`
`"Pukukukukuku!!`
` No, no, he was sleeping like a baby in his futon, clutching his knees.`
` I informed him that it was time to wake up, but he just wouldn't rise.`
` I tried to feed him, but it seems that a naughty cat wandered in and prevented that.`
` Pu ku ku, pu ku ku ku ku!"`
`'!s1`
`Gwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!!`
` You tricked meeeeeeeeeee...!!"`
`"Tch, you should talk.`
` Weren't you the one who played that massive trick last time?`
` I don't have a clue what's going on, but it looks like you got what you deserved."`
`"...By the way, Ronove, nice one."`
`"Pukukuku, thank you very much, Battler-sama."`
`The two men stuck up their thumbs as though they understood each other, chuckling together.`
`For a while, Beato was very energetic, trying to hide her embarrassment...`
`"Heh.`
` Don't take me so lightly.`
` Did you really think I'd still be hiding in a corner, holding my knees?"`
`"*cackle*`
` Then who was that person crying their eyes out in frustration last time?`
` You could've gathered your tears in a jar and called it face lotion."`
`"Sh-Shut up.`
` That was, um, just because I was a little surprised by your crappy act.`
` I might've looked a little lame, but don't think the same move'll work twice."`
`"Of course not.`
` And don't disappoint me by falling for the same move over and over again, okay?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Ihihi, yeah, just you watch.`
` I'll show you that I'm a guy who gets stronger every time he's beaten down."`
`"......But Beato."`
`"Yes, what?"`
`"Don't do it again."`
`"Hoh?`
` Why's that?`
` So you really are weak against a rear attack?"`
`"......You and I are enemies,`
` and we'll certainly never join forces...`
` I now understand that clearly.`
` ...So don't you ever try to trick me about that fact again."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` You say that, but knowing your weaknesses, I'll......"`
`Beato thought they were still joking around, ...but that tone had disappeared from Battler's expression some time ago.`
`Beato felt as though his eyes were like the surface of black tea that had cooled down...`
`"You hear me?`
` Don't do it again."`
`"......`
`...I don't get it.`
` I might do it again when you've forgotten, right...?"`
`"Don't do it again."`
`"......Nnn........."`
`Pierced by his strong and forceful gaze, Beato held her tongue.`
`Maybe she was certain that Battler would break that silence with laughter.`
`...However, Battler's serious expression didn't change in the slightest.`
`So to break that silence, Beato had no choice but to start laughing herself.`
`"*cackle*cackle* Hahhahahahahah, hahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` Very well.`
` You and I are worthy opponents.`
` No matter how friendly our relationship, we'll never be anything more than a pair of enemies.`
` If you have not mistaken this, that is enough for me."`
`"...That's right.`
` I almost forgot you were my enemy for a second there.`
` I won't embarrass myself like that again.`
` ...I won't fall for your rear attack again.`
` Never again...!"`
`"............`
`...Hmph!`
` Hahhahahyahhahha!!`
` It seems I'm not the only one who cannot wait for the fourth game.`
` I am pleased, Battler.`
` Come, take your seat."`
`"...Yep.`
` Just how I like it.`
` ...Clever little tricks won't work anymore."`
`"Stop acting so tough.`
` You remain in a state of surrender for the last mystery in the previous game, the mystery of Nanjo's murder...!"`
`"......My answer for that one's still on hold for now.`
` But that doesn't mean that I've lost heart.`
` I'll definitely break your 'red truth'...and show that I can deny witches...!"`
`"Hmph.`
` A commendable attitude.`
` You truly are a man like a phoenix.`
` Don't betray my expectations!`
` With that, let us raise the curtains on the fourth game.`
` But before that, `
`it seems we must welcome a new guest."`
`"A guest..."`
`"You remember as well, correct?`
` That mystery girl, who appeared at the very end of the last game without an invitation, ruining my fun."`
`"...That person......"`
`"She says she wants to join our game.`
` I sent her an official invitation, inviting her to join this match.`
` Ronove, summon our guest."`
`"...There's no need.`
` I'm already here."`
`The voice that answered Beato's call came from the darkness in a corner of the room.`
`When Battler turned around in surprise, he could now see that mystery girl there.`
`"My, my.`
` How rude.`
` All you had to do is greet us as soon as you arrived."`
`"I don't make a habit of talking to people before punching them.`
` After I punch is a different story though."`
`"Hoh, and what would you say?"`
`"#fefefe<Good night, `
`have a nice dream>#ffffff."`
`"*cackle*cackle* Hahhahhahahahahahaha!`
` How amusing, how truly amusing...!"`
`Beato cackled and clapped her hands.`
`But that was only Beato, and nothing rose to Battler's face except a bitter smile.`
`"...Whew.`
` You sure are a fighter."`
`"............"`
`Battler and the girl's eyes met, and he shrugged his shoulders as he spoke.`
`But the girl didn't answer, giving only a cold stare in return.`
`"...You helped me out at the end of the last game.`
` Thanks for that."`
`"I don't need your gratitude.`
` You were just slacking off.`
` I only told you to open your eyes."`
`"Kuhhyahhyahhya!`
` That's so true, stop slacking off, Battler, hyahhyahha!"`
`Beato tried to laugh as though sympathizing with her, but it didn't reach the girl's ears.`
`She did absolutely nothing except stare at Battler with ice-cold eyes.`
`"......Well, it looks like someone hates me."`
`"I'm just annoyed that you aren't taking this fight seriously."`
`"Are you saying I'm not serious about this...?"`
`"Don't tell me that travesty earlier was you being serious.`
` ...Don't take me for a fool.`
` How long do you intend to play along with the witch's farce like this?"`
`"...I'm fighting Beato in my own way.`
` And doing it seriously, of course."`
`"Seriously?`
` ......Don't make me laugh.`
` You keep on drinking tea and chatting with a witch for all eternity and call that fighting seriously?`
` Keep the jokes to just your hairdo."`
`"...Well, that's because I wasn't used to this witch's game in the beginning, and I've been through a lot of harsh stuff.`
` Still, I'm finally starting to see how to fight, and I'm getting the knack of doing it.`
` ...If the pathetic way I've been acting makes it look like I haven't been serious to you, you're just wrong."`
`"......Is that so?"`
`"Of course, I know I've gotta close in a lot more before I can grab Beato by the collar.`
` But no matter how long that distance may be, it's still finite.`
` And in each game that passes, I'm steadily closing that distance step by step!"`
`"No matter how long it takes, I'll close in on that witch, and I'll definitely checkmate her.`
` ...It might take a thousand years, to use her phrase.`
` ...But even so, I'll definitely win sooner or later.`
` Why?`
` Because I definitely won't accept losing.`
` I definitely won't stop moving forward, closing in on her!`
` In other words, there's just one thing I can say for sure."`
`'!s0`
` That's how it is."`
`"You really don't sound like you're in a hurry.`
` Are you even trying to win?`
` Even the finite can become endless if you treat it the wrong way.`
` By now, you've become an Achilles who couldn't even outstrip a turtle.`
` ......I get it. So this is why I'm needed.`
` At this rate, there's no way you could win against the Endless Witch even after a billion years."`
`"...Who are you?`
` It's not like you'll be struck by lightning if you just tell me your name."`
`"............"`
`At that point, the girl fell silent, gazing straight into Battler's eyes.`
`At first, Battler faltered under the firmness of that look, and his gaze wavered slightly, but then his eyes gradually began to be sucked into the pupils that were staring at him.`
`...Then, inside those eyes, he saw a light that he'd seen sometime before...`
`Battler was struck by how strongly they resembled the eyes of a girl who definitely couldn't be here, `
`...even though that was completely impossible.`
`"...I know it's stupid, `
`...but for some reason, it feels true to me.`
` But that can't be right.`
` ...That person's supposed to still be six years old.`
`'!s1`
`...Ange, could you......?"`
`".........`
`If I were to say 'That's right', ...would you believe me?"`
`"Nn......"`
`"I'll put it another way.`
` If I said 'I am your ally, so trust me', `
`would you believe it?`
` Would you unconditionally trust some unknown girl you're meeting for the first time just because she looks a little like someone you know?"`
`"...It's because you're such a softy that you got tricked so easily in the last game and cried so bitterly.`
` ...You said it yourself.`
` That kid is six, right?`
` Do I look like I'm six?`
` If I were to claim that I'm that kid despite that, would you just swallow that story?"`
`"...If you say it like that, `
`...there's no way I can argue back.`
` ...Sorry.`
` That's right, I am a softy.`
` And that should've been made clear to me after the last game.`
` ...Is that what you meant when you said I wasn't being serious?"`
`"Yes.`
` You may think you're fighting against a witch, but you're just getting along with her and playing.`
` ...You're just playing at fighting in a friendly game of chess."`
`"That may be a serious contest for you two,`
` but looking at it from far away, I only see you playing around and following the rules like you're good friends."`
`"......`
`...Ihihihi.`
` That's harsh."`
`"But as long as you're unable to win at this game, you won't be released from this place.`
` ...That's why I came.`
` I came to bring this game to its conclusion.`
` ...You claim that you're closing in on the witch, but you're just like a hamster running around in a wheel."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Oh, one of those? Those things that run around and around in place, night after night?"`
`"At a glance, you might think that running around in a wheel is endless.`
` ...The Endless Witch Beatrice.`
` It's just like you.`
` He thinks he's fighting, but he's actually just running around in a wheel while making a fool of himself."`
`"...This isn't a game.`
` This is nothing more than a cage to shut him up in...for all eternity."`
`"Hoh.`
` ...You liken my Endless to something like a wheel that a mouse plays in?`
` Interesting, interesting, *cackle*..."`
`"Something that's endless in a certain dimension can be less than endless in a higher one.`
` The fact that a Menger sponge has infinite surface area only matters in a world of less than three dimensions.`
` In the three-dimensional world of reality, it has zero mass.`
` Not only is it not endless, it doesn't even exist."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!`
` What an assertive woman.`
` It seems you are worthy of being called my enemy."`
`"......Who...are you?"`
`"I am your ally.`
` And an enemy of witches.`
` ......Of course, you don't have to believe it.`
` No one can prove that I really am your ally.`
` On the contrary, it's more desirable that you keep your guard up strongly enough to find me very suspicious."`
`"......That's right.`
` Last time ended up pretty bad.`
` I've got to be at least that careful.`
` ...I don't plan on getting tricked twice."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`Beato laughed in a truly pleased way, which was humiliating only to Battler.`
`"People don't just get tricked out of the blue.`
` That only happens when they fail to check things for themselves and leave it to other people.`
` ...Saying that you thought the light had turned green just because you saw other people start crossing doesn't count as an excuse for getting into an accident.`
` Get it...?"`
`"Yeah, ...I get it.`
` ...You're telling me not to swallow information given to me by others, but to think for myself.`
` ......In the past, I swallowed all the magic Beato showed me.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~I stopped thinking~ib~`
`.`
` So I was useless."`
`Battler grimaced as he remembered his many painful losses.`
`...The witch watched and laughed again, putting on a bold appearance.`
`"I'll offer you advice in a way that works to your advantage.`
` Of course, you shouldn't swallow everything I say.`
` Because no one can provide certain proof that I'm your ally."`
`In the last game, Virgilia, who I thought was an ally, was actually on the witch's side.`
`...Battler couldn't rid his head of that eerie smile worn by Virgilia, a person he'd once even thought of as trustworthy and reliable.`
`"So I don't need you to unconditionally trust me.`
` You might as well take my advice as nothing more than an opinion to be considered.`
` After all, ...the player who's fighting in a game against the witch`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~is you~ib~`
`"...That's right.`
` Saying I lost because I followed the moves of an outsider would be just too pathetic of an excuse."`
`"Oh yes!`
` My opponent is Battler.`
` You are nothing more than an outsider.`
` You should bear that in mind.`
` *cackle*!"`
`"No, I'm not an outsider.`
` With Beatrice and Ushiromiya Battler...`
`and I who gaze down from above, it's almost like a fight in the shape of a triangle.`
` At a glance, it might not look like a united front, but having a united front doesn't necessarily mean fighting together."`
`"Hoh.`
` What an odd thing to say."`
`"Just now, he described fighting with you as closing the distance.`
` But you can't measure distance with a single eye.`
` Only with two eyes are things visible in three dimensions, and only then can distance be judged.`
` ...And even when you have two fields of vision, it's pointless if they're in the same place.`
` You can pin down witches more accurately when they're far apart."`
`"...Shooting from different positions and different angles.`
` ...So, basically, it's crossfire.`
` Heheh, interesting."`
`"We're shooting...from different positions...and different angles.`
` ...So I won't get along with anybody.`
` That's how I'll keep my own position separate and catch the witch in a pincer attack."`
`"......Are you okay with this, Battleer?`
` This girl may actually be an ambush I set up, right?`
` She might just be saying something plausible to gain your trust, right...?"`
`"...Maybe.`
` She's been saying that over and over again herself.`
` ...So of course, I can't blindly accept her advice.`
` But as to whether she's worthy of trust or not, I can think for myself and make a decision.`
` As long as I don't stop thinking for myself, I won't be tricked by anyone again...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` What confidence, Ushiromiya Battleer!`
` After you've said so much, `
`it makes me want to trick you all over again, you see......?`
` I can't wait to see what kind of face you'll make when you realize you've been duped once more!`
` How pleasant, kuhhahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"......It looks like you know my name, but I don't know yours.`
` ...Tell me."`
`"............"`
`For a while, the girl remained silent, without changing her expression even once.`
`...She looked as though she couldn't decide whether to say her name or not...or possibly, as though she was deciding on the name she'd say on the spot.`
`"...Gretel."`
`"Ghetto?`
` You are?"`
`"That's my name, dumbass.`
` Call me Gretel."`
`"Then should I call myself Hansel?`
` Ihihihi, just kidding, I'm Ushiromiya Battler!`
` Call me Battler."`
`"......Nice to meet you.`
` ...I hate handshakes.`
` Don't take it personally."`
`"...Ah, really? Sorry.`
` After all, it isn't certain that you're my ally.`
` ...And you just told me to keep my guard up too."`
`Battler drew back his right hand, which he had stuck out.`
`His bitter smile disappeared...and was replaced with a strong resolve directed at this new fourth game.`
`"Battler,`
` ...think deeply about why you must win against this witch.`
` ...You can't stop with something abstract, like 'I'll beat her because I don't like it'.`
` ...Have a deep conviction that you'll definitely defeat the witch and escape from this world."`
`"......Because there is definitely...`
`...someone waiting for you to come back.`
` ...For that kid's sake as well, `
`........."`
`Maybe there was something she wanted to say.`
`Gretel clenched her fists in front of her chest and hung her head in silence, at a loss for words for a short while.`
`As though smashing through that silence, Beato spoke up in a forceful voice.`
`"Good, that should be enough of an introduction for Gretel or whoever!`
` Come, try to remember, what happened on October 4!`
` Kuhhihihihihihihi, let the curtain open on the fourth game!!"`
`At the same time, as though it had been blown by a sudden gust of wind, the clock that had been turned back to October 4, 1986...started to move.`
`While we remained in the witch's tea room, the blue-gray sea and the green Rokkenjima spread out beneath us, `
`...and we could see a boat heading there, its wake trailing behind it.`
`The sky was already cloudy, and it seemed that the barrier of the typhoon would soon shut the island away.`
`There was the boat docked in the harbor...`
`...and Gohda, helping to unload it.`
`Then, `
`...once all of its passengers had disembarked, `
`...the boat began to separate from the shoreline.`
`The relatives were gradually swallowed up by the island.`
`"Ahhahahaha!`
` Looks like you're as cheery as ever, Maria."`
`"Maria-chan, you'll trip if you aren't careful.`
` Look out...!"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Gonna faaall, faaall, siiink, siiink, *giggle*!"`
`...The long-missed cousins I had loved dashed across the beach,`
` ...getting swallowed by the forest path that led to the mansion, and disappeared.`
`And of course, Onii-chan could be seen among them too.`
`"...Daaamn it!!`
` Stop right there, Maria!!`
` You nimble little brat!"`
`"*giggle*! Uu-uu-uu-!`
` *giggle*giggle*!"`
`Maria onee-chan, whom I'd loved, started dashing, and Onii-chan chased after her.`
`They were swallowed up by the forest.`
`Following them, Father and Mother were also swallowed up.`
`The rest of the parents were swallowed up...`
`...They were swallowed up, leaving only me behind...`
`Dumbass...`
`How long are you gonna joke around and play with a witch in a place like this...?`
`Come back quickly, ...Onii-chan...!`
`Don't leave me all alone...!`
`And realize.`
`Realize how cruel and lonely the world I'm isolated in is...`
`"Good day to you."`
`"......G-Good day to you."`
`'Good day to you' is the standard greeting used here.`
`No matter how many years pass by, this style of greeting still feels very awkward...`
`Even though I'd responded to the greeting in order to stifle that awkward feeling, `
`the classmate who had spoken looked at me blankly.`
`"...Huh?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*"`
`"Huuuh, what's that?`
` It seems you're mistaken, *giggle*giggle*..."`
`Their choice of words and manner were certainly what you'd expect from a school for rich girls,`
` but the actual meaning was as innocent and cruel as you'd expect from kids of that age.`
`...It seems they found it funny that I'd mistakenly thought the greeting was directed at me.`
` No, it might be the opposite.`
`...Maybe they didn't know how to react after being suddenly greeted by a gloomy, quiet kid like me.`
`No, judging by the gazes of my classmates, who were looking this way over their shoulders and whispering to each other,`
` it looked as though some of them considered this refreshing morning ruined.`
`...I was...dark.`
` Because I was disliked.`
`So, trying not to get in the way of everyone's refreshing morning any more, I stooped lower and entered the classroom.`
`...Almost like I was cutting through the aisle in a movie theater while the movie was running.`
`This is an all-dorm school, Saint Lucia Academy.`
`It's not a school that anyone can get into by taking a test.`
`...It's a hidden rich girls' school, known of only by a select group of celebrities from various fields.`
`For lofty nobles who truly wish their daughters could be raised like saints,`
` this is probably the ideal school in which to protect them from the impurities of the common world.`
`...But at the same time, it was probably also convenient for nobles who wanted to confine daughters they didn't want out in public.`
`As well as an academy isolated from the impurities of the common world, it also held excellent potential as a prison school.`
`I was truly among the latter...and was confined in Saint Lucia Academy,`
` ...forced to live my life in dreariness.`
`Of course, there weren't that many students like me, and you couldn't tell us apart at a glance.`
`However, even if we never fessed up about it, you could usually figure out who we were by watching how we acted.`
`...After all, we were always hanging our heads, with an expression on our faces as though the whole world had abandoned us.`
`Anyway, every class had one or two kids like that, so even if they didn't speak up about it, you could guess who they were.`
`Therefore.`
`Even though I never confessed that I was one of those kids, at some point, everyone in my class knew about it...`
`Just like how the seriousness of an injury becomes a sign of status in a hospital room, how noble a birth one had became a sign of status here.`
`Those girls who couldn't be acknowledged in public were probably nothing more than filth to the others.`
`They must've thought that getting involved with such students would dirty them as well.`
`When a rumor sprang up about a particular student, `
`those fastidious girls would grow cold and distant, chasing that student out of all social groups.`
`Thanks to that, I led a quiet school life like this, all by myself...`
`Well, that's only if hearing people whisper behind my back, finding my things lost or broken all the time, and having everyone pretend like they didn't know anything...`
`can be called a quiet school life.`
`Even this early in the morning, I must look worn out.`
`...I can almost understand why my other classmates, who had a refreshing morning, looked at my face and wanted to click their tongues.`
`Consciously trying to do as I should and avoid tainting my classmates' morning, I quietly took my seat.`
`...Then, unusually, someone came to talk to me.`
` It was the class leader.`
`"Good day to you, Ushiromiya-san.`
` ...You seem to be in a bad mood this morning.`
` Were you able to get enough sleep?"`
`"......Is there some business you have with me?"`
`"You're the only one who has not submitted her questionnaire for the class presentation, Ushiromiya-san.`
` Did you forget that the deadline was yesterday?"`
`...I'm pretty sure I heard something about that last week.`
`But I'd thought that the questionnaire hadn't been passed out yet.`
`The details would be written there, so there shouldn't have been any need to remember them beforehand...`
`"...I wasn't given a questionnaire..."`
`"That can't be.`
` I believe the dormitory leader handed them out to everyone.`
` If you lost it, all you have to do is honestly say so."`
`"......I lost it.`
` I'll fill it in right now, so could you give me a sheet?"`
`Again.`
` ...Either someone lost my sheet, or they intentionally didn't tell me about it.`
`But I have no way of knowing who was behind that.`
`In the end, treating it as though it was my own carelessness would settle everything more quickly...`
`"Once you've filled it out, drop it in the questionnaire box in the student council room yourself.`
` Our class is the only one that didn't get everyone's in by yesterday."`
`As I hung my head at the class leader's scolding,`
` I could hear the giggles and whispers of people watching, coming from no direction in particular...`
`Ushiromiya-san did it again.`
`She's just so careless.`
`She doesn't deserve to be in this school.`
`She has no dignity, and no manners either.`
`...Sorry girls, but I've dealt with much worse when it comes to unfair personal attacks.`
`As I froze my heart and let those arrows of ridicule pass by, I quickly filled out the questionnaire...`
`When I learned that Father and Mother and Onii-chan...and all the rest of my family had died, `
`I was at the house of my Grandpa on my mother's side.`
`The only survivor of the accident was...Ushiromiya Eva.`
` ...Only Aunt Eva.`
`Even at the time, I hadn't really liked Aunt Eva.`
`At a glance, she would act kindly, `
`but even as young as I was, I could see that she was somehow making fun of Father and the rest, and I hadn't liked it.`
`So when it was decided that Aunt Eva would take care of me, I was pretty miserable.`
`Maybe it wouldn't have mattered if that gentle Uncle Hideyoshi and George onii-chan had been with me,`
` but I hated the thought of living all alone with Aunt Eva.`
`I'd frankly said that to Grandpa, hoping to live together in his house.`
`However, Aunt Eva had been very insistent that she should be the one to look after me.`
`She had no desire to remarry, so as her successor, I was essential if the Ushiromiya family was to continue.`
`Aunt Eva felt very strongly about the family.`
`She insisted that she take charge of me right away, so that she could give me an education and lifestyle fitting for a successor.`
`After that, it seems that confusing negotiations with lawyers took place.`
`...But in the end, I was forced to go live with Aunt Eva.`
`After doing that, Aunt Eva told me something.`
`You must bear all of the glory and history of the Ushiromiya family.`
`And in order to make you a fitting successor to bear that, the rest of your life will be dedicated to frantic studying.`
` Sacrifice the rest of your life for the Ushiromiya family.`
`...That's what she said.`
`At first, I thought she meant that literally.`
`But I quickly realized that wasn't the case.`
`Because even now, in Aunt Eva's eyes,`
` the one most fitting to succeed her was the late George onii-chan.`
`At our first meal together, I received strict instructions and questioning about table manners...`
`and was forced to listen to her abuse Mom and Dad as though they'd been neglectful in their discipline.`
`I also received the same strict instructions regarding manners at my first party,`
` and my clumsiness had been disparaged in front of everybody, forcing me to endure insults to Mom and Dad as well.`
`After that repeated over and over, I eventually began to understand.`
`Aunt Eva didn't really want to make me her successor.`
`She thought George onii-chan was the only one truly suited to be her successor,`
` ...and she couldn't forgive the fact that it was to be me instead.`
`So she insulted me in front of lots of people.`
` She humiliated me.`
`And she made it known exactly how I was inferior to George onii-chan to both acquaintances and strangers,`
` ...surely in place of a memorial service for her dead son...`
` ...Or rather, ...she must still be mourning his death.`
`...However, that wasn't something I could endure.`
`I couldn't possibly live together with Aunt Eva.`
`...I was kept like a pet, my life continually compared with her dead son's.`
`I understood that even when I was still in elementary school.`
`I tried to escape the Ushiromiya house and run off to the house of my Grandpa on my mother's side.`
`However, Aunt Eva had already foreseen that.`
`...No, thinking back on it, she might've lured me into escaping.`
`I was caught by the guards and brought back,`
` ......and for being a coward who had smeared the Ushiromiya family crest with mud and tried to throw it away,`
` ......in a way that makes my whole body shake and shiver just remembering it, `
`......I was punished.`
`How should I describe what Aunt Eva was like when she punished me?`
`In a frenzy?`
` Gleeful?`
`...I saw the anger and sadness of losing her beloved son, and well as the hatred and pain from me stealing that inheritance from the son who should've received it.`
` And the dark pleasure at being able to let those feelings out on me.`
`...I was hit with all those negative emotions at once.`
`Then, all of my free time and freedom to act was stolen, and I was put under surveillance around the clock.`
`I may have lived in a gorgeous mansion, dressed in expensive clothes,`
` ...but my heart and my dignity had been trampled upon, and I was the Ushiromiya family's slave, `
`...its cattle.`
`Compared to that lifestyle, the derisive laughter of my classmates here was calm and pleasant.`
` ...It caused my heart no trouble...`
`After burying almost all of the fields of the questionnaire with 'nothing in particular', I folded it and put it in my pocket.`
`...Because if I left it in my desk, it might 'disappear' again.`
`During lunch break, after dropping it off at the postbox in the student council room, `
`I finished lunch by myself, as usual, and headed behind the school building, where no one could be seen.`
`...Only my time by myself could protect me from the derisive laughter and gossip.`
`Since I was hated and didn't have a single friend, my time alone was the most kind to me.`
`After checking the surrounding bushes to see whether some malicious classmates were hiding and threatening my time of quiet, `
`I finally relaxed the tension from my entire body, knowing that I had gained some true peace.`
`Then, ...I let out a sigh.`
`...It faltered, heavy, as though it was the first time I had breathed out today.`
`My old favorite place behind the vegetable garden storehouse...`
`had been found out by my classmates, and I'd been teased, so this was my new lunchtime hideaway...`
`There was nowhere to sit behind the school building.`
`As I crouched near the wall in the shadow of the bushes, I opened my bag and took out a book with an elaborate, old-fashioned binding...`
`Just glancing at it, you'd probably think it was a religious book or something written in the Middle Ages.`
`But this wasn't a book.`
` It was a diary.`
`Of course, it wasn't my diary.`
`......There weren't any special things worth writing about in my daily life.`
`Every single day was just gray, ...cold and dry.`
`In those completely unchanging days, there aren't any changes worth writing down.`
`This was...the diary of Maria onee-chan, a girl I'd been very close to.`
`She'd been a bit strange and three years older than me, but Onee-chan was always a warm, wonderful cousin.`
`She would always grab me by the hand and let me join in on some fun game.`
`...I remembered that being able to see her was the most fun part of our family gatherings...`
`When I opened the diary, the characters, which were made fairly skillfully considering that this was an elementary schooler,`
` were packed close together, though they were written on every other line.`
`Was she just hopelessly obsessed with jotting everything down in her diary?`
` ...Probably not.`
`To her, writing her daily life down in a diary was probably like having a conversation with another part of herself.`
`So rather than an object on which the events of her day were written down,`
` Maria onee-chan's diary was written like a letter to another part of herself, telling of the events of that day.`
`I found this diary among her belongings after her death and secretly took it home.`
`At first, I'd felt that reading someone else's diary might be boorish...and satisfied myself with just keeping it by my side,`
` ...but I couldn't help flipping through the pages and reading through it bit by bit.`
`And by now, she had `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~become my only friend~ib~`
`.`
`I gently opened to the page with the bookmark.`
`"...Sorry to keep you waiting, Maria onee-chan.`
` ...Could you let me hear your story again...?"`
`At the same time, `
`...a very, very soft breeze blew, tickling the paper.`
`I thought the open diary might have sparkled faintly.`
`...The weather's good today.`
`Maria onee-chan loves the wonderful rays of sunlight.`
`So I'm sure she's in a good mood.`
`On the pages of the open diary...no, in the world of the diary, Maria onee-chan showed herself...`
`I'm pretty sure she was nine when she died.`
` ...So her form was already younger than me.`
`But I call her Onee-chan, so she affectionately calls me Ange.`
`"Uu-.`
` Ange, you were slow getting here today.`
` Was it packed at lunch...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` It's always packed.`
` Groups of friends set up camp in the seats, and they stay there even after they've finished eating.`
` It's pretty fatal if you get to the dining hall late.`
` ...I was on cleanup duty today."`
`"...Uu-!`
` I eat fast!`
` The faster you eat, the more you can play!`
` Uu-!"`
`Maybe she realized I was holding a grudge because that duty had been forced upon me and shortened my lunch break by a bit.`
`Maria onee-chan brightly changed the subject.`
`Grateful for that act of kindness, I responded by saying I was a slow eater.`
`Maria calmed me down, saying something about teaching me the trick to eating fast.`
`I read about it in her diary.`
` No, I heard it from Maria onee-chan.`
`She was ranked number 1 among the girls in the speed-eating ranking for her grade's newspaper.`
`She was apparently very proud of that, but a little disappointed that her mother, Aunt Rosa, hadn't praised her very much for it.`
`"Uu-!`
` Then, let's start our story for today.`
` How far did we get yesterday?`
` Uu-?"`
`"Umm...`
` This far.`
` Until you got Sakutaro as a present, Maria onee-chan.`
` ...You promised that you'd tell me about Sakutaro."`
`"Uu-!`
` Let's talk about Sakutaro!`
` You know, Sakutaro is a reeeally cute stuffed animal!`
` I'm sure you'd like him too, Ange!`
` Uu-!"`
`"Yeah.`
` Tell me that story.`
` ...The only time I can relax at school...is when I'm listening to your stories during lunch break."`
`"Uu-!`
` I'll tell you about it!`
` Sakutaro was really, umm, umm!"`
`When I looked at Maria onee-chan, who was always in a good mood, it made my heart feel warm as well.`
`As I listened to her tale, I began to get absorbed into her world...`
`"Happy Birthday, Maria.`
` Sorry I got back so late."`
`"Uu-!`
` Good job with your work, Mama!`
` I know you're busy, so even though you were late, I waited without crying.`
` I was good and waited, watching TV!"`
`"Yes, you're such a good girl, Maria.`
` As a present for waiting politely, you can order anything you want today.`
` Of course, only as much as you can eat, okay?"`
`"Uu-uu-!`
` Today, can I change my corn soup to onion gratin soup?!"`
`"Yes, that's fine."`
`"Uu-uu-!`
` It's 200 yen more expensive, but can I change it to prosciutto pizza?!"`
`"Yes, that's fine.`
` If you really can eat it.`
` ...But that's okay.`
` It's your birthday, after all.`
` There must be a reward for the good girl who waited so patiently."`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!`
` Then, then, can I have enchilada cheesecake for dessert?!`
` And then, and then, the chef's choice fruit salad and kids' french fries!`
` I want to drink melon soda too!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!`
` I'm a good girl, I'm a good girl!`
` Mama praised me, uu-uu-uu-♪"`
`"*giggle*`
` You're getting a little too excited.`
` If you don't quiet down a bit, you'll disturb the other customers."`
`When Rosa gently admonished her, Maria stuck her tongue out and eased up a little.`
` ...But it seemed that she was having a hard time repressing her excitement at being able to eat out with her mother after such a long time.`
`Today was Maria's birthday.`
`Rosa always tried to let Maria spend her birthdays at great restaurants.`
`When Maria had been in kindergarten, they sometimes invited other kids from the neighborhood over and had a party at home.`
`Rosa would make a wonderful cake and snacks and decorate the house herself, making it a huge celebration.`
`But when they moved and Maria no longer had friends in the neighborhood, Rosa had started splurging at expensive restaurants instead.`
`However, today, they were in a normal family restaurant.`
`It was also a little late in the day for a kid like Maria to eat there, even with a parent.`
`Actually, she had gotten reservations at a fantastic place that would surely have pleased Maria.`
` Of course, she had also prepared a wonderful cake with Maria's name written on it.`
`...But Rosa just hadn't been able to finish up her business...and had been forced to cancel.`
`Since that plan had been traded for a local family restaurant, Rosa felt a little indebted to Maria.`
`So she was prepared to spoil Maria a bit and let her have whatever she wanted tonight...`
`"...You never used to eat much, did you, Maria onee-chan?`
` Was it really all right to order that much?"`
`"Uu-.`
` I can't eat very much, but I like to have a lot lined up.`
` You know, like on a birthday table?`
` If it's colored all over with red and blue and green and yellow, it makes you really happy!"`
`"...You're right.`
` Having your birthday table be colorful can make you feel happy.`
` ...Birthdays at my place were no match for yours, Maria onee-chan, but the cakes we bought at the Fumiya store in front of the station were always gorgeous..."`
`Ange thought back to her own birthdays nostalgically.`
`Even though Dad was busy, he sometimes came home just to show up at my birthday party...and then went right back to his company.`
`At the time, I was sad, but now I understand how important I was to Dad.`
`Of course, Mom also took very good care of me.`
`In particular, her birthday presents were always in excellent taste,`
` and she sometimes arranged for them several months in advance.`
`Even though we always sent an invitation to Battler onii-chan, he didn't get along with Dad or something, so he kept not coming.`
`...So when he did come, I was really happy...`
`...The birthday parties when the whole four-person family gathered made for fun memories that I'll never forget...`
`"Uu-.`
` Ange's birthdays sound like a lot of fun too.`
` Battler and Uncle Rudolf are really lively.`
` Yay, yay, *giggle*.`
` Battler got covered in cola, ahahahaha."`
`Maria onee-chan peeked into my happy memory.`
`As I sat quietly, wearing the origami helmet that Dad had made for fun, I was a little embarrassed.`
`In my hand was a paper gun that Battler onii-chan had folded for me.`
`...And Mom was taking a commemorative photo.`
` It was the happiest moment of my life.`
`"But your birthday's no worse, Maria onee-chan.`
` And this is the day you get him, right?`
` Sakutaro."`
`"Uu-!`
` I was reeeally looking forward to it.`
` I got so excited, wondering when Mama would show me the wrapped present in the corner of her bag."`
`'Sakutaro' is the name of a stuffed animal that Maria was to receive that day.`
`For quite some time before then, Aunt Rosa had been making a stuffed animal to give Maria as a present today.`
`Hearing that it was a cute lion stuffed animal, `
`Maria onee-chan had already given it the name Sakutaro, even though she hadn't received it yet.`
`Today, she was looking forward to meeting Sakutaro even more than her own birthday.`
`Aunt Rosa ran a clothing design company.`
`It seemed to be some kind of brand name.`
` ...What was it, Anti-Rosa...?`
`It seems their catch phrase was 'I can't forgive the me of yesterday'.`
`...Unfortunately, I've never met someone who knew of that brand name.`
`Maybe it wasn't that famous.`
`So Aunt Rosa was pretty skilled with her hands.`
`I heard that she made some of the clothing she wore herself.`
`So making a stuffed animal had to be well within her capabilities.`
`"...A hand-made stuffed animal... That's pretty amazing.`
` By the way, why did you call it Sakutaro?"`
`"Uu-.`
` Actually wanted to call it 'Sakura'.`
` But it's a male lion, so she told me to give it a boy's name.`
` So I added a boy-like 'tarou' and called him 'Sakutarou'.`
` Eventually, the last 'u' disappeared!"`
`"Why 'Sakura'?"`
`"Uu-!`
` The main character in Card Master Sakura!"`
`It was the name of the main character in a TV anime that was popular at the time.`
`...The fact that she'd simply borrowed the name of a character she liked was...how should I say it...as innocent and cute as you'd expect from someone that age.`
`"Uu-!`
` Mama, Mama!`
` Still no Sakutaro?`
` I wanna let Sakutaro join in on my birthday too."`
`"Presents always come at the end, right?`
` If you open it now, it'll get dirty.`
` Hold on until the meal is over."`
`"Then I'll finish eating quickly!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!"`
`As soon as she proclaimed that, she started tearing into her meal.`
`Aunt Rosa got mad at her, saying that was rude.`
`It seemed that she'd expected this would happen right away.`
`I also thought that, given how straightforward Maria was, that was probably what she'd do,`
` so it was kind of pleasant when my expectations weren't betrayed.`
`In the end, Aunt Rosa lost to her daughter's eyes, which were sparkling with anticipation,`
` cleaned up the table, and took out the long-awaited wrapped present.`
`"Happy birthday, Maria.`
` ...I wasn't able to spend much time on it, so I couldn't make it very well..."`
`"Uu-!`
` If you made it, I'll be happy with anything!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!`
` Sakutaro-, Sakutaro-uu-uu-!"`
`Aunt Rosa spoke a bit humbly, but Maria onee-chan was happy even before opening the wrapping.`
`...I could really understand that feeling.`
`It's not a problem of quality.`
`Just the fact that it was a handmade present was more pleasing than anything.`
`"Can I open it?`
` Can I open it?!"`
`"I wanted to wait until we got back home before doing it, `
`...but...just for a bit, okay?`
` We'll just take a look and say hello, then put it back.`
` You can give him a proper greeting once we get home.`
` We're in public, so you can't fool around, okay?`
` Can you promise?"`
`"Uu-!`
` Promise, promise!`
` So can I open it?`
` Can I open iiit?`
` Mamaaa."`
`"Yes, yes, just for a bit, okay?"`
`"Yaaaaaaaaaaayy...☆"`
`Before Aunt Rosa finished talking, Maria started unwrapping it.`
`As soon as she did, ...yellow and orange peeked out.`
`What appeared was a slightly blank-looking lion stuffed animal, `
`with cute round eyes and a white chest.`
`It was about the size of a small pillow.`
`It looked pretty big next to someone as short as Maria onee-chan, but it probably wasn't that large.`
`From the perspective of someone who didn't know better, it would probably look like something cheap bought from a department store or something.`
`But to Maria onee-chan, it was her mother's handmade stuffed animal, the only one of its kind in the world and irreplaceable.`
`"Sakutaro, Sakutaro!!`
` *giggle*giggle*!!`
` Cute, cute, sooo cute...!`
` Thank you Mama, thank you Mama, thank you so much for making such a cute stuffed animal, even though you're so busy with work...!"`
`"...If you praise me that much, it's actually embarrassing.`
` I couldn't take much time, so I couldn't make anything that good.`
` I actually wanted to make one so big that you couldn't wrap your arms around it..."`
`"No, this is good!`
` With this size, we can always be together.`
` We can go out together.`
` Sakutaro, I'm your Onee-chaaan, uryu-☆"`
`"It really is an adorable stuffed animal.`
` So this kid is Sakutaro, your best friend."`
`"Uu-!`
` We can't go to school together, but me and my best friend are always, always together at home.`
` You know, Sakutaro is reeeally innocent and cute, and always nice to me.`
` He supports me when I'm feeling down, and plays a lot with me when I'm feeling good!"`
`"So I'm never lonely anymore.`
` Not lonely when Mama's busy with work and I'm all alone, not even when no one plays with me at school.`
` Isn't that right, Sakutaro, uryu-☆"`
`...At school, Maria onee-chan had lived in the same kind of environment as I did.`
`Compared to the other kids in her class, Maria onee-chan's tempo was always a little slow.`
`Her sensibilities and ways of viewing things were a little peculiar...and a little too idiosyncratic for her to blend in.`
`Her grades were low as well, and since she was talkative about everything related to the occult, her specialty, she was treated like a weirdo by everyone else in class.`
`If you were touched by Maria onee-chan, you'd be cursed... Stuff like that.`
`Apparently, everyone in her class acted like she was disgusting, made fun of her, and avoided her.`
`If a boy bumped into Maria onee-chan, `
`he'd start rubbing that part against the other boys, as if he'd gotten some scum on him.`
`They'd pick up her stuff like it was something filthy and chase the other boys around with it.`
`It seems the girls thought even speaking to her was unpleasant, `
`so they ignored her all the time, only giggling and sneering at her whenever she made a mistake.`
`"......It looks like bullying is the same in all eras.`
` Humans really don't advance at all, do they?`
` If only they'd just get wiped out."`
`"...I'm sad when I'm bullied, but I think it can't be helped."`
`"It can't be helped...?`
` Why not...?"`
`"After all, there's a rule that says every class has to have a single bullied kid."`
`"...That's a horrible rule.`
` I'd like to find the person who made it and hit them over the head with a brick.`
` Using the corner, of course."`
`"If I wasn't there, then there'd surely be a new bullied kid chosen in my place.`
` By staying strong, I can protect that kid."`
`As she said that, she smiled faintly.`
`......Maria onee-chan's way of thinking really is unusual.`
`According to her, from the beginning, a witch had resided in that place called a school.`
`No, she says that any place where a lot of people gather will have a witch residing there.`
`The witch tries to steal the students' souls through death by disease or accidents.`
`Apparently, she sometimes also corrupts those souls, leading them down that path of evil.`
`She says that an angel came, not content to let that continue.`
`"...And the angel...tried to finish off that witch.`
` The witch was powerful, and the fight took seven days and seven nights, but even then, it still wasn't over.`
` The tired-out witch asked for a truce and proposed this."`
`"I heard about that one before.`
` ...'Until now, I've made half of the students in the class become sick or injured.`
` But in exchange, I've protected the remaining half of the students from sickness and injury.`
` Therefore, if one member of the class becomes a sacrifice to me and is made into the 'bullied kid',`
` I shall protect all of the other students from sickness and injury', `
`......right?"`
`"Uu-.`
` The angel thought about it.`
` Compared to half the class meeting with misfortune, having only one person be unfortunate would be much better.`
` Then, the witch said that she'd protect the safety of all the other students, using her powerful magic."`
`"If there are 40 students in a class...`
`and the 20 victims are reduced to 1, then 19 people are saved.`
` ...It's actually a reasonable proposal."`
`I wonder if there's some theme behind this fairy tale.`
`If it's a creation by Maria onee-chan, a nine-year-old girl, that'd be pretty impressive.`
`"The angel decided to accept that proposal.`
` So, through that single sacrifice, 19 people were saved.`
` ...That's why my role's important.`
` The witch is protecting 19 people."`
`"...Because we become sacrifices?`
` ......Well, I don't remember ever being thanked by those 19 people."`
`...Maria onee-chan's idea was too compassionate.`
`Both of us are suffering from a very similar type of misfortune.`
` ...And yet, maybe a small difference in our way of thinking changes how peaceful our hearts are.`
`"So, you aren't sad, Maria onee-chan...?"`
`"Uu-.`
` I'm not sad at all.`
` After all, I'll be together with Sakutaro from now on.`
` Right,`
` Sakutaro?"`
`『Uryu-! If I can be with Maria, I'll be happy too!』`
`"Look, Sakutaro says he's happy too.`
` Uu-☆"`
`Maria onee-chan hugged the Sakutaro stuffed animal, playing both sides of the conversation herself.`
`I don't understand it.`
`...But that's exactly why I want to reach Maria onee-chan's level.`
`...So I was intensely drawn to her tale and her words.`
`"Ange, is it tough because you're all alone...?"`
`"...It is tough.`
` But...just the time I can be like this with you is different.`
` Because I'm not...all alone."`
`"Then, if Sakutaro also becomes your friend, it'll be even more fun.`
` Uu-!`
` Then starting today, Sakutaro is Ange's new friend!`
` Right, Sakutaro?"`
`『Uryu?`
` I am...Ange's friend...?`
` Uryu-, Ange-!』`
`Skillfully moving the stuffed animal like it was a puppet, Maria onee-chan expressed Sakutaro's emotions.`
`She was controlling him, but the charming way he waved his short hand and cocked his head to the side...`
`made it feel like he really was a new friend called Sakutaro.`
`Of course, looking at it with cold eyes,`
` it would only appear that Maria onee-chan was comforting me when I was grumpy.`
`...But a soul had definitely been sent into that stuffed animal.`
`The soul of Maria onee-chan's love.`
`So I acknowledged the existence of a being called Sakutaro inside that stuffed animal.`
`"Come on, say hi to Sakutaro too, Ange.`
` Come on, you say hi too, Sakutaro-☆"`
`『Uryu...?`
` Is Ange...`
`a scary person...?』`
`As Sakutaro timidly looked at me, `
`he unexpectedly met my gaze...and hid behind Maria onee-chan's back in surprise.`
`...Maria onee-chan really is good at playing with stuffed animals.`
`"It's okay, Sakutaro.`
` Ange isn't scary, she's a really nice girl.`
` Uu-☆"`
`『...H-Hello.`
` I'm Sakutarou...`
` ...Uryu...』`
`"*giggle*`
` ...Pleased to meet you, Sakutarou.`
` I'm Ange.`
` I'm glad to have a new friend."`
`I held out my hand as though asking for a handshake, `
`and Sakutaro's short hand was stuck out towards me, lightly touching my index finger.`
`After all, when a human and a stuffed animal shake hands, their sizes are too different.`
`This greeting by touching each other's fingers was our handshake.`
`"Uu-☆`
` Now, Ange and Sakutaro are already friends!`
` Two people are more fun than one, and three people are more fun than two.`
` Uu-!"`
`『Uryu-!』`
`Maria onee-chan had given the name 'Sakutarou' to the stuffed animal she was to receive on her birthday...`
`and had warmed and expanded his existence in her heart for a long, long time.`
`Therefore, even before she met him, his existence was sublimated into a personality.`
`Even at the first moment they met, they were already friends.`
`Of course, that wasn't anything extraordinary in Maria onee-chan's eyes, `
`although I don't think she'd personified and loved anything quite as much as Sakutarou.`
`She loved the things she owned very much, treating them just like friends or beloved pets.`
`Maybe Aunt Rosa hadn't let her keep a pet at some point in time,`
` so she felt like treasuring objects instead.`
`...And maybe she was so isolated that she'd been forced to find a friend nearby.`
`Because of all that, what happened that day wasn't anything extraordinary from her perspective.`
`Even so, Sakutarou...no, maybe I should call it 'Sakutaro' like Maria onee-chan.`
`There's no doubt that Sakutaro was a stuffed animal...`
`no, a friend...whom she loved more than anything...or anyone.`
`"Hello, ...it's Mama.`
` You're in a good mood. Is a friend over?"`
`"Uu-!`
` Playing with Sakutaro!`
` Sakutaro, knock it off, *giggle*giggle*!"`
`It was already about 9:00 at night.`
`Rosa had asked because this wasn't a good time to have a friend over, and she'd been just a little surprised, `
`but when she thought about it, Maria didn't have any friends who would come over to play, did she...?`
`Even so, to think that she'd have so much fun playing with that stuffed animal.`
`Rosa was very pleased that Maria had liked her birthday present so much.`
`"Sorry.`
` Mama just can't get her work finished tonight...`
` The next season's lineup is having a tough time.`
` It looks like we're finally starting to get orders bit by bit, and I want to somehow give it a bit more impact so we can answer to their expectations..."`
`"So, you're spending the night?`
` Sure, okay.`
` Do your best, Mama!"`
`"R-Really?`
` Thank you, Maria...`
` Thanks for being understanding about Mama's work..."`
`Rosa was surprised that Maria had accepted so easily that she wouldn't be able to come home from work.`
`To Rosa, having to tell Maria that she'd be coming home late or staying overnight was a huge burden.`
`Maria would start crying about how lonely she was on the other end of the phone, and it took a lot of time and effort to calm her down.`
`To think that Maria would accept it in such high spirits...`
`Is this also thanks to Sakutarou?`
`...Rosa was once again pleased that she'd given her daughter such a good present.`
`"I'll make sure I come back this time tomorrow.`
` Let's eat dinner together then.`
` You haven't eaten dinner yet, have you Maria?`
` Buy a bento at the convenience store and eat it.`
` No sweets, and no soda.`
` I'll check the receipt and the change, understand?"`
`"Uu-!`
` Shopping with Sakutaro, shopping with Sakutaro...!"`
`"H-Hey!`
` Not Sakutaro, have him watch over the house!"`
`From Maria's manner of speech, Rosa got the feeling that Maria might've gone shopping with that stuffed animal without her knowing about it.`
`Rosa's forehead creased, and after sourly saying that Maria definitely mustn't do that, she hung up.`
`"Uu-...`
` Mama said I mustn't go shopping with Sakutaro..."`
`『Uryu-...`
` Can't go shopping with Maria...`
` Staying home alone...will be lonely...』`
`"Why did Mama say not to go shopping with Sakutaro...?`
` Uu-..."`
`『Uryu...`
` ...I'm sure that if Maria was seen with me, it would be embarrassing...』`
`"...Embarrassing?`
` Why?"`
`『Mama says not to take me outside a lot.`
` And she usually says Maria can't do it because she's too old...』`
`"Uu-?`
` But I'm not embarrassed at all to be with Sakutaro, right?"`
`『I'm a lion, ...but I'm a stuffed animal.』`
`"You're a lion and a stuffed animal, but you're my friend.`
` So let's go out together☆`
` Just when Mama isn't around, as a secret.`
` Uu-?`
` You aren't saying that you're embarrassed, are you?"`
`『I'm not embarrassed, but...`
`...uryu, ...the people outside are a little scary...』`
`"Is that it?!`
` Then, I'll make it so that you can go outside without being scared!`
` Leave it to me, I've got something that's really useful...!"`
`Maria started fishing around her messy room.`
`Rosa often told her to clean it up, but Maria apparently didn't like doing it.`
`However, Maria herself knew more or less where everything was.`
`So much so that if it were to be cleaned up, she would have trouble finding where anything was.`
`"Here it is!`
` Hey, look, Sakutaro.`
` A knapsaaack!"`
`Maria proudly held it up high.`
`Sakutaro looked at the knapsack, which was gaping open, squirming as though saying 'Are you serious...?'`
`『Uryu, ...Maria, you aren't saying...』`
`"Uu-!`
` This way, we can go shopping together, and Sakutaro won't be scared!"`
`Maria held Sakutaro up and started stuffing him into the knapsack.`
`At first, she tried to stick him in head-first, but then he'd be upside-down and suffocate.`
`So she pulled him out and tried pushing him in again, feet-first.`
`『Uryu-...!`
` Tiiight, craaamped, daaark.`
` Uryu-!`
` Urk.』`
`"Look, it's all right.`
` If you stick your head out, it isn't cramped, it isn't dark, and it isn't scary.`
` And it's a good view.`
` Uu-!"`
`『Uryu, you're right.`
` ...Is it okay for me to go shopping with Maria like this...?』`
`"Yeah, it'll be fine!`
` What should we get for dinner tonight?!`
` Come on, let's go out, Sakutaro!`
` Uu-!"`
`"*giggle*`
` Looks like you're having fun, Maria onee-chan."`
`"Yeah, it's a lot of fun.`
` Even things that would be lonely and boring alone all become fun with Sakutaro.`
` Any Human friend would have to go home when it gets late."`
`"But Sakutaro doesn't go home, so we can be together all the time.`
` He'll watch TV with me,`
` be together even in the futon,`
` and even hold my hand on scary nights when there's thunder.`
` He'll chase away the monsters in the closet and under the bed.`
` Sakutaro is reliable!"`
`『Uryu.`
` Since I'm a lion, I'll show my courage and chase away any monsters that scare Maria.`
` Uryu-, rooar.』`
`They were so close that it made me a little envious.`
`I'm supposedly older now than Maria onee-chan was then.`
`But Maria onee-chan really is my onee-chan, and I still haven't reached her level.`
`...If only I had a friend close by like Sakutaro.`
`"Sakutaro and I are your close friends, right?`
` We're aaalways by your side.`
` It's just that your magic is weak, so you can't perceive us unless you open my diary like this."`
`"...Perceive?`
` You know some pretty difficult words, Maria onee-chan."`
`According to her, this world is full of magic and spirits.`
`And they're as natural and nearby as a light breeze.`
`"You don't normally notice or see the wind,`
` but when incense smoke or something draws trails, you can see it, right?"`
`"...Right.`
` And even if you can't see it, it's always nearby."`
`"That's it.`
` We're always really close by to you, Ange.`
` Gods and spirits and guardian spirits...are always right next to us.`
` But if you aren't conscious of them, you can't feel their existence.`
` Like wind that can't be seen with the eyes.`
` But they certainly are near us, and if they draw trails in the smoke called magic, anyone can see them."`
`I thought I'd only be able to meet Maria onee-chan while this diary was open.`
`But from what she says, she's always with me, and I can meet her at any time if I truly desire to.`
`"Along with a record of my life, I left a Fragment of my own soul in my diary.`
` So the power of my magic resides in this diary.`
` But it's very faint, so only you can feel it."`
`"...Only I...can tell it's there?"`
`"Yes.`
` After all, the power of a witch resides in you, just like me!`
` If you study hard, you too will definitely become a great witch in the future."`
`"......A witch.`
` I wonder if that'd be fun."`
`"Uu-!`
` It is fun.`
` If you do that, you'll be able to know that Sakutaro and I are always by your side, even without opening the diary.`
` If you do that, every day will become fun!`
` If you do that, I'll introduce you to many other friends.`
` If you do that, every day will get busy and very lively."`
`"That might be fun.`
` ...I do have the grimoire you left behind, Maria onee-chan.`
` I'll try reading it seriously sometime soon.`
` ...If I do that, I won't be all alone anymore, `
`right?"`
`"Uu-!" 『Uryu-!』`
`Maria onee-chan and Sakutaro said that at the same time, happy that I had developed an interest in the world of witches.`
`With her knapsack on her back and half of Sakutaro's face peeking out of it,`
` she triumphantly walked through the shopping district late at night.`
`Well, it was that time of day, after all.`
` Everyone in the shopping district was either a shop owner lowering the shutters on their shops, or an employee rushing, or else staggering, on their way home.`
`Amidst all that, Maria, who was in a good mood like someone on a hike, probably looked quite merry.`
`Every once in a while, passing employees would glance at her back with the eyes of someone seeing something out of place.`
`Office ladies giggled at the cute stuffed animal poking its head out of the knapsack.`
`The supermarket had been closed for a while by this time.`
`However, convenience stores, which had been growing in popularity lately, stayed open until midnight.`
`It was very convenient for Maria, whose mother's return was often late.`
`Maria lowered the knapsack from her back and, carrying it like a child in her arms, she headed over to the sweet buns corner.`
`She pointed to a sweet bun she had eaten before, explaining to Sakutaro that this one was delicious, and that one was pretty good too.`
` Sakutaro seemed to be enjoying it a lot.`
`"I'm gonna have the three-colored one!`
` With just this one, you can eat bean jam and cream and strawberry jam!`
` But there's sometimes greenish-brown bean jam or white bean jam.`
` There should be one kind of bean jam."`
`『Uryu-!`
` Looks like having different things inside makes them interesting.`
` Uryu-!』`
`"Next, I'll have a fruit yogurt!`
` There's fruit in it, but it isn't a sweet, right?`
` Yeah, I'm sure Mama will be fine with it.`
` Do you want one too, Sakutaro?"`
`『Uryu?`
` Is that really okay...?`
` What about the money?』`
`"Uu-, no problem!`
` Look, it's #fefefeShotoku Taishi-#ffffff, uu-!`
` So I can buy you whatever you want too, Sakutaro.`
` Let's eat together!`
` Would you like some yogurt too, Sakutaro?"`
`When Maria made to grab another one of the same fruit yogurt, Sakutaro bent his head slightly, worried.`
`『Uryu...`
` But...I can't eat a big one, so a small one will be fine.』`
`"Uu-.`
` Then how about a small yogurt?`
` It's 30 yen.`
` That's cheap."`
`『Uryu!`
` That's good enough for me.`
` Yogurt with Maria!』`
`"Yogurt with Sakutaro!`
` Uu-!"`
`Maria put the three-colored bread and the two yogurts into a shopping basket and brought them to the register.`
`The man running the register had been in charge of the tobacco shop that had been here until last year.`
`"I seem to be seeing you a lot at this time of day, little lady.`
` You're a good girl, but maybe you'd better come with your mother if you're going to go shopping at this time in the future, okay?"`
`"Mama said it's okay, so it's fine!`
` Mama always comes home late because of her work, but we aren't lonely.`
` Right, Sakutaro?"`
`『Uryu-!』`
`"Really? That sounds tough.`
` Here, I'll give you some free soda."`
`The man working at the store took a can of leftover soda or something from behind the register and packed it into the bag with everything else.`
`"Thank you mister!`
` Uu-!`
` Isn't that great, Sakutaro?!"`
` 『Uryu-!』`
`Since she had been told not to buy soda, she couldn't take it back home.`
`So she decided to drink it on her way back and not bring the empty can back home.`
`With the vinyl bag with the sweet bun in it around her elbow,`
` holding the knapsack with Sakutaro in it with that same arm and drinking her soda, the two of them walked home...`
`"...Uu-.`
` Yuzukoshou soda isn't really good...`
` You wanna try too, Sakutaro...?"`
`『Uryu?`
` ......Uryuuryuuryu, uryu-!!`
` Gaah.`
` ...Uryuuuu, you're mean, Maria...`
` Nasssty...』`
`"It sure is, uu-uu-."`
`Of course, it's not like she could actually make a stuffed animal drink soda.`
`She just put the can to Sakutaro's mouth and pretended to tilt it.`
`But it was fun for Maria to share the taste of this weird drink that she had gotten for free with Sakutaro...`
`There was a huge moon in the sky.`
`At times, that moon had been clouded by tears when she'd been unmanageable during Rosa's overnight stays...`
`and when she'd been scolded by her mother.`
`But this moon was very warm, and it seemed to watch over the two of them as they enjoyed their trip home by themselves...`
`Maria and Sakutaro.`
` ...Ange watched the two of them go from behind.`
`"............"`
`She looked so...warm from behind.`
`After looking at the backs of Maria onee-chan and Sakutaro together,`
` it became very hard to remember all of those long nights when she'd cried because her mother hadn't come home...`
`...I couldn't say it to Maria onee-chan,`
` ...but if I'd been in the same position, I may have given a stuffed animal the name Sakutarou, `
`...but it wouldn't have been anything more or less than a stuffed animal.`
`Anyone can make a relationship that only distracts you from your loneliness.`
`But Maria onee-chan was different.`
`Sakutaro isn't a stuffed animal or a toy.`
`...He was a real friend, and far from just distracting Maria from her loneliness,`
` he changed the nights without her mother into a fun time where they could play all by themselves...`
`Was it because Sakutarou was a special stuffed animal?`
`Because her mother had made it herself?`
`Because it was very, very cute?`
`...Probably not.`
`If there's a secret here, it doesn't lie within Sakutarou.`
`...I think it probably lies within Maria onee-chan.`
`"......This is the power of magic you were talking about, Maria onee-chan...?"`
`"Uu-.`
` Knowing magic means that you notice a lot of friends right beside you that you didn't notice before.`
` It's as fun as having a bunch of new toy shops pop up all over the neighborhood!"`
`...If even I, locked up in an academy without a single friend,`
` ...had power like Maria onee-chan, I wonder if I could make my days just a bit richer.`
`I wonder if I'll be able to honestly shed tears on nights I feel like crying, to smile on gray nights.`
`"Yes.`
` You can.`
` You can do it.`
` After all, you also have what it takes to become a witch."`
`"......What it takes...to become a witch."`
`"I have what it takes to become a witch too.`
` So I've still got a lot more studying and training to do.`
` I'll definitely become a wonderful witch, flying in the sky on a broom, drawing rainbows with my cane, making candy fall from the sky.`
` I can definitely do it.`
` Then, I'll show you too.`
` It'll definitely be like a scene from a wonderful dream."`
`Maria onee-chan said that, making an absolute promise with her smile.`
`...There's no way I can become a witch.`
`But if Maria onee-chan says that, it makes me feel that maybe, I really can become a witch.`
`Because, in reality, ...on that desolate night, when no flower of a smile could possibly have bloomed, her magic surely gave birth to a smile.`
`"...I wonder if...`
`...I can become a witch."`
`"You can.`
` ...You're a bit older, so your soul is bound a bit more by gravity.`
` That might make training tougher than it is for me.`
` But you definitely can.`
` After all, you're already touching a small piece of magic."`
`"I am?`
` ...Magic...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Come on, look. In a world where I don't exist, you summoned me, and you're talking with me."`
`"......This is...magic...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` You've expanded the Fragment of my soul that I left in my diary, and you're reviving me right now.`
` I also said it a short while ago, right?`
` Since you managed to reunite with me and have a conversation, since you're able to smile every once in a while, you must have some magical talent, Ange.`
` Your Maria onee-chan guarantees it.`
` Uu-!"`
`"...You said it a second ago, Onee-chan.`
` I thought I could only meet you while the diary was open, but you're really nearby all the time, right?`
` ...If I had more of the power of magic, would I be able to see you...?`
` And, just like now, ...would I be able to talk with you, Onee-chan...?`
` At any time...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` We can talk at any time.`
` I'm there by your side to say good morning, and even during class.`
` Let's talk together during dull classes to distract you from your boredom.`
` I'll also be there to talk to you during meals, so let's always be together like this during lunch break."`
`"We're with you after school too, and of course, I'm always by your side even after you return to the dormitory.`
` ...It's just that you don't`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~ 'see' me except when the diary is opened~ib~."`
`'!s1`
`...Maria onee-chan, `
`...you'll be by my side, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` I'll be there.`
` So if you try to 'see' me and try to talk to me, I'll definitely be able to answer.`
` ...If you 'look' strongly and try to talk, that is."`
`"......I'll...`
`...give it a try."`
`"It isn't easy, okay?`
` It isn't going to go well all of a sudden, got it?"`
`"......I understand.`
` I'm sure it won't be easy.`
` ...But I...`
`...want to be like you, Maria onee-chan......"`
`"Uu-.`
` I understand.`
` ......Then, look at me well.`
` Look closely."`
`"...Okay."`
`"Slowly open and close your eyes.`
` ...You can't shut them for a long time all of a sudden.`
` After burning my form into your eyes, try to make it blend into the inside of your eyelids..."`
`"......Yeah, `
`...I'm doing it."`
`"Once you can visualize me even when your eyes are closed,`
` ......without changing anything, slowly and softly close your eyes again.`
` ......How is it?`
` Can you still 'see' me?"`
`"...Y-Yes.`
` ...I think...I can probably see you..."`
`"Then try opening your eyes for a second.`
` ......Now for the real thing.`
` Calm your heart, and close the diary.`
` ...At that time, my form may disappear for a second.`
` But calm your heart, and don't get anxious.`
` ...And then, try to make the me that's blended into the inside of your eyelids blend back into your eyes.`
` ...Slowly visualize me in the empty air.`
` ...In the empty air, ...'see' me."`
`".........`
`...Yeah, I'm okay.`
`'!s1`
`...I'll close...`
`...the diary."`
`"Uu-."`
`Slowly, `
`...I closed it.`
`When I did so, ...a gray reality filled with dull air unfolded.`
`Of course, Maria onee-chan's form disappeared.`
`...Give it all you've got, have courage.`
` ...Take the first step into the world of witches.`
`I felt like Maria onee-chan was cheering me on inside my heart.`
`She's cheering me on?`
` Really?`
`Or do I just think that she is...?`
`No, that's wrong.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`It's because I think this that ~ib~I cannot 'see' her~ib~`
`Maria onee-chan is always by my side.`
`And even now, she's definitely there, cheering me on to do my best...`
`That...reached my ears.`
`So I mustn't ignore it like it's my imagination or the voice of my own heart...`
`...I believe...`
`that Maria onee-chan is there.`
`I mustn't doubt.`
` ...I believe.`
`Onee-chan said she'd always be by my side.`
` I must not doubt that...`
`But looking at that empty space, by the empty back wall of the school building,`
` amidst those almost heartlessly boring rays of sunlight, calling out her name was unexpectedly difficult...`
`The chains of common sense that had clung to me until today sneered at me, telling me that calling out to the empty air was ridiculous...`
`It was almost like being told to take a step forward off the roof of a skyscraper overlooking a sea of lights.`
`...It's Maria onee-chan saying it.`
`...It's all right, she's saying that I'm someone who can do it.`
`Stop thinking that you might fall, or that it'd be foolish to take a step off a roof,`
` ...and free yourself from those chains of common sense.........`
`".........Whew......`
`......haaah, ......`
`............okay..."`
`I steadied my breathing.`
`I concentrated my mind.`
`Make the vivid form of Maria onee-chan in the empty space before you...rise to the surface.`
`......Understand magic, `
`...and 'see' Maria onee-chan...`
`"......Maria...onee-chan......!"`
`'!s1`
` Is someone there?!"`
`At that time, I was answered by a rustle in the bushes and a wild cry, and I came to my senses.`
`It looked like I wasn't the only one behind the school building.`
`No, since I'd been so immersed in the world of the diary, I hadn't noticed someone coming.`
`I recognized a group of three beyond the bushes.`
` ...They were kids from my class.`
`From their appearance, it felt as though they'd come behind the school building to gossip about someone or talk in secret.`
`I hurried out of that place.`
`Because if it became known that I'd been alone in a place like this, mumbling to myself, it'd become a pain again...`
`"...She said it, right? She said it, right?`
` She said Maria onee-chan or something, right?!"`
`"Isn't that creepy? She isn't seeing spirits or something, is she?"`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!`
`I could hear the shrill, loud laughter from behind.`
`Irritated and feeling that Maria onee-chan had been made fun of, `
`I left that place at a quick pace, and then a jog once I turned the corner.`
`...And I might've made it to Onee-chan's world with just a little more time...`
`It was frustrating, aggravating...`
` Why does everyone get in my way...?`
`I haven't gotten in anyone else's way, not even once...!`
`I ran and ran, but it still felt as though I could hear their shrill laughter...`
`"Rumor has it, Ange-chan,`
` that you jumped off the top of a skyscraper?"`
`"The groupies were getting annoying, so I thought I'd give them the slip."`
`Ange and an old gentleman wearing an expensive suit were alone in a massive, modern conference room.`
`All of the newest machines for presentations were installed there,`
` but they didn't upset its refined and composed atmosphere,`
` and that alone was enough to make the business-like theme of the room abundantly clear.`
`However, that didn't matter at all to Ange.`
`She carelessly sat on a high-class chair that executives making a salary of several ten million yen probably sat in, looking aloof from the world.`
`"It's because I knew they were remodeling on a lower floor and had a safety net out."`
`Ange talked about it like it was no big deal, but in reality, it had been a 'miracle' among miracles.`
`To think that she'd shot through several layers of safety netting for the remodeling project, `
`been caught in a multi-colored banner adorning the atrium and slipped off,`
` ...only to be softly caught by a final banner, land on the ground without a scratch,`
` and then briskly leave that place...`
` It put Hong Kong movies to shame.`
`"Whether you knew there was a net or not, this is a 200-meter tall super-skyscraper we're talking about, right?`
` If things hadn't gone as you planned, there'd be a mess to deal with now."`
`"...I figured that if I died, then I'd be dead and that would be that, more or less.`
` Well, still, I was testing my luck a bit.`
` Call it youthful zeal."`
`As though saying that she'd had enough of that topic, Ange shrugged coldly.`
`Seeing that, the old gentleman, who was looking at the world below through a crack in the blinds, cackled.`
`"So, you were testing your luck, is that it...?`
` My, my, you truly are Kinzo-san's grandchild.`
` The nerve to trust your life to chance.`
` ...The Chairman was also a woman who could stake her life on a bet like it was nothing, so maybe this really is the Ushiromiya blood at work.`
` ...You really will make it big in the future.`
` Please, let me be blunt.`
` Why not give up this running away from home act and return to the Sumadera family?"`
`"I heard that Mom had a bad relationship with her family.`
` I don't want to go to the house of people I first met at a funeral."`
`The Sumaderas are Mom's family.`
`They're an old family from Kyoto, and compared to Mom's frank attitude, unbelievably strict.`
`The only Sumadera I'd been on good terms with was Grandpa, who was living apart from his family under the guise of retirement.`
`Mom kept in touch with him too,`
` but she avoided the rest of the family completely, almost hostilely so.`
`So when I went out to play with the Sumadera family, it was always Grandpa's house I visited.`
`When I was young, I didn't really understand it,`
` but I hear that Grandpa was in an extremely weak position, as a man who'd moved into his wife's family register, and his relationship with Grandma was also bad.`
`...You might even say that Grandma hated him and confined him to the house.`
`It isn't hard to imagine that, because she had a soft spot for Grandpa alone,`
` Mom was also hated by the Sumaderas.`
`Since I was her daughter, they probably hated me quite a bit too.`
`And yet, they appeared for the first time at Mom's funeral, `
`shamelessly going on about how big I'd gotten, like they could actually act like family after all this time...`
`When Aunt Eva died, I would inherit all the wealth of the Ushiromiya family.`
`If that wasn't what they were after, there's no way they would've been able to say such disgusting words.`
`"...Well, it's not as though I can't understand your desire for self-abandonment, now that you're all alone."`
`"This isn't self-abandonment.`
` I'm just taking a carefree stroll now that that annoying Aunt Eva has finally kicked the bucket.`
` ...Everyone else is just making too big a deal out of it."`
`Of course, everyone's after the vast Ushiromiya wealth I bear.`
`They must think that becoming my guardian means they'll be able to do as they please with that wealth.`
`Just how many people have tried to get close to me, acting like they want to be a substitute parent?`
`"If you ever find that you're hurting, please talk with me if it will help, okay?`
` After all, I think of you as my own grandchild, Ange-chan."`
`"............Haah.`
` ...I'll say <no, thank you> for now.`
` ...More importantly, let's return to what we were talking about."`
`"Ange-chan,`
` no matter how many times you ask, I am hiding nothing.`
` The Chairman was the only survivor on Rokkenjima that day.`
` And she passed away without saying anything.`
` I myself know nothing.`
` Everything is wrapped in darkness, you see."`
`This old gentleman was one of those leaders who had been entrusted with the business group Eva had built up after she passed away.`
`The one he called Chairman was the former Chairman, Ushiromiya Eva.`
`His company once had friendly ties with Hideyoshi's business,`
` and he'd had a close relationship with both Hideyoshi and Eva.`
`For that reason, when Eva lost Hideyoshi, he became the only person to whom Eva might have let her true intentions slip.`
`Whenever Eva's heart was torn by the loss of her family, whenever she took it out on Ange, `
`he had acted as a buffer between the two, so although Ange didn't trust him, she found him a very easy person to question...`
`"That crime was...`
`no, that accident.`
` If I call it a crime, I'll get in trouble.`
` ...I had the same questions about it as the public and the talk shows."`
`"...At the time of the accident, why was Aunt Eva in a place 2 kilometers away from the mansion, all alone?`
` And on the night of a storm."`
`"Back then, Kinzo-san was unsure as to whom he should select to be his successor.`
` ...Officially, he'd decided on his son, Krauss-san, but he didn't have much trust in that man."`
`"...So, to fairly determine a successor from among the four siblings, he made this game-like test called the riddle of the epitaph...?"`
`"Ostensibly, yes.`
` ...Kinzo-san probably planned to make Eva-san the Successor from the beginning.`
` He wanted to withdraw his own rule that the eldest son be the Successor, and instead of Krauss-san, leave the family to the extremely diligent and brilliant Eva-san."`
`"...The new rule about giving the inheritance to the one who solved the epitaph...`
`was probably nothing more than a farce to snatch the position of Successor away from Krauss-san."`
`"What do you mean...by farce?"`
`"There was no need for anyone to solve that epitaph.`
` Once it had been displayed for an appropriate amount of time, Kinzo-san could just call Eva-san, whom he truly wanted to succeed him, `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~and give her the answer~ib~`
`.`
` In other words, that itself would provide proof of her succession to the Headship."`
`".........This isn't something they've brought up on the talk shows, is it?"`
`"Well, once you bring up the succession of the Headship, conspiracy theories tend to rise to the surface.`
` I'm no fool myself.`
` I won't go out of my way to say things that could invite misunderstandings, you see?"`
`This was his theory.`
`At that time, the Ushiromiya Family Head, Kinzo, whose remaining life was announced to be short, was troubled by the problem of who was to succeed him.`
`Normally, the Successor would be fixed as the oldest son, Krauss, whom Kinzo had chosen himself.`
`...But in his later years, Kinzo began to think that Eva would make a more fitting Family Head.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`However, Kinzo, who was stubborn even against himself, was stymied by the title of Successor that he'd already given to Krauss,`
` and he'd searched for an ~ib~official stance~ib~ by which he could skip over Krauss and select Eva as his successor.`
`That official stance was the riddle of the epitaph.`
`The primary successor was still Krauss,`
` but there was a new rule, saying that if someone appeared who could solve the riddle, they would be chosen as the Successor to the Headship.`
`Then, on what would probably be his final family conference, Kinzo told Eva the answer to that riddle himself.`
`...In short, it was the same as proclaiming that Eva herself was the Successor.`
`"On that day, Eva-san was summoned by Kinzo-san, who revealed the answer to her.`
` And, so that she could succeed the Headship, he called Eva-san to the hidden mansion Kuwadorian, which only the Head knew about."`
`"......And because Aunt Eva arrived at the hidden mansion one step ahead, she escaped harm in that accident, you say?`
` Maybe Aunt Eva just killed everyone and made it look like an accident, so she could steal all of the wealth for herself, `
`and maybe that's why only she escaped unharmed."`
`"Well, that's what the papers are shouting about.`
` However, I believe Eva-san.`
` ...I'd say there are several points that justify trusting her."`
`"For example...?"`
`"That ring of the Ushiromiya Family Head, which is on your finger now, Ange-chan.`
` That ring is the only one of its kind in the world, which Kinzo-san had made specially.`
` And the artisan who made it acknowledges that the object on your finger is, without a doubt, that ring."`
`The Ushiromiya Family...Head's Ring.`
`That ring, with the heft of gold and the one-winged seal on it,`
` had a diamond arranged on a pedestal, and felt both sturdy and reminiscent of the dark hobbies of the rich.`
`Kinzo had worn that on his finger without removing it even for a moment.`
`This man was saying that the fact Eva had it proved that Kinzo had acknowledged her as the Successor.`
`"After all, Eva-san certainly did have that ring.`
` And, if you take into consideration that Eva-san actually was talented, and that Krauss-san had made a fool of himself several times on the business scene, `
`I cannot imagine that Eva-san's story is completely made up."`
`"......Although there's the possibility that she murdered Grandfather in order to steal that ring.`
` Then Aunt Eva, using some kind of trick, massacred everyone and made it look like an accident."`
`"Ah, yes.`
` It seems the papers were saying something about her massacring everyone, with keeping all the wealth to herself as a goal.`
` True, Eva-san was a person capable of holding back nothing when she was determined to accomplish something.`
` Or, ...she may have committed murder just once in her life...if a chance for keeping all the Ushiromiya family wealth for herself presented itself.`
` ......However, I don't think that happened."`
`"So, what's the second point that justifies your trust in her?"`
`"Eva-san's family.`
` Hideyoshi-san and George-kun.`
` ...It might be difficult for you to believe all of a sudden, Ange-chan, but Eva-san was a person who treasured family greatly."`
`...True, part of me didn't want to believe it or acknowledge it.`
`But I did understand vaguely.`
`Aunt Eva certainly had been a person who highly treasured her family.`
`After all, the root of her twisted personality had been nothing more than the sadness of losing her beloved husband and son.`
`After getting hit with her angry outbursts as she tried to distract herself from that pain, I have no feelings of sympathy at all,`
` ...but it's not like I can't imagine how the incredible shock of losing her whole family must've changed her character.`
`"...You're saying there's no way Aunt Eva, who loved her family, would throw away her husband and her son?"`
`"That's right.`
` Even if Eva-san really was the culprit and massacred the entire family, making it look like an accident,`
` ...she most certainly would have spared her husband and her son."`
`"She would quibble that, by coincidence, only her family had been in the hidden mansion.`
` If Hideyoshi-san and George-kun had been safe, even I would probably suspect Eva-san."`
`"...I truly cannot imagine that Eva-san's wailing at Hideyoshi-san's funeral was an act."`
`"......Sounds like both points so far are just circumstantial evidence.`
` That isn't the same as physically proving Aunt Eva's innocence."`
`"Hahahaha.`
` If you say that, then you're stuck right away.`
` Eva-san was the only survivor.`
` And she says that this is the truth."`
`"But no one can prove her innocence."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` And no one can prove that she committed a crime either."`
`"............"`
`"And the final point that justifies trusting her...is the police.`
` After all, it was such a flashy crime.`
` The police were being pushed forward by a public in an uproar over conspiracy theories, so they must have investigated Eva-san thoroughly."`
`It was easy to feel something unnatural about the claim that Eva had avoided the accident by coincidence...`
`because she alone had escaped to a hidden mansion.`
`Furthermore, at the time, Hideyoshi's company had been right in the middle of a takeover struggle, and in order to buy off the big stockholders, she'd wanted a large sum of cash.`
`It shouldn't be too hard to find a motive there.`
`But as a matter of fact, there had been nothing at all that implicated Eva as she went to the family conference.`
`Nothing unnatural was found on her that could've been used to brutally murder her family and make it look like an accident.`
`The servants who escaped harm by being off-duty on that day also stated that they hadn't seen anything strange regarding anyone related to the event, Eva included.`
`Putting all of that together, `
`it could only be concluded that Ushiromiya Eva had headed to Rokkenjima for a normal family conference, without any change,`
` and had encountered an accident...`
`"The police looked so intensely, and they still couldn't find evidence that it was a crime.`
` ...They reached that conclusion themselves.`
` Doesn't this resolve the Rokkenjima Suspicion?"`
`@:dwave_jp 0, enj_4e258:~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"...That just means that the police `
`~ib~couldn't find~ib~`
` evidence that it was a crime, right?"`
`"There's nothing I can say to counter that.`
` It becomes a Devil's Proof.`
` To expose it as her crime, you would simply need to find evidence.`
` But what could you possibly find to prove her innocence?`
` It's impossible to prove a negative fact."`
`"...Did Aunt Eva commit a crime, or did she not...?`
` Because we can't find any materials that'll let us say for sure, the truth will remain a mystery... That's what you're saying, right?"`
`"......That's it.`
` Phrased in a manner you would prefer, that's what it amounts to.`
` It was impossible even for Eva-san to prove her own innocence.`
` On that island, an unfortunate accident occurred.`
` And Eva-san survived by chance.`
` And we don't know any more than that!"`
`"In short, it all comes down to whether you believe the story of the only survivor, Eva-san, or not.`
` ...I believed.`
` The ring and her praiseworthy love for her family.`
` And the tears she shed at the funeral.`
` Taking all of that into consideration, I decided to believe her story."`
`"...But I don't believe.`
` If she wanted to steal the ring, there were probably many ways for her to do it, and no one knows if her relationship with her family really was that good.`
` No one can prove that tears at a funeral are real."`
`"...Anyway, I hated Aunt Eva from the very beginning.`
` So I don't even want to believe her."`
`"Hahahaha...`
` How does one view the truth of the crime?`
` You and I are on completely opposing sides.`
` Even though the information we are given is exactly the same, we interpret it in completely different ways."`
`"......This happens often in politics and business.`
` The exact same enterprise will always be assessed in multiple, differing ways.`
` Do you know why?"`
`"......Why?"`
`"It's a question of whether one has love.`
` ...Whether you feel love for someone or not completely changes how you view them.`
` If a person you like gives to the poor, you respect them for it, right?`
` But if someone you hate starts donating, you fiercely protest that it's a publicity stunt or that they're handing out favors."`
`"No matter what they do or don't do, you thank them if you have love and criticize them if you don't.`
` That's how the world works."`
`"Can Aunt Eva be trusted, or can't she...?`
` ...You're saying that's all that really matters?"`
`"Those who suspect her will probably take anything she does or doesn't do and truly see it as something unnatural.`
` And it works in reverse.`
` ...As for me, `
`I think that, barring certain extreme cases, truth might not exist in this world at all."`
`"No, even if truth does exist, `
`whether you believe it or not is determined by whether you have love or not.`
` ...Can you really call truth without certainty truth?`
` Even if Eva-san had been able to show physical proof that she had an alibi, would you have been able to believe it?"`
`"........."`
`It's hard to counter that.`
`...I hate Aunt Eva, so I'll probably deny any information beneficial to her...`
`and interpret any neutral information in a negative way.`
`...In other words, the truth is already decided inside me.`
`So just what in the world is this 'truth' that I'm still searching for, unsatisfied...?`
`"That's how it is.`
` So, no matter what you hear from me, since you still suspect Eva-san after all this time, `
`nothing will change.`
` At the very least, even if you were to grasp a piece of hitherto unknown information, I don't think you'd be able to reach the truth the way you are now."`
`"......So I can't...`
`reach the truth?"`
`"After all,`
` no matter what kind of new information or proof you find, Ange-chan, it won't change your stance that Eva-san is the culprit, right?`
` So it's pointless to investigate anything more.`
` Because`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~the truth inside of you is already decided~ib~`
`."`
`"............"`
`"However...`
` If you stop assuming that to be the truth, if you wish to struggle further towards the deeper, real truth, there is a single way.`
` I believe I already mentioned it,`
` but do you know what it is?"`
`"...Is it...love?`
` I don't really know what you mean."`
`"Right now, you're considering this under the assumption that Eva-san is the culprit.`
` But that's no different than looking at something with a single eye.`
` With one eye, no matter how much you squint, you cannot see an object in three dimensions, right?`
` That's why we have another eye.`
` And of course, it's in a different position from the first eye."`
`"......You're telling me to look at things based on the supposition that Aunt Eva isn't the culprit,`
` ...or else, that it was a real accident...?"`
`"Yes, yes, that's correct.`
` When thinking about anything, you should always try to look at it from different perspectives.`
` If you don't, you won't understand anything about what is real."`
`"It's the same with newspapers.`
` You can't see anything from the single viewpoint of a writer who wrote an article in a single newspaper.`
` Sometimes you can only process information composedly and in three dimensions when you read multiple newspapers."`
`"...Without love, the truth cannot be seen.`
` ......Hmm, sounds nice, wahahaha."`
`Maybe he thought it interesting that such a flashy phrase would pop out of his mouth.`
` For a while, he laughed, looking pleased.`
`...At the same time, he was telling me that he'd said everything he knew...`
`and that it was about time to leave.`
` I understood that and got to my feet.`
`"I do understand your feelings, Ange-chan.`
` You should do as you like for a while, until you're satisfied."`
`"...You were six years old at the time.`
` I understand how you must feel after losing your family before you could even understand what that meant...and how you must still be unable to sort out your heart."`
`"............"`
`"You may learn the truth, and you may not.`
` Eva-san may be the culprit, and she may be a victim.`
` ...I pray that you find the 'truth' you believe in, Ange-chan.`
` A journey at such a young age may prove to be a valuable experience."`
`"Thank you very much...`
` ...I'm truly sorry to be such a bother when you're so busy, Okonogi-san."`
`"No trouble, no trouble.`
` What are you going to do now?"`
`"Well, whatever works.`
` ...I've made appointments with several specialists and people related to the crime, and I plan to go visit them."`
`"I see.`
` I hope you find an answer you can accept."`
`At that time, company president Okonogi's secretary came in, handing him a memo over his shoulder.`
`He read it, then looked between it and my face.`
`"...Ange-chan,`
` my apologies that this comes right after telling you to try going on a journey, but I have some information you should lend an ear to.`
` ...It looks like you're in a bit of a nasty fix right now."`
`"People after my money?`
` This is why money's stupid."`
`"Yes, but if you sell off all of the wealth, trying to donate the whole sum to the public welfare,`
` you'll make the eyes pop out of those people optimistic about their chances with your fortune."`
`"Oh, the Sumadera family?`
` Those guys act so proud, like they're my guards or something."`
`I haven't forgotten Aunt Eva.`
`There's no way I'll put myself in the care of the Sumadera family.`
`They probably want to, as Aunt Eva often threatened in the past,`
` cut off my arms and legs, throw me in a warehouse, and suck the Ushiromiya family's wealth dry.`
`"Apparently, a messenger from the Sumadera family is coming here.`
` They're saying to hand you over...no, no, that they want to protect you."`
`"A messenger, you say?"`
`"It's your aunt.`
` Kyrie-san's younger sister.`
` I believe she told me earlier that she thinks of you as a little sister."`
`"She's gotta be joking.`
` At least call me a granddaughter, you old hag."`
`"Judging from the context, it seems they have no wish to listen to your desires.`
` I have a car waiting in the parking lot two stories underground.`
` Go."`
`"...The Sumadera family is telling you to hand me over.`
` Is it really okay to let me go?"`
`"You will definitely become something big in the future, Ange-chan.`
` Let us call this a favor to be repaid upon your success.`
` ...Go, quickly...!"`
`After bowing silently and deeply, Ange left that place at a dash.`
`After watching her leave, the female secretary straightened her glasses and whispered.`
`"The Sumadera family told us to stall her...`
` Is it really all right to let her go?"`
`"We did stall her, more than enough.`
` If they still don't make it in time, that's their own fault.`
` ...I told Ange-chan to run for it.`
` I informed the Sumaderas that Ange-chan would be coming.`
` Whether she's caught or not, I will not be blamed."`
`"...Everything in this world...is love, you see...`
` Don't worry, she'll escape.`
` After all, that child's capable of leaping off a building to shake pursuers."`
`...Okonogi looked down again through a crack in the blinds,`
` muttering 'Nope, definitely couldn't do it...'`
`Ange wasn't a fool herself.`
`She got off the elevator, but on the third floor.`
`A taxi in the second level of the basement?`
`That's so neat and clean that I don't like it.`
` It's probably better to refuse for now.`
`But my enemies aren't fools either.`
`They're probably waiting in the first floor lobby, as well as the underground parking lot.`
`It's such a massive building.`
`Instead of getting anxious and escaping outside, maybe it's better to stay inside and wait it out.`
`No, that's useless.`
`If they get their hands on a security room in a modern building like this, I'll have nowhere to run to.`
`This entire building is like a massive dead end.`
`The third floor is the business floor.`
` A young girl like me will clearly stick out.`
`Trying not to stand out any more than I had to, I walked at a brisk pace, searching for an emergency exit.`
`...It'd be perfect if that staircase was an outside one.`
`I found the door to the emergency exit.`
`After opening that heavy door, I found the outside staircase I'd hoped for.`
`I bumped into a man who looked like an employee skipping work and smoking a cigarette.`
`After glaring at me, he quickly crushed out his cigarette and went away.`
`It looked like there was no one below.`
` ...If I'm gonna escape, now's my only chance...!`
`Just when I thought that, a black car slid right under me and came to a sudden stop with an incredible squealing of the tires.`
`...Judging by the sound of tires, it seemed they had several other allies, and that one of them had come here to block this path.`
`"...Not bad, Aunt Kasumi.`
` To think you'd even send a car to pick up your little sister when she's trying to get out through the emergency exit."`
`*bam*bam*! The doors of the car were forcefully opened and three black-suited men jumped out, looking up at the emergency staircase.`
`...Crap, our eyes met.`
`"12, target found.`
` Northwest side emergency stairs, third floor, send support."`
`"Ange-sama!`
` Try not to move from there!`
` Forgive our roughness...!!"`
`The three of them began to clamor up the emergency exit.`
`...They've already announced that they plan to be rough.`
` This is pretty bad.`
`As long as I don't stop breathing, they've probably been ordered to grab me no matter what, even if they've gotta rip out one of my arms.`
`*clank*clank*clank*clank*!!`
`Their heavy, wild footsteps became a helix and began to rise from the lower floors, getting closer...!`
`In the entrance lobby of the building, a woman with seven black-suited guards behind her advanced at a leisurely pace.`
`Seeing this ostentatious entrance, the security guards for the building ran up to them, asking if they had an appointment.`
`"......How typical of Tokyo people.`
` Don't you understand the status of the person you are talking to without her having to say her name...?"`
`"M-My apologies...`
` At our company, guests are to take a securi-"`
`"...Back down, scum.`
` I came because I was called by your president.`
` Call Okonogi Tetsurou here.`
` To think he would call me here and then not welcome me... How typical of Tokyo people..."`
`"My apologies.`
` Welcome to the Ushiromiya Group, Sumadera Kasumi-san."`
`With his secretary behind him, Okonogi dashingly appeared from the elevator.`
`Even though both of them wore bold smiles, they were wrapped in a tension reminiscent of the smell of gunpowder...`
`"......Where is Ange?`
` I came to greet that adorable daughter of my big sister's."`
`"Strict observance of time is our motto here at the Ushiromiya group.`
` The former Chairman herself said that those who can't keep time can't keep contracts."`
`"...You call me all the way to Tokyo, and this is all you have to show for it?`
` You let her go, didn't you."`
`"Please, she escaped from us.`
` We did stall her for quite some time,`
` but unsurprisingly, she did eventually smell a rat.`
` Of course, this wouldn't have been a problem at all if you had arrived on time, Sumadera-san."`
`"Ah, these provicials and their loose concept of time.`
` Wahhahahahahahahaha!"`
`"......What was that...?`
` What did you say to me...?"`
`You couldn't sense any of Kyrie's open frankness in Kasumi's face.`
`She wore the arrogance of the ancient Sumadera family towards the ruined Ushiromiya family,`
` ...as well as pride, because she didn't want anyone to notice that her family was declining so much that they couldn't ignore the Ushiromiya family's wealth.`
`Even at a glance, it was easy to understand why Ange hated her aunt so deeply...`
`She couldn't stand even a slight insult, and though she still smiled, her eyebrow twitched.`
`At that time, the black-suited man behind Kasumi whispered to her.`
`"Ange-sama has been found.`
` We are currently dealing with her."`
`"...Oh, I'm glad we made it in time.`
` ...Thank you, Okonogi.`
` It seems I can finally take my mischievous niece home.`
` ...I've waited so long to talk with that girl in my tea room, with all of the tools prepared.`
` Heheheheheheh...!"`
`*clank*clank*clank*clank*...!!`
`As the violent sound drew a helix, it rushed up at me from below, threatening to swallow me up.`
`Of course, even if I fight, there's no way I'll be able to win.`
`And yet, running into the building would be like jumping into a dead end of my own accord.`
`My enemies will increase in number with time.`
`If I don't do something here and now, I won't have any more chances to escape.`
`Then, three muscular black-suited men came into view below me.`
`1, 2, 3.`
` Three people.`
` In other words, everyone who had gotten out of the car.`
`If there had been just one of them, I might've been able to dropkick them or something and smash them in the head, which might work out.`
` ...But it really would be impossible with three of them.`
`Wait, ...three...?`
` ...If there's just three, I should be able to make it...`
` ...I can do it...!`
`"Take a deep breath......`
` ......Haaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!"`
`"What?!`
` Y-You idiot, stop!!`
` Look ooooooout!!`
` Waaaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`"01 calling 12, is the package secure, we received a response.`
` ...What happened?!`
` Respond!"`
`"...Sh-She's crazy... Damn it..."`
`......Nnnggg...`
` ...Owow...`
`See, ...that worked out perfectly, didn't it? There was just the three of them, after all.`
`I've already tried that once from a higher place.`
` I knew I'd be able to jump down just three floors...!`
`It's a good thing the car they came in was right beneath me.`
`Even if it wasn't as pleasant as a trampoline, it broke my fall...a little gently, a little roughly.`
`"...How rude.`
` You didn't have to dent that much."`
`The roof of the car broke my fall, leaving a massive dent around my body.`
`Car roofs are surprisingly delicate.`
` I don't think it's because of my weight.`
`Apparently, the three people on the stairs hadn't planned on me jumping down.`
`It seemed they now realized that they'd been outwitted, and they were rushing down the stairs.`
`I've gotta run and escape while I have the chance.`
`I moved my body, making clunking sounds on the car roof.`
`But I'd been naive.`
` Of course they wouldn't all rush up the stairs without leaving one person behind.`
`There was one black-suited man left in the driver's seat of the car that had broken my fall.`
`He stuck his head out the window, and when he realized what had fallen on him, he jumped out.`
`In a rush, I jumped off the roof, but the black-suited man's reaction was really fast.`
` ...Either there was a massive reward for capturing me, or there'd be some harsh punishment in store for them if they let me get away.`
`"15, secured, secured...!"`
`"Owowowow...!!`
` Ack, don't touch me like that, let go!!"`
`I was mercilessly held down against the asphalt.`
`I was being crushed face-down, covered and pressed upon from above.`
`It was a hold without a trace of elegance, but it was extremely practical and left me no room for resistance.`
`I tried to push back with both hands, searching for a way to resist,`
` but I was being pushed down solidly, and I couldn't even tear myself off the asphalt.`
`Then another car came, squealing its tires as it slid to a sudden stop.`
`Is it all over now?`
`'!s0`
`The man that had been crushing me let out a sharp cry.`
`...He was yelling straight into my ear, making my left ear ring.`
` What in the world?!`
`Along with the black-suit guy, I fell with a *thunk*.`
`After landing face up, the first thing I saw...was an arm stuck out right in front of my eyes.`
`"......Amakusa...?`
` What are you doing here...?"`
`"Let's talk about that after we've lost them.`
` To the car, quickly, lady...!"`
`Amakusa grabbed my arm, easily pulled me up, spinning me around with himself as the center of gravity.`
`Just when I thought it was a little like a dance, he flung me through the open door into the driver's seat.`
`I climbed over the hand brake and slid into the passenger's seat.`
`Pushing me in, Amakusa also got into the driver's seat.`
`Since we suddenly accelerated while I was still on all fours, I had to kick and struggle around on the chair for a while, like a turtle that's been flipped over...`
`Amakusa checked the rear-view mirror for cars in pursuit, but he flew into the artery of the big city without lowering his speed in the slightest.`
`We sewed our way between cars one after another.`
`Just like a chase scene in some action movie.`
`...I was shaken by this horrible driving and had trouble sitting back down.`
`"Are you hurt, lady?"`
`"I'm fine.`
` Humans are surprisingly durable.`
` Next time I try to a escape a downward moving elevator, I'll jump out a window instead."`
`"Hyahhahaha, I guess air dives are a hobby of yours, lady.`
` Still, I'd recommend you grab a parachute next time."`
`"Sure, if I remember to do it after leaping."`
`"Hyahhahahahaha, <cool>!"`
`He smacked the steering wheel, guffawing.`
`Need an explanation for this flippantly-talking man?`
`His name is Amakusa Juuza (天草十三).`
`He was originally one of Aunt Eva's guards.`
` Didn't she start to hate him because he chatted too much?`
`He was much younger than the rest of the guards, but contrary to his outward flippancy, he'd hopped from the First Airborne of the JSDF to the French Foreign Legion, `
`placing himself in overseas private military companies and high-class security companies one after another, making for a pretty incredible and unique career.`
`...But I heard he deserted both the JSDF and the French Foreign Legion, and that he'll be arrested if he enters France again.`
` Both of these flippant episodes were very typical of him.`
`The guards were sternly told not to chat with me unnecessarily, `
`but he came and took a pass at me, didn't he?`
`Aunt Eva was apparently particularly put off by that...and had supposedly dismissed him shortly before she died.`
`"It's been a while since I've heard that carefree tone.`
` What happened after you got fired?"`
`"I was coaching some people at Blackwater.`
` When I came back to the country during my time off, President Okonogi offered me a high wage."`
`"...So, you deserted again?`
` I wonder how a man like that can be useful for anything."`
`"Doesn't count as desertion as long as I come back by next week.`
` I talked with him yesterday.`
` I was told that some troublesome people might come to call on you, lady."`
`"Sorry that turned out to be exactly right."`
`"My name probably came up since I know you, and I've got lots of crazy experience.`
` Thanks to you, it looks I'm in for a happy vacation plus some pocket money."`
`"...So, Okonogi-san employed you as my guard?"`
`"He probably wants to buy some gratitude from you, lady.`
` ...After I got fired, I was indebted to President Okonogi in various ways.`
` He's got some dirt on me here and there, and now I can't say no to him.`
` Hyahha!"`
`"...Seems that getting indebted to Okonogi-san can be pretty costly later on.`
` ...So, where are you planning on taking me?"`
`"Anywhere.`
` I'm employed until the weekend.`
` Anything after that'll cost you extra."`
`"How much per day?"`
`"I'll take 50 thousand.`
` Plus expenses."`
`"If you stop cracking jokes, I'll double it.`
` The period of employment isn't fixed yet.`
` It might take several weeks."`
`"...That'll be tough.`
` I'll have to call my boss to get an extension on my vacation."`
`"More than anything, I want to investigate that day."`
`"...Oh, is this about Rokkenjima?"`
`"Exactly.`
` What happened on that island 12 years ago?`
` ...I want to investigate it with my own hands to my satisfaction."`
`"Do you really expect to find anything new investigating something that old...?"`
`"True.`
` But this is a journey for my own self-satisfaction.`
` ...Once that's over, I'll just throw my hands up and go over to the Sumadera family.`
` ...Didn't Aunt Kasumi say something about how she wanted to serve me some matcha?`
` Maybe she'll serve me tea as I kneel on sharp wooden blocks, clutching stones or something."`
`"Damn that sounds freaky, hyahhahahaha...!"`
`"My apologies, we lost sight of them...`
` A single man thought to be an associate assisted in her escape.`
` Judging by his possession of a stun gun and his driving skills, he's no amateur."`
`"......I see, thank you.`
` ......What a shame, Okonogi.`
` Shall I take this as your answer...?"`
`"Letting her get away was your blunder.`
` It has nothing to do with me."`
`"......I do wish to prepare some matcha for you as well in the near future.`
` The next time you're in Kyoto, please stop by.`
` ......I'm going."`
`"Oh, are you leaving already?`
` I could offer you some chazuke first."`
`".........*cackle*cackle*`
` ...Hohohohoho...!!"`
`With her back still facing Okonogi, she laughed softly, but with an increasingly shrill and hateful tone, using that as a substitute for a sharp parting remark.`
`Just as she stopped laughing, her features suddenly changed to look like a demon's,`
` but because her back was facing him, Okonogi couldn't see that expression.`
`Okonogi watched her go, laughing cooly.`
`His secretary whispered over his shoulder.`
`"...Are you sure about this?`
` Milady Ange is our company's primary stockholder.`
` If the Sumadera family becomes her guardian..."`
`"I get it.`
` But you know, we're the world-famous Ushiromiyas.`
` We can't let them take us lightly.`
` ...Still, it looks like that guy managed it pretty well.`
` ...All that's left is to let Ange-chan do as she pleases.`
` I'm counting on you, Amakusa."`
`"...Kasumi-sama,`
` the escaping car was a rental.`
` The license plate they displayed was a fake.`
` We're clearly dealing with a pro.`
` They'll probably abandon the car.`
` Pursuit will be difficult.`
` ...Should we have the police chase them?"`
`"......Hmm, yes.`
` Shall we have them search for our runaway daughter?`
` They are getting paid with our taxes, so the police must be of some use every once in a while.`
` Hohohoho......"`
`"When I left the mansion, I boldly told mother to leave it to me, didn't I?`
` Do you intend to embarrass me further...?`
` It looks like it might be better for me to serve some matcha for everyone at once, doesn't it?`
` ...Our underground tea room is cramped, so you'll have to wait in line..."`
`"N-No...`
` We will search with everything we have."`
`"...Ah, she really is a cute kid, just like Nee-san.`
` ...Especially that way she freewheels and does as she pleases.`
` ...Ah, now I can't see anything but Nee-san.`
` Ah, I'm truly looking forward to it.`
` If only I could invite Nee-san's daughter to my tea room, right...?`
` Hohohohoho...!!"`
`"...The Sumadera family sure moved quickly.`
` Did Okonogi-san sell me out...?"`
`"You're joking.`
` He's my client.`
` If he'd sold you out, he wouldn't have hired me, right...?"`
`".........`
`...I guess that's true."`
`"...Ah, so that's why you got off the elevator at the third floor."`
`"Him having a car waiting in the underground parking lot was just too convenient.`
` I figured Okonogi-san sold me out.`
` ...Though I guess by now, it's impossible to prove whether there was an ambush set up in the parking lot or not."`
`"I see, that poor president guy.`
` Looks like you don't trust him a bit, lady.`
` That car in the basement...was mine."`
`"Huh...?`
` He was talking about you, Amakusa...?"`
`"I freaked when the elevator came and was empty.`
` I wonder what would've happened by now if I hadn't been listening in on their radio."`
`"......So what's going on?`
` If I'd obediently believed Okonogi-san and gone to the parking lot, `
`there would've been no need for me to do that jump off the third floor...?"`
`"Pretty much, yeah.`
` Well, it turned out okay in the end."`
`"............"`
`......What the hell.`
`If I hadn't suspected President Okonogi,`
` ...I could've easily escaped without getting caught in a tough spot.`
`'President Okonogi might have sold me out'.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`No, since paranoia told me that it was better to assume that he'd sold me out, I supposed and ~ib~concluded~ib~ that 'He sold me out'.`
`Because of my inability to believe in him, regardless of his truth,`
` my truth became 'He sold me out'...`
`I thought back on President Okonogi's words.`
`Can you really call truth without certainty truth...?`
`Truth can change completely depending on whether you have love or not.`
`In the end, ...perhaps truth itself doesn't exist.`
`There are as many interpreted truths as there are people who speak of the truth.`
`If I can't accept something that fluid as truth,`
` ...where does the truth that I really want to find exist?`
` ...And is it something I'll be able to see with my eyes?`
`...Even if someone sticks the truth right there in front of me and says it's the truth, `
`I might not be able to 'see' it...`
`"...Without love, it cannot be 'seen', huh?"`
`"......This Fragment of yours is very lively.`
` It doesn't bore me."`
`"You told me something.`
` You commanded me to search for the truth of 12 years ago.`
` ...But there's something I'm not getting."`
`"What's that?"`
`"...What is truth?`
` There are as many truths as there are people.`
` There are as many interpretations as there are people.`
` And those can be twisted by opinions and changed indefinitely.`
` ...Is truth really that unfixed and vague?"`
`"That's right.`
` ...Truth is unfixed.`
` It can be like a particle, or like a wave, and it can hold conflicting forms at the same time.`
` You are free to believe that the cat in the box is alive or dead.`
` ...But the truth is very delicate.`
` It can change its appearance just by being observed."`
`"You're talking about stuff like Schrodinger's cat box?`
` ......Nonsense.`
` If you open the box, you learn the truth.`
` Discussion about what happens before you open it is just an armchair theory."`
`"That's right.`
` And yet, in order to deny that abstract theory, you need to open the box.`
` ...It is impossible to negate any idea about the contents of a box that cannot be opened.`
` This is what truth is."`
`"......As long as truth isn't denied, it keeps its form."`
`"That's right.`
` As long as truth isn't observed, it keeps its form."`
`"In other words, if it isn't exposed, any reckless statement can suffice as truth."`
`"Yes.`
` ...Even if they contradict each other, endless ideas can exist as truth at the same time without being negated."`
`"......So even something as screwed up as my family being captured by the Rokkenjima witch and shut up 12 years ago for all eternity...`
`can exist as truth as long as we don't know what happened 12 years ago..."`
`"This witch called Beatrice...forcibly made room for 'Endless' imaginings in the Rokkenjima of 12 years ago, enveloping all of it inside a cat box.`
` Everything inside the unopenable box is truth."`
`That's right.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~We don't know what happened on that island~ib~`
`, so it becomes endless.`
`"...That's assuming no one opens it up.`
` I just have to wrench it open.`
` ......But that box was closed up 12 years ago, and I don't even know where it is.`
` ...Even if I visit Rokkenjima, just what can I learn about what happened 12 years ago on that desolated island?"`
`"Who knows?`
` I wonder what you could learn.`
` ......This is something that can only be done by the person who is able to walk around freely in the world of 1998, 12 years in the future:`
` the final witch, ANGE Beatrice."`
`"........."`
`"Beatrice's game board lasts two days, from October 4, 1986 to the 5th.`
` In other words, you're a piece who can move freely outside her game board.`
` ...And even Beatrice cannot influence this future that lies outside the game board."`
`"...If you say it like that, it sounds like I'm a pretty overpowered piece."`
`"The future of 12 years later in which you are placed certainly is distant.`
` However, the further a piece is placed in the future, the stronger power it holds.`
` ...I told you, didn't I?`
` The truth changes its appearance when it is observed."`
`"Come to think of it, I heard something like that once.`
` ...Even if one day, all of a sudden, a star in the constellation Centaurus were to explode,`
` the light from that explosion would have to cross 4.4 light years, so it would take it four and a half years to reach the Earth."`
`"That's right.`
` In other words, even if the sun in Centaurus has already died, people on Earth won't be able to perceive that fact for four and a half years.`
` ...Because no method of perception exists that is faster than the speed of light."`
`When we learn that the sun in Centaurus has exploded...`
`We Earth people will paint over our history of four and a half years ago with a new truth.`
`We will revise history with a new fact: that it exploded four and a half years ago.`
`However, for the four and a half year period until we learn that, despite the fact that it has already died, `
`the mistaken truth that the sun of Centaurus still exists will be able to exist as truth.`
`The truth of the future wins against the truth of the past.`
`"......That's right.`
` By itself, the Rokkenjima accident gave rise to nothing but `
`suspicion of a conspiracy involving Aunt Eva and the Ushiromiya family assets.`
` ...But later on,`
` ...it was dramatized and linked to the occult, and the conspiracy was painted over by the Legend of the Witch."`
`Even though it was clambered over as a conspiracy at the time of the crime,`
` later on, strange occult theories, which claimed that it was the work of the witch, ran rampant and began to paint over the truth of October 5, 1986...`
`The conspiracy theories will probably be forgotten over time.`
`...And only the more bizarre, impressive witch theory will continue to remain as superstition, eventually covering up the conspiracies.`
`"That's right.`
` The false truth that exists before the light from an exploding star reaches Earth is almost like the conspiracy theory, which is a human theory.`
` ......The wine bottle with a letter in it that drifted ashore several years later, the 'message bottle', painted over that theory and made things return to the occult theory, which is a witch's theory."`
`"...That's right.`
` A witch didn't exist during 1986.`
` The witch took control of Rokkenjima because she was 'observed' several years later by us humans of the future, thanks to that message bottle...!"`
`"...A small revision is necessary.`
` The witch could have existed even during 1986.`
` As one of many endless possibilities that can exist."`
`"Certainly.`
` She'd disappear if she were observed, so she curls up inside the cat box.`
` ...That's what makes the message bottle so nasty."`
`"...The witch tried to get out of the box.`
` She made it so that she'd be observed, weeding out possibilities that conflicted with the witch theory.`
` ...In other words, to make it impossible to negate her, she negated all possibilities other than the witch theory."`
`"......What the hell.`
` So in other words, Beatrice satisfied the Devil's Proof with a frontal attack.`
` And, that was part of the witch's plan from the beginning."`
`"The message bottle is information observed in the future after 1986.`
` ......It cannot be observed by Beatrice or Battler.`
` ...It can only be observed by ANGE Beatrice."`
`"...I really didn't want to investigate the message bottle.`
` ...After all, reading that would be like listening to the witch's say.`
` I thought the witch theory was just a crazy fantasy, so I thought of it as nothing more than a waste of time."`
`"...But Okonogi-san told me.`
` You can't see things in three dimensions with only one eye."`
`"You mean that while looking at it from the viewpoint of denying witches, you must also look at it from the viewpoint of accepting witches?`
` ...That's a correct way of thinking.`
` The number of viewpoints is like a denominator.`
` If you have one viewpoint, the mystery in the numerator doesn't decrease in the slightest.`
` However, the more your number of viewpoints increases, the more the mystery begins to be divided."`
`"I understand.`
` ...There was a message bottle that washed up on a neighboring island several years after the crime.`
` That passed into the hands of a dilettante.`
` I made an appointment with him, just in case."`
`...I was able to hear Aunt Eva's say from Okonogi-san.`
`Next up is...the witch's say.`
`Why don't I listen?`
` To Beatrice's say...!`
`"3 months left to live.`
` It was last year when you said that, right, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"...I-I only spoke of what I could comprehensively determine from his physical condition at the time.`
` As a result, this year too, it just so happens-"`
`"So, even though it's doubtful whether Dad'll last until the end of the year, he's still totally focused on his occult research.`
` And you still say he has only three months left, Doctor?"`
`"L-Like I said, Kinzo-san's-"`
`"Shouldn't you be happy that our respected father is still in high spirits?`
` Out of a sense of parental respect, each one of you is so eager to greet Father.`
` I can see how upset you are that he's unwilling to meet with you."`
`"...Considering that everyone has started aiming for the inheritance while the sun is still in the sky,`
` I can understand why Father wouldn't want to see you."`
`"Y-You've got it wrong, Natsuhi nee-san.`
` ...We just, umm-"`
`"Dad isn't immortal, and he'll die someday.`
` We aren't telling him to die. We're just saying that he will die sooner or later.`
` We're just talking together about how to prepare for that."`
`"And that is precisely what is so disrespectful!!"`
`"Stop it.`
` You'll make your headache worse."`
`Krauss told Natsuhi, who had risen from her chair in agitation, to sit down.`
`Trying to smooth over the atmosphere, which had suddenly become filled with suspicion,`
` Hideyoshi put on a forced smile and motioned for everyone to calm down.`
`"...Natsuhi-san, don't misunderstand.`
` People say you should always clean up after yourself, right?`
` We're just talkin' about seein' him off.`
` We're discussin' this so we can see Father off neatly when he takes off on the journey he's eventually gonna make."`
`"Hahaha...`
` That's just like you, Hideyoshi-san.`
` Even though you're saying the same thing, you make it sound so intellectual."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` Unlike you, Nii-san."`
`"Quit it.`
` We aren't getting anywhere.`
` ......So like we're saying, Aniki,`
` forget all this about the inheritance.`
` I don't even care if Dad hits us."`
`"To make a long story short, we wanna meet Dad directly and say hello.`
` Even if he says he doesn't want to.`
` If he's locked up in his study, we don't care if we have to borrow a key from Genji-san.`
` Right, Rosa?"`
`"...Oh, ...well, umm...it's not like we're forcing you...`
` ...It's just...we haven't said hello to Father in such a long time.`
` If his remaining life really is short, then there's a chance we might never be able to see him again...`
` ...Today might be our final opportunity to exchange words with Father..."`
`"That's right, just like Rosa says.`
` If he only has three months left, it wouldn't be odd for him to pass away any time now, right?`
` Are you saying that despite that, we don't even have the right to talk with him one last time?`
` ...Regardless of the circumstances, isn't that just a bit too much...?"`
`"...If greeting Father were truly what you wished to do, I'm sure he'd happily allow you to meet with him."`
`"But Father has already heard about the disrespectful topic you hope to raise!`
` No one would want to meet with you under those conditions.`
` The reason you cannot meet with Father is because of your own doing and nothing else, is it not?"`
`"Heheh.`
` Exactly.`
` You shouldn't have to rack your brains to understand why Father doesn't wish to see your faces, right?`
` Father has seen through all of your tight financial situations."`
`"......What are you talking about?`
` ...I don't have a clue what you're going on about, Nii-san."`
`"Heheheheh!`
` Did you really think I didn't know about the state you're in...?"`
`Eva and the rest realized that he had seen through to their current lack of funds,`
` and alternating between bluffing and returning to the point at hand and arguing back, `
`they repeatedly pressed Krauss to let them meet with Kinzo.`
`...The sweet smell of the black tea Rosa had gone out of her way to buy had been completely wasted.`
`The only thing she was glad about now was that the children weren't here for this.`
`...The fact that they'd gone to play at the beach right after lunch had been their only salvation.`
`Eva made as though to tackle Krauss, and Hideyoshi and Kyrie cut in between them, trying to calm both sides.`
`...Then, Kyrie took a deep breath and spoke.`
`"......I'm sorry, Krauss nii-san.`
` I know I'm an outsider, but I wonder if you'd let me say one thing.`
` I have a proposition."`
`"What is it, Kyrie-san?"`
`"...First, and this includes my husband as well,`
` for many years, we have belittled the efforts you've made by living with Father and taking care of him.`
` ...Isn't that right?"`
`"......That's...well...`
` ...We've got it easy since we get to go outside, but Aniki's been babysitting Dad for decades now, and that must've been a lot of work.`
` ...I'll accept that, but what's your point, Kyrie?"`
`"We must acknowledge that Krauss nii-san is Father's caretaker.`
` ...Isn't that right?`
` We've always feared Father...and have pushed the task of caring for him onto Krauss nii-san.`
` Everyone should acknowledge his efforts.`
` Isn't that right,`
` Eva nee-san?"`
`"......`
`...And so what?`
` Nii-san is Father's caretaker?`
` Don't decide things on your own, outsider!"`
`"H-Hey now, ...calm down.`
` ...Kyrie-san, what are you talking about?"`
`"............`
`...Kyrie, please continue."`
`"We should be more grateful towards Krauss nii-san and Natsuhi nee-san.`
` ...We should thank them for always taking care of Father.`
` It's our lack of gratitude that's to blame for these wasteful conflicts we keep having.`
` ...Isn't that right, Krauss nii-san?"`
`"......I'm surprised.`
` I did not think you, Kyrie-san, would be able to understand our efforts,`
` which even my true siblings have not stopped to consider."`
`"...It's a natural duty for the Successor to the Ushiromiya Family Headship."`
`"That's right.`
` It's your responsibility as the Successor to the Headship, isn't it?`
` ...It's because you take care of Father that we must acknowledge you as the Successor."`
`"Hey!!`
` Why are you bringing this up all by yourself?!!`
` You're just an outsider-"`
`"Wait, Aneki!!`
` ......That's right.`
` It's just like Kyrie says.`
` Because you take care of Dad, you're the Successor, Aniki.`
` It's just like you said."`
`"......Oh-"`
`"......Nn-"`
`Rosa noticed, and then Eva did.`
`Eva's barking demeanor towards Kyrie for advancing the discussion on her own disappeared in a flash,`
` and she instead stared at Krauss and Natsuhi.`
`...Natsuhi couldn't understand that sudden change and was slightly flustered.`
`"Krauss nii-san,`
` ...if you'll accept just a few conditions, `
`we won't ask you to let us meet Father again until he dies.`
` Of course, we won't demand to be present at his deathbed.`
` ...We wouldn't even mind being absent at the funeral."`
`"...Oh?`
` ......Where are you going with this?`
` But I may as well listen for now.`
` Let's hear your terms."`
`"First.`
` ...The term Successor to the Headship refers to the caretaker of the current Head, Ushiromiya Kinzo."`
`"......Hmm.`
` And then?"`
`"Second.`
` The duty of the caretaker is to look after Ushiromiya Kinzo for the rest of his life.`
` ...To make things simple, the caretaker's job is to care for him until his final moments.`
` You were prepared to do that from the beginning, Krauss nii-san, so that won't cause any problems."`
`"Naturally.`
` I have no objections to either of those terms.`
` I am already carrying them out."`
`"Third.`
` On the off-chance that the caretaker is neglectful in his responsibilities of supervision, he shall be deprived of his rights as a caretaker."`
`With that sentence, all slack disappeared from Krauss's face.`
`...Natsuhi alone was still having trouble figuring out what it meant.`
`"...Hoh.`
` And just what are these...`
`responsibilities of supervision that the caretaker bears?"`
`"It means supervision so that Father can live the rest of his life in the best possible health.`
` ...I'll be more detailed than that.`
` In the case that Father dies anything other than a natural death, the caretaker will be deprived of his rights as caretaker, and his status as the Successor to the Headship will be lost.`
` If that happens, the next highest in rank, Eva nee-san, will be selected as the Successor."`
`"......Wh-What did you say...?`
` How can you shamelessly speak such nonsense?!!"`
`"Hohoh.`
` My, my, the caretaker certainly has a heavy responsibility...`
` However, people can die in many ways.`
` For example, senile old people sometimes die when food gets caught in their throats.`
` Normally, this is called death by old age in its broadest sense."`
`"But with your argument, that becomes a death by accident, and I bear the responsibility of supervision.`
` ...This is unjustly disadvantageous to me."`
`"I have no intention of forcing such an unfair argument on you.`
` I'm referring to the kind of thing that the caretaker could have prevented beforehand by taking good care of and keeping his eyes on Father."`
`"It may be the caretaker's job to carry food to Father's mouth, but whether he swallows it or not is clearly outside the caretaker's responsibility.`
` I would have absolutely no problems with the example you raise, Krauss nii-san."`
`"......Hoh.`
` So, what kind of case are you referring to that might cause the caretaker to be blamed for making a blunder?"`
`"For example, `
`'!s0`
`"......`
`......Oh?"`
`"It seems that right now, Father is in firm control of himself,`
` but dementia might begin to set in."`
`"...He might wander around when you aren't looking and get into some kind of accident,`
` ...or he might get lost in the forest and go missing.`
` ...Wouldn't this type of case clearly be the responsibility of the caretaker...?"`
`"Father's mind is perfectly healthy!`
` There is no need to bring up dementia...!"`
`"'One day, suddenly, I saw Father go into the forest.`
` I chased after him, but I couldn't find him.`
` I called the police and searched, but after being unable to find him after seven whole years, I had him declared legally dead.'`
` My point is that we won't accept it if you use a story like that to treat him as dead."`
`"............"`
`"When Father passes away, an autopsy will certainly be carried out,`
` and we will confirm that he died of old age in the most general meaning, within the bounds of common sense.`
` ...A death of any other cause will be held as the caretaker's responsibility.`
` .........See?`
` These are all things you have toiled away at all this time, Krauss nii-san.`
` These aren't strange conditions or anything of the sort, right...?"`
`"Y-You are mocking us, disgracefully so!!`
` I find it hard to imagine why my husband must be coerced into a rule that disgraces him in this way!!"`
`"......Actually, I've been suspecting it since last year.`
` No, everyone here probably suspects it as well.`
` Eva nee-san and Hideyoshi nii-san.`
` Rudolf-san and Rosa-san too.`
` Everyone has suspected it the whole time, but it was so frightening to imagine that no one actually said it."`
`"Hmph.`
` ...Heheheheh, hahahahaha...!!`
` I see, so this is what you're trying to say?`
` ...That Father is already dead, and that I have been hiding it!"`
`"...Ah, that's right.`
` That's one of the theories I thought of as a key to solve the last mystery in the previous game."`
`"......You mean the very last bit,`
` the mystery of who killed Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"That's right.`
` ...The witch definitely said a lot in red.`
` ...She mentioned the names of all 18 people and announced whether they were alive or dead, and then she claimed that there were no humans besides them.`
` ...But with this theory, I can weave my way through that gap...!"`
`"......`
`...I see.`
` So, this is one of the answers that doesn't cause those two to contradict.`
` ......Makes sense."`
`"See what I'm saying?`
` ...You catch on pretty quick.`
` It's nice that I don't have to explain."`
`"No 19th person exists on this island.`
` And yet this trick lets us mix in an unknown new character.`
` ...In other words, 'the names of all 18 people' don't necessarily correspond to 'the 18 people on the island'."`
`"That's it...!`
` The witch mentioned the names of 18 people one after another, and announced whether they were alive or dead.`
` And on top of that, she announced that there were no humans other than the 18.`
` ...There was a single illusion in there."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`It wasn't guaranteed that ~ib~the 18 names of people = the 18 people on the island~ib~`
`.`
`"When she named off all 18 people and announced who was alive and who was dead,`
` she hid the name of culprit X, and instead mixed in someone who wasn't on this island...!`
` By doing that, even though the culprit was on the island, she was able to leave him out of the list of living or dead people!`
` The person who was mixed in wasn't actually on the island, so he didn't count towards the total number of people on the island."`
`"By this, even though the culprit counted towards the total of 18 people on the island, it was possible for his name not to be listed!`
` The two statements in red are completely independent, so this theory creates no contradictions...!"`
`"If someone's name was used to hide the existence of the culprit, that name must satisfy several conditions.`
` ...First of all, even though this person isn't on the island, they've got to be someone we think is on the island.`
` ...Otherwise, she wouldn't have been able to trick us."`
`"And it's best if this person happens to be dead.`
` ...No alibi is more perfect than death.`
` After all, at that point, the mystery was based on the fact that the crime was impossible for all 18 people.`
` ......Is it something like that?"`
`"Yeah, that's it...!`
` And, that person was...`
`...`
`Grandfather.`
` ...Right now, there's only one thing Kyrie-san can be about to say.`
` ...We thought Grandfather was locked up in his study, saying that he didn't want to meet anyone,`
` ...but there's a possibility that he's actually dead already, `
`and that Uncle Krauss is lying when he claims that Grandfather's alive...!"`
`That's right.`
` Grandfather was closed up in his room the whole time, and no one saw his face!`
`Maybe he was already dead, `
`and Uncle Krauss and the others were conspiring together, trying to trick everyone...!!`
`"......If Kinzo dies, the distribution of the inheritance occurs.`
` However, if Kinzo doesn't die...`
`no, `
`if he dies, but `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~it isn't announced~ib~`
`, the distribution of the inheritance won't take place."`
`"In other words, Uncle Krauss could have all of Grandfather's wealth to himself...!`
` That's right, he's got more than enough motive!"`
`Maybe a 19th person X really doesn't exist on this island.`
`But a person X existed.`
`...And that person was the 18th person!`
`"In other words, there were originally 17 people on this island, not 18.`
` Then, an unknown person X snuck in and committed the crime.`
` ...How's that, Beato?!`
` Come out, I've just solved the final, biggest mystery from last time!!"`
`As Battler claimed that forcefully, the crisp sound of clapping came out of nowhere, and their surroundings turned bright,`
` becoming the usual witch's tea room.`
`"*cackle* Hahahahahahaha...!`
` Bravo, bravo.`
` I wish I could deny that someone as incompetent as you has finally gotten a feel for it, but somehow or another, you've managed to come up with a single answer.`
` Even a lump of concrete can stop thinking!`
` So, you have now finally evolved into a being with intelligence."`
`"...You might say you've finally taken a step forward from the crying creature you were before, just licking my shoes and grinding your teeth.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"...I can't believe that stupid wordplay threw me for so many loops last time.`
` My lameness pisses even me off!"`
`"All right, Beato, repeat it!!`
` If you can announce that the 18 people on the island included Grandfather, just try and do iiiiiiiit!!`
` Yeah, you can't.`
` Because he was already dead.`
` This is the end of your deceptiooooooooooon!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* Ahhahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` Well now, what have we here?`
` ......Shall I slice that in two with the red truth?`
` No, no, it might also be good to hold back for now and let you get all excited.`
` If I'm going to push you off a cliff anyway, it would be more interesting to lure you to a higher place first.`
` *cackle*!"`
`As Beato sneered obnoxiously, she looked like she was searching for an expression that would tick me off even more.`
`...As though she was saying that the answer I'd reached was impossibly ridiculous.`
`Compared to me, annoyed as I was with the witch's attitude, Gretel had a blank and composed expression on her face.`
`...Almost as though she'd expected the witch to act that way.`
`".........`
`I see.`
` ...Just like how Battler has learned and grown, so has the witch."`
`"What's wrong, Beato?!`
` Don't act so tough!!`
` I asked if you can repeat it!`
` Answer!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*..."`
`"...Stop it, Battler.`
` The witch won't answer so easily.`
` ...She won't do it until she thinks it'll benefit her."`
`"What?!`
` What do you mean...?"`
`"You've been toyed with by this red truth in the games up until now, so the witch has used it many times.`
` But now, the situation is different.`
` You're trying to draw the red truth out of her...and are instead using it as your weapon.`
` In this situation, there's no way the witch will keep firing off the red without reason.`
` ......Right?"`
`"Gretel, or whoever you are.`
` ...It seems your mind is quite sharp, unlike Battler's.`
` What a fearsome enemy I've welcomed in.`
` That is correct!`
` When Battler hopes I'll use the red truth, do I have any responsibility to do so?!"`
`"No!`
` I don't even have a crumb from that croissant you ate this morning's worth of responsibility to please yooooooou!!"`
`"Y-You bastard......!!"`
`"Yes yes yes yes, that's the faaaaace!`
` I started playing with the red truth just because I wanted to see that face!`
` I have no reason to play around if it won't give me a chance to see you look like that...!"`
`"...Heheh.`
` You just don't like losing, right?`
` Just saying whatever you can to trick me because you can't answer my demand won't work!!"`
`"Don't be so full of yourself!!`
` An answer like that could be cut to pieces without any effort!!`
` But I won't go out of my way to speak in red.`
` I won't say it because that's what you're asking me to do.`
` Do you know why?"`
`"......You just said it.`
` You want to push him off at the sweetest spot.`
` This ill-natured witch is saying she won't use the red anymore, because that's what you want.`
` In other words, she won't go along with this game of telling her to repeat things anymore."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Exactly, exactly!`
` Unlike Battler, everything goes quickly with this girl, with no need for explanations!`
` I will say what I please with the red truth, at the time that I desire!"`
`"That's it.`
` Basically, it's the witch's right to use the red truth as she pleases.`
` She doesn't have to use it at whatever time the human side desires.`
` ......But even that depends on the sitution."`
`"...The situation...?`
` What do you mean...?"`
`"The witch has no responsibility to respond when you tell her to repeat something.`
` But it does become her responsibility if and only if your claim can destroy the witch theory.`
` After all, in this trial court without a judge, that which is not refuted becomes the truth."`
`"...Just like how the witch theory made by the witch......`
`will instantly become truth if you collapse and stop thinking."`
`"Then, ...since she doesn't have a counterargument for my guess, that means it's right?!`
` It's right that the culprit is the mysterious 18th person X, and Grandfather is already dead?!"`
`"...At least, until the witch argues back.`
` Truth always loses to new truths farther in the future.`
` ...The tricky part is that even the timing of the counterargument is up to the witch."`
`"...In other words, maybe your reasoning just now was correct, `
`or maybe the witch is refraining from arguing back even though you're wrong.`
` ...Or, the witch may be ignoring it because it doesn't shake the basis of the witch theory in the first place,`
` but either way, we can't tell the difference at the current time.`
` ......Is that more or less it?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Damn you, Lady Bernkastel, for throwing in such a troublesome piece.`
` Thanks to that, I'm losing all my lines!"`
`"The witch has learned that she can respond to your demands to repeat phrases at a later time.`
` ...Maybe you could even call it a delayed move."`
`"...Sh-She's messing with me...`
` ...So, even if I announce some mistaken reasoning, there's a possibility that Beato will intentionally let me flounder about without denying that guess,`
` and at the very end, when I propose an even more massive line of reasoning, she can cut it off at the base,`
` and spin everything around...?!"`
`A single piece of reasoning becomes a bridge to the next piece.`
`By demanding that she repeat lines, I've been able to strengthen my position and advance bit by bit.`
`But since that bastard Beato learned this strange delay tactic,`
` ...I can no longer confirm or deny my reasoning.`
`This is like finally finding a staff that'll let me search around in the darkness, only to lose it right away.`
` ...I'm just stuck now, right...?!!`
`"Hey, hey, Battler, if you make a despairing face like that, I won't be able to stop drooling, you see♪`
` From the beginning, that staff was nothing more than something I gave you because you were so worthless.`
` All this means is that you can finally challenge me without a handicap, right?`
` Kuhihihihihihihihi!"`
`"...But that alone doesn't change the fact that demanding that you repeat things is one of Battler's ways to fight back.`
` As I already said, as long as it's something fatal that'll destroy the witch theory, `
`the witch is obligated to argue back, and therefore, to speak with the red truth.`
` ...While the timing of that counterargument is up to the witch, it must be performed eventually.`
` ......Isn't that right?"`
`"Hmm, that may be so.`
` If I cannot deny the 'tricks done by humans' theory Battler lays out by the time the game ends,`
` Battler will use that as a reason to deny me, and it will be possible for him to proclaim his victory."`
`"...So, should we view this as a restriction on the witch's side...? That the 'trick theory' laid out by the human side, `
`in other words, what he tells you to repeat, must be countered during the game (during the episode)?"`
`"That is so.`
` ...Battler's goal is to show that he can explain the entire pleasant game I have laid out on this island with humans and deny me.`
` If Battler succeeds in that, at that time, he will become the victor of this game."`
`"Let me confirm the rules.`
` ...Should we view the time the game ends as referring to 24:00 on October 5, 1986, going by the time of the Rokkenjima in the game?"`
`"I have no problems with that."`
`"At the time the game ends, the human side must state a theory using tricks for all of the mysteries,`
` and if the witch side cannot argue back, the human side can proclaim its victory.`
` ...Does that work?"`
`"......Let us be more specific.`
` When the game ends, the witch side will be given a chance to argue back."`
`"Let's decide on an amount of time.`
` One minute.`
` If you cannot carry out your counterargument within one minute, victory will be proclaimed."`
`"Then allow me to impose the same rule on you.`
` At the time the game ends, the human side will be granted one minute to counter the mysteries it has been given.`
` If even a single mystery has not been countered within that time, it becomes the witch's victory, and that game is over.`
` ...It would be such a killjoy to have the game stopped for lengthy consideration, right?"`
`"......You asshole.`
` Moving things along without me...`
` But I more or less get what's going on.`
` Even if the lines I demand that you repeat aren't countered instantly, they've gotta be countered eventually."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ...And that must happen before 00:01 on October 6.`
` ...But be careful.`
` She only has to cut up one of the things you tell her to repeat.`
` You can't proclaim your victory unless you solve all the puzzles."`
`"Just as I can use the red,`
` from now on, I will allow you to use the blue, Battler."`
`"When explaining my magical murders with human tricks, you may state your claims in blue.`
` I am responsible for countering your blue with the red by the end of the game."`
`"Blue...`
` ...So I'll talk in blue when I tell you to repeat things...?"`
`"Not quite.`
` When you told me to repeat lines, you were able to do it for any trivial thing.`
` But the blue is a little more restrictive.`
` Unless it by itself denies witches, it will not be valid."`
`"............"`
`It's starting to get confusing, ...but it's more or less something like this.`
`For example, let's take one of the riddles in the past where I asked her to repeat something.`
`"The actual number of master keys is 5."`
`That had been to confirm that there really were 5 master keys, when she claimed there were no more than 5.`
`But since that by itself wouldn't deny witches, I can't say it in blue.`
`So, in order to speak in blue, I'd need to say something like this...`
`'The actual number of master keys was greater than 5.`
` The culprit entered or exited the room with that extra key!'`
`...Only then would the witch, who claimed that this was a closed room murder made with magic, be responsible for making a counterargument.`
`In other words, I can't demand that she repeat something that merely confirms the premises of my reasoning.`
`......That'll probably be a significant disadvantage for me.`
`Crap...`
` It's enough to make the red Beato used to toy with me until now look extremely merciful...`
`"...Damn it.`
` So even if I create a theory for a particular closed room and speak it in blue,`
` if Beato denies it at the very, very end, I won't even have time to create my next theory...?!`
` This rule's awful, horribly bad for me..."`
`"......Are you gonna surrender before the fight begins again?`
` Calm down.`
` No one said you could only use the blue once for each mystery.`
` Do you know what that means?"`
`"N-No.`
` ...What does it mean...?"`
`"In the pitiful way you've been fighting up until now, you've made a single theory, glanced at the witch's complexion,`
` and if that one didn't work, you'd then start making another theory.`
` You won't corner a witch like that."`
`"Then how should I fight...?`
` ......You don't mean..."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` ...You don't attack her riddles with a point.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~You assault them with a wall~ib~`
`.`
` You said so yourself in an earlier game, that the force of your reasoning should be like that."`
`Assault...with a wall.`
`That's right, I said so myself earlier.`
`Guessing and trying to expose the mystery is like trying to shoot a distant target with an arrow.`
`Until now, I've just been shooting off arrow after arrow,`
` asking the witch if I scored a hit,`
` and then preparing my bow again once I'm told that I've missed.`
`There's no way I'll hit at that rate...`
`Bullets might be a better example than arrows.`
`If you take one shot after another at a distant target with a handgun, you probably won't hit it easily.`
`...So how can you hit it?`
`If a handgun doesn't work,`
` ...use a shotgun!`
`Instead of a single bullet, beat her down with 'shot' comprised of countless projectiles at once...!`
`Shot scatters, so it impacts a wide area.`
`That makes it optimal for shooting small, fast targets like birds.`
`That's right, there's no rule that says I have to guess like a pistol, shooting one shot off at a time.`
`...Making a single theory and just hoping that it hits is no better than stopping your own thinking.`
`Blast away with a massive number of bullets, of guesses, and make them impact like a wall, so that only one of them hitting the target is enough.`
`"......Blue, huh...?`
` ...I get it.`
` If your red truth is a razor-sharp katana, then it looks like my blue is a shotgun.`
` No, ...a machine gun whose firepower'll turn the witch into a honeycomb."`
`"I see, so it's an awkward gun that fires many shots.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` That sort of crude analogy is just like you."`
`"The climax of a detective novel is always the same.`
` ...The famous detective gathers all the suspects at once and displays a single trail of logic that works splendidly.`
` Almost like William Tell spectacularly shooting through an apple with a single arrow.`
` That's why I mistakenly took that to be a virtue."`
`...It probably would be splendid.`
`If I could shoot through the truth with a single guess.`
`But, that isn't realistic.`
`Look at real wars.`
`Do they really have everyone pull long guns out of the trench, aim reeeally well, and take shots at each other one at a time?`
`They don't, right?!`
`They fire rapidly, they fire all over the place, they pin down the enemy with a barrage!`
`Reasoning is the same way.`
`Because of that weird virtue, I've been stuck thinking it's better to take one line of reasoning at a time.`
`We humans can fire off countless guesses and possibilities!`
`The bullet is the power of imagination.`
` Suspension of thought is a clogged barrel...!`
`The pathetic way I've been reasoning up until now is like a peashooter.`
`I've been so lame, weakly firing off shots, getting them denied in red, and then taking the next bullet and reloading.`
`My 'blue truth', which claims that humans and tricks are what's real,`
` will overpower its target, the illusion told by the witch, with its firepower and the force of what I can imagine...!`
`'!s0`
`Ushiromiya Battler's fighting style...!!`
`"......Thanks to you, I've figured out my true fighting style.`
` Thanks, Gretel!!"`
`"You're welcome."`
`"Makes me think of how pathetic I was before.`
` ...Yeah, it's like Beato said.`
` I've had a handicap up until now.`
` I'll acknowledge that...!!`
` New rule, understood!!`
` I have my own way of fighting!`
` I'll show you it!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` That willpower is good, I like it!`
` Then, try using it right away, this blue truth of yours...!!"`
`"...Yeah, I'll use it.`
` With this blue truth, I'll break apart your witch theory, which states that only a witch culprit was possible because everyone had alibis!!"`
`"This is my truth!`
`'!s0`
` Therefore, the true number of people on the island is 17!`
` By adding an unknown person X to that, it becomes 18 people.`
` By supposing that this person X exists, the crimes will be possible even if all 17 people have alibis!!"`
`"...In short, if you keep preventing us from meeting with Father, we will have to accept the following theory.`
` Simply put, Father is already dead.`
` But you're hiding that because you don't want the inheritance to be distributed."`
`".........`
`...Ridiculous."`
`"Th-That is correct, this is worse than ridiculous!!`
` I have never heard such an insult!!"`
`"It'd even be possible for us to check by force whether he's alive or dead, with the police there to witness it.`
` Isn't that right, Eva nee-san...?"`
`"...Y-Yes...`
` That's right, Nii-san.`
` There are all sorts of ways we could set you up.`
` We could easily arrange for a situation where you'd have to hold a meeting with Father under the supervision of a third party...!"`
`"Still,`
` I think that would bring a lot of shame to the Ushiromiya family.`
` That's why I'm making this proposal.`
` Here we have the responsibilities and duties of the caretaker.`
` And a penalty in the worst-case scenario.`
` If you consent to those terms, we'll be able to refrain from doing something like dragging Father outside."`
`"...Yeah, that's right, Aniki...`
` Didn't you just say it yourself...?`
` You're carrying out your natural duties as Dad's caretaker.`
` Kyrie's conditions shouldn't be anything to worry about, right?`
` Why this overreaction?"`
`"...Are you really that worried about having the position of Successor dragged out from under you if Dad dies something other than a natural death?"`
`"Or else, what?`
` Do you have some reason to think Father might die something other than a natural death...?"`
`"How could I?`
` ...I see, now I too understand how Father feels.`
` How pitiful his later years have been for him, unable even to die as he pleases."`
`"Yes, his later years truly have been pitiful.`
` ...And the thought that these 'later years' are already something of the past is exactly what we're suspecting."`
`"...You could completely clear this suspicion away just by letting us meet with Father.`
` ...So, even after being humiliated by us this much, you still won't allow us to meet with him, Krauss nii-san......?"`
`"............"`
`"Father is probably already dead.`
` The corpse may have been disposed of in absolute secrecy.`
` ...And after taking all of the wealth for yourself as Father's agent, `
`you will make it seem that he 'disappeared' until seven years pass, making Father a corpseless member of the deceased."`
`"......I'm sorry, but please don't take it badly, okay?`
` I'm just playing detective here."`
`"...H-How rude can one be?!!`
` You have no right to stay in this mansion!!`
` Leave immediately!!`
` I won't permit you to cross the threshold of this house again!!"`
`"It worked last year, but you've used up your luck if you thought it'd work this year too.`
` ...Father is in a bad mood, so he can't meet with us?`
` That was plenty suspicious last year, and yet you're doing it again."`
`"If you really wanted to fake being Father's agent and grab up all his assets, you should've done it a little more speedily,`
` making him disappear without waiting for today's family conference.`
` You really are naive, Krauss onii-sama..."`
`"......I have no idea what you are-"`
`"However!`
` ...If it's a fact that Father's in a bad mood,`
` and you're preventing us from meeting him as part of your responsibilities as his caretaker, then it's a very wonderful thing you're doing.`
` In that case, if you just accept our conditions, everything will be settled here and now."`
`"......After all, you care so greatly for Father, Krauss nii-san.`
` There's no way Father will die in a manner that leads to trouble during the autopsy."`
`"After all, Father hates hospitals, so he'll pass away in his study, right?`
` An autopsy will certainly be carried out no matter what happens.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ...The only way to ~ib~kill him without an autopsy~ib~ would be for him to disappear."`
`"......Enough, Kyrie-san. I think you've bullied Nii-san enough."`
`Eva rebuked Kyrie in an sickeningly kind voice.`
`...Considering the situation, that was impossible.`
`...Which is why it was sickening...`
`"I'm sure Nii-san has his own difficulties to worry about, as well as his pride.`
` True, Nii-san might consider that one of his natural duties,`
` but if you force him to put it on paper and assign penalties, `
`...I could hardly blame him for getting upset.`
` Don't you agree, Rosa...?"`
`"...Yes, that's right.`
` ......She might have made light of Krauss nii-san's pride as the eldest son a little too much.`
` ...I'd feel bad for him if we were to force him to sign a statement regarding the duties of the caretaker as Kyrie-san has laid them out."`
`"That's right.`
` You're doing a good job, Aniki.`
` Taking that into account, we might consider avoiding all that about signing strange papers and worst-case penalties...`
`and leave everything to you."`
`"...Y-You people......"`
`Not just Eva, but Rudolf and Rosa as well, with unnerving smiles on their faces as though they'd planned this beforehand, began closing in on Krauss.`
`They now understood perfectly how Kyrie had cornered Krauss...and exactly where she was prepared to compromise...`
`"...We were talking about a signed statement regarding the responsibilities of the caretaker.`
` But, even without signing such a thing, you can make it so that we'll never demand a meeting with Father again.`
` ...If you can prove your fitness as Father's caretaker with a form of guarantee other than a signed statement, that is."`
`"Are you telling me......to pay security money?`
` Hehheheheh, hahhahahahahaha...!`
` Hilarious!`
` Wahhahahahahahahahaha!"`
`"The security money will be paid to Eva-san, Rudolf-san, and Rosa-san, 3 billion yen each.`
` As a deposit, you will transfer ten percent of that, 300 million yen, before the year is out."`
`"9 billion?!`
` I don't have that kind of money!!!"`
`"After Father passes away, you should be able to work it out.`
` We've managed to investigate at least that far.`
` You should be able to handle the deposit of 900 million yen in your current financial situation."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"And it should even be possible for you to ~ib~borrow it from Father~ib~, right?`
` ...There's no need for obvious charades anymore."`
`"......H-How unpleasant.`
` Truly unpleasant...!!"`
`"I-It is at that!!`
` Even just the discussion of Father's inheritance was far too disrespectful!`
` Father is already dead?`
` My husband is hiding that and keeping all the money for himself?!`
` I have had enough of this!!`
` None of you are qualified to bear the name Ushiromiya any longer!!"`
`"Calm down, Natsuhi-san...!`
` We've all said all we need to!`
` Why don't we leave it at that for now...?!`
` This is happinin' all of a sudden and on a massive scale.`
` We might even be gettin' agitated ourselves!"`
`"Why don't we take a break for a while and cool our heads?`
` Krauss nii-san probably needs a little time himself.`
` Right, Krauss nii-san?"`
`".........Time...?`
` And why would I need something like that?"`
`"Don't worry, don't worry!`
` We aren't thinkin' of anythin' shady!`
` We're just so eager to see Father that we've started grumblin' a bit...!`
` And Krauss nii-san, I know reeeal well how you're dyin' to get back at us for the things we've said...!"`
`"If you're willin' to go so far, then you just need to let us meet with him!`
` Right?`
` Isn't that right?`
` You just got a bit stubborn, and it felt awkward to say you'd let us see him after sayin' we couldn't all those times.`
` Isn't that it?`
` Right? Right?"`
`"...I-It certainly does seem that my husband has lost his composure slightly, just like the rest of you have.`
` ...We were only refusing stubbornly out of respect for Father's desire not to meet with everyone."`
`".........`
`...Indeed, that's right.`
` It was turning into another sibling fight like the old days, and I started feeling stubborn as well.`
` ......Let us cool our heads.`
` ...I understand how much you all want to meet with Father.`
` ...I will pass that on to him.`
` ......I'll find some way to convince Father to meet with you.`
` ......Will that do?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` I think it'd be okay to give Krauss nii-san some time to persuade Father."`
`"Yep.`
` ...We're counting on you, Aniki.`
` Please persuade him to meet with us.`
` After all, you're Dad's caretaker."`
`"And as for persuading him, ...let's set a limit on it to sometime tonight, okay?`
` When tomorrow comes, we'll confirm Father's well-being, even if we have to break down the door to his study.`
` ......You have no problems with that, I take it?`
` Nii-san...?"`
`"...Do as you like.`
` I see, it seems even the time I've been given to persuade him is short.`
` ...Let us go, Natsuhi.`
` We shall ask him to join us for dinner at least."`
`"R-Right...!"`
`Krauss left the parlor with Natsuhi.`
`Once their footsteps disappeared,`
` Hideyoshi took a deep breath, smirking and flopping onto the sofa...`
`"......Kyrie-san,`
` ...you're...a frightenin' person."`
`"Sorry for speaking out of turn.`
` I apologize."`
`"...No, no. You didn't corner him like we'd originally planned, but in the end, this was even better.`
` ...Just like always, I've gotta bow my head to you..."`
`"But...can he really prepare 900 million...?`
` I believe we estimated that 750 million would be the most Krauss nii-san could afford with his current financial situation...`
` ...Isn't 900 million gouging him too much...?"`
`"If he can't do it, that's fine too.`
` If we do something like lowering it to 750 million so Krauss nii-san can save face, it'll look like we're compromising and it'll be easier to settle, right?`
` And if he really does come out with 900 million, that's even better."`
`"Nii-san is probably having a strategy meeting with Natsuhi-san about now.`
` ...It really will be interesting to see what kind of twisted logic our proud Nii-san comes up with as an excuse."`
`"Convince Father...?`
` There's no way he can."`
`There's no way to convince someone who isn't even there...!`
`"......The siblings have all come, despite their various circumstances, for this annual family conference."`
`Krauss and Natsuhi could be seen in Kinzo's dimly lit study.`
`Every once in a while, thunder could be heard, and the dimly lit room flickered with light.`
`...It seemed that the island would be closed off by the storm very soon.`
`"...Father...!`
` Please, just this once, show those disrespectful people the majesty of the Head...!"`
`"It's useless......"`
`The large shadow of a person standing by the window, his majestic back facing them,`
` ...answered quietly and forcefully.`
`He hung his head and shook.`
`...Eventually, they could hear a mumbling laugh over his shoulder.`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* Hahahahahaha!!`
` It's useless, it's all useless...!!`
` Wahhahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`......Three months left to live...?`
` An almost finished geezer...?`
`To whom exactly are you referring?`
`"You foooools!!`
` Did you wander over here because your siblings threatened you?`
` Know your shame!!"`
`As Kinzo turned and brushed his cape, it flashed forcefully through the room's stale air.`
`That air pressure truly signified Ushiromiya Kinzo's majesty and willpower itself.`
`After being blown back by that wind, it wasn't strange that Krauss landed on his butt.`
`As though showing consideration for Krauss, who looked as though his legs had been swept out from under him, Natsuhi also crouched down.`
`'!s0`
`...with a *thunk*, `
`...*thunk*, `
`Kinzo's footsteps approached with a heft that signified his dignity.`
`"...F-Father......"`
`"Yoou fooooooooool...!!`
` I heard from Kanon. Just how far did you pathetically let your siblings lead you around by the nose?!?!"`
`"F-Father...!`
` My husband is doing his best to protect your honor..."`
`Without lending an ear to Natsuhi's words, Kinzo extended his palm to Krauss's collar, as the latter sat on the floor.`
`...No, he curled his fingers, leaving only his pointer finger out, then took that finger and...`
`'!s0`
`...twisted it, `
`.........and slowly, `
`with just one finger, `
`...picked Krauss up into the air.`
`"...You really are a pathetic fooooooool.`
` ...You let your wife speak in your defense?`
` If you have an excuse, give it yourself!!"`
`"Gaggahh, .........gwah...!!"`
`Krauss clawed at the air.`
`Kinzo's brawny finger was choking him.`
`He couldn't even open his mouth, much less talk.`
`However, even if he had been able to open his mouth, `
`as he was now, there was no way he'd be able to think up an excuse that Kinzo would accept...`
`Still, ...how could this power be described...?`
`No one would call Kinzo an old man after seeing this superhuman strength...`
`"...Father...!!`
` My husband is fighting in his own way...!!`
` Please, forgive him...!!"`
`"......Natsuhii.`
` ...Fighting is a process you go through before winning.`
` ...The process you go through before losing isn't called fighting."`
`"That's called being pathetic!!`
` Wahhahahahahahahaha, you call this my successor?`
` Wahhahahahahahaha, wahhahhahhahahahahahahahhaaaaaaah!!"`
`As thunder roared, Kinzo laughed heartily as though nothing could be more pleasant.`
`And when he finished laughing, he threw his son away like he was scrap paper,`
` slamming him against the wall...`
`"Gwah, ...uuuuuuuuu..."`
`"Dear, dear...!! Are you okay..."`
`Krauss slid down the wall, rubbing his throat as though in pain...`
` Natsuhi ran up to him and looked after him...`
`But without showing any interest in the two of them, `
`Kinzo returned to the space near the window, as though he had been there the whole time, and looked up at the thunderclouds of misfortune.`
`"......I thought I would have no regrets in my life, if only I could meet Beatrice,`
` but it seems it won't go so smoothly.`
` ...It was promised from the beginning that nothing received from the witch would remain.`
` However, the Ushiromiya name is not the property of the witch.`
` ...Who is fit to succeed that name?`
` It seems that this alone must be resolved by my own hand.`
` ...Rejoice, Krauss!!`
` I have changed my mind."`
`"......F-Father...`
` ......So...?"`
`"I have no desire to have dinner with you cowards.`
` However, I will attend the family conference afterwards!"`
`"F-Father...`
` Thank you very much...!"`
`"There, I shall make a great announcement regarding the succession of the Head.`
` I will resolve your foolish quarrel myself!!`
` Uuhhahahahahahaha, waaahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahah!!!"`
`Forcefully opening the door with a clunk, Rosa flew in with Maria.`
`"Is Genji-san or anyone there...?!`
` It doesn't matter who, bring us a bath towel...!!"`
`There was already a full-blown typhoon outside, and it was starting to pour down hard.`
`Even though she'd had an umbrella, Maria had been in the rose garden amid all that wind and rain the whole time.`
`She had grown ice cold.`
`Maria had gotten into a minor fight with Rosa in the rose garden and had been told to stay there.`
`...She had done as she was told and had continued to wait in that spot, even though rain was pouring down.`
`Rosa certainly had gotten a little emotional and angry, `
`but Maria's stubborn whim was probably more to blame.`
`...The cousins, who had seen that exchange,`
` were relieved to see that mother and child were close to each other again.`
`Rosa scrubbed Maria's head with a towel.`
`She seemed overcome with worry that Maria had caught a cold, but Maria herself was nonchalant.`
`"Are you okay?`
` You didn't catch a cold, did you?`
` Maybe we really should go back for now and get a change of clothes..."`
`"Uu-, I'm just fine!`
` More importantly, I'm hungry, so food's better than changing clothes, uu-!"`
`"Hahahaha.`
` She looks okay, Aunt Rosa.`
` She's gotta be if she's this spirited."`
`"It's a really good thing she had an umbrella.`
` ...I was thinking she might be soaked to the bone.`
` The fact that she had an umbrella certainly is a silver lining."`
`"But Maria!`
` Even if you have an umbrella, you've gotta get to shelter when it starts raining so hard, okay?`
` Little girls definitely shouldn't let their bodies get cold."`
`"......Uu-."`
`"It's okay, Jessica-chan.`
` ...It's Mama's fault for telling her to stay there.`
` I'm really sorry, I'm really sorry...!!"`
`"Uu-!`
` I'm a good girl?`
` I'm a good girl for doing what Mama said?`
` I stayed there even though it was cold, stayed there until Mama came!`
` Uu-uu-!"`
`"Yes, you really are a good girl, Maria.`
` You did exactly what Mama said...`
` Very well done.`
` But next time, even if Mama tells you to do something, find some shelter if it starts raining like that.`
` Okay...?`
` Promise Mama."`
`"Uu-.`
` Promise Mama.`
` ...Uu-☆"`
`As Rosa gently held Maria, they joined their pinkies together and promised.`
`Battler and the others realized that by touching her mother's pinky, `
`the warmth had started to return to Maria's body.`
`"Kanon-kun, thanks for the towel.`
` That really helped."`
`"...Then, if you would excuse me."`
`As Kanon bowed with a blank expression, as though he'd done nothing that required gratitude, he left the parlor.`
`"...Okay, it's already dinnertime.`
` Let's all go together.`
` ...I'll even give Maria my dessert for being so good."`
`"Uu-!`
` Really Mama?!`
` Uu-uu-, get dessert, uu-uu-uu-♪`
` Love Mama, love Mama!"`
`"Hey, Maria, don't jump around.`
` Mama loves you too, Maria.`
` Love Maria, love Maria."`
`"I love Mama too, love Mama!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-!"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-uu-♪"`
`Rosa and Maria looked really close.`
` Even the cousins who watched started to feel a long-forgotten warmth fill up their chests.`
`"...You know, that might be the age when you're on your best terms with your parents."`
`"It wasn't like that for me.`
` Mom was always yelling at me to study, study, study."`
`"That's because they love their children.`
` A parent's love isn't always gentle and indulgent.`
` My mother was strict with me too, but now I realize that it was because she treasured me so."`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!`
` Love Mama, love Mama!"`
`"Love Maria, love Maria♪ So, shall we get some food?`
` Let's be friends and hold hands."`
`"Uu-!`
` Be friends and hold hands!`
` Mama and me, friends, friends♪"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` Mama and Maria are friends.`
` We'll aaalways be like this.`
` I love you, Maria..."`
`"......What's going on, all of a sudden?`
` ...What's up?"`
`The sudden sound had come from the teacup Gretel had been holding, which had fallen and smashed.`
`"......Sorry.`
` I got careless.`
` Sorry for dropping it."`
`The cup on the floor had smashed to pieces.`
`...Would it really have made such a sound and smashed to pieces just by being dropped from that height?`
`Even someone as thick-headed as Battler could realize that she was in a bad mood over something,`
` but he couldn't understand why she had suddenly grown so displeased.`
`When she made to bend over and pick up the fragments of the cup, Ronove appeared out of nowhere and stopped her.`
`"You will injure yourself.`
` Leave the cleaning up to me.`
` Shall I bring you another cup of black tea...?"`
`"...I don't need it.`
` ......I guess a demon's black tea just doesn't match my tastes."`
`"Hoh.`
` To think there's someone whose tastes aren't satisfied even by Ronove's tea.`
` I must respect your discerning palate."`
`"......I'm getting bored, so I'll go out for a second."`
`"Bored?`
` Wait a sec, this is where things start to get interesting.`
` About now, Maria is probably going to say that she got an umbrella and a letter from Beatrice again, right?`
` This is the essential part..."`
`"Excuse me.`
` Sorry, I'm counting on you to clean this up."`
`"Leave it to me."`
`Without saying anything else, Gretel disappeared of her own accord.`
` Her form literally melted and disappeared into thin air...`
`There was definitely a displeased expression on her face.`
`But neither Battler nor Ronove, and of course, not Beato either, could understand why her mood had so suddenly worsened.`
`All that remained was the scent of the black tea she'd spilled...`
`......I don't like it.`
`No, to be more blunt, it disgusts me.`
`"Uu-...?`
` ...Why are you so irritated, Ange...?"`
`"Why, you say?!`
` Isn't it obvious...?"`
`"Uu-.`
` ...I don't understand..."`
`Even Maria onee-chan, with that blank expression on her face, ...irritated me.`
`As I held my hands palms up in the empty air, from out of nowhere, a single book landed on them.`
`......It was Maria onee-chan's diary.`
`Even though I didn't turn the pages, the pages were flipped through, despite there being no wind,`
` and the door to Maria onee-chan's world opened.`
`"...Why do you think I'm not happy, Ange?"`
`"......Think about it objectively."`
`"By objectively, you mean from your viewpoint, right?"`
`".........`
`...Are you trying to say that the truth is different for me and you, Maria onee-chan?"`
`"Truth can change its form depending on the observer.`
` And observers from the future always overwrite that form.`
` ......Ange, what are you trying to do to my happiness...?"`
`"............"`
`The pages of the diary were flipped through at greater and greater speeds...`
` Then, a brilliant light poured out from the depths of the diary, ...swallowing everything up and painting over everything with white.`
`"......Sorry, Maria.`
` Mama has to take care of some urgent business that's piled up, so I need to stay holed up at the company for a while.`
` ...I probably won't be able to come back home until late at night the day after tomorrow."`
`"...Uu-.`
` ...Then, what about your promise to go to the movies with me on Sunday...?"`
`"The movies...?`
` Umm-"`
`Judging by Rosa's tone, she had clearly forgotten that promise.`
`But Maria's response to that was an apology for asking...`
`......I'm sorry.`
`Maria apologized for troubling her mother by asking that question...`
`"......I'll stay home.`
` I'll definitely wait patiently.`
` ...I'll take a bath every day and change my underwear.`
` ...And I know where the money is.`
` ......I'll go to a different store every day.`
` I'll try not to go out too late.`
` If a policeman asks, I'll say I'm running errands for Mama.`
` ...I'll do what Mama says, like Mama says."`
`"............`
`...That's right.`
` You really are being a good girl.`
` If you do that, I'll buy you a present.`
` Okay?`
` Go to bed by 9:00.`
` You mustn't tell the teacher or any adults that Mama isn't coming home.`
` Okay...?"`
`".........Yes.`
` ...So Mama, do your best at work.`
` ...Do your best, finish your work, ...and come back as soon as you can...`
` I...won't cry all night and annoy the neighbors anymore...`
` ...So come back quickly......"`
`"......`
`...Well then, I'm busy, so I'll hang up.`
` ...Be a good girl and wait.`
` Don't do anything you shouldn't.`
` Goodbye."`
`*click*.`
` ...With a tone of finality in her voice, Rosa hung up the phone without waiting for Maria's answer.`
`Maria politely set down the receiver and returned to the sofa.`
`There sat the stuffed animal Sakutaro, with whom she'd been watching TV until a second ago.`
`Sakutaro was holding the remote control to the TV.`
`...The TV had been turned off because of the phone call.`
`He looked like he was telling her to push the switch because he wanted to watch TV again quickly.`
`"......Sakutaro,`
` ...wanna watch...TV?"`
`『...Uryu?`
` You don't want to watch anymore, Maria...?`
` If the actors' team gets all the questions right, they can still make a huge comeback.`
` Uryu-!』`
`"......No.`
` ......That's enough...TV."`
`Again, ...Mama was busy with her work and didn't come home.`
`Mama works so much overtime that she doesn't come home until late.`
`...Because she has 'dates' or something, she always comes home after drinking a lot of alcohol, even though she's not good at drinking,`
` and with a pale face, she'll go straight into the shower and then to bed.`
`And because she has overtime even on the weekends or something, she says she has to spend the night there, and almost never comes home.`
`...Recently, she started saying something about how she's got a big job she's working on, so this sort of thing happens a lot...`
`...The pictures I did my best on during drawing time were laughed at by everyone,`
` but even so, I wanted to show them just to Mama, ...and once again, she won't be able to look at them for me.`
`And I could talk about the time everyone pushed the job of cleaning up onto me, but I did my best by myself and was praised by the teacher.`
`Or the time I went shopping, and the man at the shop said I'm always such a good kid and gave me a free canned coffee.`
`Then there was the time I wanted to encourage Mama because she worked so hard on her job...`
`and hid a card for her under her pillow.`
`"......And there's a lot...of other things...I wanted to talk about."`
`『......Mama's working really hard at her job.`
` She's working with all of her strength so that we can eat every day.』`
`"...I hate her job.`
` ...If only she'd just quit."`
`『A job is an important thing for adults to do.`
` ...It lets Maria eat, `
`buys clothes, `
`pays for school lunches, `
`and pays the deposit for summer camp.`
` ...All that happens because Mama works and earns money.』`
`".........`
`...I don't need food.`
` Don't need clothes.`
` Don't need school lunches and don't want to go to summer camp.`
` ...It's not like any of the groups will let me join in."`
`『Uryu...`
` ...Just now, on the phone, Mama promised that she'd buy a present when she comes back from work, right?`
` I think she made that promise because you're important to her, Maria, `
`and she'd feel bad if she made you lonely.』`
`"...You think so?"`
`『Uryu!`
` It definitely isn't a pain for her, or annoying, or anything!`
` ...Mama also wants to be by your side all the time, Maria.`
` ...It's also painful and sad for her, since she can't do that.`
` ......I remember when she spent the whole night by your side, crying.』`
`"......Yeah.`
` ...I didn't understand why she was crying, ...but she was so sad,`
` ...and I couldn't do anything but stay silent by her side."`
`『I remember the last thing Mama said then.`
` ...She said 'Thank you, Maria'.`
` ......She said that just by being by her side, you were her only ally in the world.`
` ...Uryu, do you remember?』`
`"Yeah...`
` ......I'm her only ally in the world, `
`...she said."`
`Sakutaro set the remote control on the table, crawled up onto the sofa,`
` sat on my lap, ...and spoke to me, gazing into my eyes.`
`『...I'm sure Mama feels the same way you do, Maria.`
` ......The designs Mama draws are the only ones laughed at by her clients.`
` ...Only Mama's company has troublesome jobs pushed onto it by other companies.`
` Mama is the president, so she has to take care of everything by herself.`
` ...Only Mama's company never gets included in the business of other companies.`
` ......Mama's only ally is Maria.`
` ...If you tell her to stop doing her job, ...where in the world could she find an ally......?』`
`"......Nnng, `
`......Sakutaro..."`
`『The only person I have in the whole world is Maria.`
` ...The only person Mama has in the whole world is Maria.`
` ......What about you, Maria?』`
`"...I've got Mama, and I've got you too, Sakutaro..."`
`『So, Maria, you aren't lonely at all!`
` Uryu!』`
`"......Uu-."`
`『Since Mama's busy with her work, she can't be together with you very often, but please, don't blame her for that, Maria.`
` ...In exchange, I'll always be here, will be by your side forever.`
` ......So don't cry, okay...?`
` ......Uryu...`
` Can't your sadness be stopped......if I'm with you...?』`
`"......Uuu, ...uuuuuuuuuuu, Sakutaro...`
` ...Uuuuuuuuu!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaahhh, waaaaaaaaaaaahhh..."`
`......From the corner of Maria's heart, which she had been doing her best to seal up, ...drops of sadness finally dripped down.`
` ...*drip*drip*.`
` *drop*drop*.`
`...*drip*drop*drip*drop*.`
`...Even though weekends when Mama didn't come home weren't that rare a thing.`
`...It wasn't as though that night was particularly painful or sad compared to other nights.`
`...And yet, Maria's tears poured down.`
`『Uryu-...!`
` Maria, don't cry...`
` I'll always be with you...`
` Even if you cry, Maria, I won't.`
` I'm a lion cub, so I won't cry even if I'm lonely.`
` ...Even though I want to cry too, I won't...!』`
`"Why won't you cry, Sakutaro...?`
` Even though you're so sad that you can't hold back the tears, you won't cry...?"`
`『Uryu.`
` But if I cry, who will make you feel better...?`
` So I won't.`
` After all, I want to get your spirits up.』`
`"If I get my spirits up, ...will Mama come back...?"`
`『When Mama comes back, if she's welcomed by a happy Maria, ...I'm sure she'll be happy.`
` Uryu.』`
`"...Mama...will be happy...?"`
`『Uryu.`
` If you do that, then I'm sure her fatigue from work will also be healed.`
` Then, I'm sure she'll start feeling better sooner and will play with you a lot.』`
`"............"`
`『When you come home and Mama's waiting for you there, and she's in the kitchen in high spirits, don't you feel really happy?`
` I'm sure Mama feels the same way.』`
`"...So if I watch over the house in high spirits, ...Mama will be happy too?"`
`『Uryu!』`
`Sakutaro nodded deeply with his big head.`
`The tears couldn't keep falling from Maria's eyes.`
`...If she greeted Mama with a tear-stained face, Mama would probably get sad too.`
`『You know about it, Maria.`
` You can't use the magic that creates smiles if you aren't smiling too.』`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...I know.`
` So, I won't cry anymore."`
`『Hey, Maria.`
` I have an idea for how to have a fun time.`
` ...Uryu, wanna hear it?』`
`"...What?"`
`『Mama won't come back until late night Sunday.`
` So let's have a pajama party and keep it a secret from Mama.』`
`"A pajama party...?"`
`『Until you get tired late tonight, eat candy and drink soda in bed, and play with me.』`
`"A pajama party.`
` ...Yeah, sounds fun.`
` ...I don't have to go to bed at 9:00, right?`
` Mama won't get mad if I don't sleep?"`
`『This is a secret between me and you, only for when Mama isn't around.`
` So tonight, until you get sleepy, let's have fun the whole time.`
` Let's eat jellybeans and try to guess what color we'll get next.`
` Let's split open peanuts and try to guess which half is the Grandpa.`
` Let's search for treasure in the closet.`
` And more, and more!`
` I wonder what it'll taste like if we mix cola and melon soda.』`
`"Uu-.`
` I wanted to try it once, but asked Mama if it was okay and she got mad."`
`『Uryu-!`
` Let's keep it a secret from Mama and try it out♪`
` Tonight, let's play a lot, laugh a lot, and blow away our tears with happiness.`
` Don't worry, it'll definitely be fun if I'm here!`
` I'll definitely make you happy, Maria.』`
`"Yeah, yeah!`
` It'll definitely be fun if Sakutaro's there.`
` I'll definitely be happy.`
` Thank you, Sakutaro.`
` I won't cry anymore.`
` Let's play all we can, get happy all we can, and say welcome back when Mama gets home."`
`『Uryu-!`
` Tonight, let's play a lot and feel a lot better♪`
` Let's have the kind of secret party we can only have when Mama isn't here.`
` If we're noisy enough, I'm sure plenty of friends will come to play from the land of the looking glass and wonderland.`
` Then, we'll have so many friends that we won't be able to get bored.`
` Uryu-!』`
`"Uryu-!!"`
`...Then, Maria began her pajama party all alone with Sakutaro, having fun until late into the night.`
`She played by sticking her hand into the bag of jellybeans without looking, trying to guess which color she'd pull out next.`
`...Sakutaro had good intuition and got it right a lot.`
`Maria also had a brilliant streak where she guessed right four times in a row.`
`The game where she split peanuts open and tried to guess which was the Grandpa...`
`was easier than guessing the color of the jellybeans, so she got it right a lot.`
`Sucking her salt-covered fingers was impolite, but that was the yummiest part.`
`She liked both cola and melon soda on their own.`
`She hoped that by mixing her two favorite drinks, there might be a flash of light like alchemy,`
` and a new drink that no one had ever tasted before would be created.`
`She got excited about how, if it turned out really delicious, she'd call it Sakutaro Soda and sell it.`
`But, unexpectedly, it had a weird taste that she hadn't hoped for.`
`And the color was somewhat dull and thick.`
`...Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised that black and green mixed together would make this.`
`...Too bad. I imagined that it'd become a sparkling pineapple color.`
`But, it was an awesome, incredible, fun night.`
`If it's this fun here, maybe Mama will feel like coming home and drop by out of the blue.`
`...So, I got the feeling that Mama might suddenly come home and went to the front door many times to check, `
`but there was no way Mama would be able to come home when she was this busy with work.`
`But rather than a feeling of loneliness, `
`it felt just a little disappointing that Mama couldn't join in on this fun late-night party.`
`Sometime soon, I'll do this when Mama is around and let her join in.`
`Mama likes some things I don't think are yummy,`
` so maybe she'll really like Sakutaro Soda.`
`When Mama comes back tired, I'll serve her some.`
`And more than anything.`
`...I want to at least write about this fun night in a letter and tell Mama about it.`
`So that these feelings of happiness will reach Mama too.`
`Her work is always so tough and she comes home so tired, so I hope I can share this happiness with her.`
`Mama will almost certainly come home tired late Sunday night,`
` and I hope I can brighten her day even just a little by sharing this happiness...`
`I gently placed that letter on Mama's desk.`
`'To Mama.`
` Good job with your work again today☆ Let me share my happiness with you.`
` ——From Maria'`
`Then, I decided to give a present to Sakutaro for proposing this wonderful party.`
`It was a small, red muffler I found when searching for treasure in the closet.`
`When I was still very young, Mama knitted this tiny thing.`
`'Maria' was embroidered on it with knitting wool.`
`...I softly wrapped that muffler around Sakutaro.`
`It really suited him, accenting his yellow with red very well.`
`『......Uryu.`
` ...Does it look good on me...?』`
`Sakutaro looked embarrassed as he wore his first present ever.`
`...Yeah.`
` It really looks good on him.`
`"Uu-.`
` Sakutaro, thank you so much for everything.`
` It was so fun tonight.`
` I can't even remember why I was crying.`
` ...Let's be together from now on.`
` And let's always play and laugh together."`
`『Uryu-!`
` Love you, Maria!』`
`"Me too.`
` Love you, Sakutaro."`
`After playing so wildly, Maria's room was a mess.`
`Maybe she played a little too much.`
`...But I'm tired for today, so let's sleep together.`
`And tomorrow, we'll clean up together and welcome Mama with a clean room.`
` ...All right, Sakutaro?`
`Uryu-♪`
`"...See?`
` I am...no, we are so happy, right?"`
`"......`
`Is this your happiness, Maria onee-chan...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I'm happy."`
`"...Even though you were looking forward to that movie so much, and Aunt Rosa promised that she'd definitely take you, she completely forgot."`
`"She just happened to forget because she was so busy with work.`
` ...Even if she remembered, with her work, there'd be nothing she could do.`
` Whether she remembered or not, Mama would've spent the night at work.`
` She couldn't go to the movies.`
` ......Whether she remembered or not is a minor issue."`
`...There's no way that's a minor issue.`
`After all, ...when Aunt Rosa answered 'Movie?' on the phone, `
`it was obvious that she'd completely forgotten her promise.`
`And when she heard that, Maria onee-chan's mood definitely darkened.`
`"Well, ...like you say, `
`even if Aunt Rosa had remembered her promise, you wouldn't have been able to go to the movies in the end.`
` ...But even so.`
` ...To think that your mother just forgot her promise to spend one of her few days off with you, ...it's sad.`
` I'd be mad."`
`"............`
`...Yeah.`
` It was sad.`
` Because even if she had remembered, we wouldn't have been able to go to the movies.`
` ...But after that, I had a very, very fun night with Sakutaro.`
` You must've thought that pajama party looked really fun too, Ange."`
`".........`
`There's no way that would be fun.`
` ...I mean, all that messing around you did that night...`
`was just intentionally making a big fuss about nothing, all so you could forget that you were lonely and that your mother wasn't coming home."`
`"That's not true.`
` I really did have a fun party with Sakutaro."`
`"No, that's wrong!`
` You were just so sad, and you hated your mother so much for forgetting her promise, that you made a mess of your room...!!"`
`"......Where was something like that ever written in my diary?"`
`"It isn't written anywhere!`
` But...by reading in the gaps between every line, I can understand your feelings!`
` You didn't have a good time at all that evening!`
` And you stayed up late when you were told not to, broke the strict rule about eating sweets outside of snack time, `
`...and when even that didn't bury your sadness, you went wild in your room......and made a mess of it, right...?!!`
` And after you made a mess of your room and were all tired out, `
`......all you did was claw at the bed sheets and cry yourself to sleep, right...?!"`
`"......The diary does say that Mama probably forgot her promise about the movie...`
`and that I stayed up late having a pajama party with Sakutaro...and made a mess of my room searching for treasure."`
`"Yes.`
` And......this is what it means!`
` You were starving for Aunt Rosa's love, Maria onee-chan...!`
` And Aunt Rosa always put her work and her public image first, always keeping you on the back-burner...!"`
`"That's what disgusts me!`
` Because I know just how superficial Aunt Rosa's words of love for you were!!`
` You should realize this yourself!"`
`"So, ...how can you say you're happy despite that?!`
` I don't understand...that part of you, Maria onee-chan!!`
` Even at my age, I can't understand it at all...!!`
` Why aren't you sad?`
` Why is it that you can experience a reality filled with misfortune and can call yourself happy?!`
` I can't do it, I can't understand it...!!"`
`"......You're a sad kid, Ange."`
`"I don't get it!!`
` Why are you pitying me?!"`
`"......Even though a 'fact' about a really fun pajama party is written about in my diary,`
` ......if the same 'fact' is observed by different people, it has a different form."`
`I remembered talking about something like this with Bernkastel.`
`Truth is unfixed and changes its form every time it's witnessed.`
`By the way it's perceived...in other words, depending on the person who perceives it, a single truth becomes different truths.`
`And truths of the past are painted over by truths of the future...`
`"In this diary, I wrote that what happened that night was very, very fun."`
`"...You described the events of that night as something very happy."`
`"And yet, when you read the diary, the events of that night sound very, very sad."`
`"...Even though you describe it as a happy scene, I read between the lines and realized that that wasn't true."`
`"Stop it."`
`"............"`
`"This...tells of a happy night.`
` ......This is...the 'truth' of that night.`
` Please, don't take this happy truth...`
`...and paint over it with a new, different truth."`
`"......Are you...happy with this, Maria onee-chan?"`
`"Yes.`
` I'm happy.`
` ......That's why I feel sad for you, since you wouldn't be able to feel happiness in a similar situation."`
`......Right now, I'm like she was then...`
` Just as isolated, with no friends.`
`Ange...had accepted her isolated reality for what it was.`
`But Maria...painted over her isolated reality with a reality of happiness.`
`Ushiromiya Maria took a sad truth...`
`and changed it into happiness.`
`That was...`
`the only, and yet very large, ...difference between me and Maria onee-chan.`
`And, even though I'm unable to accept it, `
`...I'm also jealous of that power.`
`"Yes.`
` ...That's right.`
` This is 'power'.`
` ...I was able to find happiness with that power.`
` Because you don't have that power, you can't find happiness, Ange."`
`"What......is...`
`...that power......?"`
`"I didn't know what to call that power either.`
` ...Not at this point in time, at least.`
` ...Eventually, I was taught its true form.`
` ...I'll talk about it later.`
` On the next page.`
` ......So then, so then, late Sunday night,`
` Mama came back with a present, just like she'd promised..."`
`"......I'm back."`
`"Mama, welcome hoooooooome!!"`
`『Uryu-!!`
` Mama came back, Mama came back!』`
`Waiting to greet Rosa as she returned home all tired out...`
`was Maria, in an unbelievably good mood, holding Sakutaro.`
`Most likely, Rosa's worn-out expression was partly because she really was tired, `
`...but partly because it would be a pain when Maria, who should've been grumbling after staying home alone for several days, would cling to her, sobbing.`
`However, when she was welcomed by an unbelievably happy Maria...`
`and found that her fears were unbelievably needless, Rosa couldn't hide her surprise.`
`"Wh-What's going on, Maria...?`
` You're in a great mood...?!`
` Is someone here...?!"`
`It was strange enough to make Rosa think that a friend had come over, and that she'd come home right when they were having a good time playing together.`
`But there were no other shoes by the entrance.`
`...Even though Maria was in such high spirits, she had been home alone.`
`At first, Rosa was suspicious that the cause of this unexpected good mood could be nothing good,`
` but that really was a needless fear, ...and in any event, Maria really had been in a good mood while she watched over the house.`
`......Even if Rosa's heart had been as cold and hard as a rock, ...after being welcomed with a smile like this...`
`Rosa started to honestly accept that smile, and a smile rose to her own face automatically.`
`...In that smile, you could no longer see any of the weariness of someone who'd been unable to return home for several days.`
`Maria kept talking about what a fun time she'd had playing with her stuffed animal, Sakutaro.`
`Rosa really hadn't imagined that the stuffed animal she herself had given would be so appreciated, and she couldn't hide her pleased surprise.`
`"I see.`
` So you spent the time together with Sakutaro.`
` Well done, Maria.`
` Here's a present for Maria and Sakutaro for being so good."`
`『Uryu-!`
` A present!`
` A present!』`
`"Uu-!`
` What is it, what is it?!"`
`Both Maria and Sakutaro started jumping around.`
`There were two presents.`
`One contained an assortment of Western sweets.`
`Inside was a Scotch cake.`
`It looked to be of very high quality.`
`But Maria was more interested in the other one.`
`The other one was an even bigger box, and it was pretty heavy.`
`"Go ahead and open it.`
` They might become new friends for you and Sakutaro, okay?"`
`"Waaaaaaaaaahhh...!`
` What's this?!`
` What's this?!!"`
`Inside, laid there like chess pieces, were about 20 small ceramic figures shaped like animals.`
`Squirrels, rabbits, small birds, dogs and cats.`
`And they were all holding musical instruments.`
`In addition to them, there was also a panorama-style background.`
`A forest scene was drawn on it.`
`The small forest animals were gathered in a plaza and looked like they were having a good time.`
`Rosa set it up on the table.`
`...And when she then lined up the ceramic figures like chess pieces in front of it, `
`......it became a band of forest animals.`
`"Isn't it wonderful?`
` I saw it in a store window, and I was taken with it at a glance.`
` This is a present for you for being such a good girl home alone, Maria."`
`"Uuuu---!!!`
` Thank you, Mama!!!`
` Awesome, Sakutaro!`
` Look how much our friends have grown...!`
` It's just like you said, Sakutaro.`
` It was true that if we had a fun, noisy time, we'd get more friends...!"`
`『Right, didn't I tell you?`
` Look, we have more friends, look, we have more friends!`
` Uryu-♪』`
`Relieved that her gift had been appreciated, `
`Rosa remembered that she'd been filled with several days of weariness...`
`"Mama, you really worked hard...!`
` Go take a shower.`
` If you take a hot one, I'm sure your weariness will go away.`
` Wanna take a bath?`
` I'll choose what to put in the bath today!"`
`"Thank you.`
` But it's already late, so get ready to go to bed.`
` Mama is tired, so I'll just take a shower and go to sleep.`
` I have to get up early tomorrow."`
`"Yeah, got it!`
`"I can do it myself...`
` ...Oh, thank you."`
`"Mama, your coat is full of smells from outside.`
` ...Uu-?`
` Oh, sorry, something fell out.`
` I'll pick it up, okay?"`
`When she took Rosa's coat, a receipt or ticket stub or something fell out.`
`...It had been in Mama's pocket, so it was probably important.`
`Maria hurriedly picked it up...`
`It looked like a ticket for the Green Car or the Shinkansen or something.`
`......Atami?`
`Wasn't that a place famous for its hot springs...?`
`At that moment,`
` ...with a razor-sharp sound, the warm atmosphere shattered.`
`Instead of the Rosa who had been there just a second ago, enjoying the gift with her daughter and recovering from her weariness with a long-awaited return home,`
` ......there stood a person who looked exactly the same, but who had a completely different, terrifying expression on her face.`
`...In her hand was the ticket stub that Maria had picked up.`
`...She had stolen it from Maria's hand in an instant.`
`Just a few seconds too late, `
`'!s0`
`and her mother's expression, `
`Maria realized that she must have done something wrong.`
`But she didn't know what she had done that had gotten her in trouble.`
`...It was probably because of that ticket stub-like thing.`
`Was she not supposed...to touch it......?`
`Even though she had tried so hard to welcome Mama with fun and happiness,`
` ...she had touched something important to Mama without asking, and had ruined that pleasant atmosphere...`
`...So Maria apologized immediately.`
`"...S-Sorry......"`
`"......!`
` ......"`
`Even though she must have heard those words of apology, Rosa's expression actually darkened.`
`...Maybe those weren't the words she had been hoping for.`
`Maria didn't know what to do...and stared at her mother's reaction...`
`Then, even though it should've been such an important ticket stub, `
`Rosa crushed it up and hurried off to her room...`
`Maria...didn't really understand what she had done wrong...`
`"......Uu-...`
` ...I must've...`
`...done something I shouldn't have...`
` ...That paper must've been something important for Mama's work.`
` And I touched it without asking..."`
`『Uryu...`
` ...You didn't do anything wrong, Maria......`
` ...That's why tonight was so very happy.』`
`"Yeah.`
` ...Happy."`
`『And when Mama takes a bath and clears her head, she'll go back to being the normal, nice Mama.`
` So you mustn't worry about it.`
` Uryu.』`
`"You're right...`
` Mama's tired too.`
` ...Uu-, mustn't worry about it.`
` After all, we were so happy tonight."`
`『Uryu.』`
`"......Just stop it.`
` ...I can't watch this."`
`"You're the one who's wrong, Onee-chan!!`
` How can you call this happiness...?!!`
` It's so...pitiful that I can't watch anymore!!"`
`"What is...?`
` That Mama suddenly got mad?`
` ......That happens sometimes when humans get tired.`
` ...Condemning a person because of a momentary misplaced emotion isn't very adult of you, Ange."`
`"...I can't believe I'm hearing this from a nine year old...`
` But that's not the problem!`
` That ticket stub you picked up was clearly strange!"`
`"What was?`
` There was nothing strange about it, and it has nothing to do with the happiness of that night, right...?"`
`"Aunt Rosa called because she'd be staying over at her company because of work, right?!`
` Why Atami?!`
` Isn't that what you call a vacation?!`
` It means she left you and went on a vacation, right?!`
` And you normally don't go on a vacation by yourse-"`
`"Even if that was a ticket for Atami,`
` that alone doesn't make it proof that Mama lied and went on a vacation, right...?"`
`"She lied on the phone, and then she changed her expression so drastically and grabbed it from you!`
` What more proof could you want...?!!"`
`"......It might have been from a business trip long ago, right?`
` Or maybe she just happened to pick up some trash and put it in her pocket.`
` It might've been a receipt from someone who worked for her, who went on a business trip.`
` ...In that case, it would be important for her work.`
` It wasn't a toy, so I can understand why Mama took it away.`
` ...This evidence you're talking about is only circumstantial.`
` Imagination and delusions.`
` ......I don't know why you're interpreting it in a way that makes our relationship worse."`
`"I'm the one who doesn't understand why you're interpreting it in a way that's so convenient for Aunt Rosa!!"`
`"......As I thought, you're a pitiable child, Ange.`
` ......Even though there are so many Fragments lying about you that could make you happy,`
` you can't find them."`
`"...Instead, you only look at unhappy Fragments and continue to get hurt.`
` ...That's why you're scared of being hurt...`
`and only start looking for happiness after you check to make sure there's nothing around you that could hurt you."`
`".........When I talk with you, Onee-chan, it gets hard to tell which one of us isn't making sense."`
`"You know what?`
` There are lots of happy and unhappy Fragments, and they fill the world up.`
` So people who can't find happiness right beside them won't be able to find it no matter how hard they look.`
` ...Like Tyltyl and Mytyl searching for the blue bird."`
`"......Oh yeah.`
` That story with a moral."`
`"You're the complete opposite, Ange.`
` You're searching for a world without a Fragment of unhappiness.`
` But that's the same as the blue bird.`
` So you'll be unable to find your happiness for all eternity.`
` ......Is Battler Hansel?`
` Or is he the blue bird...?"`
`"...Give it a rest already.`
` ......In any event, I understand that a night of happiness was wasted because of a single scrap of paper."`
`"It sure is scary.`
` That a single scrap of paper could do that.`
` ...In that case, maybe the power to get your happiness back can also lie in a single scrap of paper, right?"`
`Just when she'd finally been able to communicate with Maria after so long...`
`Rosa's face twisted with a mixture of anger, sadness, and a fierce self-hatred as she flew into her room and closed the door.`
`......Maria's 'sorry' had sliced into her chest sharper than a knife.`
`At that time, `
`...she noticed a cute envelope placed on her study table.`
`It was probably something that had come with a girls' magazine.`
`......To Mama:`
` Let me share my happiness with you, ...it said.`
`She took it, ......and after hesitating, opened it...and read what was inside.`
`............`
`'!s0`
`drip down the paper, `
`...she flew out of the room, `
`hugged Maria from behind as she headed for the bathroom, `
`......buried her face into her daughter's back...`
`and cried.`
`'!s0`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`she apologized.`
`Why is Mama apologizing...?`
` There was no answer to that question...`
`"......Look.`
` We already made up.`
` ......Something like that was absolutely nothing to worry about, because of the friendship Mama and I share."`
`".........`
`......To me, your happiness is...too painful, Maria onee-chan."`
`"...I understand how you feel, more or less.`
` ...Before I realized I had that 'power',`
` ...even I was a pitiful child who could only find Fragments filled with misfortune, just like you are now."`
`"......What is that 'power'?`
` This power that I don't have, but you do...`
` ...Are you saying that I'm unfortunate and you're blessed because I don't have that?`
` ......Just what is this thing you can't describe except with an abstract word like 'power'...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` You do want to know that, Ange.`
` ...That's why you've been reading my story so far.`
` ......Of course, I'll teach you.`
` I'll show you the secret to that power.`
` ...And it's something I taught you about long ago, when you were little, right...?`
` Did you forget...?"`
`"It's okay, I remember.`
` ...Now I...`
`...no, she.`
` She will teach you."`
`"......She...?`
` Who's that?"`
`"I shall teach you in MARIA's place."`
`'!s1`
`Beatrice........."`
`"The 'power' MARIA has, but you do not."`
`"Yeah.`
` The 'power' I have, but Ange doesn't."`
`——It's...magic.`
`Maria and Beato said it together.`
`And then they started giggling because they'd said it at the same time.`
`...It was an innocent reaction, one that didn't seem like Beato at all.`
`Black tea was arranged on a table in a peaceful garden,`
` and Beato, Maria, and Sakutarou, who was sitting on Maria's lap, were having fun chatting...`
`"......Hoh.`
` I see, he is called Sakutarou.`
` So this is your best friend!"`
`『Uryu...`
` Nice to meet you, I'm Sakutarou...』`
`"Uu-, Sakutaro's shy, so he's nervous.`
` It's okay, Beatrice is also a great friend of mine...!"`
`『Uryu.`
` Are Maria's friends...my friends...?』`
`"Yeah!"`
`『Uryu. ...Then, am I Beatrice's friend too?』`
`"Yeah!"`
`『Uryu-!』`
`"...Maria, does something like this happen frequently for you in your everyday life?"`
`"Uu-?`
` What?"`
`"Is breathing a spirit of magic into inorganic matter and giving it life like this...`
`commonplace in your everyday life?"`
`"...Uu-.`
` Sakutaro isn't inorganic matter, he's a lion cub."`
`『Uryu-!』`
`"Hmm...`
` ...A stuffed animal makes for an excellent vessel.`
` It is not uncommon for spirits to be made to reside in them...when they are spoken to by innocent children with no toxin."`
`According to Beatrice, every time a child plays with dolls,`
` the dolls actually gain a will and converse with them, sometimes even moving by their own will.`
`However, because of their innocence, the power imbued into such a vessel is very weak.`
`If they get struck with even a tiny bit of the toxin from a Human's common sense, which says that there's no way a doll can talk or move,`
` they instantly revert to being non-speaking dolls...`
`"However, ...this Sakutarou stuffed animal of yours is different."`
`"Uu-!`
` Sakutaro is a stuffed animal, but he isn't ooone!"`
`『Uryu-!`
` I'm a lion cub!`
` Ro-, ro-, ...uryu-!』`
`"Sakutaro is a lion cub, but he's still a kid, so he can't roar sometimes.`
` Uryuuryuuryu♪"`
`『Uryuuryuuryu-!』`
`Gazing at Maria, who was playing around with Sakutaro by the table loaded with tea, Beatrice let out a sigh of admiration.`
`"......How incredible.`
` This Sakutarou, with a cloth and cotton vessel as a shell, has completely materialized into the human world.`
` He has his own personality, talks with the summoner freely, `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~and even moves by his own will~ib~`
`."`
`"...And even more surprising...is that Maria did not summon him using the name of a person from another world, `
`but created him out of the sea of zero."`
`After that, Maria boasted to Beato that Sakutarou wasn't her only friend, and that she had many more of them back at home.`
`It seemed there were other similar stuffed animals and dolls who could talk and move of their own will like Sakutarou.`
`It was something natural for Maria.`
`It was natural for stuffed animals to talk, move, and become her friends of their own will.`
`...When she saw that Maria accepted this as something natural, as a witch, Beatrice felt a respect bordering on awe.`
`"......Maria,`
` without a doubt, that power of yours is magic."`
`"It's magic...?`
` I'm still a witch apprentice, so I can't use magic yet, right...?"`
`"No, it is magic.`
` ......Because you cannot use it consciously, you are still an apprentice, `
`...but even so, what magical power it is!`
` The materialization of your friend, Sakutarou, is excellent proof of that."`
`"Materialization...?"`
`"Indeed.`
` In your case, it may even be fitting to call it creation.`
` ...A piece of inorganic matter that would have no soul at all in another's hands can have a soul sent into it through your magic."`
`"Furthermore, that strong magical power lies in the human world.`
` ...In this era so filled with the toxin that denies magic, summoning a magical power that can materialize a single life-form is not easy even for me."`
`It isn't hard to give birth to any number of soulless beings.`
`However, giving birth to a being with a soul is very difficult.`
` ...This is what Beato asserted.`
`"......I don't really understand what you're saying, Beato.`
` You're saying Sakutaro is amazing...?"`
`"Both you and Sakutarou are incredible.`
` ...You should be proud.`
` ...I see, that which Kinzo desired above all else seems to dwell most strongly within you."`
`"I don't have a clue why Beato is praising Maria so much.`
` Right, Sakutaro?"`
`『Uryu-!』`
`"...What should be truly admired is not only that a soul has been made to reside in a stuffed animal.`
` Even more significant is the fact that you have changed your own worldview.`
` ...When it comes to giving birth to something from nothing, you stand out from the crowd."`
`"...It is easy to make 100 from 1.`
` However, giving birth to 1 from 0 is not.`
` ...When you do become a full witch, beyond just becoming a match for me, you might grow into a Great Witch that even I must acknowledge as superior."`
`"A Witch of Origins, perhaps.`
` ......I'm really looking forward to your future."`
`"Uu-!`
` Beato said I have talent as a witch!"`
`『Isn't that great, Maria?!`
` Uryu, Beato, ...thank you for praising Maria.』`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` No need to thank me, Sakutarou.`
` That red muffler truly suits you.`
` And I am envious of the talent of your master, who was able to give birth to a friend like you."`
`『Uryu-!`
` Thanks for complimenting my muffler.`
` This is a present I got from Maria.`
` It's my favorite.』`
`"And its size is truly like a muffler that was created just for you.`
` ...I see, I must also give my new friend some kind of present."`
`"Uu-?`
` Beato is giving Sakutaro a present...?"`
`"Of course, a gift from a witch must be something with magical power.`
` In that case, so that he can be your friend for all time, and so that you can have even more fun playing with him, `
`I shall give Sakutarou my magic power.`
` With that, he should be able to materialize even more strongly."`
`"Uu-?`
` I'll be able to have much more fun playing with Sakutaro...?`
` How's that?"`
`『Uryu...?`
` What could it be, Maria...?`
` Is it something scary...?』`
`"Don't worry.`
` Beato won't do anything scary.`
` Right, Beatrice?!"`
`"Indeed.`
` I believe you will like it.`
` ......So, to make him materialize even more strongly, a stronger image will be necessary.`
` ......Well, well, what to do.`
` Hmmmmmmmmmm..."`
`Beato crossed her arms and thought about what she could do to please them even more.`
`Then, right there, `
`......was the form of yet another witch.`
`It was Beato's teacher, Virgilia.`
`Virgilia truly was a Great Witch.`
`...Since Maria already thought of Beato as a Great Witch, this person Beato called a Great Witch must've been a Great Great Witch.`
`According to Beato, she still didn't even rise up to this witch's feet when it came to magical power.`
`"My, my.`
` I thought I heard some cheery voices.`
` What a fun tea party this seems to be..."`
`"Oh, Teacher.`
` Perfect timing.`
` I want you to look at this lion cub.`
` I hear he's Maria's new friend."`
`"Ho ho ho.`
` What a lovely lion-san.`
` ...I wonder if he can greet me?`
` Hello, nice to meet you...?"`
`『U-Uryu-!`
` I-I'm Sakutarou.』`
`Sakutaro fell to Maria's lap, greeting Virgilia with half of his face poking out over the edge of the table.`
`...It seemed he was very nervous, since this was a witch that even Beato called Teacher.`
`"Ho ho ho.`
` What an adorable name.`
` ...As a reward for giving such a good greeting, here's a sweet for you."`
`After waving her hands about, Virgilia held the palm of her hand upwards, as though she was lightly grabbing at the empty air.`
`Then, she held her fist out in front of Sakutaro.`
`......When she opened her fist, there was one of those individually wrapped cough drops.`
`『Uryu-?!`
` Maria, it's candy, awesome, awesome...!!』`
`"Uu-!`
` Isn't that great, Sakutaro!`
` Make sure to thank her."`
`『Uryu.`
` Thank you very much for the candy.`
` ...*gulp*.』`
`Even though Virgilia was a Great Great Witch, she still treated a stuffed animal like Sakutarou to an elegant greeting.`
`"Still, Teacher. Cough drops? Are you someone's granny or something...?!`
` Can't you at least pull out some strawberry-milk candy?"`
`"How rude.`
` In that case, I won't be giving you any more."`
`"Kuhhyahhyahhya, sorry, sorry.`
` ......Well then, Maria.`
` Take out your grimoire.`
` And, of course, your writing tools."`
`"Uu-?`
` Yeah, I'll take it out.`
` What should I write?"`
`"...Oh, what are you starting?"`
`"I will use a magic I learned from you, Teacher.`
` ...Magic to make a resident of another world materialize into a vessel.`
` I think that by applying that, we may be able to further strengthen the power that makes this friend of Maria's materialize.`
` ...I wanted to give that as a gift to Maria and her friend."`
`"I see.`
` ...For a being that has already materialized, it shouldn't be that difficult.`
` That could become a wonderful gift.`
` Well then, I shall help too, if only a little."`
`"It would be very reassuring if you would sign for this magic as a witness, Teacher...!`
` Be glad, Maria.`
` This will be a wonderful gift...!"`
`『Uryu...?`
` What's happening...?`
` It isn't scary, is it?`
` Is it...?』`
`"Don't know.`
` But I don't think it's scary.`
` ...What could it be? I can't wait."`
`Beato borrowed the grimoire from Maria's handbag and majestically flipped through the pages.`
` ...Then, she found an empty page among those with magic circles drawn on them...and flattened it out.`
`After gazing at Sakutarou with a grin, she suddenly started moving her pen.`
`...It was something like a written declaration made by witches to a high-order world.`
`It was magic whose effect could be controlled if Beatrice wrote and Virgilia signed.`
`Maria didn't understand what Beato was writing at first, but partway through, she figured out the wonderful magical power of this document, and her eyes began to sparkle...`
`『Uryu?!`
` Uryu?!`
` What is it, Maria, what's she drawing?!`
` Uryuuryu?!』`
`Sakutarou was on her lap, so he didn't know what was being written on the table.`
`...But even if he had seen, Sakutarou probably wouldn't have understood.`
`"Awesome, Sakutaro!!`
` Wait a bit, almost done, almost done!`
` It's amazing, Beato, amazing!!"`
`"......When it comes to writing documents of power, this child's talent is magnificent.`
` You might even serve well as a Secretary in the spirit world."`
`"How's this...?!`
` Not so bad, right...?!"`
`After finishing her writing with an intense amount of concentration, Beato looked over the document again from a distance.`
`...It seemed she was fairly satisfied with her work.`
`And Maria, who was also peeking in at it, let out a cry of wonder.`
`"...Awesome, Beato!!`
` Cuuute!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"By the name of the Golden Witch, Beatrice, I now acknowledge Sakutarou, MARIA's child.`
` ......Teacher, if you would sign as a witness!"`
`"Yes, yes.`
` ...By my name, I witness and acknowledge this oath.`
` ......It is done."`
`Virgilia signed, completing the written declaration.`
`It was a document with the power to proclaim to the beings of a higher world that Sakutarou had most certainly materialized in the human world.`
`Sakutarou, who had been born from Maria, was nominated by the two witches, Beatrice and Virgilia,`
` and just now, his existence had been acknowledged by the higher world.`
`...That itself was the great magic of materialization.`
`According to Beato, it was apparently quite fortunate that Virgilia was there.`
`After all, depending on the number and quality of witches that signed proclamations to the higher world, the power that resided in them could change drastically.`
`Virgilia in particular had many friends in that higher plane,`
` so her signature gave the proclamation a power with which Beato's couldn't even compare.`
`"By this proclamation, I accept you, Sakutarou, as an individual with his own ego.`
` And I welcome you as a friend in accordance with the contract of Mariage Sorcière.`
` From now on, Sakutarou is our common friend."`
`"And for that, I shall bestow upon you a fitting form as a gift.`
` Accept it."`
`With the grimoire still opened to the page with the proclamation, she turned it around and handed it to Maria.`
`Maria showed it to Sakutarou on her lap.`
`When Sakutarou beheld that proclamation,`
` ......he felt something hot and bright begin to dwell...`
`in his body made of cloth and cotton.`
`Even as he looked around, nervous at this sensation he'd never felt before, that power strengthened, `
`...and eventually, a bright light completely swallowed him up...`
`『Uryu...?`
` Uryuuryuuryuuryu...!』`
`Then, when that light disappeared...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`......There, Maria's friend Sakutarou held a new form and ~ib~existed~ib~.`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!`
` You're cute, Sakutaro!`
` Reeeally cute!"`
`『Uryu...?`
` Uryu-...`
` Does it really look good on me?`
` It isn't embarrassing...?』`
`"Ho ho ho ho.`
` It is a very lovely form, Sakutarou-chan."`
`"I figured the muffler was his charm point.`
` And the ears!`
` Animal ears sure are nice, truly cute!`
` Let me nibble 'em later.`
` *cackle*!"`
`"Thank you, Beatrice!!`
` Thank you very much for the wonderful present!!"`
`"There is no need for thanks.`
` This is out of respect for your wonderful magic and your friend.`
` ......And, now that you have reached this level, it would not be odd for you to graduate from being an apprentice at any time.`
` From now on, I shall instruct you on even more new and fun magic.`
` ...From this point forward, you may call yourself MARIA, an Apprentice Witch of Origins."`
`"A Witch of Origins...?"`
`"Indeed.`
` It is the title of a witch who seeks to become a Creator.`
` Right now, you are just an Enchanter (a magician specializing in forms of magical enhancement) who has only enough strength to breathe magical power into the small objects around her.`
` ...But after one thousand years of training, you could conceivably use the magical compendium that resides inside your heart to create a galaxy."`
`"...The talent of a Witch of Origins is very rare.`
` Even though everyone has it when they are young, no one can continue to hold onto it.`
` ...This title is also proof that you have not lost your untainted heart."`
`"Uu-!!`
` A Witch of Origins, awesome!`
` I'll become one!`
` I'm Maria, an Apprentice Witch of Origins!"`
`"Maria, that's so incredible...!`
` A Witch of Origins, incredible, amazing, uryu-!"`
`"Eventually, you will be able to call yourself a full witch: Lady MARIA, Witch of Origins.`
` ...It may be a good time now to give not only Sakutarou, but you as well, an appearance fitting for your rank.`
` ...Here.`
` I shall give a proper outfit for one who, while still an apprentice, is worthy of using the title of a witch."`
`When Beato waved the pipe that was her cane, `
`many gold butterflies that had appeared out of nowhere grouped around Maria, giving her a wonderful dress.`
`It certainly was fitting for the girl who would eventually take the name of the Witch of Origins, combining both cuteness and dignity...`
`"Amazing...!!`
` Awesome awesome awesome awesome!!`
` Cute, cute!`
` I wanna show these clothes to Mama too...!!`
` Can I?"`
`"The full dress of a witch must not be shown indiscriminately.`
` It's value increases if you're stingy with it.`
` *cackle*!"`
`Then, the Great Witch, the witch, the witch's apprentice, and their new friend, Sakutarou, enjoyed a lively tea party...`
`"......See?`
` Look how happy I am.`
` And look how fun this is."`
`"............"`
`"Please, don't be afraid of being happy.`
` Becoming happy isn't the same thing as accepting your current misfortune.`
` It means creating a new happiness out of your current misfortune.`
` That is the Magic of Origins."`
`"...I...didn't want to acknowledge my current world.`
` ...I couldn't bear to accept such an isolated and painful world.`
` ...That's why, even though I was entranced by your world, Maria onee-chan, `
`...I couldn't cross the final line."`
`"......I'll teach you.`
` About my Magic of Origins.`
` No, I taught you before, right?`
` And you used it before.`
` Did you forget...?"`
`"............"`
`"You were also a witch apprentice, Ange, with your name entered into Mariage Sorcière, weren't you?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` That was true.`
` ......Mariage Sorcière...`
` ...That takes me back.`
` ...I also had my name entered in there at one point, didn't I...?"`
`"Yes, I will never forget that.`
` It happened in April of 1987.`
` I received a certain strange request from a friend.`
` ...There was a large collection of books, the former possessions of a very rich man, that were being sold at auction,`
` and it was thought that some of them might've been extremely valuable to the study of archeology and folklore, as well as in an occult sense, `
`so this friend wanted to witness their worth confidentially."`
`"......That was '87.`
` Half a year after the crime on Rokkenjima."`
`"Correct.`
` It was explained that those books had escaped the disaster at Rokkenjima.`
` The owner of the island, Ms. Ushiromiya Eva, had put them up for auction."`
`This was apparently a high-class restaurant.`
`A middle-aged man was sitting across from Ange in a secluded and quiet seat.`
`Amakusa could be seen by the entrance.`
`He was probably keeping a lookout for pursuers from the Sumadera family.`
`The scholarly man across from Ange spoke politely, but with enthusiasm.`
`He didn't lay a finger on the food in front of him, so you could tell how excited he was as he spoke fervently.`
`He was a professor at a certain college, and particularly well-known as an authority on Western folklore.`
`However, among his life works, that was only a convenient exterior.`
`His true life work was...`
`the study of occultism, Western magic, alchemy, and everything else to do with the occult,`
` as well as demonology.`
`In short, he was the person in the best position to understand the details of Kinzo's research...`
`"First, what I learned by appraising those books was that Ms. Ushiromiya Eva had absolutely no education in the study of folklore...`
`and that the original owner of the books, Ushiromiya Kinzo, was certainly one of the top five authorities on demonology in Japan."`
`April, 1987.`
`A major city antique shop obtained a large quantity of ancient documents that were thought to have a high historical value.`
`They were entrusted with them by Ushiromiya Eva, who wanted them to be sold at auction.`
`At the time, it was thought that Eva would succeed the Ushiromiya family and have all the wealth to herself, as the only survivor.`
`However, at that point, not even half a year had passed since the accident, and the others had not been missing long enough to be presumed dead, even under extraordinary circumstances.`
`Because of that, Eva had supposedly been in a very tight spot financially, unable even to collect on her family's life insurance.`
`It seems she tried to sell everything of value, `
`and even the books kept in the place where she'd escaped harm in, Kuwadorian, were used for this purpose.`
`These old books, which would eventually be called 'the Ushiromiya Library', were later gathered from antique shops by authorities in the field so that they could be appraised, ...and those authorities were astounded.`
`"At least speaking from the perspective of occultism, `
`the impact of that discovery on the world was comparable to the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls."`
`"This is because...contained within 'the Ushiromiya Library' were many extremely vital documents that had never been found, `
`though their existence had been known of for more than a millenium."`
`The many dreams of the occult, such as those represented by alchemy, always stirred an intense fascination in dilettantes.`
`It is whispered that many 'magic books' of great historical value, currently unknown to the public, `
`might be in the secret possession of extremely wealthy lovers of the occult.`
`Items such as Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks, which are particularly popular among dilettantes, are said to be prime examples of this.`
`It is said that approximately 5,000 pages of these notebooks currently exist, and that over 10,000 have been lost,`
` but some researchers believe that a large part of this lost portion may be monopolized by certain enthusiasts and members of the extremely rich.`
`It is said that because of this, even now, `
`dilettantes who can't help but seek these spare no expense to search around for quietly hoarded away and unannounced notebooks...`
`There is probably no doubting that Ushiromiya Kinzo was himself one of those dilettantes.`
`No one knows what Kinzo went through to obtain those,`
` but there can be no mistake that he used his vast wealth freely, buying them off of other rich people with the same hobby as him.`
`Those books, which were so valuable that enthusiasts could never satisfy their desire to hoard them away, were discovered in large numbers at the end of the 20th century,`
` and their release to the public had given the entire world a massive shock...`
`"Because of this case, the name <Rokkenjima> became known across the world.`
` The world was also shocked to learn that, in all likelihood, a large number of even more valuable undiscovered books were lost during the accident on Rokkenjima."`
`"...Because of this, the names of Rokkenjima and the Ushiromiya Library will remain in our memories for all time."`
`...Our memories.`
`That 'our' probably meant the occult neck of the woods with the same hobby as Kinzo.`
`Because of that incident, the name of Rokkenjima had taken on a vital meaning in the world of the occult.`
`There certainly had been a lot of reporting about the accident on Rokkenjima itself, but not on an international level.`
`However, this one part had spread across the world, `
`taking the image of Rokkenjima as a small island in the Izu archipelago...and painting it over as a demonic island where riddles, suspicion, mystery and the occult met.`
`In other words, until Kinzo's library was leaked to the public by Eva,`
` Rokkenjima had been merely a nameless island that no one could remember,`
` ...and certainly not the island of a witch.`
`However, when knowledge of the Ushiromiya Library spread all over the planet, Rokkenjima's image immediately took on an occult twist.`
`"What happened next was the discovery of that message bottle.`
` That's what turned that island into a witch's island.`
` A nameless island in the Izu archipelago began to transition into an island of the occult, the island of the mysterious witch, Beatrice."`
`"You might say that, lacking either the Ushiromiya Library or the message bottle, the Rokkenjima Witch Legend would never have been established."`
`"...The message bottle."`
`"Yes.`
` A form of communication to an unspecified target by throwing an empty bottle with a letter sealed inside it into the sea."`
`"It was once famous as a way of sending an SOS from a deserted island, but because of the influence of a certain prominent foreign detective novel,`
` it has also become known as a method of confessing the truth after one's own death, like a time-delayed will.`
` The case of the Rokkenjima message bottle was certainly one of the latter."`
`"...This is the thing everyone says a fisherman on a nearby island picked up?"`
`"Correct.`
` We learned that a young fisherman on Shikinejima picked up a wine bottle with a letter in it.`
` This young fisherman kept it just out of curiosity.`
` Then, because Rokkenjima had fallen under the world's attention due to the Ushiromiya Library, he announced his discovery."`
`"Is there any chance that it was a fabrication made by the fisherman?"`
`"Of course, we weren't able to deny that possibility.`
` The scraps of paper in the wine bottle were signed by a certain member of the Ushiromiya family.`
` A girl named Ushiromiya Maria.`
` However, after looking at the writing left on her former belongings, it was confirmed that this message was written in a different person's handwriting."`
`"......A different person's handwriting...?"`
`"Correct.`
` At the very least, I believe there can be no doubt that it was written by a person more skilled at writing and of a greater age than her.`
` There's a very high likelihood that someone faked her name when they wrote it.`
` Therefore, at that point in time, the contents of those scraps of paper were thought to have a very low credibility."`
`However.`
`Later on, it was confirmed that a similar message bottle had been recovered from the nearby ocean on the day of the accident by the police in their search for lost articles, and this caused a sensation.`
`"It seems that, due to evidence from the surrounding area and the fact that the bottle had been sealed, `
`the police had decided that its likelihood of being a fabrication was low and that it had been abandoned no earlier than a few days before the accident.`
` And the handwriting for both matched.`
` This caused the credibility of the scraps of paper discovered by the fisherman to rise."`
`"It seems magazines and the like have reported on the contents of that message bottle repeatedly, but would you like an explanation?"`
`"...No.`
` I know about it, more or less."`
`Many scraps of paper had been stuffed into both of the wine bottles.`
`It was an extensive notebook written by someone calling themselves Ushiromiya Maria, but who wasn't Maria, and which told of the events starting the day before the accident and up until the day of the accident in a diary-like way.`
`And its contents had been the beginning of 'The Witch's Legend Serial Murder Incident',`
` as well as 'The Golden Witch Beatrice's Puzzle'.`
`"This bizarre, diary-style notebook described how the Ushiromiya family members, nailed down on the island by the typhoon,`
` were caught up in a ceremony for the resurrection of a witch...and killed one by one in inexplicable ways."`
`"And, in the end, the Golden Witch Beatrice revived, and everything was flung into the Golden Land.`
` ...It was written almost as though it was a complete account of the events on those days."`
`"Also, it depicted the current situation on the island at the time in great detail,`
` and the former servants who used to work for the Ushiromiya family gave testimony that it had definitely been written by a human who knew the inside details of the island."`
`"...So, because of a combination of the occult boom from that strange fantasy novel and the Ushiromiya Library,`
` and well as the fact that the truth remained shrouded in darkness, the legend of the Rokkenjima witch was born...?"`
`"Correct.`
` More than 10 years have already passed since that case, and it is still the focus of interest for occult enthusiasts across the world."`
`"No, to the contrary, you could say that it has become increasingly deified as time passes.`
` There are still many enthusiasts who try to secretly land on Rokkenjima, even though it's prohibited.`
` ...Could there be another message bottle that has still not been discovered?`
` And on that day, what really happened on that island?`
` There is still much to be discussed."`
`As though he had finally remembered that he'd been going on and on for some time, the man took a gulp of water.`
`...His potage was getting cold, but it seemed that the man's hunger had already been blown away.`
`"...I'm pretty sure I heard that the fisherman's scraps of paper and the police's scraps of paper had completely different contents."`
`"Correct.`
` Due to that, interest in the Rokkenjima mystery increased even further.`
` Inside both bottles were diary-style notebooks on which was written an account from the day before the accident until the day of the accident.`
` However, while both of their contents described the same two-day period, they were completely different."`
`"It was as though one was the truth and one was a lie.`
` Or perhaps both were lies.`
` In any event, the beginnings and endings alone matched each other.`
` In the beginning, the 18 people including the relatives are sealed up on the island by the typhoon.`
` And in the ending, everyone dies, the Golden Witch is revived, and everything is flung into the Golden Land."`
`The contents of both message bottles wrote about the events of the day before the accident and the day of the accident.`
`But the details were completely different.`
`Both diaries outline a serial murder following the epitaph of the witch, but the order of the sacrifices, the ways they died, and even 'the tale of the two days' were different.`
`However, in both, everyone died in the end and the witch revived, making for the same general plot.`
`"Because the only survivor, Ms. Ushiromiya Eva, has remained silent about what actually happened on that island,`
` the events of that entire two-day period are shrouded in darkness."`
`"These two diaries presented a full two theories to wipe away that darkness.`
` Those two days could be explained with either of those two diaries.`
` However, we don't know which is correct, or even if there's anything correct contained within them."`
`——Schrodinger's...cat box.`
`If it isn't denied, even a mixture of truth and fiction can be the truth.`
`Through the media, these scraps of paper had of course been shown to Eva as well, but in the end, she never broke her silence...`
`"Who sent the message bottles...and why?"`
`"Earlier, in their special issue for the crime's 10th anniversary, a certain magazine took that topic up for discussion in a grand manner, didn't they?`
` That theory seems to be the one garnering the most support lately.`
` But it is rather dull.`
` ...What happened on that island, on that day?`
` Considering this question is the true charm of the Witch Hunt."`
`"The Witch Hunt...?"`
`"Yes, the Rokkenjima Witch Hunt is the name of a group of enthusiasts who try to explain the truth of that crime from an occult perspective.`
` Discussion of the mysteries that surround Rokkenjima, from the Ushiromiya Library to the mysterious two-day period to the Legend of the Golden Witch, is flourishing even today among enthusiasts."`
`"For the 10 year anniversary, an international convention was held in New York.`
` I also participated as a representative of Japan!`
` I was able to intermingle with zealous overseas Witch Hunters in many ways.`
` Witches are a very popular category overseas.`
` The age span of the participants stretched from elementary schoolers at the bottom, all the way to famous cultural figures at the top!`
` Even in Japan, in recent years, there was finally-"`
`...You probably don't need any more explanation, but he's one of the most famous Rokkenjima Witch Hunters in Japan.`
`Even though I didn't ask anything more, he kept continuing on excitedly all by himself.`
`As I swirled the thin film on my potage with my spoon, I shrugged my shoulders and sighed.`
`...Looks like researching about the message bottle really was a waste of time.`
`No, if there's one thing I've found, `
`it's that the notebook supposedly written by Maria onee-chan was actually written by a different person faking her name.`
`And, that person wrote up an occult legend on their own, put it into the bottle as though it was the truth, and threw it into the sea.`
`...I have a question.`
`Why would they go to all the trouble of writing so much in order to prepare a suspicious letter like that?`
`With a message bottle, there'd be no guarantee that it'd ever pass into anyone's hands.`
`If their luck had been bad, it could've sunk in the ocean, never to be seen by anyone.`
`And even if someone had picked it up, they might've not cared about it and thrown it away.`
`...Why would they entrust their confession of the truth to the sea with such an uncertain method?`
`And why would they write up multiple, differing tales?`
`If there'd been one message bottle, claiming that its story was the truth might be reckless, but not impossible.`
`However, because there were two, that made both of them doubtful.`
`If someone was plotting to make out those two days to be the work of a witch, then they really did go one step too far.`
`And because there were two, it suggests that an undiscovered third one, or possibly even more might exist.`
`...In other words, the two differing contents makes both of them harder and harder to swallow.`
`But despite that, the contents of both matched in that they told of a witch in a tale.`
`So, is that the main point the writer wanted to get across to us......?`
`...It seems to me that the only possible explanation...is that someone who wanted to give rise to an illusion of a witch carried out this crime for their own enjoyment.`
`However, the 17 people other than Aunt Eva lost their lives, and a vast wealth or maybe even 10 tons of gold had moved around secretly in the darkness.`
`It doesn't feel right...for a confession occurring after all that to bring up this illusion of the witch.`
`Even if we ignore the magazines' theories, it's very doubtful that the message bottle really was a diary.`
`...After all, the amount of writing was massive.`
`It's hard to imagine that someone actually caught up in the middle of a serial murder like that would be able to calmly write it down.`
`In that case, it's probably more realistic that this diary was written slowly over a long period of time, up until the day prior to the accident.`
`In that case, ......would it mean that everything on Rokkenjima was a 'planned crime', with everything prepared for over a long stretch of time...?`
`...The fact that Aunt Eva left this world without saying anything is...infuriating.`
`She definitely said it on her death bed.`
`She definitely said that her reason for not telling me the truth was because it was her best way of harassing me.`
`...Yeah, by now, it's painfully obvious.`
`Of all the things Aunt Eva did to harass me, this was probably the last and the greatest.`
`......But thinking of it this way, it's pretty doubtful that Aunt Eva is the true culprit.`
`Of course, that's not because the handwriting on the message bottle was different from Aunt Eva's, or anything like that.`
`...It's because in both tales that were discovered, Aunt Eva was included among the victims.`
`If the writer of that diary was the culprit...`
`...Maybe Aunt Eva was also one of the targets to be killed.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`Maybe Aunt Eva survived because ~ib~something went wrong~ib~`
`.`
`......Because I hated Aunt Eva, I came to believe that she had to be the culprit.`
`But the existence of the message bottle...`
`...makes me suspect that the mastermind is a far more profound and unknown person than her...`
`I looked at the clock.`
`I've heard more than enough.`
` It's time.`
`As he continued to speak fervently, I suggested that I wanted to bring this discussion to a close.`
`He seemed to be aware that he'd gotten excited and talked too much, so he quickly accepted this.`
`"Thank you very much for today.`
` I believe I've heard something truly valuable."`
`"...No, no.`
` It was truly fun to be able to welcome a young lady as a new friend of the Witch Hunt.`
` I have many precious materials that I couldn't show you because of this change to a different venue from the usual.`
` I would be glad to show you them at the next chance we get."`
`"Thank you, Professor.`
` ......Could I ask one more thing?"`
`"Yes, what is it?"`
`"Professor, why are you interested in witches...no, in occultism and demonology?"`
`"Well, that is somewhat embarrassing.`
` ...A daydream I had in my childhood, that if I could use a mysterious power, I could take on even the biggest of bullies,`
` went on to become my life's work.`
` After all, the primitive desire of admiring unknown power is as universal today as it ever was in the past."`
`"Professor, if you could do it, would you want to become a witch?`
` Do you still dream of being able to use magic at will?"`
`"But of course.`
` Even though, at this age, I understand logically that such a thing couldn't exist, `
`I cannot forget my child-like dreams, such as flying in the sky and turning scrap iron into gold.`
` ...Hahaha, if you would, please keep this a secret from my students."`
`"......If I told you that I was a real witch,`
` would you believe it?"`
`"Hahhahhahha.`
` My pet theory from my few experiences with women is that they are all witches."`
`Ange snorted at the old professor, who must've been an earnest scholar with barely any experience with women.`
`"Yeah, yeah.`
` And one final question.`
` ...Professor, have you seen the original message bottle itself?"`
`"I have indeed."`
`"In that case, do you know that handwriting well?"`
`"Of course.`
` I am not a specialist in that area, but at least when it comes to the handwriting of the message bottle, I am proud to be the most knowledgeable in Japan."`
`At that point, Ange set a book on the desk with a thud.`
`"......And this is?`
` I have never seen it before."`
`He prided himself on his thorough knowledge of all literature related to Rokkenjima, and he looked bewildered at this binding that he hadn't seen before...`
`Ignoring him, Ange silently flipped through the pages, opened to one of them, and showed him.`
`On that page was a handwritten paragraph beginning with 'To my beloved witch apprentice'.`
`...And at the end, there was a signature in katakana that said...Beatrice.`
`"Th-This is......?"`
`The instant he glanced at it,`
` his face went pale.`
`...She knew the answer before asking, but Ange asked it aloud anyway.`
`"Does the handwriting in the paragraph on this page match the handwriting in the message bottle...?"`
`"W-Well, umm...I-I must take this home and investigate more...`
` ...P-Pardon me for asking, but what in the world is this book?!`
` Where did you get it?!"`
`The man stretched out his hand, but Ange pulled it back.`
`...As though telling him not to touch it with his filthy hands.`
`"Thank you.`
` Just that reaction is all I need.`
` Thank you very much for today.`
` ...Here's the reward I promised."`
`As she stood up, clutching Maria's diary,`
` Ange carelessly tossed a wad of 10 thousand yen notes wrapped with a strip of paper onto the table.`
`As Ange turned her back to him and made to leave, the man raised his voice as though clinging to her.`
`But Ange didn't stop walking.`
`"I-I beg you...!!`
` What in the world is that book?!`
` I don't need a reward, show me that book...!!"`
`"...Both you and I are in the Witch Hunt, but it looks like we aren't pursuing it at the same level.`
` You're entertaining yourself with the outside of the cat box.`
` And what I want to know about is the inside of the cat box.`
` ...And this book is the key to opening it.`
` It's too good for you.`
` Well then.`
` <Goodbye, gentlemen>. <Have a nice day>."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"P-Please wait,`
` ~ib~Sumadera-san~ib~...!!!"`
`His voice didn't reach her.`
` She had already joined up with Amakusa and gone into the car...`
`"Did you find anything?"`
`"...Only at the very end.`
` I was right.`
` The one who wrote the message bottles was Beatrice herself."`
`"<Cool>.`
` So, you've concluded that the witch actually exists?"`
`"Who knows.`
` ......Mind if I sleep?`
` I'll bet that talkative professor gets lost in his own little world in lectures and makes a lot of kids fall asleep."`
`"Please, go ahead, take a rest."`
`"......Still, that went really well.`
` That guy believed I was a Sumadera until the very end."`
`The Sumadera family had set up a web beforehand around any people Ange might try to contact.`
`They had offered a reward to anyone who could take Ushiromiya Ange into custody if she appeared.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`Ange had foreseen that and had ~ib~snatched it away~ib~`
`.`
`She had called herself Sumadera, and after cleverly tricking the man by saying her own subordinates would set up an ambush, so he didn't need to worry about it, she had taken him outside.`
`So, when the Sumadera family pursuers reached the professor's house, there was no longer anyone there...`
`"According to the family, a young man and woman calling themselves Sumadera visited this morning, `
`took the professor out with them and still have not returned.`
` ...There's a chance we were outmaneuvered."`
`".........What a bad child, Ange-chan.`
` ...I wonder if that craftiness is from Nee-san's blood.`
` ...To think she'd casually take on the name Sumadera after saying she'd hate to go by it so often..."`
`"......Hohohohohoh.`
` ...The professor should be returning soon.`
` When he does, we must serve him some tea..."`
`"...Y-Yes.`
` Understood."`
`"......I wonder if she thinks she's leading me around by the nose.`
` What a naughty child.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*, ...hohhohhohohohohohoho!!"`
`With a demonic look on her face, Kasumi violently stamped her heel.`
`I'll teach you.`
`About my Magic of Origins.`
`No, I taught you before, right?`
`And you used it before.`
`Did you forget...?`
`You were also a witch apprentice, Ange, with your name entered into Mariage Sorcière, weren't you...?`
`"......I was also...included among the witches, wasn't I...?"`
`I closed Maria's diary and flopped down on a very high-class-looking bed.`
`I'd slept deeply for a long time in the car, so it took longer than usual for drowsiness to set in, and I read the diary as I waited.`
`This was a super expensive hotel in the city.`
`...Since it was often used by the rich and the famous, they were very big on confidentiality.`
`That made it very convenient for Ange to escape her pursuers.`
`The idea that renegades should spend their nights hiding in cheap hotels is a commoner's way of thinking.`
`...To Ange, who possessed all the wealth of the Ushiromiya family, renegade life was comfortable indeed.`
`Of course, even though he was a guard, Amakusa was a man and therefore in a separate room.`
`Ange used the bedroom of the suite, and Amakusa lay on the sofa in the living room.`
`...According to Amakusa, the sofas here were more pleasant than his own beds had been recently.`
`Poor guy.`
`When I looked at the clock, `
`...I saw that it was almost 2:00 in the middle of the night.`
`I'm still not getting sleepy.`
`......I sighed deeply.`
`At that time, even though there was no wind, I had the feeling that Maria onee-chan's diary fluttered.`
`...Then, Onee-chan appeared.`
`Her form was no longer the normal one I'd known.`
`...She was wearing the dress that Beatrice had given her after acknowledging her as a witch.`
`"......If you don't get some sleep, it'll be tough tomorrow, right?"`
`"If I were a witch too, `
`...I'd be able to use magic, wouldn't I?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` You can use it.`
` I taught you, didn't I?`
` Taught you how to use it.`
` ...And you were able to use it in the past, weren't you?"`
`"......I remember.`
` ...I've started wanting to use it."`
`"Are you starting to feel lonely...?"`
`".........Not really.`
` ...It's not like having a different pillow every night is that tough."`
`"......The first step to magic can be loneliness or boredom, `
`...even small reasons like that."`
`"Even if it's just trying to kill time until you can fall asleep?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I'm glad you remembered about magic one more time."`
`............`
`...It's been quite a long time since I last used magic.`
`At one point, with Maria onee-chan's introduction, ...I touched a corner of it...and opened the door a tiny bit.`
`So, ...I should still remember that sensation.`
`"...Right now, your magical power has declined significantly, Ange.`
` ...If you don't devote yourself to the basics, it'll be hard, okay?"`
`"Sure.`
` ......Checking all directions.`
` Securing a quiet space."`
`"What about Amakusa-san?"`
`"......`
`......He's sleeping."`
`After opening the door to the living room a crack, I could see the blanket caterpillar on the sofa roll over in its sleep.`
`"...With your magical strength as weak as it is now, the anti-magic power is affecting you too much.`
` ...Not just the sight of people,`
` but voices, sounds, and even the presence of people will get in the way of your magic.`
` ...Sever those completely.`
` Like how ancient magicians shut themselves up in ateliers to preserve their isolation."`
`"I remember.`
` ...The very existence of Humans blocks magic.`
` ...Therefore, the very act of showing magic to people is the sign of a high-level witch..."`
`Obtain a quiet space for yourself alone.`
`...That should be enough to prepare a space to use magic.`
`"......Next is the vessel.`
` ...Right now, it's important for your bike to at least have training wheels...no, a chain."`
`".........`
`......This is...`
`...of course...`
`impossible..."`
`Ange rubbed her own head.`
`...She wore hair accessories there, with pink gems attached.`
`They felt a little childish for Ange, but she never took them off, not even for a single day.`
`"......Yeah.`
` ......It really will be impossible for you now, Ange.`
` ...If you'd practiced every single day since then,`
` you might've gained the ability to summon with that by now."`
`".........`
`If I were to start training now, how long would it take?"`
`"......It's said that a year of magical training for a child is worth ten years for an old person.`
` You need a lot of determination."`
`"You mean like Ushiromiya Kinzo?`
` ......So, just like the piano and the violin, getting a special education from a young age is huge when it comes to magic."`
`"As you are now, your power has weakened since the time you were first able to use magic, Ange.`
` ...Don't overdo it, ...and devote yourself to the basics."`
`After stubbornly rubbing those things on my head one more time, I gave up.`
`Then I started fishing through the knapsack.`
`...Looking for anything that might make a good vessel.`
`"......Shouldn't this be a perfect vessel?"`
`"It's been a long time.`
` ...Yes.`
` With this, I think even you should be able to perform a summons as you are now.`
` ...And they have no master now.`
` It should be possible for you to become their new master, Ange."`
`Among the things that looked like good vessels, I took the one I thought might possess the strongest magical power...`
`and set it on the side table near the bed with a clatter.`
`It was...a shady-looking, stake-shaped weapon with an occult design inscribed on it.`
`It was one of the 'Seven Stakes of Purgatory', which the witch used to offer sacrifices.`
`When the police had been searching the family's possessions, they had collected a large amount of junk.`
`After the investigation had finished, these had been politely returned to the Ushiromiya family.`
`...Finding something that I'd seen in the pictures of Maria's diary, I took it home with me.`
`"......Originally, there were Seven Stakes of Purgatory.`
` ...How pitiful.`
` Now, she's the only one left."`
`Onee-chan smiled, looking lonely...`
`I pulled another book out of the knapsack.`
`...This was also old-fashioned, and you could tell that it was an occult book just by looking.`
`But its contents were plain.`
`It was one of Maria onee-chan's elaborate notebooks.`
`This wasn't a diary.`
`...This was a grimoire, which she had written as a witch.`
`The Seven Stakes of Purgatory are Beatrice's furniture.`
`Created by her and employed only for her sake.`
`But since Beatrice is also a witch of Mariage Sorcière, they could be employed by MARIA, a witch of the same alliance.`
`For that reason, the method of summoning the Seven Stakes of Purgatory and how to handle them was written about in great detail in Maria onee-chan's grimoire...`
`And...`
`...As another person with their name registered in that alliance, I was also permitted to employ them.`
`"......Which...`
`...of the Seven Sisters is this stake?"`
`"Their characteristics are written about well in my grimoire.`
` ...The Sisters of the Seven Stakes really hate it when you get their names wrong.`
` Remember their names well before summoning them."`
`A packed page told of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory.`
`...It described the Seven Sisters in great detail.`
`...Yes.`
`I think I memorized almost this entire page once in the past.`
`The more I read it, the more I start to remember...`
`By the pictures and characteristics written on the grimoire, I could tell that the stake in my hand was 'Mammon's stake'.`
`In the past, I hadn't had any stakes, so I'd summoned them without any vessel.`
`...So, this was the first time I'd clearly seen any of the Seven Stakes, let alone Mammon.`
`"Mammon.`
` The fifth sister.`
` Controls the deadly sin of greed.`
` ...An incredible kid."`
`"Greed also controls aspirations, the desire to improve oneself, and the strength to live.`
` It definitely doesn't mean only bad things.`
` ...She's rude, but she's a girl who tries really hard."`
`"...I see.`
` You could say that without desire, there's no reason to live."`
`For a while, I heightened my concentration and digested the information that was written about Mammon.`
`...The more the summoner knows about the target that's being summoned, the better...`
`Knowledge is connected to magical power.`
`...I began to fill my head with knowledge about Mammon, raising a necessary amount of magical power for a summoning.`
`"...Grimoires can be a bit interesting.`
` This might be a much better read than some lame novel.`
` ...It really takes me back."`
`"For a grimoire, it is demanded not only that you understand the letters, but that you fill up the world of the space between the lines, `
`giving birth to a world from the pictures and creating things in various ways.`
` ...The power to give birth to something.`
` For someone who has that, such as you, a grimoire should be more interesting than any book.`
` ...I've always known that you'd be able to understand that."`
`"......That should be...enough knowledge of Mammon for now.`
` ......Yes.`
` I've remembered it, more or less.`
` ...I'll give it a try."`
`"Take care.`
` ...In case the worst happens, here is my talisman.`
` ...The treaty of the alliance won't protect you right now.`
` That Mammon is a bit of a quick trigger.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ...And...she may still ~ib~bear a grudge~ib~.`
` Be careful."`
`"Yes.`
` ...I'll wear it."`
`The Seven Stakes of Purgatory, as furniture used to make sacrifices for a ceremony, were treated as beings inferior even to weapons.`
`But that was only when compared to other demons.`
` To Humans, furniture is something to be feared.`
`I fished through the knapsack again,`
` took out a bracelet charm with a scorpion medal that I'd gotten from Maria onee-chan long ago, and put it on my arm.`
`...In the past, I hadn't needed something like this.`
`But I need insurance...`
`"......It's okay.`
` That has already been fitted with the required amount of magical defense.`
` As long as you wear that, you'll definitely be fine."`
`Maria onee-chan's magic power, which had been specially put into this charm, had been enough to earn even Beatrice's admiration.`
`...While it may have looked like something cheap to a human who couldn't understand magic,`
` its magical worth was incalculable.`
`"............`
`Come, arise.`
` Forgive the sin.`
` ...One of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory,`
` Mammon of Greed."`
`.........`
`I focused my mind.`
`I made the magic-repelling toxin that filled my body zero.`
`Imagine an untainted, vast space.`
`...Doubts and common sense all resist magic.`
`Make the resistance zero...and erase the burden on the magical power...`
`............`
`...Inside my head was the image of a vast space.`
`It was a nighttime world where I floated in the air and the neon stars over the ground sparkled.`
`A world where the stars that should have covered the sky were wiped away by the light from below that covered the ground.`
`In the world of a vast night sky with no obstructions, `
`...I imagined the wind blowing through at will.`
`At that time, `
`...in a room where there shouldn't have been any wind, `
`...the free nighttime wind kicked up a cyclone.`
`The long forgotten sensation raced through my entire body.`
`......It was the unique feeling of exultation that comes from using magic.`
`Mammon's stake, which I held out in my hand, gradually began to make me feel a pale light.`
`A twisting cyclone with the stake at the center.`
`...The hefty stake floated a bit into the air.`
`"......Wonderful.`
` ...Looks like the gap in your training hasn't stolen your talent."`
`"...Come, arise.`
` Forgive the sin.`
` ...One of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, Mammon of Greed.`
` ...Show yourself to me..."`
`After I raised my hands bit by bit, lifting them higher than my head,`
` as though it was being attracted upwards, Mammon's stake once again floated up high into the air...and gradually began to shake.`
`That shaking began to grow faster, `
`'!s0!d900`
`'!sd`
`...The terrible sound of it dancing around threatened to make me flinch.`
`...However, I must not lose my mental concentration.`
`Then, the stake, which had been flying around at an incredible speed, finally stopped and faced me...`
`...It was in the air, just a few centimeters away from my forehead, ...and held back by the defensive barrier created by the scorpion charm.`
`It had tried to break the defensive barrier, eating into it with an incredible power, but Maria onee-chan's barrier wouldn't be broken so easily.`
`"......It's no use, `
`...I can't break it..."`
`The stake muttered hatefully.`
`...It was probably safe to say that the scorpion charm saved me.`
`Without that, my attempt at killing time until I got sleepy would've killed my time for all eternity.`
`When Mammon's stake realized that it was unable to gouge me, it gave up and grew docile, changing its form from that of a stake into a human.`
`...In that same old outfit that I'd never be able to walk around outside in.`
`Although you could say it suited her, in a demonic sort of way.`
`"......Is that Ange-sama?`
` ......But that magical power's pretty shabby.`
` ...Are you really Ange-sama?"`
`"It's been a long time, Mammon.`
` ...Have you been well?"`
`"......`
`...And here I was convinced that furniture that's already fulfilled its function just gets left to rust away in a closet.`
` ...So, what kind of side show is this?`
` You aren't gonna say that you're my owner, are you...?"`
`"......Yes.`
` Ange is your master."`
`"Lady MARIA, `
`......how unsightly of me.`
` Was that barrier just now yours?"`
`"Yes.`
` I thought that as she is now, Ange might just have gotten finished off by you.`
` I lent her a talisman."`
`".........`
`...If Lady MARIA says Ange-sama is my master, I cannot refuse.`
` ......Ange-sama, please, your orders.`
` If it's me you need, are you going to perform a new ceremony?`
` With new sacrifices...?`
` Of course, that's only if you're willing to handle me yourself and get your own hands dirty."`
`"......That role isn't something I'm asking for anymore.`
` ......All you have to do is talk with me like you used to."`
`"............"`
`"........."`
`"......Heheh.`
` ...Yes, if that is what you desire.`
` Furniture is furniture because it is used.`
` It is an honor just to be summoned,`
` Ange-sama."`
`Mammon had a slightly complicated smile on her face.`
`...She accepted her new master because Maria had told her to, `
`but it looked like she hadn't gotten over her discontent at working for Ange, with her frail magical power.`
`...Perhaps she had some other reason for hating Ange,`
` but for now, it seemed that she couldn't disobey, even if she wasn't happy about it.`
`"......So?`
` What should I do?"`
`"I don't know.`
` ......Just do something lively.`
` Like old times."`
`"Well now.`
` This liveliness you're talking about is probably from when we sisters were all together.`
` It may be difficult by myself.`
` ...Did you forget?"`
`"...That's right.`
` The Seven Sisters were really lively when they got together.`
` ...But with Ange's magical power now, I think summoning just Mammon is the best we can hope for.`
` The stakes for the other six have been lost."`
`"My apologies, Lady MARIA,`
` but maybe it would be possible to summon the Seven Sisters via my own stake.`
` ...If I am to be used, I'd hope Ange-sama has at least that much power, right...?"`
`Mammon grinned.`
`...Apparently, she wanted me to summon the other sisters without a vessel.`
`I see.`
`Since she's unable to satisfy herself with being summoned alone, she's asking for the other sisters to be summoned as well.`
`...I get it, greed.`
` Yes, she was like this back then, wasn't she...?`
`......To furniture, the times during which they are used are bliss.`
`No matter how badly they are exploited, being used is furniture's joy.`
`On the contrary, regardless of how nice you are to them, not being given a job is more painful than anything in their eyes.`
`Mammon spoke in a challenging way, but she wanted me to summon the other sisters somehow and rescue them from the world of nothingness.`
`......If that's the case, all she's gotta do is say so.`
`These demon people can never just say what they mean.`
`"......Ange,`
` don't overdo it.`
` You'll need plenty of rehabilitation just from summoning Mammon."`
`"Oh, I'll need to rehabilitate after just one?`
` Well, I'm just killing time anyway.`
` ......Okay, Mammon.`
` I've gone this far.`
` I'll call as many as I can."`
`"Really...?!`
` Not bad, Ange-sama!`
` Okay, quickly, quickly!"`
`Apparently, even though she'd asked, Mammon hadn't really expected Ange to do this.`
`She hopped around, badgering Ange to summon the other sisters.`
`...Summoning Mammon alone consumed a considerable amount of physical and magical power.`
`...It'll probably be pretty tough to do six more.`
`...I'm awed by the magical power of those who can summon sisters like this at will with a snap of their fingers...`
`and who therefore reach the level where they can be called witches.`
`"Mammon, don't make Ange overdo it.`
` She still isn't at her best..."`
`"Whaaat?!`
` Ange-sama said she'd summon everyone!"`
`Actually, I only said I'd call as many as I could.`
`...I guess that's greed for you.`
`"Don't overdo it, Ange.`
` You should rest for today.`
` You're tired enough."`
`"It's okay.`
` I'm just killing time anyway.`
` Let me get tired enough that I can just fall over asleep."`
`...This time, there's no vessel.`
`I'll have to strengthen the image from my knowledge of the grimoire...and materialize them with just that.`
`I held my hands out into the air, replaying in my head the sensation from when I'd summoned Mammon...`
`I'm acquainted with all of the Seven Sisters, right?`
`...I've gotta remember that time, long ago, `
`...when I talked with them......`
`Once again, ...the power of magic began to fill me up.`
`It let off a faint...and yet distinct pale light from both of my hands...`
`"Ange-sama...!`
` Hold on, hold on, good luck...!`
` Hey, Lady MARIA.`
` Ange-sama's definitely gonna summon everyone, right?`
` The Seven Sisters will get to be reunited again, right?`
` Right?!"`
`"Yeah, definitely.`
` ...But there's no guarantee that it'll happen tonight."`
`"Ange-sama can do it...!`
` Please, Ange-sama...!`
` Start with the youngest sister, Asmo...!"`
`"......Asmodeus.`
` The seventh sister.`
` ......Got it.`
` I'll call them in order starting from the youngest."`
`A strand of hot sweat dripped down from my forehead.`
`...This really is gonna be one hell of a burden to carry.`
`The pale light in this space...began to slowly form into the outline of a girl...`
`"......Come, arise.`
` One of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, Asmodeus of Lust..."`
`There was no vessel.`
`...However, as I held a strong conviction that she definitely did exist there as a core, ...her form began to crystallize...`
`Her outline became distinct, ......and the form of the youngest of the Seven Sisters, Asmodeus, was finally created.`
`"Asmodeus of Lust, right here...`
` ......Where is this?`
` Am I alive...?"`
`"Asmo...!!`
` I'm so glad!!"`
`"Mammon nee-san!`
` ...Where in the world is this?`
` Who summoned me?"`
`"Ange-sama did...!`
` Ange-sama said she'd revive all of us...!"`
`...No, I didn't.`
`"Ange-sama, thank you!`
` Do Belz next...!!`
` Please...!"`
`"...Beelzebub.`
` The sixth sister.`
` ...Beelzebub of Gluttony.`
` Come, arise..."`
`At this rate, ...I wonder how many I'll be able to summon.`
`If I can't focus, `
`...this is probably it.`
`The pale light made an outline......and formed into Beelzebub.`
`"Beelzebub of Gluttony, right here..."`
`'!s0`
`@:dwave_eng 0, rg7_4e10:`
`Mammon and Asmodeus jumped onto Beelzebub, celebrating their reunion.`
`...I'd summoned three people at once.`
`...My head was throbbing.`
`Gotta summon the next one, without stopping for a break.`
`"...Come, arise.`
` One of the Seven Stakes, Belphegor of Sloth..."`
`"Belphegor of Sloth, right here.`
` ......To think...that I would be needed again..."`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, rg6_4e18:`
` I mean, I'm so glad to see you again!!"`
`"To think that the Seven Sisters would be able to meet again...`
` Ange-sama, thank you so much!"`
`"Keep it up and do Satan-nee next!`
` And Levia-nee and Luci-nee...!!"`
`"......Yeah, `
`...I get it.`
` ...So please, try not to be so loud.`
` ...Doing four people at the same time...`
`is pretty...tough..."`
`"Ange, don't overdo it any more than this.`
` You did a good job summoning even four of them after such a long time."`
`"...Stop it, Mammon.`
` Right now, Ange-sama is being pressured with the burden of summoning us.`
` Ange-sama, I beg that you do not strain yourself too much..."`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, rg5_4e56:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, rg5_4e57:`
`...No, I...`
`"Right?!`
` Ange-sama?!`
` You said everyone would meet again!`
` You promised that we could meet again right away!"`
`".........`
`......That's right, ......I promised.`
` ...I didn't promise anything about when, ...but I certainly did...promise."`
`"So keep that promise!`
` If you don't, I'll never forgive you for forgetting it until today, Ange-sama...!"`
`".........`
`...Come, arise.`
` One of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, Satan of Wrath..."`
`My mind's getting hazy...`
` ...But...I'll call.`
`Even though I'd forgotten about those days.`
`Even though I've never thought of that time as anything but sad and lonely.`
`...Because the short time I spent with them...`
`...was fun, without a doubt.`
`"Satan of Wrath, right here.`
` ......What the hell are you people doing?!!`
` Don't you realize how much it's burdening Ange-sama just to let us have an idle chat?!"`
`Satan, who had apparently figured out the situation immediately after being summoned, cried out in a loud voice, telling her sisters off.`
`...That loud voice made my consciousness hazy again.`
`"We are furniture who have been granted rest by Beatrice and whose duty has been finished!`
` Not only are you not honored at being given another chance to be of some use, but you're putting a burden on our new master, you disgrace to all furniture!!`
` Erase yourselves right away!!"`
`"Yes, it's like Satan-nee says.`
` I'll erase myself.`
` You all erase yourselves too.`
` In this moment, that's the best way for us to be of use to Ange-sama."`
`"No way.`
` Not until everyone's summoned!"`
`"Same heeere!`
` I'm huuungry!`
` I mean, I'd hate to leave again so soon after being reunited with you all!"`
`"Don't be so selfish!!`
` Come on, erase yourself quickly!!`
` Come on, Asmo!`
` Disappear right now!!"`
`"Waaaah, Satan-nee's bullying me...!`
` It's not fair if you always bully the youngest one!"`
`"......Yes, they really are lively.`
` ...It doesn't......bore me..."`
`"That's enough.`
` You've surpassed your limits for now, Ange."`
`'!s1`
`right...`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, enj_4e718:`
`With five of them summoned...and messing around as they pleased,`
` the load was far too heavy for me, with the meager magical power I had at that moment...`
`...This is.........it...`
`As my consciousness went hazy, I fell over onto the bed.`
`...Have beds always felt this soft...?`
`.........`
`It seemed that the sisters were still squabbling together as much as they liked.`
`...For a way to kill time until drowsiness comes to get me, `
`...this is enough......`
`Feeling something warm and nostalgic in the sisters' liveliness, I sank into a world of deep sleep......`
`At the entrance to my dream world, I felt Maria onee-chan...`
`...and Sakutarou waiting to receive me.`
`"......`
`You worked hard.`
` ...And...good job."`
`『Uryu.`
` ...Welcome back, Ange...』`
`...Welcome back, huh?`
`Then, I should respond like this...`
`......I'm home......`
`That's right.`
` Just once in the past, I underwent training in order to step into the world of witches.`
`I accepted that the only power that could save me from those sad, painful days at Saint Lucia Academy...`
`was the thing called magic, and I received Maria's introduction to the basics...`
`"......Imagine...a vast space...`
` ...The scene from when I looked down at the mountain's base from a rest stop at the peak...`
` ......Like this...?"`
`I projected that scene from a memory into my mental world.`
`...Normal girls get over their fascination with magical girls when they leave elementary school.`
`So seriously training to use magic at this age...was embarrassing even for me.`
`But even that embarrassed feeling felt pleasant to me now.`
`Right then, I was learning mental concentration from Maria onee-chan, in order to use magic.`
`But it wasn't going very well.`
`...It was about as hopeless as teaching a person to wiggle their ears by showing them...`
`It seems that you need to imagine a vast space to gain the mental concentration for using magic.`
`So I remembered the time from my younger days when my family had gone on a small vacation, `
`when I had looked down towards the base from a viewing platform at a rest stop on a peak,`
` and I tried painting this scene in my mental world.`
`"No, still far too small.`
` Imagine a much, much wider space.`
` And create your own mental world.`
` Your image is still way too foggy.`
` There's no temperature in the air, and there's no wind.`
` No smells either.`
` The world is still very faint.`
` ...You can leave those for later, so for now, imagine an even wider space."`
`『Uryu.`
` ...Why do you have to imagine a vast space?』`
`"From the time of their birth, Humans have inside of them a toxin that blocks magic.`
` If that toxin isn't purified, you can't use magic well.`
` ...One effective method of achieving this is to imagine a vast space."`
`"......Just now, I thought of the world as seen from the window of an airplane, but that didn't work.`
` ...I can't even think of...`
`a world more vast than that."`
`『In that case, Maria just has to teach Ange about the vast world Maria has...!`
` Won't that make it easy for Ange to imagine as well?`
` Uryu!』`
`"...That's right.`
` And, I'm interested in the kind of world Onee-chan imagines when she uses magic.`
` ...I'll use it for reference."`
`"Uu-, that won't work.`
` The mental world must be vast and isolated.`
` A world with no obstructions other than yourself.`
` ...So, if you teach someone about that world, it won't be isolated anymore.`
` That's why you mustn't reveal your mental world to anyone.`
` And if you draw up a good mental world, you too must keep it as a secret only for yourself."`
`『Uryu...`
` So stingy, Maria...』`
`"Thanks, Sakutaro.`
` I guess there are no shortcuts in training.`
` ...I'll make an effort.`
` It's okay, I've been given plenty of hints."`
`『Uryu...!`
` Do your best, Ange...!』`
`Until recently, I thought there was no way something like magic could save me.`
`After all, magic doesn't exist in this world.`
`That kind of thing's supposedly nothing more than an illusion, a delusion, a daydream.`
`...However, Maria onee-chan showed me that she could fill her own world with happiness using a power that's impossible for me.`
`I used to look down on that happiness as something empty.`
`...Because I didn't believe in magic, I also denied everything else, refusing to believe in the happiness that magic gave birth to.`
`But slowly, bit by bit, Maria onee-chan's world grew happier.`
`In the past, I'd disparaged it, thinking it too pitiful to look at.`
`But...that might've been nothing more than jealousy.`
`I was forced to admit that.`
`And now, this was my first step in my search for happiness...`
`A vast space.`
`A dry wind that could blow without being blocked by anything.`
`...Let me feel that wind blowing through my own hair.`
`...I see, ...even the ground might get in my way as I am now.`
`Then, I don't need a ground.`
`......Brush the ground away, downwards, downwards.`
`In other words, ...it was as though I had floated up, leaving the ground far behind.`
`After pushing the ground further and further downwards, `
`...the ground grew foggy and faint, ...and for the first time, it began to feel like the sky.`
`......Then, I understood its vastness.`
`In that instant, I felt the vivid wind go right through even my body...in other words, blowing through me without any resistance.`
`"............`
`...Yes.`
` Maintain that sensation."`
`"...Yeah, I get it.`
` ...I get that I've been...released from all hinderances."`
`『You did it, Ange, you did it...!`
` You've taken your first step into the world of witches...!』`
`"......This is...the world of witches...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` So, let's try practicing the magic that you've always wished for, Ange.`
` ......Magic that'll summon friends.`
` ...A magic that'll create allies who'll save you from your loneliness, and thereby bring you happiness."`
`『Will Ange also be able to summon friends like me?!`
` Uryuuryu!』`
`"...As she is now, it's still far to early for Ange to summon friends like Sakutaro from the sea of zero.`
` ...To begin, let's start by practicing with friends that are easy to summon."`
`"......`
`...What will we start with...?"`
`"Because you're a witch of Mariage Sorcière,`
` you are also permitted to use those employed by other witches in the alliance.`
` ...For example, Sakutaro is my friend, but since you're in the same alliance,`
` he's your friend too, and you can summon him.`
` ...You wanna try summoning Sakutaro one of these days? When you're so lonely it gets tough, I'm sure Sakutaro will cheer you up."`
`I see.`
` You could call Sakutaro a being employed by Onee-chan.`
`So, as a witch in the same alliance as her, it's possible for me to summon Sakutaro too...`
`I met Sakutaro's gaze.`
`...How pleasant it would be to have him just be there by my pillow,`
` so he could talk to me a bit on lonely nights.`
`"...If I call out, will you appear...`
`and talk to me...?"`
`『Uryu-!`
` I can't wait to be summoned by you, Ange!`
` Uryuuryuuryu!』`
`Looking happy, Sakutaro pressed his head against me like a cat.`
`Suddenly getting a cute younger brother...felt a bit confusing, a bit embarrassing, and a bit nice.`
`......Unable to understand why I couldn't honestly accept this feeling, I felt tears well up in my eyes.`
`"Right.`
` ...I'll give it all I've got, Onee-chan."`
`"Then let's practice.`
` ......Let's try summoning the furniture of Beatrice, a witch from the same alliance."`
`"......Beatrice's...furniture."`
`Hearing Beatrice's name gave me a slightly strange feeling.`
`When it came to the crime on Rokkenjima, the public kept going on and on in a frenzy about how it was a sacrifice ceremony performed by a witch.`
`...And that witch was Beatrice.`
`So, if the witch did commit that crime,`
` ...that would make her the culprit who stole my family from me.`
`However, Maria onee-chan said that Beatrice was a good witch.`
`If I held negative emotions towards Beatrice,`
` she'd get mad, leading to a nasty fight, and refuse to talk for a while.`
`...At this moment, Onee-chan was my only close friend.`
`...So to avoid worsening her mood,`
` I'd decided to think of Beatrice as nothing more than Onee-chan's magic teacher...`
`...Also, I believed that the crime was a conspiracy cooked up by Aunt Eva.`
`...I would definitely expose the truth about that someday......`
`"Ange,`
` obstructions are entering your body again."`
`"......Sorry, I lost my concentration.`
` ...One more time..."`
`I'd expect no less from you, Onee-chan...`
`You instantly noticed that I was being overcome with idle thoughts.`
`After shaking my head just once, I re-imagined the wind blowing through a vast space...`
`"......The Seven Sisters of Purgatory?`
` That's a pretty creepy name."`
`"But they're very energetic and fun kids.`
` They might become your new friends, Ange.`
` ...First, I'll show you how to summon them.`
` Watch."`
`Maria onee-chan lifted both hands up to the level of her head...and quietly unified her mind.`
`...The state I wasn't able to reach except by meditating for a long period of time, she reached in the span of a few quick breaths.`
`Then, a pale light began to gather in her palms, ......and one by one, the girls began to show themselves.`
`1, 2, 3 people.`
` 4, 5, 6, 7 people...`
`The way they were summoned one after another in a line was a masterpiece.`
`...Incredible.`
`Just like the illustrations in Onee-chan's grimoire, ...the Seven Sisters of Purgatory...`
`The younger sisters were behind the eldest, Lucifer, who saluted Onee-chan.`
`"The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here...!`
` Lady MARIA, it has been quite some time."`
`"Yes.`
` Long time, no see.`
` Is everyone well...?"`
`"We furniture are what we are because we are used.`
` To us, being summoned after so long is truly an honor!"`
`"Kya-♪ Sakutaro-!`
` It's been so loong!"`
`"You look as delici-, I mean, cuuute as ever!!"`
`"Me fiiirst!!`
` Kya-, today he's so fluffy, squishy, and cuuute!"`
`"Aaah!!`
` Let me hug him too, let me hug him too!"`
`『U-Uryu-!`
` Can't breathe!`
` I won't run away, so let go of me, everyooone!』`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, rg3_4e12:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, rg3_4e13:`
`"...Even though you're saying that, it looks like you want to hug him the most, Satan-nee.`
` *giggle*."`
`"Ack!!@:dwave_eng 0, rg3_4e15:`
`"Hey!!`
` Be silent in the presence of Lady MARIA and Ange-sama, you foolish sisters!!"`
`They were so energetic...`
`I was shocked by their sudden burst of activity right after they appeared.`
`And on top of that, I was surprised that the innocent Sakutaro was on such good terms with the Seven Sisters.`
`"...That's unexpected.`
` To think that Sakutaro would be so loved by such shady people."`
`"They're fellow members of the same alliance.`
` There's nothing to be scared of, right?"`
`"But on the off-chance that their mood worsens, it looks like they could finish Sakutaro off in an instant..."`
`"It's all right.`
` The witches of the alliance and their furniture are all friends.`
` So Sakutaro can play without worrying.`
` ...Of course, that goes for you and me too, Ange."`
`It was one of the pacts of Mariage Sorcière.`
`"Mutual nonaggression and noninterference".`
`Member witches must respect each other's magic and creations.`
`Even the sisters, who were normally shady and belligerent, treated fellow alliance members as friends.`
`So, to the Seven Sisters, Sakutarou was a mutual friend.`
`He was loved by all of them, and they were even trying to steal him away from each other.`
`This scene as they squeezed him and loved him was a bit charming.`
`"...I see.`
` They're fellow members of Mariage Sorcière, after all."`
`At a glance, you'd think that Sakutaro's casual atmosphere and the Seven Sisters' shady one would be like water and oil.`
`It looked like they definitely wouldn't be compatible.`
`And yet, they were interacting in a friendly way like it was completely natural...`
`If this wonderful alliance could join all the peoples of the world together,`
` ...I wonder if everyone in the world would be able to become friends right away.`
`"All you Seven Sisters, listen.`
` Right now, Ange is in the middle of magic training.`
` So I want everyone to lend their power."`
`"Certainly, Lady MARIA.`
` ...But what specifically?"`
`"The magical power materializing you will move from me to Ange.`
` In that state, I want you to be by her side all the time.`
` You just have to talk with her."`
`"......My apologies, `
`but I wonder if Ange-sama's magical power will be able to easily summon all seven of us around the clock..."`
`The oldest sister, Lucifer, gazed at my complexion as she advised this, speaking reservedly.`
`...In other words, she was saying that the burden might be heavy for me at this point in time.`
`"That's the kind of training it is.`
` Ange has more talent and magic than everyone imagines.`
` It'll be pretty tough, but I think it's worth it for Ange to take this challenge as she is now."`
`"...Ange,`
` starting now, I'll move the magic power materializing them over to you.`
` ...In other words, it will become as though you had summoned them."`
`So, what Maria onee-chan was trying to say was something like this.`
`To keep the Seven Sisters materialized, you are continuously burdened with a significant amount of magical power.`
`...Maybe you could say it was like training while wearing a weighted wristband.`
`『Uryu...`
` Doing all of the Seven Sisters would be pretty tough...`
` Isn't that asking a lot of Ange all of a sudden...?』`
`"Thank you, Sakutaro.`
` But this is training to become a witch.`
` I want to see how far I can go."`
`...The seven of them certainly do seem boisterous.`
`But even if this is for training,`
` having them with me will surely distract me from my loneliness, at least a little.`
`I understood it would be an ordeal, but wanted to give it a shot.`
`"Don't overdo it if it gets tough, okay?`
` And everyone, if it looks tough for Ange, take it easy."`
`"Certainly.`
` Get it, everyone?!"`
`""""""Yeees, Onee-samaa!""""""`
`"Well then, Ange-sama.`
` For now, we, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, will become your furniture.`
` ......Lady MARIA, if you would."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...So, Ange,`
` can we start?"`
`"...Sure.`
` ...I'm a little nervous."`
`『Uryu...`
` This might be tough all of a sudden...`
` If you feel like you're getting a headache, lower your magic power immediately...』`
`"Okay, I'll move the source of magic power over to Ange......`
`........."`
`"......Nnn..."`
`In an instant, the inside of my head felt very heavy.`
`'!s0`
` Yeah, `
`......it's tough...`
`Until then, the inside of my head had only been used for myself.`
`It was almost like it was now being used for seven other people.`
`...If they just stood there and blinked once or let out a single sigh, that would put a strong pressure on my head...`
`"...Lady MARIA,`
` my apologies, but perhaps the burden from all Seven Sisters at once might be too great after all."`
`"...I-I'm okay......`
`...ack......"`
`"...No...`
` It won't work after all.`
` You're using all of your energy to materialize them.`
` There's no point if the burden is such that you can't balance it with your everyday life.`
` And anyway, this is a bit unrefined for a witch."`
`『Uryu...`
` That's why I said doing so many suddenly was impossible...`
` Everyone, erase yourselves for a bit...』`
`"Right.`
` It seems it'd be better to lower the number of people.`
` Asmo, erase yourself."`
`"Me agaain?`
` I'm opposed to youngest-sister-bullyiiing!!`
` Disappear starting from the top every once in a whiiile!"`
`"That would mean I'd have to disappear second, right?!`
` No, no, nooo!"`
`"Don't make a ruckus, Asmo and Levia-nee!!`
` That kind of disturbance will become a burden to Ange-sama!!"`
`'!s0`
`"Eek!"`
`"......Aah, ......ack...`
`...gah......"`
`The Seven Sisters started arguing over who should erase themselves first.`
`...The energy from that fight all became a burden, forcing Ange to bear an even greater headache...`
`In the end, they decided the order with rock, paper, scissors, and 1, 2, 3 of them disappeared.`
`But even at that level, Ange was still far from comfortable.`
`In the end, once six of them had erased themselves, I was finally able to calm my breathing.`
`With my magical power, forget the Seven Sisters, just one person is my limit...`
`"...Sheesh, this way it's not the Seven Sisters, but just me, right?`
` You're a bit unreliable, Ange-sama."`
`Mammon, who had won all of the rock, paper, scissors matches and was permitted to remain until the end, grumbled.`
`『Uryu...`
` Mammon, you shouldn't say things like that...`
` Ange is still just starting her training.`
` ...Are you all right, Ange?`
` Is your headache okay...?』`
`Sakutaro stretched up on his tiptoes, trying to pat Ange's head.`
`Watching this, Maria scratched her head, acknowledging that this sudden training had been too difficult.`
`"Uu-.`
` Maybe that was a little too much.`
` I'd be perfectly fine with this much though.`
` The more friends you have, the more fun it is."`
`"......Now I'm even more aware of how incredible you are, Onee-chan..."`
`Apparently, when one reaches Maria onee-chan's class, one can summon enough people to perform in an orchestra.`
`For a witch apprentice, that's awe-inspiring...`
`"Are you okay?`
` Ange-samaa?"`
`"......I'm sorry...`
` It looks like summoning you is the most I can do."`
`"Well, I guess I'm okay with that.`
` After all, of all the Seven Sisters, I get Ange-sama all to myself.`
` ...What do you think, Ange-sama?`
` If it's just me, will it be a burden for you?"`
`"No, I think I'll be able to manage you alone somehow..."`
`"Great!`
` Then please train a lot and cultivate your magic power a bunch.`
` Then someday, for sure, please bring the Seven Sisters together and let us serve you.`
` Promise?"`
`After confirming that, for the time being, her own materialization wasn't causing any issues, `
`Mammon immediately became cheery again and tried to make me promise to work harder.`
`I see, that definitely fits with her being Greed.`
`...But maybe you could also call it having a positive attitude.`
`"...Yes.`
` I promise.`
` ...I have to be able to do at least that much someday."`
`"Thank you, Ange-sama!`
` I, Mammon of Greed, will surely serve you until that day...!"`
`My headache finally abated, and I relaxed both hands, which had been clutching at my head.`
`Then Mammon stuck out her hand, helping me stand back up...`
`『Uryu?`
` ...Ah.`
` ...Maria, Ange, it's about that time.`
` If we don't return to the room, you'll be scolded.』`
`"......Huh?`
` ......Oh..."`
`I hadn't expected Sakutaro to talk about the time.`
`...I was brought back into reality.`
`As though the light had disappeared, the vast world sunk into the darkness, `
`......and I was in a tiny, tiny bathroom stall, sitting on a toilet...`
`Onee-chan's grimoire was open on my lap.`
`I looked at the clock.`
`...It was almost 20:00, time for lights out.`
`If I show up late for the roll call before lights out, not only will things get pretty annoying, but it'll cause trouble for my roommates and floormates.`
`...I couldn't care less about causing them trouble, but I don't want them messing with me later...`
`*sigh*......`
`My free time by myself is already over for today.`
`I'll sleep, wake up, tomorrow will begin, and another long, long gray-colored day will repeat again.`
`I closed the grimoire and rose from the toilet seat...`
`At that time, Onee-chan appeared again and spoke.`
`"...Hey, Ange.`
` You're forgetting your training.`
` ......Take Mammon with you."`
`I'd forgotten.`
`...The moment I'd returned to reality, Mammon's materialization had stopped...`
`One more time, I created a strong image of the existence of Mammon in my mind...`
`"Sheesh, you're so mean, Ange-sama.`
` Why'd you erase me so suddenly...?!`
` At this rate, you won't be able to call all Seven Sisters easily!"`
`"......I'm sorry.`
` I got careless."`
`"It's been incredibly long since I've materialized in the human world, so I'm interested in absolutely everything.`
` I'm getting a bit excited.`
` Where is this?"`
`"......The Saint Lucia Academy dormitory.`
` This is a stall in the shared bathroom.`
` ...Each room has its own bathroom, so no one comes here.`
` It's quiet, and perfect for reading books."`
`"So in this dorm, you have to hide in a toilet stall even to read a book?`
` Do they burn books or something?"`
`......`
`I have a two-person room, so my roommate is always there.`
`Our relationship is gloomy and it feels like I'm always getting ignored.`
`...The atmosphere's bad, so I really can't relax there.`
`And, as long as I'm not there, she can do what she likes, call her friends over and chat away.`
`It's more convenient for them too if I don't return until just before lights out.`
`There's also a library, but there's a group that uses it as a meeting place, and they're always talking behind my back.`
`So I don't like to go there.`
`...During lunch, it's the bushes behind the school building.`
`During the night, it's the stall in the shared bathroom in the dorms.`
`Those are the only hideaways where I can find peace...`
`I opened the door to the stall...and went out.`
`I turned around, signaling with my eyes for Mammon to come with me.`
`"......I don't really get it, but I realize it'd be hard to call this place pleasant for you, Ange-sama.`
` Let's go out quickly.`
` I hate the air here."`
`"Really?`
` ......I think the air here is the most decent."`
`When I left the bathroom and entered the corridor, `
`because it was near lights out time, several kids who had gone to play in other rooms were dashing back to their own.`
`When it came time for lights out, we had to change into uniform pajamas that we hated and called prison clothes,`
` line up in the hallway, and go through the dorm leader's roll call.`
`...On the off-chance that someone was late, `
`we would take collective responsibility, and all of the floormates would have to undergo punishment in the form of volunteer work...`
`As long as I avoided this, the girls would look at me coldly, but they wouldn't get in my way.`
`...That alone was enough for me.`
`Mammon looked at the passing kids and the furnishings of the dorm with interest.`
`...Without paying her any particular attention, I hurried back to my room.`
`In front of my room was my roommate, who had already changed into her prison clothes, chatting with some kids from the room next door.`
`When they noticed me hurrying back, the topic of their conversation noticibly changed.`
`They lowered their voices, stealing glances at me.`
`I acted like I didn't notice, went into my room, and changed.`
`Then I hastily went out into the corridor.`
`Everyone was already lined up.`
`"......Hey, this is weird.`
` I thought this was a school for rich girls.`
` It's like a prison.`
` It's stupid."`
`"You think so too?`
` That's what I think.`
` And unlike prison, you don't get out early for good behavior."`
`...After bad-mouthing the place, I noticed something.`
`Having someone to listen to your complaints...`
`feels surprisingly good.`
`Fortunately, Mammon's form can only be seen by her summoner, me.`
`And of course, there was no need to speak out loud for this conversation.`
`All I had to do was speak inside my mind, so no one could listen in.`
`......Magic...and the friends it creates...`
`might actually not be so bad.`
`"All of these people are sheltered brats.`
` Feels like they aren't even alive.`
` Kyahahaha."`
`"Stop it.`
` If you're seen by some chance, it'll be pretty bad, right...?"`
`"Humans without a fragment of hopes or dreams are like a lump of anti-magic.`
` There's no way they'll be able to see me.`
` Hah, you lower life-forms can't even see.`
` *giggle*giggle*!"`
`"......Are you okay being around so many Humans with that magic-resisting toxin?"`
`"I'm fine as long as you continue to make me materialize, Ange-sama.`
` ...Although, since you'll probably have to keep concentrating to materialize me, there's a chance you'll neglect your daily life.`
` ...Look, that girl you're sharing a room with is calling you, right?"`
`"...Huh?`
` ......Oh-"`
`"Ushiromiya-san, are you listening?`
` About our weekly duties starting next week..."`
`...She's probably trying to push a few more chores onto me.`
`My roommate, who never even looked me in the eye normally, was smiling at me unpleasantly.`
`But it'll be easier to have the weekly duty pushed onto me alone, rather than doing it together with her.`
`That's a small price to pay to have her continue to ignore me non-stop...`
`Even so, with a completely shameless excuse,`
` she sidestepped the issue for some reason and insisted on flipping the situation around, as though I should've come forward and done it of my own initiative.`
`...One of the special traits of this academy is that it's full of girls who don't know how to ask a favor.`
`"...That kid.`
` She pisses me off.`
` I'd love to just gouge her right in the forehead."`
`"Yeah.`
` I hope you do, one of these days."`
`.........`
`...Yeah.`
`Having a friend nearby all the time to complain to...makes me happier than I thought it would.`
`It really was lively with all the Seven Sisters gathered together.`
`...I'm sure just watching them mess around will be a lot of fun.`
`...I want to gain enough magical power to summon all the Seven Sisters at once, and soon.`
`'!s0`
`......and finally summon...`
`the thing I really want to find.`
`"......?`
` What is it you really want to summon, Ange-sama?"`
`Mammon noticed my conversation with myself inside my head and asked about it blankly.`
`I hesitated to talk about it, but then figured that there was no reason to hide it and told her.`
`".........My family.`
` ......Dad.`
` Mom.`
` Onii-chan."`
`"So you mean...the souls of the dead...?`
` Calling a resident of another world is summoning, but calling back the souls of the dead is called resurrection, and they're completely different.`
` ...Resurrection is supposed to be a very high-level magic."`
`I know.`
`...So much so that even Maria onee-chan can't do it at all.`
`But that's the thing I want to find with magic...the most.`
`...I've been warned that it's a very difficult, high-level magic.`
`...So great that, in the worst case, I might not necessarily reach that point even after training for my whole life.`
`Furthermore, I have no vessel.`
`A vessel is vital for making magic succeed, whether it's summoning or resurrection.`
`Because I don't have that, ......a magic that would already have been difficult is now hopeless.`
`That's right.`
` I have nothing to remember Dad or Mom by.`
`However, ...by an extraordinary coincidence...`
`I do have something to remember just Onii-chan by.`
`And that's......this.`
`"...That hair accessory with the pink jewel?`
` What the hell... I hate to say it, but it looks a little cheap for you, Ange-sama."`
`"Long ago, without telling Dad,`
` I went with Mom to meet Onii-chan, and we went to play at an amusement park.`
` ...This is a prize from the crane game there."`
`I know it's cheap, I realize that it doesn't match my style, and I get that it's too childish.`
`...But this hair accessory is the only thing that makes me feel as though Battler onii-chan is by my side.`
`The glass case had been filled with plastic capsules packed with fun-looking things.`
`It seemed that each capsule had some cute accessory in it.`
`The game was to grab those with the crane, ...but I was young and it was too hard for me.`
`I tried it several times, but I didn't even get close.`
`Mom said that whatever was inside was probably cheap anyway, and we didn't even know what we'd get,`
` so there was no point in getting all upset over it.`
`But whether it was something cheap or not wasn't the problem.`
` ...The process of grabbing happiness with my own hands felt really important and sacred to me.`
`So I wanted the cheap thing inside more than anything.`
`Then, Battler onii-chan came over after finishing a game of shooting soldiers with a gun...`
`and tried to do it for me.`
`...With his arms that were longer than mine, Onii-chan grasped the happiness that I couldn't reach.`
`...Onii-chan really was coordinated.`
`It seems he often played with his friends at the arcades.`
`After only one or two attempts, he grasped that thing on the other side of the glass with the crane that I hadn't even been able to touch...`
`...and threw it into the exit chute.`
`When Onii-chan tossed me that capsule,`
` I remember that he looked very, very reliable.`
`For several days, I felt like opening the capsule would be a waste.`
`Then, one day, I finally opened it up.`
`...And what revealed itself inside...was this pink-jeweled hair accessory.`
`Since that day...`
`It's been a symbol for Onii-chan.`
`Since I was young, I felt that having all four of us gathered, including Battler onii-chan,`
` was a precondition for a happy family.`
`So I wanted Onii-chan and Dad to make up quickly.`
`...In my own way, I'd treated this hair accessory as a charm for bringing my whole family together.`
`So I always used to wear it.`
`I wanted to feel my reliable, fun, and wonderful Onii-chan by my side all the time...`
`and let him live in our house.`
`"But...my memories of Onii-chan...are very distant.`
` ...I can't do it as easily as Maria onee-chan created Sakutarou from a lion stuffed animal.`
` ...One day, I'll surely possess the high-level magic to revive the souls of the dead.`
` And the only key...the only vessel...that can make that successful is this."`
`"............`
`...I see.`
` I did feel an incredible magical power from that hair accessory. So that's what it was."`
`"Magical power...?`
` There's magical power in this thing Onii-chan gave me...?"`
`"Maybe I should say that it resides in you, Ange-sama.`
` ...Your strong desire to call your brother gives you magical power.`
` ...Resurrection certainly is a high-level magic,`
` but there can be no mistake that you're steadily and unconsciously climbing the stairs towards it."`
`"......I'm glad.`
` It's nice to hear someone other than myself acknowledge that."`
`Your own effort isn't something that you can observe by yourself.`
`In that sense,`
` ...even though these words came from a shady demon girl who controls one of the seven deadly sins, `
`...they made me very happy.`
`"Well, I can't guarantee that you'll obtain the resurrection magic before your life is over.`
` ...However, your power as a witch is proportional to the height of the mountain you dare to climb.`
` If you don't lose heart, I'm sure you'll rival even our former master, Beatrice,`
` as a Great Witch someday."`
`"...I wonder if I can.`
` I wonder if I can become a Great Witch and revive Onii-chan...`
`no, my family."`
`"The Witch of Resurrection, Lady ANGE...!`
` Kyaah, wonderful!`
` A Witch of Resurrection is a very rare kind of witch.`
` Having a master like that would make me pretty proud.`
` Actually, I'd love for that to happen.`
` Because furniture's worth is also proportional to the class of its master!"`
`"Please pass Beatrice-sama up and become a peerless Great Witch!`
` As a representative of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, I'll support you from the bottom of my heart! Kyaha!"`
`......I'd thought that if a magical friend were to appear for me too, a cute kid like Sakutarou would be best.`
`But even this fifth sister of the shady Seven Sisters who controlled the seven deadly sins...`
`was enough to calm my heart so much all by herself.`
`...Maria onee-chan has probably known that since long ago.`
`That's why she recommended the world of witches to me over and over and over again.`
`And I kept on stubbornly rejecting her...`
`I should've given in and started my training as a witch sooner.`
`A year for a child is worth ten years for an old person, ...right...?`
`Now I find my past self, which only ever complained, deplorable for wasting my precious time.`
`Long after I turned off the lights and slipped into bed, Mammon continued to talk to me alongside my pillow.`
`...I promise.`
`One day, for sure, I'll develop a magical power that can summon the Seven Sisters.`
`And I'll let them have a lively and fun time.`
`The seven of them make a single whole.`
`...None can be left out.`
`Family must be together.`
`I must...bring them together......`
`"............"`
`My awareness began to return slowly.`
`Unable to stand watching Aunt Rosa and Maria onee-chan's relationship,`
` ...I ran away from Beato's and Onii-chan's game, didn't I...?`
`...I've got to go back.`
`I've got to go back, support Onii-chan, and quickly bring him back from this strange world of the witch's game.`
`After all, as long as I'm here, ...I'm not allowed to call myself Ange.`
`...At that time, I felt someone's presence.`
`When I turned around, ......I could see Mammon there.`
`"Gretel-sama,`
` Beatrice-sama said that if you do not return soon, it will become a hindrance to the progression of the game.`
` I beg that you return swiftly."`
`"......Thank you.`
` ...I'll go back now."`
`"Isn't it great?"`
`"What is...?"`
`"That you were able to meet Battler onii-chan."`
`"......Is that sarcasm?"`
`"Well, if that's how it sounds, feel free to call it that."`
`"......I'm sorry.`
` I should've taken it literally.`
` ...Yeah, you're right.`
` Even in this screwed up world, being able to meet Onii-chan makes me happy from the bottom of my heart."`
`"And you'll win against Beatrice, for your Onii-chan's sake...?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...Can't have him playing around in a world like this forever.`
` ...It's about time for him to return home.`
` That's why I came to call him."`
`"......Please do the best you can.`
` Although I can't support you, since my current master is Beatrice-sama."`
`"I know.`
` Until October 5, 1986, ...you are Beatrice's furniture.`
` And eventually, you'll become my friend."`
`"But eventually, you'll throw that friend away.`
` After all, ...ng, ......gah..."`
`Mammon moaned as if she'd bit her tongue, staggering as she clutched her chest.`
`Apparently, the rules apply to people other than me as well.`
`"Are you okay?`
` It's pretty...painful."`
`".........`
`...Excuse me, `
`G-Gretel-sama."`
`"No.`
` Thank you."`
`"......?`
`"I'm glad.`
` Glad I was able to meet Onii-chan.`
` That's my answer to your first question.`
` ......Well, let's go back.`
` If I grumble too much, you'll get in trouble with your current master."`
`"Yes.`
` I'm glad you understand.`
` Well then, thi`
`".........Mammon?`
` ......Huh?"`
`I'm sure Mammon was about to say "Well then, this way..."`
`But then, ...she stopped, as though the film had been torn off at that point.`
`It looked like she'd suddenly frozen.`
`...Then, I noticed.`
`She wasn't the only thing that had frozen.`
`...Even the air and floating bits of dust had frozen in place in empty space.`
`A world where it seemed even time had frozen.`
`...Yes.`
` This looks like a portent that Bernkastel will appear.`
`But the atmosphere was different somehow.`
`Then, I understood.`
`......It wasn't Bernkastel.`
`...It was the other witch.`
`"How are you feeling, Ange...?"`
`"......Lambdadelta.`
` ...The rules don't apply to you, do they?"`
`"Of course not.`
` Rules exist to bind others.`
` What kind of idiot would bind themselves with them?"`
`Bernkastel is a witch who supports me, ...but this girl is different.`
`This witch supports Beatrice.`
` ...In other words, she's a being on the opposing side.`
`But there's some kind of difference between her and Beatrice.`
`Even compared to Bernkastel, there's something strange about Lambdadelta's existence.`
`...It's...how should I put it...`
` Maybe like she's a being from a higher dimension...`
`In any event, I was still unsure about how to deal with her.`
`...The only thing that was certain was that she was my enemy.`
`...No, just knowing that might be enough, but...`
`"So, ...do you have some business with me?"`
`"Not really.`
` When I listened in on your conversation, it started to get a bit interesting.`
` I thought I'd let you hear something good."`
`"You're supposed to be my enemy.`
` I can't think of a reason for you to tell me something that'd help me.`
` So the moment I start listening to you, I lose.`
` Bye, <see you next time>."`
`"Don't misunderstand.`
` My opponent is Bern, not you.`
` ...In other words, it's possible for there to be a topic that benefits both you and me."`
`".........Sorry,`
` but I don't feel like listening."`
`...Although I said that, `
`I probably won't be released from this frozen time until Lambdadelta is satisfied.`
`...This itself might be proof that she's in a higher dimension than me.`
`I haven't been given the option of not listening to her.`
`All I can do is try not to be shaken by anything she says...and strengthen my mental guard.`
`She'll probably try to make me believe something disadvantageous to me,`
` threatening me...`
`"*giggle*giggle*`
` There's no need to square off like that.`
` I just came to resolve your misunderstanding.`
` ...No, that's not quite it.`
` I came to let you know about the lie Bernkastel told you."`
`"......Bernkastel......lied?"`
`"Didn't Bern make it sound like your big brother would come back if you defeated Beato?"`
`"......`
`Who knows.`
` ...I don't feel like talking with you."`
`My brother coming home...`
` I hadn't been promised anything that dream-like.`
`Getting just one person only if I was lucky...had been a promise without very high hopes.`
`But that's enough for me.`
`...After being promised an eternity of isolation,`
` having a faint but still non-zero chance was like a shining beacon.`
`"In a way, that promise of Bern's wasn't a lie.`
` ...If Bern promised, then I'm sure that if you defeat Beato, Battler and your parents will be released and will come back to you."`
`"Then there's no problem."`
`"......Seriously?`
` ......That kid is surprisingly cruel.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~To think she'd deceive you, even though she knows~ib~."`
`"......How are you saying I was deceived?"`
`Damn...`
`I'm letting her take the initiative.`
`...But I won't be released until I lend an ear to her.`
`...So it's something I'll have to hear anyway...`
`Even though I realized I was falling into a trap, I urged her forwards.`
`"What year is it now?"`
`"...You're talking about the world of the game board?`
` ...In that case, it's October 4, 1986."`
`"That's right.`
` So if you win against Beato, then on October 6, when the typhoon has passed, the people who were trapped on the island will return.`
` ...On October 6, 1986, that is, right?"`
`"......So what?"`
`"How was your October 6, 1986?`
` ......You were at your relatives' house, right?"`
`...I'd been at the house of the only Sumadera my mother trusted, Grandpa.`
`......We got a call.`
`When I was playing with building blocks in the tatami room, we got that call...`
`'!s0`
`...Lambdadelta laughed unpleasantly...`
`and spoke.`
`"HEY.`
` ON YOUR OCTOBER 6, 1986, DID BATTLER ONII-CHAN COME HOME?"`
`'!s0`
`Even though I didn't understand what she was saying, I noticed an unpleasant sweat seeping out all over my face...`
`...Aaah, I don't get it.`
` I DON'T GET IT.`
`...What is...this witch saying......?`
`"See?`
` If you defeat Beato, Battler will certainly be released.`
` And he'll probably return home.`
` To his home in 1986.`
` After all, that's how it is, right?`
` Battler was locked up from the 4th to the 5th of October in 1986.`
` It's only natural that he'd return the next day if he were to be released, right?`
` ...And you?`
` You're a person from the year 1998.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` You're Ushiromiya Ange of the year 1998 where ~ib~Battler did not return~ib~.`
` Know what that means?"`
`"......What...are you talking about?`
` ......If my family came back home on October 6, ...wouldn't that be wonderful?`
` I'd come home from Grandpa's house right away.`
` And then we'd meet.`
` ...Everyone would be happy..."`
`"Yes.`
` Ushiromiya Ange probably would be reunited with her family.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ...~ib~The six-year-old Ushiromiya Ange from 1986~ib~ would, right...?"`
`"......Who am I?"`
`"Ushiromiya Ange.`
` An eighteen-year-old one.`
` ......No, that's not it.`
` You aren't Ushiromiya Ange.`
` You're a witch's piece with that name.`
` Strictly speaking, the name ANGE Beatrice belongs to a completely different person.`
` ...Know what that means?"`
`I don't...really get it anymore...`
`......Huh?`
` ...Huh?`
` ...Who...`
`...am I?`
` ......Huh?`
`"...And thaaat's why I think Bern's cruel.`
` No, I think she's a meanie.`
` Especially since it's not like she hasn't gone through the same thing herself."`
`'!s1`
`...being tricked...`
`......somehow......?"`
`"Yeah, but please don't blame Bern, okay?`
` After all, depending on how you look at it, that kid isn't lying.`
` ...If Beato is defeated, your family will be returned.`
` Returned to Ushiromiya Ange.`
` ...But she probably didn't say that this Ushiromiya Ange would be you, right...?"`
`Was it like that...was it like that...?`
`What did Bernkastel say to me, again...?`
`Your assistance is required.`
`...Your family needs it.`
`Bernkastel started by saying that.`
`Then I spoke.`
`If I save them, does that mean my family will come home?`
`...And how did Bernkastel answer that, again...?`
`Umm, umm...`
`'...I cannot promise that.'`
`U-Umm...!`
`She did make me a promise.`
`In exchange for accepting this fight...!`
`Yes, this is what she said!`
`'In exchange, I will search for a Fragment with the ideal world that you wish for, `
`a world where your family comes home.'`
`......Yeah, that's right.`
`...She didn't say any more than that she'd look for it.`
`She didn't say she'd find it.`
`...But...I was prepared for that from the beginning.`
`But even so, ...that child promised that as long as I didn't give up, there was a faint chance of it happening...`
`And, ...in the end, she said this.`
`'I'm giving you a chance for revenge.`
` ...In exchange, I promise to search for and bring you the happiest resolution among the possibilities you're capable of accepting.'`
`".........`
`...I've known it was a tough bet from the very beginning.`
` ...After all, I have no family in my 1998.`
` Even just a small chance of shaking that absolute zero...`
`would be worth it.`
` I was warned beforehand that even if I succeeded in my revenge, it might be a wasted effort.`
` ...So, ......umm......"`
`"Yeah, there's no lie in that part.`
` Beato's game board is perfect.`
` Even having you around `
`makes the chances of Beato losing so slim that it's doubtful you could even dream of it happening once in your life."`
`"In other words, your chance of winning is almost zero, so absolutely that it could be regarded as infinitely close to zero.`
` So, Bern can be forgiven for saying that part in such an evasive way."`
`"...But I can say for sure that she was tricking you when she let you get your hopes up.`
` After all, even if you could overcome astronomical odds and win, `
`the person your family will come back to isn't you.`
` It's the six-year-old Ange that exists in this 1986, the true Ushiromiya Ange.`
` Not YOU."`
`"...Bern will still probably go around the billions of Fragments, searching for the best world for you.`
` But didn't she tell you?`
` That she planned on bringing it to you as a present, but wasn't able to find it?"`
`"......She did..."`
`"Hehheheheheh, *giggle*giggle*giggle*...!!`
` You're finally starting to notice, aren't you...?`
` No reward has been prepared for you in this battle.`
` No, to the contrary, when smashed, Beato's game board will disappear.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` Then `
`~ib~you, as a piece, will disappear~ib~`
`."`
`"......The sort of goal you'd be capable of accepting is completely...`
`......no.`
` I'll proclaim it upon my name.`
` Upon the name of the Witch of Certainty, Lambdadelta!`
` I proclaim that it 'certainly' doesn't exist...!"`
`".........That can't be......"`
`"That's what Bern lied about.`
` ...Or should I call it speaking in riddllles?`
` She made you misunderstand and think you could be saved.`
` I came to clear that up."`
`"......In other words, `
`...no matter how hard I fight, `
`no matter how hard I pursue victory,`
` ...my family won't come back to me......?"`
`"Right, they won't come back!`
` With 'certainty'!`
` Ohohohohohoh!!`
` The Witch of Certainty says it with certainty!`
` Isn't this incredible?`
` Several ancient kings have dedicated historical buildings to me because they wanted me to give them certainty!`
` And here I am, graciously giving it to you as a present.`
` Isn't this reeally incredible, cute and marvelous?`
` Ohohohohohh!!`
` Buut!`
` I have a single good proposition for you."`
`......Damn.`
`...I'm getting completely overwhelmed...`
`I knew I shouldn't have listened, ...and now I'm starting to be overwhelmed by this witch, Lambdadelta...!`
`"My opponent is Bern, not you.`
` Didn't I just say it's possible for the two of us to talk about something that benefits us both?`
` I've said that from the beginning.`
` So listen to me.`
` You have no choice...!"`
`'!s1`
`...I'll listen...`
` ...I've just gotta listen, right?!!"`
`I finally lost control over my emotions and exploded from the inside.`
`I don't have a clue anymore.`
`...I believed that I was Ange.`
`But at some point, I stopped being Ange.`
`That's right, I'm ANGE.`
` Not Ange...!`
`Who am I?`
`I'm not my parents' child, nor my brother's little sister.`
`...I'm just a piece...in a witch's game...!`
`"There's no need to be so pessimistic.`
` ...I mean, think about it, okay?`
` Right now, you're together with Battler onii-chan.`
` While it's true that you can't tell him your name, `
`at least you're positioned as his ally in a game where he battles a witch, `
`...and you're able to be with him for all eternity.`
` ...Know what it meeeans...??"`
`......I can't stand it, `
`......but I understand...`
`In other words, ......as long as Onii-chan keeps getting a tie in this game, it will continue forever.`
`Continuing to tie means continuing the game for eternity,`
` and it means that I can remain with Onii-chan as a piece.`
`...But if Onii-chan wins...or loses, and the curtain closes on the game...`
`"You, as a piece, will disappear."`
`"............"`
`"How do you define happiness for a game piece?`
` ...Getting used by someone playing the game, nothing more.`
` You won't find it when the game's shut in a closet, gathering dust, right?"`
`...In the past, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory said it as well.`
`Furniture's happiness comes from being used, not being stored away.`
`'!s0`
`@`
`...the witch's...`
`...furniture.`
`"Let's change things around a bit.`
` ...To be honest, I want this game to continue in a tie for all eternity.`
` An unending game is an eternal cage.`
` ...An absolute closed room that never opens for all time and that'll finally make Bern surrender."`
`"...You know, Beato does want to win a bit.`
` Victory by making Battler surrender.`
` But that's actually a problem for me."`
`"After all, if the game ends, the closed room'll fall apart.`
` ...So I'll go easy on Battler a bit, to stop him from surrendering.`
` Don't worry, okay?`
` When Battler's about to surrender, I'll become his ally."`
`"......But you know?`
` I get the feeling that Beato is faintly starting to realize.`
` ...I think she's starting to realize that her victory won't come for all eternity in this game."`
`"But she is, of course, the Endless Witch.`
` Beato's stupid, so she optimistically thinks that even so, she'll surely win eventually, `
`like she just has to repeat this game on and on endlessly.`
` Of course, pretty much all blondes are morons, *giggle*giggle*!"`
`'!s1`
`......there will never be...`
`a victory or a loss..."`
`"I won't let her win.`
` And I won't let her lose.`
` With certainty!`
` ...Bern noticed that.`
` So, she looked for the most powerful piece for breaking that deadlock, found you, and threw you in.`
` To make this game end, you see?"`
`"......To make this game...end..."`
`"What's a piece's role when the game ends?`
` ......I'll state it clearly.`
` Your existence is a contradiction.`
` ...Your reason for existing is to bury yourself in the darkness and despair...!"`
`My goal is to defeat Beato and release my captive family.`
`...And yet, even if I succeed, I won't be rewarded.`
`"You cannot lose.`
` And you won't be rewarded if you win.`
` ...So, I've brought you a third choice.`
` And that choice will make our interests coincide."`
`......Continuing the tie...for all eternity......`
`"Yes.`
` ...As long as the tie continues forever, this world will not crumble.`
` ...What is this world?`
` ......It's the world of the game with the witch.`
` A world where Beato and Battler fight for all eternity.`
` ...And at the same time, `
`it's a world where you get to be with Battler for all eternity...!!"`
`'!s1`
`......aaaah`
`...ah`
`......"`
`My head was spinning.`
`That confusion became a hot liquid, and I felt it pouring from my eyes...`
`It was so hot...that it felt like it'd burn my face...`
`"Riight...?`
` ANGE Beatriiiiice...??`
` Since Bernkastel's goal is to end the game and end the world where you and Battler can interact, why should you be her ally...?"`
`"...That kid tricked you, you see?`
` She made it look like you might be saved if you became her piece.`
` But I won't deceive you there!"`
`"...So I'll say it, ANGE.`
` Become my chess piece.`
` Unlike Bern, I won't offer you rewards based on lies that certainly will never be granted.`
` As long as you become my piece and help me so that this world 'certainly' never ends...`
` Then with 'certainty', I'll swear upon my name that this world will 'certainly' continue!"`
`"That's not all.`
` I'll add on a bonus.`
` This rule that binds you.`
` ...I'll clear it away for you.`
` Well, of course, I'll only do it after you've sworn to become my piece, okay?"`
`In my own throat, ...there was a thick, loud gulping sound...`
`Aah, I shouldn't have listened...`
`If I hadn't listened, I could've remained an innocent little sister, praying for my brother's victory.`
`...But I might be different now.`
`...I might've been degraded into a witch's furniture, `
`......one that cares about nothing but being by Onii-chan's side...`
`"...I'm not telling you to betray your brother, okay?`
` If it looks like Battler's gonna lose, you can save him with all you've got.`
` ...On the other hand, when Battler closes in on Beato too much, I want you to hold back a little.`
` ...That's all I'm asking, all right?"`
`"Don't worry, there's no need to actually betray Battler.`
` ...Battler can't win against Beato alone.`
` That's why Bern threw you in, you see?`
` ...As long as you don't lend a hand, Battler will be unable to win against Beato for all eternity."`
`"See?`
` It's really simple, isn't it?`
` ...*giggle*giggle*, hohhohohoho, ahhahahahahahah, ahhahhahhahhahhahha!`
` Kahhahhahhahha, kyaaahhahahahahaha, hahhhahahahahahahha!!"`
`"Hey!!`
` That's miiine!`
` Giiive iiit baaack!!"`
`"No, no, I'll eat iiit!`
` Asmo, Asmo, pass!"`
`"Kya-hahahaha!`
` Over here, Levia onee-samaaa!"`
`I wonder where they swiped it from.`
`They were fighting over a donut or something, playing around really loudly.`

`"Yelling stuff like that makes you the loudest one, Satan! Be silent!!`
` You foolish little sister!"`
`"Y-You're the loud one, Lucifer onee-sama!!`
` I-Is there something you'd like to say to me?!"`
`I was already used to the oldest and the third oldest sister arguing with each other.`
`Even though they're both so quick to anger, it's a bit funny how they're both having to hold back a little.`
`They might be surprisingly like each other.`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` You were told to be noisy, but this is a bit too much.`

`"You like to read, Mammon?`

` Still, she wants to keep that knowledge all for herself, so be warned that she refuses to let people read any book you give her, and sometimes burns them after reading them."`
`"I like knowing things that no one else knows.`
` I like being able to do things that no one else can do.`
` So I like studying and practicing.`
` Because I want to keep wisdom that no one else knows about all to myself."`
`As Mammon said that, her eyes sparkling, `
`she peered down at the page that was open and read through it again.`
`You could see the greed that made her covet that page even more thoroughly than I did.`
`As you can see, my magical power has grown much stronger than it was on the first day I summoned them.`
`By now, I've gotten so that I can summon all of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory at once and still calmly read a book like this.`
`This place, although I can't recall exactly where it is, is a quiet and calm street-side bench.`
`I'd been young back then, so I don't remember the details of its location.`
`...Still, I remember that my days walking here were a lot of fun.`
`Together with Dad, Mom, ...and even Onii-chan,`
` it was a memory of a very rare and very happy day when everyone had been together...`
`The people who walked by every once in a while didn't notice me.`
`They just pleasantly ignored me and passed by as though everything was normal.`
`Even the Seven Sisters' incredible outfits weren't embarrassing or anything,`
` because it wasn't like anyone was actually watching.`
`Come to think of it, I'm getting pretty used to it.`
` As long as they don't make me wear those.`
`I was sitting on a stylish bench, memorizing a timeline for world history.`
`...In an academy system where everything is based on collective responsibility, there's no tolerance for dunces.`
`It seemed that I was considerably below the average grade for the class.`
`According to those extremely intellectual girls,`
` if I alone improved my grade, the average would rise drastically.`
`...They had been kind enough to show me with a graph drawn by colorful pens on a B4 sheet of drawing paper.`
`...Just thinking of the effort it had taken to draw that was repulsive.`
`But I've already spat out all those complaints.`
`...I've already voiced my constant and furious anger and sadness to these girls here.`
`The Sisters `
`were sometimes indignant, `
`sometimes sympathetic, `
`and sometimes mourned along with me.`
`...I was truly happy to be able to share emotions like that with friends.`
`It's said that they were originally furniture that existed to carry out Beatrice's cruel sacrifice ceremony.`
`...According to the occult message bottle I hated, `
`...it seems that several of them even attacked my family.`
`But I don't believe that, and it's pointless to question them about it.`
`They are furniture, so they only respond to their master's requests.`
`Even if they really did attack my family, I can't hate them.`
`'!s0`
`was the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
`......Or else that ringleader of the Ushiromiya Suspicion, `
`Aunt Eva.`
`"...Ange-sama, quickly, the next page."`
`"Oh, sorry.`
` ......I'm tired.`
` Mind if I take a break?"`
`"Kyahaha!`
` Ange-sama said break!"`
`"Let's play, let's play!`
` Ange-sama, let's plaaay!!"`
`When they noticed that I had interrupted my studying, the most energetic youngest sisters gathered around me.`
`And that wasn't all.`
`Even Maria onee-chan and Sakutaro showed themselves.`
`They had probably been very close by, but they must've hid themselves so that they wouldn't interrupt my studying.`
`『Uryu-!`
` Ange!`
` How's studying? How's studying?』`
`"Kyaaah!!`
` Sakutaro-!!`
` How are yooooouu?!"`
`"Wait a second!`
` Let me squeeze him tooooooooooo!!"`
`'!s0`
` Kyaa, cute, cute!"`
`『Ukyuu--, you're crushing meee!`
` Uryuu--!』`
`"Your luck ran out when you showed up while all the Seven Sisters were gathered.`
` Give up and let us hug you."`
`"Come on!`
` It always turns out this way!!`
` I apologize for my stupid older and younger sisters...!"`
`"Ahahahahaha.`
` Sakutaro's happy to meet everyone, too.`
` ...How's it going, Ange?`
` How's the studying going?"`
`"Thanks.`
` Well, not bad.`
` They were nice enough to pass around printouts from a quiz that another class took earlier.`
` Their beautiful sense of solidarity is enough to bring tears to my eyes.`
` ...Well, at least it's probably better to put a timeline into my head."`
`『Uryu.`
` You sure are good at studying, Ange.`
` You'll be able to get a lot of points, uryu-.』`
`"Good work.`
` I was terrible at studying, so I'm jealous of you for being able to get a good score when you study hard."`
`"You're joking.`
` When it comes to English, Latin, and knowledge of the occult,`
` you're much more amazing for being able to remember so much."`
`"I can remember anything when studying magic, but I can't remember anything boring.`
` So that didn't help at all for tests."`
`"Well, it's true that occult knowledge would be like that, but your grades must've been pretty good in English, right?"`
`"In the first year of elementary school, on a Japanese language test,`
` there was a problem when I was given a picture of a gun and was told to write its name in four squares.`
` It got marked wrong because I wrote the English word 'rifle' in katakana (ライフル)."`
`"Why?`
` Doesn't that fit?"`
`"It was supposed to be the Japanese word for gun in hiragana, ~ib~てっぽう~ib~.`
` I was told that's wrong, because you don't learn katakana in first grade.`
` ...I didn't really get it,`
` so from that day on, on tests, I wrote everything in hiragana.`
` But I got in trouble with Mama for some reason.`
` Got in trouble with the teachers too."`
`".........`
`...You were probably born in the wrong country, Onee-chan."`
`"Then I'd rather have been born in a country of witches, so I could enter a witch school.`
` Uu-."`
`『If that happened, you might've had much, much more wonderful magical friends!`
` Uryu-!』`
`"Uu-♪`
` But it's not like I mind it now.`
` After all, I can use lots of magic, and I've got a lot of magic friends.`
` Sakutaro is all I need."`
`『I'm not the only one!`
` There's also Sakusuke and Sakukichi, the animal band, Shimoda-kun the seal, Sanae-san the rabbit, Mr Pig-kun, and plenty more!』`
`...Incredible.`
`The number of Onee-chan's friends keeps increasing.`
`Every time I ask, the number of names for her friends grows.`
`But there's no doubt that Sakutaro is her best friend.`
`...I'm a little jealous of all those close friends.`
`"...What do you think?`
` How are the Seven Sisters?`
` Do you get along with them?"`
`"Those sisters are really energetic.`
` They sometimes say shady stuff, but they aren't bad.`
` ...I'd wanted to get a cute kid like Sakutaro, but I think being with them now is more than enough."`
`"*giggle*`
` If you learn more of my Magic of Origins, I'm sure you'll be able to give birth to friends you'll like, Ange.`
` Creation is still a bit too hard for you now."`
`"There's a difference between creation and summoning.`
` ...And, resurrection is also different."`
`"......`
`So, your greatest wish really is to revive your family...?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......I have a vessel for it.`
` This."`
`"That's right.`
` ...I'm sure that hair accessory will eventually become the key to summoning Battler.`
` ...The rest is up to your training, Ange."`
`"Although not knowing how long it'll take is enough to make me cry."`
`『Uryu...`
` Stay strong, even if it's tough...`
` If you don't give up, Ange, it will definitely, definitely come true someday...』`
`"If someone gave me some proof that it'd definitely be granted, at least that would calm my heart."`
`『Uryu!`
` Then I guarantee it!`
` Without a doubt, Ange will surely have her wish granted someday!』`
`"...Thanks.`
` I'm glad to hear it, even if you're just saying it to console me."`
`『It's not like that, uryu-.』`
`"Stop it, Ange.`
` That kind of emotion will turn into the magic-resisting toxin.`
` The feeling that your dreams will definitely come true is the best seed that buds into magic power."`
`"......`
`...That's right, sorry, Teacher."`
`"You need to be a bit greedier, Ange-sama.`
` Go however far it takes to get the thing you desire!`
` You're lacking the willpower to never give up until you get it!"`
`『Uryu-!`
` That isn't true, Ange's doing her best...!』`
`"Thanks, Sakutaro, Mammon.`
` Crying about it won't help anything.`
` There's nothing I can do except hang in there.`
` I'll try hard.`
` I'll grit my teeth.`
` I'll definitely make my dreams come true.`
` With certainty."`
`『Uryu!`
` You're awesome, Ange, do your best!`
` Mammon and I will support you!』`
`"Yes, we'll support you.`
` The greedier our master is, the more our worth will increase."`
`"More importantly, Ange-samaa!`
` We've finally got 10 people gathered heeere!"`
`"We planned to have everyone play shiritori or something!"`
`"If you lose, there's a punishment game!`
` Let me nibble your eeears!"`
`"Come on, is hunger the only thing inside that head of yours?!"`
`"Please forgive my foolish sisters' stupid proposals...`
` Are you sure it isn't about time you returned to your studying?"`
`"No, no, nooooooo!!`
` I waited so long for you to finish studying, so I can't stand it if you don't play with us!"`
`"I don't think it's a bad idea.`
` Perhaps playing every once in a while is good for softening the mind."`
`"......You govern Sloth, right, Belpha?`
` What you're saying sounds reasonable, but you're actually being sneaky, aren't you?"`
`"Hmph.`
` My apologies.`
` ...You are diligent, Ange-sama."`
`"If it's okay with Ange, I'd also like to play with everyone.`
` Let's make some noise.`
` It'll definitely be fun."`
`『Uryu-!`
` Ange, Ange, let's play, let's play!`
` Let's all do shiritori!』`
`"In that case, let's start from Sakutaro's 'uryu-'.`
` ......In that case, which sound should we start the next word from?`
` 'Ryu'?`
` Or 'yu'?"`
`"From 'uryu-'?`
` ......I wonder.`
` Maybe it really should be 'ryu'?"`
`"...It's rare for a word that ends like that to come up."`
`"Then I'm first!!`
` I'll do a word starting with 'ryu'!`
` Ryuuzu (watch crown)!"`
`"I wanted to go first!`
` 'Ryuuto' (lute) would've been wonderful!"`
`"'Zu'?`
` Feels like we keep getting tough ones.`
` ...Wait a sec, what order are we going in?`
` Who's next?"`
`『Uryu.`
` I don't think it matters who.`
` Whoever thinks of a matching word first.』`
`"What's that? Sounds interesting.`
` How about the person who can say the most wins?`
` It's fast-talking shiritori!"`
`"Then I'll go!`
` 'Zucchini'!`
` 'Ninniku itame' (garlic stir-fry)!`
` 'Mekabu with pasta'!`
` All of them delicious!`
` Kyaha, I said three of them!"`
`"Belz takes three points.`
` ...Can you use conjunctions?"`
`"If you could use 'with', then anything would work!!`
` That last one doesn't count!`
` Minus one point!!`
` Let's start from 'me'."`
`"Then I'll go.`
` 'Meringue'-!"`
`『'Ge'??`
` ...U-U-`
`Uryu-!』`
`"'Gesuidou' (Drainage system), `
`'umetatechi' (reclaimed land), `
`'chikashitsu' (basement).`
` How'd you like them apples?"`
`"Onee-sama, those are all pretty crummy words, *giggle*!"`
`"S-So what? Then why don't you try following up with something refined!!`
` Anyway, that's three points for me.`
` The next one's 'tsu', okay, 'tsu'!"`
`"I've never played such a weird shiritori before.`
` Uu-uu-!`
` It's fun!"`
`『Uryu-!`
` I don't get it at all, but it's fun.`
` Uryu-!』`
`I've played normal shiritori before, but I've never experienced a shiritori this weird.`
`There's only the lively Seven Sisters, Maria onee-chan, Sakutaro, and me.`
`I'm now surrounded by friends that are so fun to be with.`
`...The courage to accept a world of magic, a world of witches...`
`...That alone didn't change the fact that I was still locked up in an academy,`
` without a single friend in my class.`
`But despite that, I'm able to have such a fun and lively time.`
`......I'll also become a witch, like Maria onee-chan.`
`And someday, I'll add my family to this fun circle.`
`Dad, Mom.`
` And Onii-chan.`
`...And if possible, George onii-chan and Jessica onee-chan.`
` And the other relatives.`
`I'll call everyone, everyone here without a single person missing, ...and we'll all gather together.`
`"...This is my...dream.`
` ...That's right.`
` Until I make that come true, I definitely won't lose heart."`
`"I'm sure you'll become a Great Witch, Ange-sama.`
` As long as you believe in that.`
` We Seven Stakes of Purgatory will always serve by your side until that day comes."`
`"You'll be there for me...?`
` No matter how long, `
`...you'll lend me your strength?"`
`"Of course.`
` After all, I'm your friend. Right, Ange-sama?"`
`".........`
`...Yes, that's right.`
` Let's all stick together and play together.`
` Today, and in the future, always, ...always."`
`"Until the day your dream comes true, Ange-sama."`
`The lively, ten-person game of shiritori, `
`alongside a street cut off from time, under the constantly bright rays of the sun, could have continued forever...`
`"......Wait, seriously? What's going on, Ushiromiya-saan?"`
`"............"`
`...In the end,`
` I wasn't able to get a very good grade on my test.`
`I tried memorizing things in my own way,`
` but if you could manage anything by cramming the night before a test, no one would ever worry about tests.`
`"Normally, when you know the problems beforehand, you should be able to pass easily, right? Easily!"`
`"It's true that we didn't go so far as to write the answers into the blanks for you.`
` We thought you'd studied at least that much."`
`"What the hell?`
` Come on, are you serious? I can't believe it!`
` They're almost all wrong, aren't they?`
` Did you really study properly?!"`
`".........More or less..."`
`"This isn't what you call more or less, Ushiromiya-san.`
` ...It's so horrible that it makes me dizzy, okay?"`
`"Oh, God.`
` Please forgive her for getting a miserable grade on such an easy test...`
`and for making the average score for the entire class plummet...!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*, `
`ahahahahahahaha."`
`...The same test had been given in another class first.`
`That test paper had been obtained, so the average score for our class had been unusually high.`
`Enough to obscure my slight improvement.`
`However, ...there were some things I had no excuse for.`
`If I'd spent that entire day studying like mad, I might've been able to get a slightly higher score.`
`...But I hadn't gone that far.`
`After that on that day, `
`...I spent the whole time having fun playing shiritori with the Seven Sisters, Sakutaro and Onee-chan.`
`As expected, the winner had been Maria onee-chan.`
`She was a strong player thanks to her wide knowledge of trivia.`
`Sakutaro had gotten the punishment game.`
`He spent the whole time cheering for everyone else's answers,`
` completely forgotting to think of any himself.`
`...Because of that, he'd been squished by the Seven Sisters and had his ears thoroughly nibbled, hadn't he?`
`"Heey, are you listening, Ushiromiya-san?!"`
`"........."`
`They were surrounding me, twittering like small birds.`
` They were annoying, smelly.`
`On the outside of that circle was Mammon, an exasperated expression on her face...`
`"This is a messed up school, just like usual.`
` Shouldn't you be more than happy as long as your own grades are good?"`
`"......It's probably because of that collective responsibility thing.`
` Instead of worrying about their own grades, `
`they're more concerned about how embarrassing it is for the class average to be low.`
` Or maybe it's because they really hate the volunteer work they're forced to do as punishment."`
`"So in other words, they aren't studying because they want their grades to be good,`
` but because of collective responsibility and since they hate volunteer work?"`
`"...They're jealous and embarrassed.`
` They don't want to be inferior to anyone, and they don't want to be humiliated.`
` That's the only feeling that drives them to study."`
`"What noisy people. If they want to study, why can't they just do it themselves?"`
`"In the end,`
` without collective responsibility and volunteer work, they'd have no desire to study.`
` ...How foolish it is to study without knowing the meaning of studying."`
`"Still, these guys really are annoying and stupid!`
` Don't you dare disturb Ange-sama's precious day for even a minute!"`
`"Waaah, I hate those people!!`
` Just get lost!!"`
`"I'm hungryyyyyy!!`
` Go away noooooow, waaaah!!"`
`"......`
`......Sorry, everyone.`
` I wonder why Humans are so shameful."`
`"It's probably because, instead of working hard themselves,`
` it's easier to make you work hard and earn them a higher class average to satisfy their greed.`
` ...Humans are all greedy.`
` And they'll burden others with their greed to make things easier for themselves."`
`"...We'll eventually be reunited with them on the mountain of Purgatory.`
` When they get to the fifth terrace, they'd better watch their step..."`
`Mammon controls the fifth terrace of the mountain that reaches to heaven, Mount Purgatory.`
`...Since she's saying this, you can probably be sure that after those girls die, their journey to heaven won't be an easy one.`
`...No, on the contrary, let them just fall into hell.`
`The class committee went to the student council and applied to use a classroom during lunch and after school.`
`The purpose of use was for a class study group.`
`A wonderful little gathering so that they could all surround me and make me study. I'm so grateful I could cry.`
`Which meant that every day, all of my lunch and three hours of my afternoon would be stolen.`
`The academy and its student council, with its theme of student self-government,`
` instantly approved of this pleasant activity that the students were taking up of their own initiative...`
`In other words, I was no longer able to escape after school by leaving the classroom...`
`After school, the first class study group meeting started right away.`
`Would they open a textbook, then kindly and carefully explain so that even I could understand it?`
` Of course it didn't turn out like such a naive illusion.`
`After school in the classroom, dozens of my classmates crowded around my desk.`
`First, before we started studying...`
`Why were my grades so bad?`
`What was the reason?`
`It was decided that we couldn't start until I could clearly answer those questions, become aware of the problem, and show regret for my actions.`
`...Of course, there's no way for me to respond when asked a question like that.`
`They've loathed me all this time.`
`And they've rejected me and kept me at a distance, preventing me from joining in on their community.`
`So, I've avoided their community myself.`
`There shouldn't have been any conflict for either of us that way.`
`So even in this group that was enthusiastic about raising the class average, `
`they obviously kept me at a distance.`
`Even if I tried to join in, `
`they would probably ignore me, like they always did in the past.`
`"If you'd just asked, we would've taught you whatever you wanted.`
` Riiiiiiiight?!"`
`'!s0`
`They were getting themselves all worked up.`
`...I've already had enough of the hypocrisy of their tacked-on excuses.`
`"Ushiromiya-san, your problem is that you're lacking a cooperative personality.`
` You mustn't be satisfied as long as everything's good for you alone."`
`"Those who gather in Saint Lucia's place of learning shall have a cooperative heart.`
` It's written right there in the student handbook, right?"`
`"I think having a cooperative heart is what gives birth to the desire to study together and contribute to the entire class.`
` I believe that itself is the thing you lack before you even start studying, Ushiromiya-san, `
`but what do you say?!"`
`"Heeey, have you even been listening to us?!`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` We went to all the trouble of staying after school to say this `
`~ib~for your sake~ib~`
`, right?!"`
`.........`
`I'm so grateful I could cry.`
`Of course, they didn't like that.`
`'This way, it almost makes it look like we're bullying you', they reprimanded me.`
`Fortunately, I'm normally all cried out anyway.`
`If I'm told not to cry, I can hold it back.`
`First, I was made to write a letter of remorse and read it out loud.`
`Of course, this was to be done by today.`
`The class committee politely applied to the student council and the staff room for an extension on the use of this classroom.`
`...It seems it was accepted right away.`
`Which means that starting now, I'll be forced into self-criticism for at least a full five hours here...`
`——Ushiromiya Ange got a low score on her test and caused trouble for her classmates.`
`'!s0`
`"You getting low grades and causing us trouble isn't the root of the problem, is it?!"`
`"It's a cooperative attitude, right? A cooperative attitude!!"`
`"Come ooon!!`
` Why do we even have to direct Ushiromiya-san on how to write a letter of regret?!"`
`Their abusive jeers flew about one after another.`
`I followed their 'directions' and erased it.`
`——Ushiromiya Ange didn't have a cooperative attitude and caused trouble for her classmates.`
`"Hey, wait a sec, it's pointless if you just write whatever we say, right?!"`
`"Do you really know what 'regret' means?!"`
`"It's pointless if you don't write it in your own words, pointless!"`
`"I always thought you were a bit strange, Ushiromiya-san, but you really are weird!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`Even following their directions didn't change the jeers much, and now it felt like they were mocking me even more...`
`So for several more hours, without rest, without even being allowed to go to the bathroom,`
` much less dinner, I was continuously abused...`
`...I was coerced into writing a paragraph that humiliated myself...`
`At about 9:00 that night, ...I was told to stand up and read it aloud.`
`The contents...`
`were smeared black with tears and eraser marks.`
`'!s0`
`...but it was like a list of soulless letters, `
`whose contents I couldn't even remember.`
`Everything had been copied down according to their orders.`
`So while I had been the one to write the letters, they weren't my words.`
`I'd been coerced into writing them down...and even coerced into reading them aloud.`
`......Even after all this time, I was surprised to learn that, beyond just ignoring people and hiding their things,`
` there are other ways to bully people...`
`"Heey!`
` Read it aloud quickly!!"`
`"Look how many people are staying this late just for you, Ushiromiya-san.`
` Why not thank us a little?"`
`"Isn't the fact that she doesn't feel gratitude a sign that she doesn't have a scrap of a cooperative attitude?"`
`"It's okay, Ushiromiya-san.`
` We'll always be with you from now on.`
` Why not study with us and remake yourself?`
` Okay?"`
`"*giggle*giggle* "Ahahahahaha "Kyahhhyahyahyahya!!"""`
`As I stood by my seat, surrounded by them, ...I dropped my gaze towards the blackened page.`
`And then...I spoke those humiliating words, `
`but right away, jeers flew at me saying that they couldn't hear and to speak up.`
`......I can't read it.`
`I had no idea...`
`that being forced to read a paragraph humiliating me would be so painful.`
`My throat shook.`
` My fingertips shook.`
`...The paragraph of humiliation written in my own handwriting made my eyes burn with a hot liquid.`
`So my world blurred and twisted.`
`I saw the girls surrounding me twist and bend.`
`...I saw them twist and bend into the impression I had of them.`
`In other words, ...that was my true field of vision.`
`Beyond that twisted crowd of people, ...I could see my friends.`
`Compassion could be seen in all of their eyes.`
`"......Ange, ......stay strong..."`
`『Uryu-......』`
`Maria onee-chan and Sakutaro were looking at me with sad eyes.`
`Probably because they realized that even cheap words of compassion would hurt me.`
`...They kept alternating between trying to say something...and hanging their heads.`
`"What the hell's wrong with these people...?!!"`
`"They're just the worst!`
` Really pisses me off!`
` What's so fun about gathering around Ange-sama and torturing her?!"`
`"It's a resentment they can't voice despite their jealousy.`
` They don't care who it hurts, as long as they can let it out.`
` What horrible people."`
`"Ange-sama!`
` In this kind of situation, it's okay to go mad with rage for your own honor's sake!!`
` Anger is an appropriate emotion and an appropriate reaction!`
` If you don't get mad now, when will you get mad?!!"`
`"Stop it, don't stir Ange-sama up with cheap anger!!`
` If Ange-sama could do that, she would've done it already!!"`
`"......You should only get angry if doing so will improve the situation.`
` However, from a objective standpoint, doing that now would probably only aggravate the situation further.`
` It may be humiliating, but the wisest thing to do now is to withstand it."`
`"Ahha!`
` You really are a sloth, Belpha!`
` Quit fooling around, I can't stand this!!`
` I can't forgive them!!"`
`『...E-Everyone, calm down...`
` It'll become a burden for Ange...』`
`"A burden?!`
` What are you talking about? Is this the time or place to be calm?!`
` We furniture are not so cruel as to cooly watch when our master is humiliated!!"`
`"Ange-sama!!`
` You have no obligation to read such a humiliating letter!`
` If you can't let out a cry of rage, then at least throw it onto the floor!!"`
`"You don't need to trash talk them, you don't need to yell so loud that they bend over backwards!`
` Just throw the notebook on the floor with all your might...!!`
` By doing just that, you'll be able to show your strong will!!"`
`"Don't start running on by yourself, Mammon!!`
` I told you, right?!`
` If Ange-sama could do it, she would've done so long ago!!"`
`"Nothing will be resolved by the eruption of momentary emotions.`
` Can't you see that doing that will only make their treatment of Ange-sama even more severe?!"`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, rg7_4e30:`
`'!s0`
`"And it's not just tonight, but tomorrow and the day after too!!`
` That's enough, you can't simply sit there bearing this humiliation!!"`
`"Hey!! Are you really listening to us?!"`
`Someone tugged at my hair.`
`...I was torn back into my tragic reality.`
`...I was no longer even permitted to listen to the Seven Sisters speaking on my behalf in my heart.`
`My hair was lifted upwards, one of my hair ornaments came off, and I could hear the sound of it rolling on the ground.`
`...No one picked it up.`
`To the contrary, they casually avoided it as though something filthy was rolling towards them.`
`I tried to follow it with my eyes, but my hair was tugged upwards again.`
`"Why do you neeever listen to us, even though we're talking about something so serious?!"`
`"In one ear and out the other, is it?`
` Does anything get into that thick skull of yours?!`
` Get a grip, okay?!"`
`"Are you really conscious of the trouble you're causing us?`
` You aren't going to start saying that you just wrote it grudgingly because we told you to, right?!"`
`"Until you really show regret of your own will, this seriously isn't gonna end, okay?!`
` It's not just for today.`
` It'll seriously keep on going tomorrow and the day after, you see?`
` Don't you play us for fools, okay?!?!"`
`"I mean, why are you still even alive?`
` Is it normal to go on living like this?`
` If it were me, I'd just die!"`
`"You can't live like this, can you?!`
` 'Cause you being alive just means getting in other people's way all the time, right?`
` If it were me, I definitely couldn't live on!"`
`"Yeah, yeah, I'd die too.`
` If doing that's better for the world, then I'd die right away! Riiiiiiiiight?!!"`
`...Then die.`
`"Ange-sama..."`
`"Kill all of them now!!`
` Lucifer, can you hear me?!"`
`"Uh, ...ah..."`
`"You Seven Sisters of Purgatory are incredible furniture that can massacre mere Humans in a flash, right?!`
` You're always boasting about it to me!!`
` Then do it!`
` Massacre them right now!!`
` Right here, right now!!"`
`"......Well........."`
`For some reason, Lucifer hesitated.`
`...Why?`
` What's wrong?!`
`You're certain-kill furniture that can fly around faster than the eye can see and instantly pierce the hearts of a witch's enemies, right?`
`And I'm giving you an order as your master!!`
`Carry it out right away!`
` Kill!!`
` Kill them aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaall!!`
`".........A-Ange-sama...`
` ...Please, calm down..."`
`If they had immediately followed my brutal order, making heaps of corpses with me at the center...`
`...I was ready to reflect on my own reckless actions of stealing human lives so readily, ...ready to regret and repent, just as they had wanted me to.`
`I was prepared to do that.`
`And yet, Lucifer just let an unsure expression rise to her face...and didn't move to carry out my order.`
`.........I knew it.`
`Yeah, I knew it.`
` ...Vaguely.`
`No, that's not right.`
` ...I've known from the beginning.`
`I've......known that magic was all empty this whole time, haven't I...?`
`"...The Seven Sisters of Purgatory? Yeah, right...`
` ...Stupid, so pointless...`
` ......I've known it the whole time..."`
`"......A-Ange-sama, `
`'!s0`
`I glared into the worthless Lucifer's eyes.`
`...And pain seemed to accompany that gaze.`
`As though she was being assaulted with a violent headache, Lucifer grasped her head with both arms.`
`But it looked like she couldn't tear her eyes off my gaze.`
`...So she was assaulted with a pain that grew more and more violent.`
`"............"`
`"Guhguhguh, ah...gahgaaa, agaa......!!`
` Gyack!!!"`
`Useless, useless...!!`
`I hate you!!`
` Disappear...!!`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~You're nothing but a delusion inside my head~ib~`
`...!!!`
`Hopelessness and disappointment.`
`Resignation and a dream's end.`
`A cracking sound, like you'd hear from a frozen lake's surface during a fierce winter, rang out just once.`
`At the same time, Lucifer's form, which was being tormented by a violent pain, stiffened in place and grew cloudy.`
`...It was almost as though a beautifully polished glass window had been heartlessly smashed and turned white from the countless fissures.`
`And that was an accurate analogy.`
`At some point, Lucifer's form had turned into a glass ornament of the same shape.`
`Countless fissures ran through it from the inside, and as the head and arms collapsed, it crumbled to the floor.`
`"Eeeek?!!"`
`"L-Luci-nee...!!"`
`"......Who's the second sister...?`
` Leviathan?`
` Carry out my order.`
` Massacre them right now!!"`
`"N-No, um!`
` ...Err, Ange-sama...`
` ...Please calm your heart and listen...`
`'!s1`
`......aaah, `
`gwaagahhgguguggah, `
`kyaaggghh!!"`
`I'm not looking for excuses or back talk or an answer.`
`...I want nothing more than a swift confirmation of my order to eradicate the girls who are humiliating me.`
`If you're going to say anything else, there's no need for me to listen until the end.`
`After Leviathan also turned white due to countless cracks throughout her whole body,`
` she fell over backwards, splitting into separate parts along her neck, hips and arms.`
`If she'd been smashed to bits and lost her original form, it probably wouldn't have seemed so brutal.`
`So seeing the two of them halfway left over made the remaining younger sisters shake even harder...`
`"...Why won't you listen to my orders...?`
` Why?`
` Why?!!"`
`"M-My apologies...!!`
` H-Here, under the current conditions, the anti-magic power is...e-extremely strong and..."`
`"What's that?`
` You can't do it because Humans are here? That's your logic?`
` Isn't killing Humans what you do?!`
` If you can't do that, then what use are you as furniture?!!`
` Die!!!"`
`"Eeeeek!!`
`'!s1`
`aaaah, `
`khhagah, gihh, ack!!"`
`As she clutched her head with both arms, Satan also turned white and fell down face first.`
`Apparently the neck is the most slender part after all.`
`Her head slid off and rolled over to Belphegor's feet.`
`"You can't do it because there are too many Humans?`
` Then later on, I'll call them into the shadows one by one,`
` and you can make a bloodbath of all of them, right?"`
`"...With your current magical power, it may be easy for you to converse with us.`
` However, you still lack the training to materialize us in front of all of the Humans here...!"`
`"I deeply understand your anger, but even if you could use us to attack...`
`and murdered everyone here, that would only make your situation worse...!`
` I know it's humiliating, but please control your anger for the time being...`
`......ahgah, `
`...gaaaahaahh, kwaaaagghhgh!!"`
`"......Will I get the same answer from the next three...?`
` Are you gonna tell me you can't do it because the anti-magic power is too great?`
` Are you gonna tell me you can't do it because my magical power is too weak?`
` ...Then I won't ask you to kill all of them.`
` Just one person's fine, so try and kill them.`
` Right here, right now...!!"`
`As Asmodeus and Beelzebub held each other, they crouched down, cringing in fear under my glare.`
`...If they'd been able to obey my order, they probably would've carried it out immediately.`
`And yet here they were, crouching down.`
`...Empty.`
` Sad.`
` And pathetic...`
`That's right, I've known.`
`These girls can't even touch reality with one of their fingers...`
`"N-No, no...!!`
` Belz, I'm scared, Beeelz!!"`
`"Ange-sama, spare us, spare us...!!`
` I don't wanna diiiiiiiieee!!"`
`"Die, useless furniture!`
` Why are you guys even alive?`
` Why are you alive when your lives are worthless?`
` It doesn't matter if you die, right?`
` Die.`
` I'm telling you to die!!`
` Do you think any idiot would leave furniture that has no use lying around?!"`
`""Eeeeeeekkk!!`
` !!!! Gah!!!""`
`"P-Please stop, Ange-sama!!"`
`"...What is it, Mammon?`
` Are you gonna be only one to fulfill my order?`
` That's right.`
` You're my best friend.`
` ......You alone will do it for me.`
` Get them!"`
`"......A-As you are now, Ange-sama, ...even if you use us, you aren't capable of committing murder!!`
` It's furniture's duty to help with things their master can do...!`
` Things that even the master can't do, we can't do...!!`
` Do you hate them, Ange-sama?`
` You do hate them, right?"`
`"I totally understand why you want to kill them!!`
` Okay, in that case, go ahead and kill them, Ange-sama!`
` If you stain your own hands with blood, then we, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, will go along with you however far! However far you go!!"`
`"...I'm...asking you all......because I can't do it myself, aren't I...?`
` ...Isn't being able to do things I can't the thing that makes you furniture?!!"`
`"Yes, we are furniture.`
` Furniture to be used...!!`
` Please, go ahead and use us to kill!`
` You'll be the one killing, Ange-sama!!`
` If you're saying that you want to kill, then go ahead, be my guest!`
` No need to hesitate, go and carry it out right now!!"`
`"And once you've prepared yourself mentally,`
` once you're prepared to dirty your own hands, then we'll help you!`
` But you haven't done that, Ange-sama!!"`
`"Pft, ......*cackle*cackle*, ahhahhahhahhahha...`
` Ahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahha, don't speak, furniture.`
` You delusion!!`
` I get it already, you don't all have to tell me.`
` ...You people can't do anything.`
` You're nothing more than my delusions, illusions, daydreams...!`
` I haven't had a single friend from the very beginning.`
` You're just a phantom, a pretend friend I created in my heart, in my isolation, right?`
` I've known from the very beginning!!!"`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Yeah, that's right!`
` We're an illusion inside your head, Ange-sama, but so what?`
` Yes, that's truue!`
` We're just imaginary friends created to soothe `
`lonely, lonely Ange-sama's heart because she doesn't have a single friend, but so what?`
` If you want to look at reality, just look at it.`
` You can stop looking at us and return to being surrounded and bathed with jeering over there!!"`
`"C'mon, c'mon, go back, welcome home to reality!!`
` Just call on us only when it's convenient for you and pretend you have friends, `
`then spur us on even though you don't have the guts to dirty your own hands, then deny and erase us once you realize that it's hopeless!`
` Yes, please enjoy it, I'll leave with a shriek of anguish just like you want, Ange-sama!!"`
`"Just copy the jeering that you're being showered with right now,`
` and do the same to us to get it off your chest.`
` That's also furniture's duty!!`
` Getting slammed against the floor when someone's pissed off is also a chair's important duty!!`
` If that alone can absorb their master's bad mood even for an instant, `
`there can be no greater honor for furniture.`
` Kill me, deny me, your first and final friend...!!!"`
`At the end, Mammon had a mocking expression on her face,`
` ...but for some reason, it looked splashed with tears.`
`Mammon, Beelzebub and Asmodeus were smashed and fell to the floor...`
`『......U-Uryu.........』`
`"......`
`Come over here, Sakutaro.`
` Ange is a little agitated right now.`
` ...So you mustn't get close."`
`『What about everyone else?`
` Are all the Seven Sisters alive?`
` Did they die...?』`
`"...It's okay.`
` It looks gruesome, but those are the remains of their vessels after being deported from the human world.`
` Shells that have been shed.`
` ...So it's all right.`
` They're probably deeply hurt, but they're okay.`
` Everyone is alive.`
` I'm sure we'll be able to meet them again someday."`
`『Uryu...`
` ...Thank goodness, ......thank goodness......』`
`"...Ange has violated the contract of Mariage Sorcière.`
` ...To do such a horrible thing, ...even though witches of the alliance must respect and accept one another...`
` Even though they were all important friends to you, Ange..."`
`"No witches' alliance has anything to do with this.`
` Magic friends? Give me a break.`
` ......I killed them, erased them.`
` I smashed the Seven Sisters!"`
`『Uryu, ...that's so cruel, ...so cruel......』`
`"...Just give it a rest with this playing witches thing.`
` ...I'm begging you.`
` Maria onee-chan and Sakutaro, I want you to disappear by yourselves.`
` ......Even in my imagination, ...I don't want to kill and erase you."`
`『...W-We aren't your imagination...`
` We're your friends, Ange, ...uryu......!』`
`Sakutaro said that as he hid behind Maria onee-chan, sobbing.`
`......Sakutaro doesn't exist.`
`Sakutaro is also...an imaginary creature Onee-chan created to distract herself from her loneliness......`
`『...U-Uryu, ......it hurts, ...it hurts, Maria...`
` ...Why? Why...?`
` Uryu......uryu......』`
`"Stop it.`
` Denying my friend is the one thing I will not permit."`
`The same power that had smashed the Seven Sisters was probably eating into Sakutaro as well.`
`...But Maria onee-chan was apparently protecting him with some other power.`
`So Sakutaro's form didn't break and scatter.`
`Onee-chan glared at me sharply.`
`...It was a serious expression that I'd never seen before.`
`"Sakutaro is my furniture.`
` You cannot erase him, Ange.`
` ...However, trying to deny someone is the greatest form of scorn for a witch."`
`"Sakutaro didn't exist from the very beginning.`
` He's just a lion stuffed animal.`
` A phantom you personified with the delusions inside your own mind!"`
`"Uu-!!!`
` That's not true!!`
` Sakutaro is my friend!!`
` He was a stuffed animal once, but now he isn't!!"`
`"No, he's a stuffed animal.`
` A stuffed animal made of cloth and cotton!`
` He can't move or talk by himself!`
` You're just talking for him like a ventriloquist, right?!`
` You call that magic?`
` You call that a witch?!`
` You call that...a friend?!`
` I can't accept that!!"`
`『............Uryu...`
`'!s1`
`...not me...?`
`...Am I...`
`...just a stuffed animal that...`
`...can't really talk...`
`...and not Maria's...`
`...friend...?`
`U...ryu......』`
`As though struck with a high fever, Sakutaro weakened bit by bit.`
`As he clung to Onee-chan's body, he did all he could to continue standing, `
`...but his body began to gradually slip down...`
`As he did, Onee-chan held him, yelling at me as tears streamed down her face...`
`"Uuu--!!`
` Stop iit!!`
` Don't burn Sakutaro with the magic-resisting toxin!!`
` Don't bully him!!`
` Don't insult him!`
` Don't deny him!!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` Maria onee-chan, you're so weeeird!!`
` There is no Sakutaro!`
` Stuffed animals are stuffed animals!`
` I learned from Mama that they're made of cloth and cotton!!`
` There's no way they can walk or talk!!`
` *giggle*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!!"`
`『......Uryu, ............u...yu......』`
`"Sakutaro!!`
` Sakutaro-!!!`
` You aren't a stuffed animal, you aren't a stuffed animal, you're a friend!!`
` Uuu--!!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` Instead of playing with stuffed animals, it's better to play outside with everyone!!`
` I'm bored with stuffed animals already!!`
` *giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"I hate you, Ange!!`
` Uu-!!`
` Why say something like that, hatehatehatehate!!`
` I hate you!!"`
`You're not my friend!!`
` I won't let you be one of us witches anymore...!!`
`Upon my name, the Apprentice Witch of Origins, MARIA,`
` I hereby expel the Apprentice Witch ANGE from the Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches...!!`
`......And then.`
`...What had been peaceful days to me became a daydream and ended.`
`By now, it's impossible to prove.`
`No one can verify whether that really was magic or whether those really were my friends,`
` or else nothing more than a daydream.`
`...I, the sole observer, concluded that they were a daydream.`
`...So that became the truth.`
`Perhaps, in the farther future, I'll observe it again, `
`and when that happens, maybe I'll acknowledge that it wasn't a dream, ...that the Seven Sisters really were my friends, and that along with Maria onee-chan and Sakutaro,`
` they did everything they could for me in my isolation.`
`......Something so vague is neither the truth nor an illusion.`
`Maybe the reality here and now is the only world with the real me.`
`Where is the real me?`
`The person standing amidst the girls' exposed wreckage that resembles broken glass sculptures,`
` that girl who's breathing harshly, her shoulders heaving, ...isn't me.`
`I'm...over there.`
`The me that's surrounded by a crowd and being showered by jeers...and who's hanging her head, her eyes red......`
`...Isn't the me over there...`
`...the real me...?`
`I won't dream anymore.`
`Because there's nowhere left to run.`
`I'm...going back.`
`...I'll return myself to the cage made of flesh...`
`"Hey!!`
` Are you listening to us?!`
` It's not like anything'll be resolved if you just stand there hanging your head, right?!"`
`"............`
`...I hear you."`
`"Ah, you finally answered.`
` You aren't thinking that this'll end if you stay silent, or that we'll forgive you if you cry, right?!`
` We're asking if you're aware!`
` We're asking if you're aware of the trouble you're causing those around you...!!"`
`......I...slowly nodded.`
`...I acknowledged it.`
`I acknowledged that I had slipped into the world of my daydream, trying to remain separate from the others in my class.`
`...To separate myself from and disgrace those Sisters who spoke to me with reliable and kind words,`
` despite being totally unable to help when I really wanted them to, `
`...I acknowledged that.`
`"...I, Ushiromiya Ange, do not have a cooperative attitude and caused trouble for my classmates.`
` There is nothing to blame for that except my excessive inferiority complex towards all of my classmates because of my inability to study.`
` And, ............"`
`"......It's a shame that I'm alive."`
`Starting there, I was no longer reading the paragraph they'd made me write.`
`...It was me...improvising.`
` And...it was what was in my heart.`
`They noticed that it wasn't what they'd anticipated,`
` but while they did frown, no one spoke.`
`So I continued.`
`"...That's right.`
` It's a shame that I lived.`
` ...I should've had them take me with them on that day in 1986.`
` ...And yet, I was the only one who wasn't taken."`
`"...Why am I here?`
` ...This isn't the world I'm supposed to be in.`
` ......No one will save me.`
` ...For a time, ...I felt as though only the fictional friends I created inside myself could save me.`
` But those friends were nothing more than a delusion, ...and they didn't save me at all.`
` After all, this isn't a world of imagination, but a world of reality."`
`"......So, in short, ...up until today, ...I've been having the same daydream.`
` ...I hated my real classmates and only lived by interacting with the friends in my mind.`
` ......Just now, I split up with those friends.`
` So I am here."`
`"......I have no family.`
` I've thrown my friends away too.`
` ...There's no longer anything left for me.`
` ...Why haven't I died?`
` Someone asked that a short while ago.`
` ...I think they're right.`
` Why......am I alive?`
` ......I should've died......in the year 1986.`
` ...No, I must really have died."`
`"And yet, ......my dead soul is still locked up inside this cage of flesh.`
` So I'll ask someone.`
` If no one answers, ...I'll do it myself."`
`'!s1`
`.........let me die."`
`I spoke that sentence...and looked around.`
`Dumbfounded girls.`
`Shocked girls.`
`Girls whose faces seemed to be saying 'What the heck is this kid talking about?'`
`And, a bit late, `
`more and more girls with faces that said 'Is this girl all right?'`
`*whisper*.`
` *chatter*.`
`And then, *giggle*.`
`......When I ordered the friends in my daydream to kill, they couldn't do it.`
`And so.`
`I asked real Humans to kill me, `
`...but of course, these girls can't do it either.`
`...In other words, both daydreams and reality are the same.`
`Doesn't this mean that, including this world...`
`......Absolutely everything is a daydream?`
`Then, ...there's no problem, right?`
`After all, ...on that day when I lost my family, I was already dead.`
`...Everything that happened afterwards is going on in my head, my life flashing before my eyes after I failed to die.`
`Once I understood that, ......it felt like the scenery surrounding me began to twist and bend slightly.`
`......Yeah.`
`...I'll finally......wake up.`
`...I'll be released from this daydream world.`
`I feel my consciousness sliding away.`
`...That's all right.`
`Fade farther and farther away......and take me to my family...`
`Then, no matter what happens in this twisted, stale world, I won't mind it at all.`
`I saw the crowd get pushed aside as a teacher stepped in.`
`Perhaps a teacher doing the rounds happened to notice a strange disturbance.`
`The teacher was vigorously shouting something, moving to protect me.`
`...Watching that, I knew that an ally had appeared for me, even if there was only one,`
` and I felt my awareness return very slightly.`
`.........`
`...The only ones who can save me in the world of reality...are real Humans.`
`Never again.`
` ...Never again will I seek rescue from daydreams.`
`......This is the world of Humans.`
`Nothing can save a Human...except other Humans...`
`".........`
`...I see.`
` If that's what you think, then that's your world, Ange."`
`『...Can Ange...`
`find happiness this way......?』`
`"......If Ange believes that's the only way to find happiness, then it is the only way.`
` ...If she can't accept the blue bird in the cage for what it is, `
`...then she must go and search forever."`
`『Uryu...`
` ...Maria, are you...breaking off relations with Ange......?』`
`".........`
`...No, nothing like that.`
` I only did that because that's what Ange wanted.`
` ...We witches are sometimes persecuted.`
` However, we always remain by everyone's sides.`
` ...And our aid can always be asked for."`
`『...Will the day come......when Ange will play with us once again...?』`
`"Maybe. Or, she might forget, and it'll never come.`
` ...In the human world, we call that growing up and saying goodbye to your childhood self.`
` ......Still."`
`If Ange just remembers, we'll always be by her side.`
`...And until then, ...we'll be waiting.`
`...............`
`『.........Uryu...`
` ......Maria, ...answer me...』`
`"............"`
`『......Uryu...`
`'!s1`
`a stuffed animal...?`
` ...I'm made of cloth and cotton, `
`...so there's no way I can...`
`talk...?`
` ...So, `
`...I can't talk to Maria......?』`
`Sakutaro looked up at Maria sadly.`
`Maria's face was covered with tears, and it looked as though it had even lost all traces of sadness...`
`"......Uu-.`
` ...I hear you, Sakutaro.`
` ...You aren't a stuffed animal made of cloth and cotton.`
` ......You are...my friend.`
` ......I hate Ange.`
` ...Uuuuuuuuuuuu..."`
`『Uryu... Sorry, Maria. Sorry, Maria...!`
` Uryu...!』`
`Sakutaro regretted doing that.`
`By freezing her heart, Maria had finally been able to escape from her sadness.`
`...By speaking up and calling her back, he'd caused her to be overwhelmed with sadness again...`
`Sakutaro tried hugging Maria, letting go of her,`
` and gazing at her uneasily, lost as to how he could bring Maria's spirits up.`
`...He might've looked a little humorous doing that.`
`In the end, that was enough to distract Maria from her sadness...`
`"Sorry.`
` ......Crying won't help anything anymore."`
`『You got in a fight with Ange, but you still have lots of friends, Maria...`
` I'm not the only one.`
` ......Everyone's here.`
` Sakusuke and Sakukichi, the animal band, and many, many more...』`
`Maria looked at the many stuffed animals around her pillow, which were gathered together as though they were having an idle chat.`
`『...Everyone...is worried about you, Maria.`
` They're all talking over and over about how to cheer you up, okay...?』`
`"............`
`...Everyone won't...go away...like Ange...?"`
`『They won't.`
` We'll always be together.』`
`"......Really?`
` All of you are only with me at home.`
` We can't go out together when Mama's around, and we can't go to school."`
`『You aren't supposed to take us to school, so you'll get in trouble if the teacher finds out.`
` But if no one finds out, we can be together at any time.』`
`"...Sakutaro, you're big, so you'd be found."`
`『Then you can take one of the kids that are small enough to walk around with.`
` ...For example, ...what about them?`
` If you take the friends in the forest band, `
`...look, they're small, so you can hide them in your pocket and go to school together.』`
`"......There's a lot of them in the band.`
` I can't fit them all in my pocket."`
`She collected all of the forest band pieces that were scattered across her bed.`
`There were about as many of them as pieces in a chess set, so it'd probably be impossible to fit them all in her pocket...`
`『In that case, you can just take friends that you're especially close with.`
` ...You can take the four rabbits, your best friends in the forest band.』`
`"...I could fit four in my pockets.`
` ...Yeah.`
` This way, they won't be found."`
`『Now, you won't be alone even at school, Maria.`
` Those kids will be with you even where I can't go.』`
`"......Yeah.`
` ...Maybe...I won't be lonely that way.`
` ...Maybe I can hold out...until coming home from school..."`
`『As long as we aren't found by the teacher and Mama, we can be with you at any time.`
` So let's be together, play together forever.`
` We definitely won't leave you all alone, Maria.`
` Uryu!』`
`Maria's expression finally regained a little of its brightness.`
`...That's right.`
`In the beginning, Maria's world didn't have Ange in it.`
`Even without Ange, it was fun with everyone.`
`And yet, strangely enough, it suddenly became sad without Ange, who had come in at the end.`
`...All that's happened is that I've returned to the world right before Ange entered it.`
`...So there's nothing to be sad about.`
`"...Yeah.`
` I'm not lonely.`
` Sakutaro and the others are with me."`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, sak_4e339:`
`"I won't let any more Humans come into my world.`
` ...Mariage Sorcière is an alliance between me and Beatrice only.`
` ...From the start, even Beatrice didn't want to let Ange join.`
` ......It's all right this way.`
` Ange was still too young."`
`『...For now, until you can be friends with Ange again, I think it's okay to forget about it.`
` You can play together once you've regained your high spirits, Maria.`
` Until then, all of us will be by your side.』`
`"......Thank you.`
` ...Sakutaro, ...everyone."`
`Then, Maria once again regained her former world.`
`She regained the world that wasn't lonely, where she was surrounded by many friends.`
`Just like usual, she didn't have any Human friends at school, but her magic friends were always with her.`
`The rabbit band she hid in her pockets talked with her during class, sounding like they were having fun.`
`Just listening to that greatly embellished the time she spent in class.`
`Maria made it so that, as long as Mama and the teacher didn't find out, her other friends could always be with her.`
`When Mama told Maria to go play outside, Maria would secretly pack Sakutaro and Sakusuke and the rest into her bag and play together at the library or somewhere.`
`Even when Mama was late coming home and Maria went shopping for dinner, she always went with Sakutaro.`
`The man at the convenience store and the other people were nice to Sakutaro.`
`He sometimes gave a second portion free for Maria and Sakutaro.`
`When Mama found out, Maria would get in trouble for bringing Sakutaro and the rest outside.`
`When the teacher found out, Maria would get in trouble for bringing toys to school.`
`The toxin must be strong in Mama and the teacher.`
`That's why Sakutaro looks like a normal stuffed animal to them.`
`After all, the convenience store man and the others say hello to Sakutaro.`
`......Not all Humans are hopeless.`
`There are tons of people who, unlike Ange and Mama and teacher, can say hello to magic friends like I can...`
`"Oh, Maria-chan.`
` Welcome.`
` Was your Mama late coming home tonight too...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...But I've got Sakutaro, so I'm not lonely.`
` Right, Sakutaro?"`
`『Uryu.`
` It's not just Sakutaro today.`
` Some other friends came too.』`
`"Oh, other friends, is it?`
` What kind of friends did you bring today?"`
`"Today, the rabbits from the forest band are also with me.`
` ...Look, in my pocket."`
`Maria began to line up four ceramic rabbit dolls on the register.`
`As the owner of the shop looked at it, smiling, he sent a signal to a part-timer with his chin.`
`Then, the sign on the other register that said 'closed' was taken down, and a voice called out for everyone to move over there.`
`All of the people in line behind Maria lined up behind that one...`
`"I see, I see.`
` You do have a lot of friends, Maria-chan.`
` But I hope your Mama comes home soon."`
`"Uu-.`
` Mama's busy with work again, so she's spending the night at the company.`
` It's been very busy lately.`
` ...She hasn't even been able to get much time to talk to me on the telephone.`
` But I'm not lonely!`
` I've got Sakutaro and the rest!`
` Right?"`
`『Uryu-!!』`
`"I've even got all the rabbits from the band.`
` Look.`
` Kyu-kyu-♪"`
`"Is kyu-kyu- the sound a rabbit makes?`
` My, I've never heard that."`
`After smiling at Sakutaro, who was poking his head out of her knapsack,`
` she played around with the rabbit band on the register, making them frolic around.`
`Although the shop manager gazed at this pleasantly, he had slightly pitying look on his face.`
`...This was apparently a single mother household, where the mother had to work hard and couldn't come home very often.`
`On top of that, it looked like this girl didn't even have any friends.`
`As he watched her play around happily with her dolls and claim that she wasn't lonely despite everything,`
` he couldn't help but feel a kind of compassion.`
`And actually, this wasn't limited to him alone.`
`Maria had become quite famous in this shopping district...`
`"Maria-chan, you should eat some oden every once in a while.`
` If you don't eat your eggs and fish paste, you won't get big."`
`"Uu-?`
` Can't get a cream roll...?"`
`『Uryu.`
` If you don't eat certain things, you won't get big.`
` How about oden for today?』`
`"Uu-.`
` ...Then I'll have some oden."`
`"Yep, yep, that's the ticket.`
` Why don't I stick a whole bunch in there?`
` Want mustard?"`
`『Uryu.`
` I can't handle spicy things...』`
`"I see, I see.`
` Then, you make sure you don't let it spill on the way home.`
` It'll sure be delicious while it's hot."`
`"Uu-.`
` Thank you."`
`She had planned on getting some sweet pastries for dinner, but since oden had been recommended to her, she would be having that tonight instead.`
`Letting someone else determine the menu makes for an unexpected and interesting meal.`
`...Very often, Maria had to decide what her dinner would be on her own, so it was easy for the menus to get a little one-sided.`
` So, it felt fun to have a meal she hadn't anticipated...`
`『Uryu-!`
` Thanks for giving us extra, Mister!』`
`"Send my regards to your other friends at home.`
` No stuffing yourself on your way back.`
` Go straight home and eat it there."`
`"Uu-!`
` Thanks Mister!!"`
`Maria raised the bag with the oden container high...`
`"............`
`......Huh...?"`
`『...Uryu?`
` What is it, Maria?』`
`"......The key isn't in my pocket."`
`Standing in front of the door to her house, Maria searched all over her body.`
`...The key to the house wasn't there.`
`She always methodically put it in the same pocket.`
`So there was no way she had put it in another pocket, but she searched her whole body just in case.`
`...Unsurprisingly, it wasn't there.`
`『Did you drop it when you took your wallet out...?』`
`"No.`
` When I took my wallet out, I definitely felt it.`
` I also felt it when I searched my pocket partway here.`
` ...It was there until partway.`
` I didn't drop it!`
` Uu-uu-uu-...!"`
`Even though the late autumn wind had been bearable when Maria had been thinking of returning home, where the heater was,`
` now that she was confused and had lost her key, that wind tormented her.`
`But no matter how hard she searched, she couldn't find her key.`
`She turned out all her pockets and even tried taking off her jacket and hitting it, but to no avail.`
`...Of course, she also turned the knapsack Sakutaro was in upside down, but the key didn't come out.`
`"......Uu-.`
` ......Uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`Something that should have been there...wasn't where it was supposed to be.`
`Why isn't the key there, when I didn't do anything wrong?`
`...Why isn't it?!`
`Why?!`
` Why...?!!!`
`Maria was cold and frustrated and angry, and she stamped on the ground...`
`The bottom of her foot throbbed, but that didn't lessen her frustration.`
`...At the same time, her tears poured out.`
`"...Uu-.`
` ...Uu-!!`
` Uuuu---!!"`
`It wasn't her fault.`
`So, it was someone else's fault.`
`But Maria didn't know who that someone was...and could do nothing but continue to let out a moan of anger.`
`『...Uryu...`
` I'm sure you dropped it partway...`
` Let's look for it, okay?`
` Let's return on the road we came by and search, okay...?』`
`"...Uu-...`
` Even though I went to all the trouble of buying oden...and got eggs and stuff for free...`
` I won't be able to eat it while it's hot...`
` ......Uuuu----!!!"`
`『...Maria, ...I know it's frustrating, but let's search, okay...?`
` It's no one's fault, so let's search...』`
`Maria finally lent an ear to Sakutaro's words and began to trod back down the road she had come on.`
`...The wind was colder than before, and it felt like it was blowing in through the corners of her jacket in a mean way...`
`『Uryu...`
` Let's watch our feet closely and search, okay...?`
` Then let's get home quickly, let the heater warm us up, and eat oden, all right?`
` I'm sure it'll be delicious.』`
`"......Uu-.`
` ...Gone.`
` ...Uu-.`
` ...It's gone..."`
`As Sakutaro encouraged her, Maria searched for the key...`
`But she made it all the way back to the convenience store where she'd bought the oden.`
`...She hadn't found it.`
`Just in case, she asked the man at the convenience store whether they had found a dropped key,`
` but they hadn't found anything.`
`...One more time, she returned home, paying close attention to the area around her feet.`
`But, unsurprisingly, she didn't find it.`
`She was no longer frustrated enough to stomp her feet.`
`...But hot tears dripped down her face.`
`The oden had cooled down completely.`
`...Even though she had been told it would be delicious when warm, she hadn't been able to eat it.`
`...Even though that man had given her so much free stuff...`
`『...Uryu...`
` Don't cry...`
` ...Mama isn't coming back tonight.`
` ...Let's do our best and search...』`
`"......Why can't I find it...?`
` ...Uuuu, ...uuuuuuuu!"`
`『Maria, don't cry...!`
` Let's do our best and search...!`
` ......Maria...』`
`Maria was no longer able to hold back her tears.`
`Sobbing, she clutched Sakutaro and held the bag of oden, returning once more down the road she had come by.`
`Perhaps because more and more houses and stores had turned their lights off by now, it was even darker and harder to search than before.`
`...And, once again without finding the key, she returned to the convenience store.`
`"Maria-chan, `
`...still can't find your key...?"`
`"...Uu-...`
` ...My key... It's gone..."`
`"Wasn't your mother away for the night?`
` So, you can't get into your house without a key?"`
`"Uu-...`
` ...Can't get in..."`
`"Well, that's not good...`
` Did you try going to the police?`
` They might be able to help you."`
`"......Mama said not to talk to policemen, even if they start talking to me."`
`"Oh?`
` Well, why is that?"`
`"............"`
`It was probably because Rosa would be liable for making such a young girl like Maria watch over the house by herself,`
` and because she knew that this wasn't something that would be permitted by society.`
`So, Maria was indoctrinated into changing the stores she bought things at, so that she didn't catch the eyes of adults,`
` and into saying no more than a greeting to policemen, even if they talked to her.`
`Maria had obediently done as she was told.`
`Instead of considering why she must do that,`
` she was much more concerned with meekly obeying because her mother had told her so.`
`But the manager of the convenience store probably didn't think of it that way.`
`...In the first place, seeing such a young girl being forced to watch over the house alone, and so frequently, `
`...would make anyone worry...`
`...And then.`
`After making the round trip between her home and the store once more...and arriving at the convenience store for a third time...`
`...A policeman was there.`
`"It's that child.`
` ...Maria-chan, did you find your key?"`
`"......Uu-...`
` ...Didn't find it..."`
`"What's your name, miss?"`
`"........."`
`The policeman asked her name, but Maria didn't answer.`
`"Did your mother tell you not to talk to policemen?`
` Heheheh!`
` Don't worry, no need to be scared of me.`
` Have you eaten dinner yet, miss?"`
`"......I bought some, but I couldn't get into my house, so I couldn't eat it."`
`"What's your mother doing?`
` Is she not coming home tonight?`
` Is it her work?"`
`"......Uu-."`
`"Do you know how we can contact your mother at work?"`
`"........."`
`Maria hung her head limply.`
`...She didn't understand why the policeman was getting mad at her.`
`No, he probably wasn't getting mad at her, but if this reached her mother's ears, then she would definitely be in trouble.`
`Even if she didn't understand the reason why she would be in trouble, she at least understood that much.`
`But the policeman wouldn't let Maria go.`
`And her head was swimming from hunger.`
`The policeman noticed that, and it was decided that he'd listen to her story as they ate in the police box.`
`...Maria was taken to the police box.`
`She had her oden heated in a microwave oven, and even salty rice cakes and hot tea were brought out for her.`
`She had been told not to talk to policemen, `
`...but after being asked about Sakutaro, she responded, starting to feel that this wasn't a bad person.`
`...And anyway, she wouldn't be able to return home now, so she didn't know what to do.`
`......She told him Mama's work phone number, `
`...which she had been told to tell no one of and to use only in a very, very serious situation.`
`In the tatami room inside the police box, as she ate the oden that was so hot it felt like it would burn her,`
` she watched the policeman making the phone call, lazily thinking, ...'Aah, I'm probably gonna get in trouble'.`
`"......Will Mama...get mad at me......?"`
`『...Uryu......』`
`He must have been listening to the phone ringing for a very long time.`
`With the receiver up to his ear, the policeman looked up at the clock, grumbling.`
`"......Maybe they aren't picking up because their business hours are over.`
` ...Hmmmmmm.`
` ...Huh?`
` Hello?`
` Hello?`
` Is this Anti-Rosa Ltd.?`
` This is the Komatsugawa Police Department police box in front of Senbonzakura Station.`
` Is President...umm...Udaikan...no, wait, President Ushiromiya available?`
` ......Yes.`
` ...What?`
` She's on vacation?"`
`"Yes.`
` Starting yesterday, the president has been on a three-day vacation.`
` Umm, is there some business you have with her...?"`
`"Oh no, no, no, never mind.`
` So, do you know where she might be?`
` You haven't heard where to contact her, have you?"`
`"Sure, ...could you hold on for a second?`
` ......Hey, anyone heard where the president went for her vacation?`
` Or how to contact her?"`
`"I heard she was going for all-you-can eat crabs in Sapporo with her boyfriend.`
` Aaaw, I'm sure such a cold place will do wonders for shrinking the distance between them, don't you?`
` I haven't heard how to contact them."`
`"Yep, understood.`
` ...Um, hello.`
` I hear she went to Sapporo, but I'm not sure about how to reach her.`
` ...Should I take a message?"`
`"Hmm, I see, what a shame.`
` Well then, if you manage to get in touch with her again, could you tell her that we called?`
` Sure, yes."`
`...After that, I was taken to the police department, which was even bigger,`
` and ended up spending the night there.`
`Then, they asked me various things about myself.`
`A lady who called herself the district welfare officer came by and asked about a lot of things.`
`And I was told 'You poor thing'.`
`When I heard that, I learned for the first time.`
`"......Am I......a poor thing...?"`
`『...Uryu...`
` That's not true, ...you're happy, Maria...』`
`"......Uu-..."`
`Then, ...Rosa came back.`
`Maria was told to go to her room,`
` ...but on her way back from the bathroom, she hid by the entrance to the living room and listened in on the exchange.`
`The person who had come to visit...was the female district welfare officer who had asked Maria various questions on that other day.`
`"You can't be so pushy!!`
` Maria's heart is too innocent and delicate, so if there was an insensitive kid there, she could be hurt!!`
` Please stop your pointless meddling!!"`
`"But in that case, Miss,`
` if the child is so delicate, why leave her home all alone?`
` Shouldn't a mother be together with her child?"`
`"I am together with her as much as I should be!!`
` I don't need to take instructions from you for something like that...!!"`
`"Oh, really?`
` She's very well known in this area.`
` They say your daughter frequently goes out at night to buy things and eat.`
` Everyone was worried and looking out for her."`
`"How do you know that was my child?!!`
` There's got to be plenty of children around this town, right?!!`
` Don't just suddenly decide that it's my Maria!!`
` Kids sometimes walk around outside at night, right?!`
` How can you prove that they were all my child?!"`
`"It's well-known around the shopping center...that a girl holding a lion stuffed animal often stops by to eat dinner and buy things.`
` Everyone treated Maria-chan with care out of concern for her.`
` Sometimes, people even escorted her home, thinking the night roads might be dangerous, you see?"`
`"Y-You can find lion stuffed animals anywhere!!`
` It was none of their business, escorting her home!!`
` Are they thinking of kidnapping Maria?!`
` Don't bother her!!`
` Maria is my child.`
` I am raising her!`
` I have no intention of putting her in some strange institution!!`
` Stop your needless meddling!!"`
`『U-Uryu...`
` Does that lion stuffed animal...`
`mean me...?』`
`"...It's okay.`
` I'm the one in trouble...`
` It has nothing to do with you, Sakutaro..."`
`Maria hugged Sakutaro, continuing to watch her mother fearfully...`
`"I-I also wish I could be with Maria every day!`
` But I'm a single mother, so I have to work!`
` I may not look it, but I'm a president of a company, and I bear responsibility for my employees' well-being!!`
` I'm busy with my work all year round, so there's no time for me to rest!!"`
`"Reeally?`
` But you've been on vacation these last three days, haven't you?"`
`"I-I have not been on vacation!`
` I've stayed at my company all night, working!!`
` There's a mountain of matters to be taken care of that the other unreliable employees can't handle!!"`
`"Why are you lying like that?`
` Someone from your company said that you were taking a three-day vacation, you see?`
` You went to Hokkaido with your boyfriend, right?`
` Leaving your daughter by herself for three whole days...!"`
`"I-I don't know anything about this boyfriend I don't know anything about Hokkaido!!!`
` Where are you getting this nonsense?!`
` Why, why?!`
` Do you have any proof?!`
` What the hell, don't just start butting in on someone else's family matters!!`
` I love Maria I have my own way of loving her so just keep your mouth shut!!`
` I didn't go on a vacation I was just working the whole time!!"`
`"I was trying to finish things up at work with all my strength, all my strength because I wanted to see Maria as soon as I could!!`
` I stayed at the company the whole whole whole whole, whole whole whole whole time!!`
` I don't know I don't know I don't know anything about Hokkaido don't just go ahead and say something like thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!!!`
` Just get out!!`
` Get ooooooooout!!`
` What's wrong with yoooooouuu?!!`
` Get out!!`
` Get ooooooooouuuut!!!"`
`Rosa raged, her hair flying wildly.`
`A teacup was knocked over from the force of her standing up,`
` but far louder than that was the sound of her beating the table with both hands.`
`When faced with this rage that could accurately be described as wide-eyed derangement,`
` the district welfare officer couldn't help but be taken aback.`
`...And the same went for Maria, who was secretly watching this from the hallway.`
`She had already seen her mother in a rage several times before this.`
`But she had never seen her this crazed with anger.`
`When she saw this, Maria was sure.`
`...This was no longer her mother.`
`It was some other evil being that was possessing her mother's body...`
`And then, she herself was discovered by the evil being.`
`Maria knew that she was being reflected in the evil being's eyes.`
`Her mind went blank, and she felt as though her field of vision was racing off into the distance...`
`After fiercely closing in on Maria, Rosa mercilessly slapped her on her small shoulders...`
`and dropped her gaze towards the stuffed animal Maria was holding, Sakutaro.`
`"......Maria,`
` even though I told you so many times not to take that outside, `
`...you brought it with you, didn't you?"`
`『...U-Uryu......`
` I-It isn't Maria's fault...`
` I told her to take me...』`
`"Th-That's not true...!`
` I brought Sakutaro on my own because I was lonely...!`
` So Mama, it isn't Sakutaro's fault...!!"`
`『Uryu, ...Maria......』`
`"It's not Sakutaro's fault!!`
` It's not Sakutaro's fault!!"`
`Instead of Maria, the brunt of Rosa's anger was aimed at the lion stuffed animal Maria was holding.`
`...A girl went shopping in the middle of the night, always clutching a lion stuffed animal.`
`Because of that, she had become well known in the shopping center...`
`'!s1`
`...D...`
`Didn't I tell you not to take stuffed animals with yooooooooouuu?!!!`
` Why...`
`can't you...`
`listen to what Mama says?!!`
` Why?!`
` Why, why?!`
` Why can't you follow Mama's ruuuuuuules?!!"`
`With every single word, she stamped her heel and banged furiously on the wall.`
`...Of course, she didn't make direct contact with Maria.`
`However, the violence of the harsh sound certainly beat against her.`
`"M-Miss, ...stop that...!!"`
`"Let go!!`
` I said let go, damn iiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`The district welfare officer had come back to her senses and was pinning Rosa's arms behind her back.`
`But the instant Rosa was touched, she went wild, furiously throwing the welfare officer off.`
`...She hit the table and fell to the ground.`
`A teacup on the table smashed on the floor, making a violent sound...`
`『...M-Maria didn't do anything wrong...!`
` It's my fault!`
` So don't scold Maria...!!』`
`"I'm the one who brought Sakutaro...!!`
` It's not Sakutaro's fault!!`
` It's not Sakutaro's fault!!`
` So don't look at Sakutaro with those scary eyes!!`
` Don't look at hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiim!!"`
`『Don't scold Maria...!`
` Don't scold Maria...!!`
` Uryuu--!!!』`
`".........Y-You...`
` What were you doing just now, and a minute ago too?`
` Do you also play with dolls like that...outside?`
` Did you do it in front of the people in the store...?`
`'!s0`
`So that's why they remembered yoooooooou, `
`die you brainless moron!! Why are you such a dumbaaaaaaaaaaaassss?!!!"`
`"Answer me honestly.`
` When you went out, you always walked around with that stuffed animal without telling Mama, right?"`
`『......U-Uryu......』`
`"Stop using that weird stuffed animal talk!!!`
` Speak with your own words, not a stuffed animal's!!!"`
`"S-Sakutaro isn't a stuffed animal!!`
` He's my friend!!`
` Don't call him a stuffed animal...`
` Doooooooooooooooooooon't!!"`
`"Yeah, yeah, I get it, it was called Sakutarou, was it?!`
` You took him with you all the time when you went shopping, without telling Mama, right?"`
`"...Y-Yeah......"`
`Maria admitted it honestly.`
`If she hadn't admitted it, then Sakutaro would have said something to take the blame,`
` so by admitting it right away, she was protecting her small friend.`
`"Only Sakutarou?`
` Any others?`
` ...You haven't been bringing weird things to school too, have you...?"`
`"...M-Miss!!`
` Surely your daughter has done nothing wrong!`
` Stop this interrogation at once!"`
`"You, stay quiet!!!`
` I'm talking with my daughter, aren't I?!!!`
` ...Come on, Maria, look at Mama when you talk.`
` What's the answer to Mama's question?"`
`"...U-Uu-...`
` ...It wasn't just Sakutaro.`
` ...All the rabbits were with me too..."`
`"......Do you have them with you now...?"`
`"Uu-......"`
`Maria fished around in her pockets,`
` ...pulling out four ceramic rabbits with her tiny hand...`
`The rabbits were her close friends, who could be together with her at school in Sakutaro's place.`
`But when Rosa saw that, she shook her head slightly as though dizzy...`
`On a school notice, it had been written that Maria was apparently bringing toys to school and playing with them,`
` and her family was instructed to try and prevent this.`
`But Rosa had rejected that, blaming the teacher and phoning in a protest of her own to the school.`
`...Saying that there was no way her child would bring toys to school.`
`For nearly an hour, she had shouted at the vice principal to stop making false accusations about her daughter.`
`...To a certain degree, those at the school had grasped that Maria was a pitiful girl.`
`They knew that the small toys she brought in were her only friends.`
`...So they had done their best to overlook it.`
`But when the other students caught sight of them,`
` some of the boys had started complaining that only she could bring toys, and the school had racked their brains on how to cope with this...`
`They had tried to gently send a warning by way of the mother,`
` but after Rosa's overreaction, even Maria's teacher decided to overlook it.`
`......But now Rosa knew.`
`She had been the one who was wrong, ...and her daughter really had been bringing toys to school.`
`......And those at the school...`
`had known that she was a disgrace who brought toys to school and played with them as though they were her only friends.`
`To Rosa, who thought her daughter was just a little different from normal children,`
` having this peculiar side of her daughter exposed and found fault with was, more than anything else, something she couldn't bear.`
`......So she howled.`
`She raged.`
`The district welfare officer tried to cut between Rosa and Maria again,`
` but she only met with Rosa's wrath once more.`
`'!s0`
`and when even that failed to curb her anger, she stomped on the ground over and over again so forcefully that it seemed she might break through the floor.`
`Then, after seeming to come back to her senses for a second, `
`......she immediately froze her harsh breathing...and asked Maria.`
`".........`
`...Maria.`
` Those rabbits in the band, are they your close friends?"`
`"......U-Uu-......"`
`"I see.`
` Isn't it great that you have a full four friends?"`
`As she said that, Rosa grabbed one of the rabbits from Maria's hand.`
`Then, she shoved it in front of Maria's eyes so she could see it very well.`
`...The cute rabbit holding a trumpet was a small doll like a chess piece.`
`She slowly lifted it into the air.`
`...Of course, Maria's and Sakutaro's eyes also followed it...`
`And then, with a speed that the eye couldn't follow, she smashed it against the wall.`
`『......!!!』`
`She had half imagined that this worst possible thing might happen.`
`So she instantly realized what had been done.`
`...So, Maria let out a short, despairing scream...`
`It was in pieces.`
`It had been small and sturdy, but that hadn't been enough to withstand her mother's fierce rage.`
`"......Because you didn't listen to what Mama told you, I broke one of them.`
` From now on, every time you disobey something Mama says, I'll break another one.`
` ...Remember that!!!"`
`"Miss, ...you think to call yourself a mother after doing something like that?!!`
` You think you can do something like that and not hurt your daughter?!"`
`"Hurt Maria?!`
` I'm also hurting, right?!`
` Who's gonna take responsibility for my wounds?!`
` Weeeell?!`
` Who iiiiiiiiiis?!!!`
` Didn't I tell you to shut uuuuup!!!"`
`"S-Stop it, Mama...!`
` It's my fault...!`
` Don't get mad at this lady...!"`
`『It isn't Maria's fault, ...it's mine...!`
` Don't get mad at Maria...!`

` As long as Sakutaro's there, I don't need anything else!`
` So give him back!!`
` Give him baaaaaaaack!!"`
`...For some reason, my frantic request just added oil to the fire of Mama's anger...`
`Mama pushed my arm aside as I tried to grab Sakutaro and snatch him back,`
` and in a bizarre way, she stuck her fingernails on both hands deep into Sakutaro, twisting him...`
`The red muffler, which I had carefully wrapped for him every day, came off and fell to the floor...`
`...Sakutarou, who had been so, so precious to me...`
`...Was twisted, smashed, torn at with fingernails so much...`
`'!s0`
`his face curving...`
`in sadness......`
`'!s0`
`found a stitch on the neck......`
`and tore it...`
`...With the fingernails of both hands, `
`...she tore it apart......`
`In that instant, `
`......Sakutaro's yellow cloth...`
`and the cotton inside...burst apart...`
`It looked almost like moist cotton candy...`
`『...U......ryu.........』`
`"...kutaro......?"`
`『...Ma...ria......』`
`"......Sakutaro......"`
`『U...ryu...———』`
`"......kutaro......"`
`『——... .. .・  "`
`"......ta...ro......"`
`...`
`......The crumpled yellow cloth and the cotton candy flowing out were thrust right in front of my eyes.`
`Then, ...through Mama's face, the evil being...stated it clearly.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"~ib~Sakutarou is dead~ib~."`
`Mabagagyurui, gyugo.`
`'!s0`
`...kutaro`
`...sakuta`
`...o`
`...gubijitta......`
`...Uuuuu.`
`Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuu...`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuu...`
`gudaro...`
`sagudaro...`
` ...Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuu......`
`"MARIA, ...MARIA......`
` ...Do not cry..."`
`"Beatrice, Beatrice...!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"Sakutaro was a good friend...`
` As long as you do not forget that, he will always be with you...`
` So do not cry..."`
`"Bring him back to life!!`
` You can use a lot of magic, Beato!!`
` You can even bring Sakutaro back to life, right?!"`
`"......A-About that...`
` ...Of course, if Sakutaro had been my furniture, it would be easy.`
` However, Sakutaro is your furniture.`
` ...That makes it difficult for me."`
`"If you say it's difficult, that means it isn't impossible, right?!`
` Bring him back to life!!`
` Bring him back to life with the Endless Magiiiiiic!"`
`"......Hmm...`
` ...To tell the truth...`
` Sakutarou's vessel was a stuffed animal Rosa made herself, correct...?`
` That Rosa has denied Sakutarou.`
` ...A life that is not permitted by its own mother cannot exist..."`
`Beatrice's words were feeble.`
`...Because she knew that, no matter what the excuse,`
` it wouldn't be enough to calm Maria and make her accept it.`
`But she had to communicate the painful truth to her disciple and close friend.`
`......She had to tell her the fact...`
`...that even with all of her own power, even she could not revive Sakutarou.`
`"As long as you continue to strongly believe in Sakutarou's existence, that soul will not disappear...`
` So, MARIA, ...please, do not be sad..."`
`"Even now, look, ...believe that Sakutarou is smiling right over there..."`
`'!s0`
` No `
`no `
`no!!`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, mar_4e1029:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, mar_4e1030:`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!"`
`"Give it up...!!`
` There is no magic to revive Sakutarou...!`
` Despite that, you must strongly believe that Sakutarou will continue to exist as your close friend...!!`
` That power will become magic...!"`
`"That's not magic, that's not magic!!`
` You have to bring Sakutaro back to life...!!`
` You can't do it because Mama made him herself?`
` Why did Mama make Sakutaro?`
` It was to give him to me as a present, right?`
` It was to make him my friend, right?`
` So why...did Mama make it herself...and break it herself?`
` Why did Mama give birth to it by herself, and try to break it herself?`
` I don't understand, I don't understand!!"`
`"I hate Mama, hate Mama...!!`
` Can't stand it can't stand it too sad too sad...!!`
` Wanna smash Mama up like she did to Sakutaro...!`
` Wanna stick my fingernails in and tear her, turn her into cloth and cotton!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!`
` I can't stand it, I can't stand it, Beatriiice!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, Sakutaroooooooo!!!!"`
`From the darkness behind Maria's back, two massive jet-black arms crept out,`
` twisting around Maria as she sobbed in anger.`
`Then, massive fingernails stuck into Maria's chest and stomach...`
`Maria could not see that.`
`...But Beato could.`
`Anger and sadness without any place to go will tear you apart.`
`...Beato knew that.`
`She could see that.`
`Yes.`
` ...In the end, those massive arms were Maria's own.`
`Those fingernails slowly started to eat into her chest and stomach...`
`...With their immense size and strength, `
`those arms could probably tear Maria into bits easily...`
`But Maria herself couldn't notice.`
`Drowning in a sea of her own tears, ...she couldn't notice that her own arms were trying to tear apart her own chest...`
`"I can't stand it, can't stand it...!!!`
` If Sakutaro can't be brought back to life no matter what, ...I want revenge!!`
` Want to make Mama meet the same end!!`
` Want her to meet the same end as Sakutaro...!`
` Beatrice!!`
` Teach me magic for that!!`
` Teach me magic to beat Mama...!!"`
`"............`
`...Is that truly how you feel?"`
`"Kill Mama!!`
` I'll kill her!!`
` No, that isn't Mama!`
` It's the bad witch possessing Mama!`
` I'll kill the witch Mama!!`
` Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!"`
`".........`
`...Very well.`
` I shall give you that power.`
` ...For tearing you and your beautiful heart apart, `
`...for giving you that pain, it is fitting that your heartless mother be torn apart considerably."`
`"......I shall teach it to you.`
` ...I shall teach you of the abyss in the world of witches, of the depths where no light reaches..."`
`"Uuuuuuuu, Sakutaro, Sakutaro...!!`
` Hate, hate, I haaaate everyone!!`
` I hate Mama too, Ange too!!`
` I hate everyone, everyooone!!`
` Uuuuuuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`I had planned on taking a nap, ...but the boat really was shaking bad.`
`I gave up on sleeping and went up onto the deck.`
`There, I was welcomed by the shining sun and a strong sea breeze...`
`Amakusa had been doing some stretches on the deck.`
`...He must have a lot of time on his hands too.`
`After all, it'll be several more hours before we reach Niijima.`
`It would only have taken a couple dozen minutes by airplane, but there was the chance that the Niijima airport was under the Sumadera family's web.`
`The harbor would probably be the same.`
`For that reason, I had obtained a boat that would let me land while avoiding the harbor, no questions asked.`
`I'd bumped into a cheery boat captain,`
` plied him generously, and he had decided to help me out, amused...`
`"Still gonna be a while?"`
`"I just asked the captain, and it sounds like it'll take a full two hours more.`
` Well, beggars can't be choosers."`
`"......The weather sure is nice.`
` Feels like I'll burn."`
`"Going to read on the deck?`
` You'll damage your book."`
`Amakusa apparently thought this because I was clutching Maria onee-chan's diary under my arm.`
`I'd been reading it half asleep, which was why I'd come back up still clutching it.`
`"How's it going?`
` Think you'll be able to find the truth of Rokkenjima from Maria-san's diary?"`
`"......Who knows.`
` No matter how much I investigate what happened on that island, it won't make for anything more than a theory.`
` There's no truth written in the message bottle or Onee-chan's diary, just a fairy tale with a witch walking around.`
` ...I'm stuck."`
`"Looks like you've got nothing to look forward to except questioning those involved on Niijima."`
`"I imagine the Witch Hunters have showered them with questions over and over, so I'm pretty sure I won't find any new facts."`
`"Hehhaha...!`
` So even though your hopes are that low, you're willing to spend a half-day trip on a boat to go to Niijima anyway! Talk about fickle."`
`"......It's like a journey of self-satisfaction, so that I can say 'I investigated'.`
` I'm not so naive as to seriously think that the truth of 12 years ago will be revealed."`
`"And when you're done with your self-satisfaction trip, what'll you do next?"`
`"Who knows.`
` I haven't thought about it.`
` ......I'll go to Niijima, ask some people who were involved.`
` ...Then, after going to Rokkenjima in the end and leaving some flowers, my journey will be over."`
`......Several days have already passed since this journey began.`
`After being told by Bernkastel on the roof of that building to search for the truth of 12 years ago, `
`I'd left on a journey like trying to grasp a cloud.`
`At the time, I felt as though I'd experienced something mystical...and had the feeling that I might be able to grasp some kind of miracle at the end of this journey.`
`...But after several days passed, my excitement died down.`
`On that day, when I stood on the roof of that skyscraper, my heart was completely cornered and dead.`
`...So I'd wanted from the bottom of my heart to be released from the cage of my body and rise into the sky...`
`and had crossed the fence in order to die.`
`Maybe experiencing the desire to die and actually stepping forwards, throwing my body down...`
`caused some kind of mystical experience inside my head, making me think I had received a message from a witch.`
`......The excitement from my jump lessened over time, and the more I came back to my senses, the more this journey lost its meaning.`
`But I didn't even consider suspending this journey just because of that.`
`If I stop this journey, it'll mean acknowledging that the message from that witch was an illusion.`
`And I felt as though that meant throwing away the promise the witch made...`
`and any chance that someone from my family might come back.`
`So, because it was hard to believe that those events were an illusion, I've continued on my journey.`
`I don't seriously believe that this journey will change anything.`
`...It's even up to me when to end this journey.`
` It's up to me to choose where the final destination is.`
`In the end, this journey is only for my self-satisfaction...`
`"......Self-satisfaction, huh?`
` It sounds bad when you say it, but I think that's actually what life is all about."`
`"...Oh?`
` If that's the answer you've reached after hovering over the line between life and death in the mercenary business, that's probably pretty deep."`
`"Don't take it so lightly.`
` What I'm trying to say...is that the only one who can acknowledge you in this world is you yourself."`
`Amakusa continued stretching as he spoke.`
`In an irritatingly fresh way.`
`Hearing it told to me as though from a teacher made me instinctively want to resist, but what he was saying was extremely sensible.`
`".........`
`...That may be true.`
` People work hard when they want to be acknowledged by someone.`
` ...In most cases, that someone is their parents.`
` Children learn how to work hard because they want to be praised by their parents.`
` ......Although that's why I never learned."`
`"Sorry, that's not how I meant it.`
` ...What I'm trying to say is that there's nothing wrong with self-satisfaction.`
` No matter who praises you, it's meaningless unless you can accept it.`
` ...Turning it around, even if no one praises you, that doesn't matter as long as you can accept it."`
`"......Self-satisfaction tends to contradict a desire to improve oneself, so we're usually taught that it's bad.`
` Somehow, your argument seems like a pretty fresh take on it, Amakusa."`
`"The anguish of the human world comes when you want someone to acknowledge you, but you don't know what it is you should be striving for.`
` I had a time like that too.`
` I wanted to be acknowledged by someone, but I didn't know what I wanted them to acknowledge about me.`
` And since I didn't know what to strive for or how far I should go to be acknowledged,`
` I did a lot of crazy things."`
`"And the answer you reached...was self-satisfaction?"`
`"It sounds bad, but that's how it is.`
` Rich is the one who is content with what they are, they say."`
`"......If I'm satisfied with my life, it doesn't matter what other people say.`
` It's the same for your life, and for this journey.`
` No one has any right to criticize you other than you yourself, Ange-san."`
`"You're the only one who determines the meaning and results of your journey.`
` If it's been a meaningful journey for you, then that's more than enough."`
`".........`
`......I always did take you for a flippant ladies man, but you really do say weird things every once in a while.`
` I'll bet you think saying stuff like that will make you popular."`
`"Of course not, of course not.`
` That's not how I meant it at all.`
` ......Looks like you want to be alone.`
` I'll head over to see the boat captain.`
` Please, take it easy."`
`Amakusa apparently decided I was in a bad mood.`
`...Although I didn't feel that way myself.`
`Or, he might have finished a set of stretches and wanted to cool off in the shade.`
`The sea winds were strong, but not enough to cool the rays of the sun.`
`Amakusa disappeared.`
`Only I remained.`
`"......Self-satisfaction is life itself, huh?"`
`"That's just boring.`
` Life is nothing without greed."`
`I noticed that Mammon had suddenly appeared, her abundant hair fluttering over by the prow of the ship.`
`"It's true that a life of greed would be fun.`
` But unlike you, Humans have a limited life-span.`
` If greed is eternal, that means a person will have desires even in the last moment before they die.`
` Having desires means there's something that you want.`
` Something you don't have, some way you aren't complete."`
`"...I'm sure it's tough to die when you can't think of your life as being a full one.`
` So I'm sure self-satisfaction is necessary."`
`"......I see.`
` Because of the existence of a life span, you have to compromise like that?`
` All of my masters had very long life spans, so I've never thought of it."`
`"I wonder if Humans live for the purpose of becoming satisfied.`
` ...If so, it's probably easiest to live without desires.`
` ...I see, so that's why greed is one of the seven deadly sins."`
`"*giggle*`
` Your praise honors me."`
`Apparently that counted as a compliment in Mammon's eyes.`
`She turned and gave a graceful bow.`
`"Ange-sama,`
` do Humans live so that they can find satisfaction at the moment of their deaths?"`
`"...Wouldn't it be pretty tough if you felt you were lacking something when you died?"`
`"If so, then Humans live only so that they can meet a satisfying death.`
` They live so that they can have a better death.`
` They live so that they can die."`
`......This kid's saying something pretty incredible.`
`...I see, as I'd expect from a demon stake.`
`However, it might be the truth.`
`Humans suffer because they aren't satisfied...and live only to find satisfaction.`
`In other words, that might be the same as a desire to die satisfied.`
`"I can't counter that.`
` ...People live in order to be satisfied.`
` And they hope to die that way.`
` So, it's really painful when you don't know how to find that satisfaction."`
`"Just how can you find something like that?`
` In a Human's life."`
`"......By being acknowledged.`
` By hearing someone say 'You are happy'."`
`"If it doesn't matter who acknowledges them, then I'll do it."`
`"Yeah, that's the problem.`
` ......People don't know who needs to acknowledge them."`
`"So, searching for this person who can acknowledge them is the journey of their life?`
` Hmmmm."`
`"It sounds strange.`
` Whether you're acknowledged or not, it supposedly doesn't change your circumstances.`
` ...And yet, if you are acknowledged, you will be satisfied, while if you aren't, then you won't.`
` ...It's almost like the blue bird.`
` ...Because you can't notice the blue bird even though it's already in the cage, you have to go out on a journey searching everywhere."`
`"What the heck.`
` Kyahhahaha.`
` Human lives sure are stupid."`
`"That's right.`
` Amakusa said something really good.`
` ...Rich is the one who is content with what they are, ...was it?`
` I don't know where that proverb came from, but it's deep.`
` ...Basically, if you can't find enough satisfaction unless someone else acknowledges you, that's the same as not acknowledging yourself.`
` ...The ultimate in self-fulfillment is acknowledging yourself."`
`"That's right.`
` Because, if you can 'know' that you're fully satisfied, there's no need to be acknowledged by anyone.`
` Just by taking notice of the small things, the Humans' foolish journey of life can be ended easily.`
` You can spend the rest of your life playing and having a good time.`
` A Human's life is so ridiculous, kyahhahahaha!"`
`Mammon's choice of words was bad, but it was surely the truth.`
`If most of a Human's life is a journey with the hopes that someone will acknowledge them, `
`so that they can achieve a satisfied death...`
`......Then when they realize that the person doing the acknowledging isn't someone else, but they themselves, that pointless journey can end.`
`Humans who have ended that journey can probably spend the rest of their lives as they wish, with their heads held high.`
`How noble, how praiseworthy would that be...`
`"You know, `
`it seems Amakusa's on pretty bad terms with his parents.`
` ...That makes sense.`
` Any decent parents would want him to get the hell out of the trade he's in."`
`"Does that really matter though?`
` As long as it's fun for the person in question."`
`"......Exactly.`
` That's what it comes down to in the end.`
` Criticism formed by the observations of other people doesn't matter.`
` If your existence is firmly acknowledged by you yourself, that's enough.`
` ...If you can live with confidence in yourself, you'll surely be able to accept and be satisfied with any kind of lifestyle."`
`"I'm sure Amakusa will eventually eat a stray bullet on the battlefield and get seriously injured.`
` ...He might even die.`
` But I don't think he'd view that as something unfair.`
` I'm sure he'd cackle about how that's also part of life."`
`"What a great way to live.`
` I could fall for the guy."`
`"...Pitiful Humans who can't acknowledge themselves...`
`wander about searching for that their whole lives, and without anything being accepted, they do nothing but grumble and die while still unsatisfied.`
` ...How pitiful.`
` Compared to people whose lives drag on without any purpose,`
` Amakusa is more likely to eventually die by the roadside, but I think he's much more noble for living his life with his head held high."`
`"Aren't the winners in life those who achieve enlightenment?`
` If they can do that even a little sooner, they'll be able to live that much more of their life effectively."`
`......With Mammon's words, `
`...I finally accepted a certain fact.`
`In the past, ...I've called that girl unusual, a little strange.`
`However, `
`...that wasn't true.`
`All she did was keep her head held high...`
`...and finish that journey faster than anyone else.`
`".........Maybe that's what made Maria onee-chan...so amazing.`
` When she was at the age where she might or might not enter the first year of elementary school, she had already reached that point."`
`For people like us, looking at her life from the outside, it wasn't something we'd call blessed.`
`But even though days like that were engraved in her diary,`
` ...they always finished up by saying that it was a happy day.`
`Even though the part of her mother that didn't love her daughter came and went, `
`she believed that her mother loved her.`
`The mother's love that didn't exist, she created herself, filling her world with love.`
`Others might observe her as an unsatisfied, pitiful girl,`
` ...but she herself acknowledged that she was satisfied.`
`And so, she was happy that way.`
`It's easy to observe that as something pitiable and sad.`
`But to her, that was an outsider's opinion, so it didn't matter.`
`'Whether or not it was happy for her'...was the only important thing.`
`It's just like how, when people who live in the city point to the lifestyles of those in rural areas,`
` and mourn their inconvenience and feel sympathy for them, it's really none of their business.`
`If those who live there are satisfied with what they have, that's more than enough.`
`"......I've finally noticed something.`
` I noticed it just now.`
` ...I did something horrible to Maria onee-chan.`
` ......And to you all and Sakutarou as well, on that day."`
`"............"`
`"Whether magic exists...or not.`
` ...That's not up to other people to decide.`
` It's up to you yourself.`
` Whether magic exists to Maria onee-chan is a problem for Maria onee-chan to decide, not me."`
`"...And yet, when I was young, on that day, I said it.`
` By saying there was no way magic exists, ...I hurt her."`
`The fact that magic doesn't exist in my eyes...matters in my world.`
`But denying it even in Onee-chan's world for that reason was totally misguided.`
`"Mariage Sorcière is the Witches' Alliance Maria onee-chan created.`
` I was invited into it...and told to become a witch with them."`
`"Thinking it a new, interesting game, I went along with that for a while.`
` ...But, because of the cruelty of youth,`
` I got tired of it half-way through.`
` And, ...I tore her pure heart apart with sharp words."`
`"...At that time, we must've gotten into a huge fight.`
` I forgot about it right away, but she couldn't forget about it.`
` ...After all, to her, magic was a natural power that really existed,`
` and she believed that she'd be able to share it with me."`
`"...To Maria onee-chan, `
`magic is a power that can interpret the world as blessed...no, which can truly make everything blessed.`
` She just wanted to share that with me too.`
` The young me tore that feeling apart.`
` ...So, she closed herself up in a shell, assuming that she wouldn't be able to share her magic with anyone."`
`"......If that's true, then Lady MARIA's journey through life wasn't over after all.`
` If she'd been able to accept herself, then there'd be no need to collapse just because you denied her, Ange-sama."`
`"Onee-chan was young.`
` She still hadn't reached a philosophical viewpoint like Amakusa.`
` ...Yeah, now I understand...`
` That's why the witches' alliance called Mariage Sorcière was necessary."`
`——An alliance where each acknowledges that the other is a witch.`
`"...That's right, I'm pretty sure that was the first article in the agreement of Mariage Sorcière.`
` ...Witches of the alliance would acknowledge each other and respect each other.`
` That's the deepest and only meaning of the witches' alliance..."`
`Maria onee-chan wanted to share with me the secret laws to make the world happy, called magic.`
`But I was young.`
`And she was too.`
`...I hurt her with innocent cruelty.`
`"......On that day, I said...cruel things.`
` To you all and Sakutarou.`
` I said there was no way you exist."`
`"How rude.`
` We acknowledge that we exist ourselves.`
` We're not like Humans, with their souls half-asleep.`
` ...'I think, therefore I am'.`
` Whether you acknowledge or deny magic, the existence of the magic called the Seven Stakes of Purgatory...is a fact.`
` ...As long as we acknowledge it ourselves, to borrow your words."`
`"It truly would be violence for another person like me to deny it.`
` ......I'm sure that'd be like having your true mother yell 'I wish you had never been born'...`
`no, 'Disappear'."`
`...Even after being slammed by all those words,`
` ...Maria onee-chan's magic...`
`...made her believe in her mother's love.`
`Sakutarou, her magic friend, always encouraged her.`
`...He kept saying that her mother loved her, that she was coming home late because of her work,`
` and that she would definitely bring back a present...`
`Even after Maria learned that her mother's work wasn't really the cause, magic allowed her to continue believing.`
`And by believing that her mother loved her, by acknowledging herself,`
` she filled her world with love and peace and serenity, ...establishing it completely.`
`"What happened 12 years ago, ...what happened to my family...`
` ...This was never...a journey to search for that."`
`"......Then what kind of journey is this?"`
`"It was a journey...to apologize to Maria onee-chan for what happened that day."`
`"............"`
`"I don't know why, but that's what I think.`
` ...If I hadn't hurt her,`
` ......the incident 12 years ago might not have occurred.`
` ...That's what I think."`
`I have no basis for it.`
`I don't have a clue how hurting Onee-chan could be connected with that mysterious incident several years later.`
`But, for some reason, I can't imagine that there's no connection.`
`A witch caused that incident.`
`And the culprit is the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
`And Beatrice was part of the Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches.`
`I horribly hurt the other witch of that alliance.`
`I hurt her with the thought that magic doesn't exist.`
`......So, several years later, a crime caused by a witch occurred,`
` and a two-day period that couldn't be explained with anything but magic was thrust in my face, thanks to the message bottle.`
`"...There's no way I wasn't involved somehow.`
` ......I don't get it.`
` It could be coincidence, or it could be fate.`
` ......For some reason, I've starting thinking like that on this journey."`
`"And what's your basis for it?"`
`"I have none.`
` I just think it's true."`
`"Hmmmm...`
` The Japanese sure are interesting.`
` Even when they're the victim, they feel as though they did something wrong and apologize for no reason.`
` ...I could understand if you said 'I hate Beatrice for stealing my family!' or something,`
` but you really are weird, feeling guilty for no reason and apologizing."`
`"Of course I hate Beatrice.`
` I couldn't continue this journey without that feeling.`
` But it's okay to choose yet another purpose for this journey.`
` There's nothing wrong with adding on a goal of apologizing for past sins, in addition to getting revenge on a witch for what happened 12 years ago.`
` I can at least go to Rokkenjima, apologize for my reckless remarks, and offer flowers."`
`"...No, ......there's something better than flowers.`
` And I think that would be more fitting for Onee-chan."`
`I stood up, not minding that the sea breeze scattered my hair, and concentrated my mind...`
`I lifted my palm up to the height of my head...and imagined a vast space...`
`"......Ange-sama, ........."`
`"...Be quiet.`
` .........`
`...Come, arise.`
` ...I am the witch apprentice, ANGE Beatrice.`
` ...I was excommunicated, but I was once a member of the same alliance, and you are the dearly-missed furniture who played with me.`
` Answer to my call......"`
`It was hard to tell in the middle of the day, but a faint blue light gathered around the palm of my hand.`
`......Then, `
`......Sakutarou's form was revived.`
`It truly did bring back memories, that figure.`
`His cute ears, his bright-red muffler.`
`...It came off easily, so Onee-chan faithfully re-wrapped it all the time, didn't she...?`
`"...Sakutaro, `
`...do you recognize us?`
` Do you know who we are...?"`
`『...Uryu...?`
` Uryu...?`
` Mammon...?`
` Ange......?』`
`With a sleepy face, as though waking up from a long slumber, Sakutarou looked all around him as he spoke.`
`"It's been a long time, ...Sakutarou.`
` I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've summoned you with my own power.`
` ...And now, I'm the only one who can summon you."`
`『.........Uryu...』`
`Those words might have been a bit cruel.`
`Sakutarou's face clouded over...`
`"In the past, I denied you.`
` ......Now that I've summoned you, `
`...it means I've accepted your existence."`
`『......Are you sure...?`
` Is it really all right...for me to be summoned into Ange's world...?』`
`His eyes were a bit frightened.`
`...It was only natural.`
`I, who had played with him like a friend before,`
` had suddenly denied him and tried to burn him with the magic-resisting toxin.`
`It was only natural that he was scared...`
`"I apologize...`
`for that day.`
` ......To you too, Mammon.`
` And to the rest of you."`
`At some point, ...the rest of the Seven Sisters had gathered on the deck.`
`No, they're always there.`
`Always by my side.`
`As long as I acknowledge that it's okay for them to be there, they'll always appear.`
`"You certainly do exist.`
` Lucifer.`
` And Leviathan.`
` And Satan.`
` And Belphegor.`
` And Mammon.`
` And Beelzebub.`
` And Asmodeus.`
` ...And Sakutarou too."`
`"...Are you sure?`
` You're one challenging Beatrice-sama, Ange-sama.`
` ...Is it okay for one in a position of denying witches to acknowledge us?"`
`"As to whether magic exists or not in my world, sorry, but let me put that on hold.`
` It's not like I myself acknowledged the existence of magic."`
`"...But then, doesn't that contradict the fact...that you're acknowledging us?"`
`"It's because magic exists for people who believe.`
` Even if I don't.`
` If someone believes, then magic will exist in the human world."`
`"That fact won't change in the slightest whether I believe in magic or not.`
` No, it mustn't change.`
` That person just had to hold their head up high and believe in their own magic.`
` I acknowledge that.`
` So, it wouldn't be strange at all for all of you to exist."`
`"......Quite a play on words, ...but it's an interesting interpretation."`
`"What you're saying, Ange-sama, is probably a Devil's Proof."`
`"A Devil's Proof...?"`
`"Right?!`
` To prove the existence of demons, you just need to find one."`
`"But it's impossible to deny the existence of demons."`
`"Kyahha!`
` And we're here.`
` That means that whether Ange-sama believes in magic or not, our existence is unshakable."`
`『...Uryu?`
` The magic-resisting toxin...`
`...is disappearing...`
`...from Ange...』`
`"Y-You're right...`
` ...Even though you're in a position of denying magic, ...why...?"`
`"That's probably...`
`...because I learned what it means to respect and acknowledge.`
` Right now, ...I might be able...`
`to understand the depths of Maria onee-chan's...and Beatrice's magic."`
`In the past, I didn't believe in things like magic.`
` Thinking something like that couldn't exist, I acted like I was closing my eyes tightly and couldn't see anything.`
`But now, I'm different.`
`I get the feeling I can look right at the thing called magic...and close in on its true nature...`
`"...How frustrating.`
` It's truly rare to find a Human so free of the magic-resisting toxin in this day and age.`
` And she has such an uncommon genius for being a witch..."`
`"That's right.`
` ...If Ange-sama tried to become a witch right now,`
` ...she could grow to be a Great Witch, maybe even at Beatrice-sama's level."`
`"Even so, she has acknowledged our existence and is our master.`
` ...Most likely, Ange-sama will be our final master.`
` Let us think of this as our final service, and apply ourselves to the fullest."`
`"...Ble-ah.`
` But I just can't staaand that Ange-sama still doesn't believe in magic herself."`
`"...Ange-sama, please believe in magic toooo.`
` It feels like a waste to finally have a master and have it not be a wiiitch."`
`"Even though you have outstanding talent that could make you one of the greatest of witches, your goal is to attack witches.`
` It's so frustrating.`
` ...Well, even so, that's your life, the way you live,`
` and in the world where you've decided that, there's nothing we can do to complain."`
`"Thanks for understanding me.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` Yeah, whether magic exists `
`~ib~to me~ib~`
` or not,`
` that's up to me to decide.`
` Regardless of whether magic actually does exist somewhere in the world or not."`
`When I think about it, this world is so vast...and yet so small.`
`Billions of people live on the earth.`
`But I probably won't meet even 1% of those people.`
`Even so, I will speak of a world.`
`'My world', which doesn't know even 1% of the world.`
`"I'm not qualified to deny the laws of a world I don't know.`
` ...So just because magic doesn't exist in my world, I can't deny that magic exists in a world I don't know.`
` That makes it a true Devil's Proof.`
` No, maybe it's more like 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do'."`
`I can be confident in the world I know.`
`So even if that's denied by a complete stranger who doesn't know a thing about my world, that's nothing to worry about.`
`And in the same way, I've got no right to deny a world I don't know...`
`just because I don't know about it.`
`"Therefore,`
` regardless of whether there's magic in my world or not,`
` ...I can't deny the magic Maria onee-chan taught me."`
`『Uryu!`
` After all, even if you've never seen it,`
` ...magic exists!』`
`"Yes.`
` That's why, as I've already said,`
` ...you friends of the witches' alliance, Mariage Sorcière,`
` can't be denied by me or anyone else."`
`I proclaimed that most important part again.`
`......Even though the sea breeze and the crashing of the waves were noisy, it was a time of silence.`
`Both Sakutarou and the Seven Sisters of Purgatory...reflected upon my words.`
`And, probably, I did too.`
`Does magic exist?`
`Do witches exist?`
`While ignoring what the answer would be for my own world, ...I acknowledged their existence.`
` That contradiction was what I'd proclaimed so boldly.`
`『Thank you, ...Ange.』`
`"If you'll acknowledge that much, can't you acknowledge witches too...?`
` ...No, that was a foolish question.`
` You already have a clear answer to it."`
`"Sorry.`
` Though, I do acknowledge that witches might exist somewhere in this world.`
` But that doesn't shake my world."`
`"...You won't acknowledge witches or magic.`
` You'll definitely expose the truth of Rokkenjima.`
` ...Right?"`
`"Yes.`
` That's my world.`
` Even if a real witch exists, I won't acknowledge it in my world.`
` No matter how much that witch tries to convince me."`
`"Your position is to attack witches, Ange-sama.`
` ...And I understand well that you haven't the slightest wavering in that feeling.`
` We are your furniture, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory...!`
` We will always be by your side.`
` We'll always be waiting for the day that we can be useful...!"`
`"Although, since you don't believe in magic, we can never be anything more than people to talk to."`
`"That's enough for now.`
` We've been left room to exist.`
` For that alone, we should thank and acknowledge Ange-sama."`
`"In short!`
` All of us!"`
`『Are all together again...`
` Uryu-!!』`
`"Kya-h!!`
` Sakutaro-!`
` Let me squeeze youuuuuuuuu-!!"`
`When Sakutarou was overcome with emotion and tears came to his eyes, the Seven Sisters closed in and mobbed him.`
`...They were also celebrating a long-missed reunion.`
`If their existence is permitted, they're definitely capable of existing here.`
`No, even if I don't permit it, they can exist.`
`Because I acknowledged them, they `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~showed their reunion's joy to me as well.~ib~.`
`As I watched over that scene, ......I reflected over what this journey of mine meant.`
`"......I wonder if everyone will forgive me this way."`
`"You've done enough.`
` We are furniture.`
` Just being summoned,`
` just being allowed to be by your side makes us happy."`
`『Uryu...!`
` Ange, thank you very much...!』`
`"...Come to think of it, why was I able to summon Sakutarou?`
` ...No, it's the other way around.`
` Why wasn't Onee-chan able to summon Sakutarou?"`
`Maria onee-chan had despaired, thinking that Sakutarou had died.`
`Which meant she hadn't been able to summon him like this anymore.`
`In the past, Onee-chan said it was more advantageous in a summoning to have a vessel.`
`However, a vessel is like training wheels, and it shouldn't be absolutely necessary.`
`...In other words, even if the stuffed animal lion that was Sakutarou's vessel didn't exist, it should've be possible to summon him.`
`...No, when you put it like that,`
` it's even a little doubtful whether summoned things can be limited by life and death.`
`Moreover, Sakutarou should have been an especially important friend to Maria onee-chan.`
`She should've been able to strive hard to summon him one more time.`
`It certainly was sad that the original stuffed animal vessel had been torn apart,`
` but why did he 'die' and become impossible to summon again...?`
`『...That's because...`
`...at that time, Maria saw my stuffed animal torn...`
`and `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~decided~ib~`
` that I'd died.』`
`"It's the same as the existence of magic.`
` ...If Sakutarou has died in Lady MARIA's world,`
` then he can't exist in her world."`
`『......Uryu...』`
`The shock of having her beloved stuffed animal torn apart...`
`had left a wound in her heart serious enough to prevent her from summoning her irreplaceable close friend.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~In Maria onee-chan's eyes~ib~`
`, Sakutarou died.`
`So even if Sakutarou can exist like this to me, he cannot exist before her.`
`『I...was always with Maria...`
` ...When Maria cried, I was always right beside her, telling her not to cry...`
` ...But my form, my voice, ...nothing of me will reach Maria now...』`
`Sakutarou hung his head, looking sad.`
`"...After that incident, the nature of Mariage Sorcière rapidly began to change.`
` Before then, the alliance was a peaceful thing.`
` But after that incident, it grew full of shadier things, focusing on how to curse people you hate.`
` ...Onee-chan's diary began to show a clear change."`
`A diary is a mirror that reflects one's heart as it is.`
`It probably showed the personality called Maria die......`
`and be reborn as the evil witch personality, MARIA.`
`When she buried that diary in hatred and sadness, ...her heart surely wasn't satisfied.`
`Because it wasn't satisfied, she had to bury it with hatred and sadness.`
`And while still unsatisfied, she met with death.`
`...I wonder if her unsatisfied soul has a hole opened in its chest from sadness even now...`
`and continually wanders, dripping tears down and calling Sakutarou's name...`
`............`
`"......Onee-chan...needs you."`
`『Uryu......』`
`"What can I do to revive you in Maria onee-chan's world?`
` If I can learn that method, I'll be able to save Onee-chan.`
` ...That's the method of atonement I've been given.`
` What can be done to revive Sakutarou?"`
`『...To Maria, my vessel had a very important meaning...』`
`"The vessel.`
` ...In other words, if we could revive the lion stuffed animal..."`
`『But...`
`...Mama Rosa made my stuffed animal herself, so only she could make it...』`
`Even inside the diary, Maria onee-chan had asked this of Beatrice...and was refused for that reason.`
`The magical significance of a stuffed animal being unique and handmade is very large.`
`Then, if we could make the same thing once more...`
`But Aunt Rosa is already gone from this world.`
`We can't make the same thing again.`
`"...Was there ever another identical stuffed animal made, or anything like that?"`
`"He's a stuffed animal made to be Lady MARIA's birthday present...and is the only one of his kind in the world.`
` ...A handmade and unique vessel.`
` That's why it conceals a great magical power.`
` And, ...if lost, it cannot be obtained again.`
` It won't revive..."`
`『......Uryu......』`
`...Because she knew that, `
`Maria onee-chan watched that stuffed animal, which was unique in that world, get torn apart, `
`......and despaired.`
`Because it was the only one of its kind in the world,`
` and she couldn't permit a compromise such as buying another one, ...she had despaired from the bottom of her heart...`
`"...But Sakutarou is right here.`
` Even without a vessel, he's here.`
` Because I acknowledge that, he certainly exists in my world.`
` ......Even if Maria onee-chan doesn't acknowledge him, that cannot be denied.`
` Right...?"`
`"Logically, that's true,`
` ...but I think using the same logic to make Lady MARIA accept him could be difficult."`
`『...Maria, `
`...I'm not dead...`
` I'm right here......`
` ...Uryu...』`
`"I'm sure that on Rokkenjima,`
` ...I'll be able to be reunited with Maria onee-chan.`
` And, ...no matter what, I'll revive the you that's inside Onee-chan...and let you be reunited."`
`『Can you do it...?』`
`"It'll probably be hard.`
` ...Just like how, after being invited into the witches' alliance, I rejected it without understanding what it meant,`
` she might also reject your existence."`
`"......But, I've got to do it.`
` That's the only way I can atone for my sins."`
`"......Ange-sama..."`
`"What's waiting on Rokkenjima?`
` And what will happen, what will be created?`
` ...Or maybe nothing will happen."`
`『............』`
`"That island, which was the beginning of everything, is the final destination of this journey.`
` ......You all are the furniture of a witch, so as your master, `
`...`
`I have to take you home~ib~...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`to the witch's island, to Rokkenjima."`
`Even though the rays of the sun had been so strong, at some point clouds had started to hang down.`
`The spray that hit my cheek might not all have come from crashing waves.`
`"Ange-san,`
` looks like we're gonna get a bit of a shower.`
` Maybe you'd better go below deck."`
`Amakusa called out to me with an expression that said 'Oh, you're still here?'`
`When I looked up, I saw that the island's silhouette had gotten much larger.`
`We might reach land very soon.`
`I remembered that the weather report had mentioned scattered rains.`
`The sky wasn't dark enough for rain clouds.`
`It'll probably be just for a short time.`
`Even though the rain was light enough not to be a pain...`
`...Having rain start to fall as we approached the island felt like some kind of fate.`
`It was raining on October 4, 1986 as well.`
`I'm approaching the Rokkenjima of that day...and not just in distance...`
`I went back down with Amakusa.`
`He was carrying what looked like a really large and heavy golf bag.`
`It was something Amakusa had brought back with him on a day when we'd split up.`
`...I didn't inquire as to its contents, but it was hard to imagine that they were anything peaceful.`
`"......I won't go so far as to ask what's inside, but it looks heavy."`
`"Why are these things so darn heavy all the time?`
` A French instructor taught me something interesting about that once.`
` He said they should always be heavy.`
` ......After all, a human life is heavier than the world.`
` So these should be even heavier."`
`"......It'd be nice if you didn't need to use them."`
`"That would be nice."`
`Amakusa set the golf bag-like luggage down beside him.`
`A two-propeller aircraft touched down on the runway.`
`Considering the weather, it couldn't have been a pleasant flight.`
`Everything after this flight had been suspended due to weather.`
`Cutting through the drizzle as she traversed the runway, Sumadera Kasumi entered the lobby with two black-suits as guards.`
`The four black-suits who had been waiting inside the lobby stood up and respectfully lowered their heads in salute.`
`"""Kasumi-sama...!!"""`
`"Propeller planes certainly do shake...`
` I wouldn't want to ride one again."`
`"We have a car prepared!`
` Please, this way."`
`They got into two luxury cars that had been rented...`
`"...Ange should be heading for Rokkenjima.`
` A deserted island... How convenient.`
` ......You've arranged for some tools, I take it?"`
`"Yes Ma'am...!"`
`The black-suit in the passenger seat put a heavy bag that had been set by his feet onto his lap,`
` opened the catch with a *click*, and showed Kasumi what was inside.`
`Inside were several silver lumps of carefully wrapped aluminum foil.`
`...He peeled one open to show her.`
`A black, blunt automatic pistol peeked its face out...`
`It was already approaching 10:00 at night.`
`By now, the typhoon had wrapped itself around Rokkenjima.`
`Even the rose garden that had looked so beautiful midday...`
`was beaten down upon by the fierce winds and resisted with all its might, undulating and trying to keep the flowers from blowing away...`
`In that rose garden...was Shannon in the lead, Battler holding up an umbrella, Jessica, and George carrying the sleeping Maria on his back, all heading for the guesthouse.`
`"We can at least make it to the guesthouse from here.`
` Shannon-chan, it's fine, you should go back and rest."`
`"Don't worry, seeing you off is also part of my duty..."`
`"The family conference is going on inside, and Mom and Genji-san are probably getting stressed.`
` If we keep you, they'll misunderstand and think you were being lazy."`
`"That's right.`
` Just graciously accepting our offer might be the best way to avoid burdening people.`
` ...Thank you, Shannon."`
`"Not at all.`
` ...Certainly, as Milady has said, it is very tense inside the mansion today.`
` Therefore, coming with all of you allowed me a breath of fresh air, and I've been able to relax a bit."`
`"The family conference, huh?`
` ......They went to all the trouble of chasing us kids out, so they're probably talking about something shady."`
`"Probably.`
` I'm sure there's nothing we can do to help out.`
` Just trying to stay out of their way is probably the best way for us to be useful."`
`"Heh...!`
` I'm sure it's all just 'Money money money!'.`
` ...Even though they act like they're so rich most of the time, when it gets tough, they all start getting pushy.`
` Why don't they just be graceful and split it evenly between everyone?"`
`"Ihihi.`
` That'd be awesome.`
` It'd be nice if I got a share too.`
` If I got some too, I'd split it with Shannon-chan right away."`
`"Th-Thank you very much...`
` Well, I appreciate the sentiment."`
`"Shannon isn't greedy at all.`
` Normally, girls of your age would have tons of things they'd want to buy."`
`"I guess.`
` But none of the things I want can be bought with money."`
`"Ooh!`
` How unselfish!`
` If you lined up all the things I wanted, all the gold in the world wouldn't be enough."`
`"That's if you're talking about things that can be bought with money.`
` I wonder what these 'things that can't be bought with money' that Shannon wants are.`
` Do you have any idea, George nii-san?"`
`"W-Well, I wonder.`
` I'm not Shannon, so how could I know?"`
`"I-I don't know either."`
`George and Shannon looked down, their faces red.`
`Battler had also heard about what was going on with them, so he knew what Jessica was teasing them about.`
`"George-aniki is a person I respect.`
` I think you've met up with a really great person, Shannon-chan."`
`"Yeah.`
` I also feel relieved that we can leave Shannon to George nii-san."`
`"St-Stop teasing.`
` It's a serious issue for us.`
` More importantly, what about you, Jessica-chan?`
` Have you been able to get a little closer to Kanon-kun?"`
`"Whaaaaaaaaat?!`
` So, you and Kanon-kun are like that?!"`
`"Ah, um, well!!`
` Th-That's dirty, George, twisting the conversation around like that's dirty!"`
`As they had an animated discussion with ups and downs,`
` the four kids headed for the guesthouse...`
`The annual family conference was extremely important to the Ushiromiya family,`
` and this year seemed like it was going to be especially important.`
`Apparently, the Family Head, Kinzo, was personally going to be making a very serious announcement,`
` and everyone other than the adults had been strictly ordered to leave.`
`Battler hadn't attended the family conference in six years, so he didn't really notice,`
` but according to Jessica, there seemed to be a very tense atmosphere tonight,`
` completely different from a normal year.`
`...Common sense made it clear that Kinzo, whose remaining life was short,`
` was going to make some big announcement about the succession of the Headship and the distribution of his fortune...`
`"But I'm suprised.`
` ......To think that Grandfather's actually gonna make an appearance..."`
`"...I see.`
` So, this is the witch's counterattack."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I wanted to leave the Joker called Kinzo face-down a little longer, but it's probably about time to turn it over.`
` Trump cards exist to be used.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Damn.`
` My theory that Grandfather was dead since the beginning, and a different 18th person had snuck in,`
` ...is now suddenly torn apart."`
`"I had foreseen that you'd begin to doubt Kinzo eventually...!`
` Yes, now your reasoning has all gone back to square one again, right?"`
`"With this, your theory that Kinzo was dead at the very beginning and I was hiding as the 18th person goes poof!`
`"......Fuck...`
` But no way I'll lose heart.`
` That's only one theory gone.`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` I'd have it no other way!`
` Even the first twilight has not yet begun.`
` It is far too early to give up.`
`"That's right.`
` And, it's not like it was denied with the red truth.`
` ......At this point in time, Battler's theory hasn't been defeated.`
` It's too early to say that you've won."`
`"Nn, yeah, that's right.`
` ...It's still too early for me to just swallow her story.`
` ...Grandfather is supposed to finally appear, `
`but there's a chance that they'll talk about how his health has gotten worse, and he won't appear after all."`
`"...Uncle Krauss might be trying desperately `
`to hide the fact that Grandfather really is dead until the last second."`
`"Ha...!`
` I see, I see, you could also think of it that way.`
` Do as you please.`
` It will be resolved soon.`
` Very soon...`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`All of the relatives and Nanjo could be seen in the dining hall.`
`Nanjo sat alone, quietly watching the wind and rain outside.`
`Krauss sat down in the seat of his own rank, with Natsuhi standing motionlessly at his side.`
`The other siblings were gathered at the opposite end of the long table, whispering to each other...`
`"...Is that true?"`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, ros_4e247:`
`was Father."`
`"What in the world...?`
` In other words, our strategy has collapsed from the roots...!"`
`"Not just our strategy.`
` Since Father is healthy and has said that he'll make an announcement himself, our trivial bargaining with Nii-san was completely pointless."`
`"Yep.`
` ...That old bastard.`
` Why couldn't he have just shown himself right away without making a show of it?`
` Thanks to that, we've just been quarreling with Aniki uselessly."`
`"......Or maybe he wanted to test us on that point.`
` I might not be one to talk, since we aren't related by blood, but your Father is very intelligent, correct?"`
`"Our arguments during the day were probably overheard by one of the servants and reported to Father.`
` ......Incredible.`
` The fact that we were making a fuss with Father's inheritance as our goal is now right in the open...`
` ......Ah, just incredible..."`
`Eva uncharacteristically held her head, dejected.`
`If, as Kyrie had said, everything had been going according to Kinzo's plans from the beginning,`
` and if this was a huge setup that had been kept up for over a year, trying to find the siblings' true intentions,`
` then they had fallen for it completely...`
`"...We still don't know for sure that it's reached Father's ears."`
`"No, it definitely has!`
` ...Everyone but Nii-san claimed that Father was dead, and none of us believed in Father's good health...!`
` Aaah, it's already over...`
` ...Father will make an announcement.`
` Nii-san will become the Successor, and he'll say we aren't even qualified to wear the One Wing...`
`'!s0`
`"Nee-san, ...get ahold of yourself..."`
`"...Rosa-san,`
` I wonder if Maria really received that umbrella from Father."`
`"Huh?`
` What do you mean...?"`
`"...Maria-chan might have seen Father.`
` However, we haven't seen him.`
` Maria-chan only claims to have seen him."`
`"What are you saying...?`
` ...Are you saying Maria's lying?!"`
`"Calm down, Rosa.`
` ...Maria-chan didn't necessarily lie.`
` Still, she's an innocent kid, right?"`
`"...For example, if Genji-san came up to her and said something like 'I was told by your Grandfather to hand this to you, Maria-sama',`
` then even if Maria-chan hadn't met Dad, she still might say that she got an umbrella from him, right?"`
`"...Th-That's right.`
` That trick could work...!"`
`"But what was it Maria-chan said?`
` 'Grandfather came and handed me the umbrella'."`
`"Yes, that's what she said.`
` She clearly said that she received an umbrella directly from Grandfather."`
`"...Directly, huh?`
` Then we're stuck."`
`"...............`
`They often say that bad thinking is no better than sleeping.`
` If you think about it a bit, all of this about the umbrella is a trivial problem."`
`"Why's that?`
` Couldn't Maria-chan have been bribed by Nii-san to lie and say something that made it seem like Father was in good health?!`
` There is no evidence that Father actually handed the umbrella to her...!"`
`"Regardless of whom Maria-chan received the umbrella from,`
` assuming she was even given an umbrella in the first place,`
` Father will appear very soon.`
` Once Father's in front of us, the problem with the umbrella will become completely trivial."`
`"......In other words, this is not the time to gossip about the umbrella issue."`
`"What do you mean, this isn't the time?"`
`"......I see, ...I got it.`
` ...This is probably what Kyrie-san's sayin'.`
` ......Father is supposed to come here very soon,`
` but the chance still remains that he'll get mad again and won't show up, right...?"`
`"...I-I see.`
` That's true...`
` Maybe Nii-san just said Father was going to appear at random in a desperate bid to buy time against our investigation.`
` Father really is dead already, `
`and Nii-san is still lying and saying he's healthy...!"`
`"In short, if Father appears, then no schemes will be effective.`
` There's no need to even think about that case.`
` We're fish on the chopping board.`
` We'd have no choice but to leave fate to the heavens and negotiate directly with Father.`
` That means we'd have no choice but to let him clobber us with his fist, then prostrate ourselves and beg for money."`
`"...But on the other hand, if Father doesn't appear, then our primary strategy isn't hampered in the least."`
`"......I see.`
` In short, no matter which way it goes, there's absolutely no need to get flustered now."`
`"That's it.`
` If Father shows up, we just have to carry out the normal family conference.`
` ......If he doesn't, we just have to keep on investigating Krauss-san."`
`"We can't let him talk his way out of it,`
` ...like if he says Father's mood has suddenly gotten worse."`
`"...It seems what we really should be trying to figure out...`
`is what scheme Nii-san is going to try and trick us with.`
` The way he just doesn't know how to give up is something I know better than anyone."`
`"If Father is well, ...we'll prostrate ourselves and beg for money.`
` ...If it's a farce of Krauss-san's, then we'll continue our ugly sibling fight.`
` ......It sounds like this year's family conference is going to be just wonderful."`
`"Yep.`
` So, bad thinking is no better than sleeping, huh?`
` It's almost 22:00.`
` ...Should we press Aniki?"`
`Rudolf and the rest looked at Krauss.`
`He was sitting down firmly...and looked like he was awaiting Kinzo's arrival with an air of composure.`
`...They couldn't tell if he really was composed, ...or if he was scheming about how to tie together his lie.`
`"......Dear..."`
`"...Calm yourself.`
` We won't get anywhere by making a fuss after all this.`
` ......Let's leave it to Genji-san."`
`"It's almost...10:00, isn't it?"`
`That was the time that had been set for tonight's family conference to open.`
`And, it was the time that the Ushiromiya Family Head needed to appear...`
`Right then, they heard the sound of footsteps approaching from the hall.`
`There were multiple sets.`
`Natsuhi raised her head, relieved...`
`But because of the sound of a knock, her expression was filled with disappointment.`
`Because Kinzo probably wouldn't have knocked.`
`"...Please excuse us.`
` I have finished closing up the mansion for the night."`
`It was Gohda and Kumasawa.`
`Unlike the powerful Gohda, `
`it was rare for Kumasawa, with her old body, to be forced to work this late.`
`Of course, Krauss also seemed to know that.`
`"Indeed.`
` Good work.`
` ......My apologies for making you work at such a time, Kumasawa-san."`
`"Oh, it's nothing.`
` I may not look it, but staying up late is still one of my specialties.`
` Hohohohoh...!"`
`"...Wouldn't it be okay to at least let Kumasawa leave without being an observer?`
` It really will be difficult on her body, I imagine."`
`"......The order was to gather all of the servants as well.`
` I cannot disobey."`
`Tonight's family conference was clearly different from normal.`
`On a normal year, no one was allowed to attend except family members.`
`To have the servants present for such a thing...was unthinkable.`
`But this year was different.`
`All of the servants were told to attend.`
`Of course, they were not allowed to talk.`
`......They were there as observers.`
`Just what in the world was happening that needed to be observed by five servants?`
`...Even Krauss didn't know.`
`"Hohohoh.`
` I don't look it, but I'm good at staying up late.`
` If you stuff yourself with mackerel too, Krauss-sama, you'll be more manly at night."`
`"Hahahaha.`
` I see you're still in high spirits.`
` I'm sure you'll be working in such high spirits until you're a hundred."`
`"Madam,`
` forgive my arrogance, but I have prepared a light snack.`
` I can serve it at any time, so feel free to order it."`
`"Thank you.`
` You really are considerate.`
` ...Please offer refills of coffee to the others."`
`"Certainly."`
`After nodding, Gohda took the pot towards the relatives gathered at the other end of the table.`
`As he did, more footsteps approached from the hallway.`
`...It was a single set.`
`And it was light.`
`Even before the knock, they could imagine who it was.`
`"Excuse me...`
` I've taken the children to the guesthouse."`
`"Good work.`
` Tonight is a special evening.`
` Make sure you stay alert."`
`"Y-Yes.`
` Certainly, Madam..."`
`Genji had gone with Kanon to meet Kinzo.`
`...There was still no sign of their return.`
`The hand of the clock passed 22:00 slightly.`
`Once sure of that, Eva spoke to Krauss.`
`"...Nii-saaan?`
` It's time.`
` Are you still not going to start the family conference?"`
`"......The arrival of the guest of honor has been delayed.`
` Wait a short while."`
`"How long?`
` Sorry, but time's up.`
` I won't have you saying 'Father hasn't quite shown up yet' over and over until dawn."`
`"How could I make a promise about the time Father shows up?`
` Why are you in such a rush?`
` Why not drink some tea and calm down for now...?"`
`"Aniki, we're gathered here for a family conference.`
` Not a farce.`
` We'll wait 30 more minutes.`
` But if that doesn't work, you'll let us break into the study, okay?"`
`"B-Break into...`
` Such an action would be quite lacking in respect for the Head!"`
`"Oh, right, our apologies.`
` We'll be good for 30 more minutes.`
` Hehheheheh..."`
`".........Hmph."`
`".........`
`I look forward to seeing if you can keep that same smile up 30 minutes from now."`
`"...So, you honestly believe that Father is dead?"`
`"I have no desire to discuss that now.`
` We can wait until Father comes here.`
` There's absolutely no need for me to argue you down, Nii-san."`
`"The Ushiromiya Headship will be passed on to the proper person in the proper manner.`
` ...No matter what you may scheme, you cannot resist.`
` Of course, the same goes for me."`
`"What are you trying to say?`
` ...And after bragging all these years about being the Successor yourself...!"`
`"I'll turn your own words back on you.`
` I have no desire to discuss that now.`
` All that matters is for Father to come here and proclaim it with his own mouth.`
` There's absolutely no need for me to argue you down.`
` ...Right?`
` Heheheh!"`
`Krauss casually turned Eva's words back on her.`
`Of course, that added oil to Eva's anger.`
`But it didn't ignite.`
`Because, in that instant, the sound of a very loud knock rang out.`
`Both Genji and Kanon were usually very reserved when they knocked.`
`They wouldn't hit the door with such a violent strength.`
`...It was like a judge's gavel slamming down in a call for silence.`
`So, everyone went quiet...`
`The door opened slightly, ...and Genji showed himself.`
`Then, he spoke with a serious tone different from his usual one.`
`It wasn't the tone he used when carrying out his duties.`
`...It was the tone he used when speaking for Kinzo himself.`
`So just by hearing Genji speak like that, the siblings were struck with a sudden tension.`
`"Take your seats, everyone."`
`At those words, the dining hall was wrapped in total silence, and everyone hurriedly returned to their designated seats.`
`It was as though students who had been bustling around just before homeroom had suddenly returned to their seats when the teacher came,`
` and it might even have looked humorous.`
`...But there was no way anyone would joke about it.`
`Everyone sat in order, and Shannon, Gohda, and Kumasawa stood up straight in a row by the wall.`
`"...The Head of the glorious Ushiromiya family and lord of Rokkenjima, the island that sparkles gold,`
` ...Lord Ushiromiya Kinzo has arrived."`
`Of the double doors that led to the dining hall, Genji opened the right door from the inside, and Kanon opened the left door from the outside.`
`...And, welcomed by a respectful bow from those two, majestically fluttering his cape, ......Kinzo appeared...`
`Kinzo's gait had a dignified weight to it, and it was hard to believe that he had reportedly been at the end of his life.`
`Genji pulled back Kinzo's seat and motioned for him to sit.`
`But Kinzo stayed standing, signaling with his chin for Genji to move back.`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* Fuhhahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` Welcome to Rokkenjima, ladies and gentlemen.`
` Why the frightened face, Evaa?"`
`"N-No, why would I be frightened...!`
` I'm just relieved to find you in excellent spirits, Father..."`
`"Wahhahhahhahhahhahha...!!`
` Evaa, you're as amusing as ever, aren't yoou?`
` Why don't you just honestly say how frustrated you are at losing your bet with Krauss?`
` ...*cackle*cackle* You can't say it, can you?`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`Eva realized that their conversation during the day had indeed been leaked to Kinzo, and she hung her head, turning red.`
`"Well then, my sons and daughters and their companions!`
` Tonight, I shall make an important announcement regarding my inheritance and the succession that you all seem so keen on."`
`"But first!`
` I must tell you how incredibly disappointed I am.`
` After all, until this very day, no one has been able to solve the riddle of the epitaph."`
`Even though Kinzo said he was disappointed,`
` a condescending smile rose to his face, as though there was no way the likes of these could've solved it, and his gaze passed through all of them.`
`"...I had planned to hand over everything to the one who could solve it.`
` But none have been able to solve it before today, and here we stand, with nothing of mine passed down to anyone."`
`"How shameful...!!`
` To think that not one among you has come forward with the qualifications to succeed me!`
` How truly disappointing, and shameful, and patheetic!!`
` Wahhahhahhahhahhahha!!"`
`The siblings hung their heads in silence.`
`Of course, they would have solved it if they could.`
`True, they couldn't deny that they'd wasted a golden opportunity, but it was just so hard...`
`"Therefore,`
` I am proclaiming here and now that I will suspend the use of the epitaph's riddle as a method of choosing my successor.`
` In short, time's up!`
` This is game over.`
` ...And what a shame for you all.`
` Even though it should have given you all an equal and fair chance, that's gone now!`
` ......Gehhahahahah!!"`
`It truly sounded like Kinzo was making a victory proclamation.`
`"In that case, will my oldest son Krauss succeed the Headship...?`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` The answer is <no>!!"`
`"Wha...?!"`
`"......"`
`"...You understand, right, Krauuss?`
` I certainly gave you the title of Successor.`
` But all you did was let it go to your head...`
` Do you know what a Successor is...?"`
`"......It means...the person who will inherit your position after you, Father..."`
`'!s0`
` The position of Successor isn't something that's guaranteed by the current Head at aaaaaaaaaaall!"`
`"......Listen up, Krauuss.`
` I won't tell you this again.`
` A Successor...`
`is what you call someone who finds everyone else who's after the Headship,`
` thoroughly breaks their noses, and makes it so they can never disobey him again."`
`"This is not only something that can be said of the Headship.`
` It's the same with money!`
` A 'rich person' doesn't mean someone who has money.`
` It means someone who crushes everyone who had more money than himself,`
` and who scrabbles together more money than anyone else."`
`"It's the same with talent.`
` A genius is not what you call a person blessed with talent!`
` It means a person who crushes everyone with more talent than themselves!`
` A person who can coerce geniuses and all other people to call them that using strength and charisma!!`
` You have a mistaken impression when it comes to all of these things.`
` ...So, you aren't of the right caliber to be my Successor.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"...I-I'll take your words to heart..."`
`Perhaps that truly was Kinzo's philosophy.`
`As a result of faithfully carrying out that rant-like philosophy of his,`
` Kinzo had glorified the Ushiromiya family to the state it was in today...`
`It may be hard to imagine after his immersion in the occult in recent years,`
` but that brutally overbearing outlook was no more or less than Ushiromiya Kinzo's charisma and aura...`
`"Such an unsatisfactory person is not qualified to inherit everything of the Ushiromiya family.`
` In that case, is Eva, Rudolf, or Rosa qualified?"`
`"Again, <no>!!`
` You were unable to solve the riddle, and you were also unable to use a scheme to drag Krauss down!`
` All the three of you managed to do was gather together in a united front to try and extort money from Krauss.`
` And even that scheme was thoughtless!`
` You can't even corner Krauss all by himself!`
` ......There could be nothing more shameful!"`
`"You lack the avarice to steal away the position of Successor by any means!!`
` In order to get what you want, you should sacrifice everything, becoming as covetous and greedy as possible...!!`
` The goddess of luck smiles upon the greedy!!`
` You three, who don't have that wild spirit, are as unfit for the succession as Krauss is!!"`
`Eva and the rest had no words to respond with.`
`And they couldn't calculate what it was Kinzo was about to say...`
`Was Kinzo actually planning to proclaim that no one would succeed the Headship?`
`If so, that would work to Eva, Rosa, and Rudolf's advantage.`
`After all, in the end, they'd just have to renegotiate everything among the siblings after Kinzo's death, splitting the inheritance evenly.`
`It would surely be more troublesome if a specific person's name was raised and proclaimed to be the Successor.`
`...But would Kinzo really say something to benefit any of the four siblings after demeaning them so much?`
`"...You don't think...he's going to say that because no one will succeed him,`
` he'll donate all of his fortune to charity or something, right...?"`
`"......I'm afraid I wouldn't put it past Father."`
`"The blood's just risen to his head...`
` We can't do anything but let him talk for now."`
`"...W-Well then, Father.`
` What thoughts do you have regarding the Succession of the Headship?"`
`"Hmph......`
` Since I am so utterly disappointed in all of you, I've lost the desire to hand it over to anyone.`
` Therefore, the Ushiromiya family will end here.`
` It ends with my generation."`
`"...Th-That cannot..."`
`"The Ushiromiya family was crushed long ago in that earthquake.`
` The current Ushiromiya family is nothing but an illusion of gold I'm glimpsing for an instant.`
` ...The likes of which will end when I awaken from my slumber.`
` Hehheheh!`
` Everything in this world is a dream, an illusion.`
` ...Life is but a daydream before the awakening called death.`
` Aaah, yes, that's how it was from the beginning!!`
` That I should lose everything when I die was part of Beatrice's contract, and her curse!`
` Fuhahaha!!`
` As if I'd let you, Beatrice!`
` I will be the one who captures you!!`
` Tonight, that goal will be realized.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` Wahhahahahahaha!!"`
`For a while, Kinzo was overcome with cackling, and his eyes bulged.`
`Whenever he talked about Beatrice, it was always both eloquent and insane...`
`"Foolish children such as yourselves truly are daydreams!!`
` It's as though you were never there from the beginning!!`
` Disappear! Wake up!!`
` Disappear from the doze of the truth that I am...!!`
` You failures that have not built up anything that makes you worthy to succeed me!!"`
`"K-Kinzo-san.`
` If I may..."`
`"What is it,`
` my friend?"`
`Nanjo nervously raised his hand, asking to speak.`
` Kinzo allowed him to.`
`"I understand how you feel, Kinzo-san.`
` Because you love your children, you expect a lot of them,`
` and as a parent and grandparent myself, `
`I understand how parental affection can make you feel as though your expectations were betrayed."`
`"...However, you are extraordinary, Kinzo-san.`
` A genius.`
` Isn't saying that it's only natural for them to catch up to you a little too harsh...?`
` Despite that, Krauss-san, Eva-san, Rudolf-san, Rosa-san,`
` and all of their partners have done their very best to catch up with you..."`
`"Hohoooooooooohhh???`
` And just how much money have they built up with this 'Doing their best'?`
` After these cowards fail completely in ventures and gain debt,`
` and still try to sponge off me, how can you say that they did their very best...?!!"`
`"Money is the crystallization of everything in this world.`
` If you cannot grasp that, then you cannot grasp the world!`
` If a life cannot strongly grasp this world, it doesn't deserve to live!!`
` Disappear!!`
` Disappear from my life and reality!!"`
`"...That's a reckless argument.`
` With that logic, even I must not live.`
` ...Even so, I believe the time I spend playing chess with you was worthwhile for both of us, Kinzo-san...`
` ...You should know better than anyone else that there are many things in this world that cannot be bought with money."`
`"......Hmm.`
` ...Hmph."`
`As the siblings motionlessly hung their heads, they cheered Nanjo on inside their hearts.`
`Not one of the siblings could offer their opinion in front of Kinzo in a rage, but Kinzo's close friend Nanjo alone was allowed to...`
`Even though Kinzo had raged so fiercely, after being admonished by Nanjo, he nodded several times as though in agreement.`
`...This surprisingly obedient side of him might have seemed cute, but there was no one here who could laugh.`
`"It may be true that your children haven't built up as great a fortune as you have, Kinzo-san.`
` ...Though, even so, they're rich enough to make me jealous."`
`"But besides money, they have also built up many things that cannot be bought with money.`
` When it comes to that, they are in no way inferior to you, Kinzo-san."`
`"Hoh.`
` And what do you claim they have built up that cannot be bought with money?"`
`"Happiness.`
` Family.`
` ...They have found wonderful partners, had children, and each has built up their own happy homes.`
` They have glorified your family name...and have brought back grandchildren."`
`"Grandchildren are wonderful.`
` We older people can look at these young grandchildren, who will live on into a new era that we will not even be given a chance to see, and in them, we can imagine an endless future.`
` ...Isn't that the sole entertainment we have in our old age?"`
`"Remember, Kinzo-san.`
` Remember your joy when they first brought back their grandchildren...!`
` Your children and your grandchildren...will carry your great works on to future generations, setting an example.`
` That is something that an individual cannot accomplish no matter how much money they have."`
`The siblings all nodded in agreement...`
`Certainly, Kinzo had looked happy when his grandchildren had just been born.`
`...Back when he still had some sanity in his heart.`
`...However, did Kinzo's heart still contain a Human's warmth...?`
`"In other words,`
` in exchange for the vast riches I created,`
` instead of gaining money, I have gained my grandchildren?!"`
`"N-No, no, that's not what I..."`
`"So, in exchange for the several tens of billions in wealth that I have built up, I have gained a single grandchild from each of my children!!"`
`"Hahhahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` This is wonderful!`
` So, I have created a single life using ten billion yen!`
` That's how it is!`
` Interesting, truly an interesting example in the alchemical sense, riight...?!"`
`"Hooh, what valuable grandchildren!`
` Wonderful, ...wonderful!!`
` Wahhahhahhahhahha!!`
` Is that right, Krauss?`
` ...Is your daughter worth ten billion yen...?"`
`"......"`
`Krauss couldn't answer instantly.`
`...It wasn't that he didn't have confidence in his daughter. It was because he didn't have a clue what Kinzo was trying to test him with in this question.`
`But when Natsuhi was then pressed for an answer, she responded, breaking Krauss's silence with an answer of her own interpretation.`
`"...Y-Yes.`
` Jessica is a daughter I wouldn't let go of even for ten billion yen.`
` In that sense, I believe she has a value that can't be measured with money."`
`"Hoh.`
` So, you can state for certain that she's worth ten billion.`
` Hoh hoh!`
` What about you, Eva?`
` What about your George...?"`
`Since Natsuhi had answered that way, Eva naturally came up with her own answer as well.`
`...Even though Eva should have known better than to respond to a provocative question like this, she answered as well.`
`"Yes, Father.`
` George is worth ten billion...no, even more than that.`
` And that's not in the abstract sense of things money can't buy.`
` George will certainly build up a fortune equal to his worth.`
` He'll become a grandson worthy of carrying on your great works, Father...!"`
`Eva sent a glance at Hideyoshi and Natsuhi as if she'd scored a point.`
`...When she heard what Eva had said, Natsuhi was about to add more praise for her daughter, but stopped at a glare from Krauss.`
`"Hmm, I see.`
` ......Then what about you, Rudolf?`
` What about your Battler?"`
`"Compared to George-kun, ...there's nothing about Battler I can brag about.`
` If he was kidnapped and we were threatened with a ransom of ten billion, I'd feel like sticking a bow on the guy and letting them have him."`
`"*giggle*giggle*..."`
`"On top of that, he's an idiot and reckless.`
` He talks about grand dreams and things that couldn't be done.`
` ...I guess in that way, he's a super idiot worth the equivalent of ten billion normal idiots."`
`"But I'm sure that guy could do things that even a group of ten billion average people couldn't do.`
` Well, I'm pretty sure he'll fall flat on his face.`
` The world isn't easy."`
`"...But at the very least, `
`there's no doubt that watching over his life will be more fun than looking at ten billion average people."`
`Eva clicked her tongue at that clever style of speech, which would probably match Kinzo's tastes.`
`Apparently, Rudolf had done that on purpose, so he grinned back at her.`
`"...What of Maria?"`
`"...M-Maria is my adorable and only daughter.`
` Her value cannot be measured with money.`
` ...That is all."`
`"Hmm.`
` ......I see.`
` Dreams and the future, miracles and possibilities are the source of my magical power.`
` No magic without hopes holds any strength."`
`"...Heh, I cannot expect any more from you who have proven to be average,`
` but I see, my grandchildren hold future possibilities, and expecting a magical miracle from them may be worthwhile."`
`"If you're saying that, in this way, they are worth more than ten billion...hmm, yes, I can see where you're coming from.`
` ...Hmmm, hmmmm..."`
`When Kinzo got in a rage, he wouldn't let anyone speak up,`
` but even so, he would sometimes accept something on his own while yelling by himself...and change his own opinion.`
`...That's what this felt like to the siblings.`
`Apparently, even though Kinzo had been disgusted by his unsuccessful children and had cast them away as being unfit for the inheritance of his title or his fortune,`
` he wasn't sure about his grandchildren.`
`...At this rate, he might soon say that the inheritance would go to his grandchildren instead of the siblings.`
`As the siblings sat in fear of what their fickle and short-tempered father might suddenly think of next,`
` they carefully watched his every move...`
`"...Hmm.`
` ...Let me change my thinking a little.`
` I have absolutely no desire to hand over all I have to any of you."`
`"However, it will be quite interesting to question the grandchildren to see if one of them is qualified...`
` I've always thought of them as mere kids,`
` but there's a chance I'll find a shining gem amongst them that will catch me off guard."`
`"And testing them for that would be...`
`...yes, it would be a shame to abandon that final side-trip in my remaining life.`
` ...Hmmmmm, `
`...well then, what shall I do...?"`
`"...I-I can, with confidence, recommend George as someone fitting to follow after you!"`
`Eva claimed that right away.`
`Natsuhi looked like she was about to follow along, but Krauss gave her a look telling her to restrain herself, so she swallowed her words.`
`"Hehheheheheheh!`
` How bold.`
` ...Then, let us do this.`
` I will individually question the grandchildren to see if they are qualified to succeed the Ushiromiya family inheritance and wealth."`
`"...Father..."`

`"......I shall obey Father's decision."`
`"Same here.`
` I'll go along with what he decides.`
` ...What about you, Aneki?"`
`"O-Of course.`
` ...I believe Father will make a wise judgement."`
`"I-I will also obey Father's decision..."`
`"I shall think of how to test my grandchildren.`
` Which means this is no longer any business of yours.`
` After all, none of you are involved with the succession in any way now.`
` ...So right here, right now, perhaps we should discuss a different matter that does involve you."`
`"A different matter...?"`
`"Indeed.`
` That is tonight's true purpose, and the true purpose for this final Ushiromiya family conference as well.`
` ...Heheheheheheh!!`
` I have no desire to hear your thoughts and opinions.`
` I demand only your assistance!`
` Assistance in my ceremony!"`
`"...Your ceremony...?"`
`"Quiet...!`
` Father's talking now...!"`
`Rudolf and the rest had automatically narrowed their brows at the occult-like word.`
`Could he be planning to start some strange ceremony involving Beatrice's resurrection again...?`
`And he wanted their assistance...?`
`What in the world was he planning to do?`
`In the past, he had carried out many eccentricities that he called by the same name, such as starting to burn a strange incense and filling the whole mansion with the stench.`
`To the siblings, a ceremony was nothing more than one of the aged Kinzo's obnoxious hobbies.`
`"Father,`
` just what do you mean by that......?"`
`"If we can assist you, we'll do anything.`
` Right, Rosa?"`
`"Y-Yes...`
` But...what in the world...is it...?"`
`"A ceremony as inscribed in my epitaph.`
` ...A ceremony to revive Beatrice and open the door to the Golden Land.`
` That witch, who escaped her cage of flesh and sneeringly slipped through my fingers, I shall now capture...`
`and force into submission with my greatest hidden art.`
` ......For that purpose, I must offer 13 people as sacrifices."`
`"...Hehheheheheh!`
` Gathering 13 people's worth of sacrifices is no easy feat.`
` But tonight is the family conference!`
` Many adults have gathered on Rokkenjima.`
` There could be no other day on which to carry out this ceremony."`
`Taken literally, it sounded like he was telling them to become human sacrifices for his dark ceremony and die.`
`Ridiculous.`
`Was it some kind of metaphor...?`
`But they didn't even have a clue what he was trying to illustrate.`
`The siblings whispered together about what Kinzo was saying...`
`"...What's Dad going on about?`
` Is this his usual sickness...?"`
`"Probably.`
` Listen silently for now."`
`"........."`
`"I'm sorry, Father...`
` I don't understand what you mean by that."`
`"What is it you don't understand?`
` I am making this extremely simple.`
` I told you that I'll choose 13 of the humans on this island and offer them as sacrifices in a ceremony to revive Beatrice.`
` Even worthless people like you can be very useful as sacrifices in my ceremony.`
` Wahhahhahhahha!!"`
`"...Listen!!`
` This is not a joke nor anything of the sort.`
` This is my final bet, my final ceremony, the last one I will desire in my life!`
` There are now more than 13 humans on this island.`
` In short, that's a head count that can easily satisfy the massive number of sacrifices I require!`
` Become the sacrifices for my ceremony!!"`
`"...Kinzo-san, ...you weren't...`
`serious about what you said back then, were you...?!`
` It wasn't a joke...?!!"`
`Unusually for him, Nanjo's face changed color as he stood up and shouted.`
`It seemed this wasn't the first time Nanjo had heard all this dark talk about 13 sacrifices.`
`"Sorry, my friend.`
` That was no joke nor anything of the sort.`
` It is what I bet my life on, the final ceremony, the final game that I will attempt."`
`"Yes, this is a game!`
` If gaining my fortune and leaving the island is your goal, then there are only two ways to achieve it!`
` Will you escape being chosen as one of the 13 sacrifices and spectacularly survive, by finally solving the riddle of the epitaph and stopping the ceremony, `
`...or will you kill me?!`
` ...And thereby stop this ceremony.`
` Those are your only two options!!"`
`By now, everyone wasn't just whispering, but chattering and muttering away.`
`Even the siblings had noticed that Kinzo was beginning to act abnormally...`
`"...Father, are you a little tired?`
` Genji-san, has Father been drinking?"`
`"......No.`
` The Master is sensible."`
`"Sorry, Dad.`
` I don't have a clue what you're talking about...`
` Dad's free to start up any weird ceremony he wants to revive the witch he loves.`
` That's his hobby.`
` But getting wrapped up in that...ahaha...and being made into a human sacrifice is a little more than I can handle."`
`"Rudolf, are you trying to interrupt Father?!"`
`"What are you talking about, Aneki?!`
` You expect me to listen to something that shady and say 'Oh, really?'?!"`
`Was the 'ceremony' Kinzo had mentioned literally something disturbing, `
`or was it some kind of test to choose the Successor?`
`It seemed that Rudolf had taken it literally,`
` but Eva apparently still believed that it was something like a test or examination to find a proper Successor.`
`But Kinzo responded with a clear smile.`
`"Well then, that is all I have to say.`
` Nooo objections or opinions are necessary from you...!!`
` I will simply awaken from my dream of having four unsuccessful children.`
` To all of you, what will occur now before your very eyes may seem like a dream, an illusion, something that couldn't conceivably be of this world, and a world that defies understanding."`
`"But that itself is my reality!!`
` Now, I will finally awaken from the shallow, useless dream that all of you are!!"`
`"Come, the game has already begun, see?`
` With this many of you here, I can take lives starting with anyone...!!`
` So long, my unsuccessful children.`
` And for the final and only time in your lives, be useful...for my ceremony...!!`
` Arise, Pendragon's Memorial Troops...!!"`
`When Kinzo raised his arms high like an opera singer and yelled as though towards a packed audience, `
`the air shattered like glass, ......and the outlines of three people who supposedly hadn't been invited to this island appeared...`
`"Chiester 45, right here...!"`
`"Chiester 410, riiiight here!"`
`"Chiester 00, right here, sir."`
`Three girls with strange forms suddenly appeared behind Kinzo.`
`Where from?`
` When?`
` Who?`
` Who were they??`
`...The Humans were thrown off balance, and their minds went blank.`
`Because they spent all that time thinking, they lost their last chance to survive.`
`"You have permission to shoot six to death.`
` I leave the choice of targets up to you.`
` Begin your attack."`
`"Unrestricted Firing, understood, sir.`
` Thank you for granting us such excellent targets.`
` Everyone, Commence Unrestricted Firing."`
`"Nihi!`
` First one in, nyeh!!`
` Hyahhah!!"`
`When 410 scratched the air with her finger, a golden bow appeared in empty space, and she pulled its string.`
`The golden arrow that had been readied there was fired off without any hesitation, flew around the room leaving haphazard gold curves everywhere, `
`......and chose Natsuhi from among those sitting at the table of the family conference, pulverizing the left half of her face.`
`Flesh and deep-red blood scattered around,`
` leaving massive red spatter marks on the relatives' faces and the pure white tablecloth.`
`...Silence fell.`
`Despite the massive number of deep-red spots left on the tablecloth, `
`......no one could understand why Natsuhi's head was half smashed, nor why she was hanging her head as though dozing while still sitting,`
` ......and they watched on in silence.`
`...Those sitting on Natsuhi's right-hand side were silent for a relatively long time,`
` but those sitting to her left were not.`
`...Because the people sitting on that side had been shown how her head had been smashed open like a watermelon or a pomegranate...`
`and could even see inside her...`
`"Na...tsuhi......"`
`"...One down.`
` Natsuhi, is it? A luckless woman to the end.`
` ...Next!"`
`"00, Firing."`
`After scratching the empty air in the same way and readying her bow, 00 fired as well.`
`After it flew around and around at high speeds like the golden arrow 410 had released, drawing a convoluted curve in the same manner,`
` ...it smashed half of Rudolf's head in the same way as he looked at Natsuhi in shock, killing him instantly.`
`This time, everyone managed to avoid freezing up mentally.`
` They realized that a fearsome murder had started playing out right in front of them, just as Kinzo had said.`
`And they realized that Kinzo would probably kill even more...!`
`'!s0`
`""Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!""`
`Shrill screams burst out.`
`Even so, they didn't know what to do.`
`So they could only keep screaming and flapping their wide-open mouths like goldfish...`
`"...F-Father, `
`...what do you think you're doing...?"`
`"...Y-You fool!!`
` Run now!!"`
`As Eva asked Kinzo that in total shock,`
` Hideyoshi, who had come to his senses faster than anyone else and risen to his feet, pulled at her arm from behind.`
`However, merciless fate's choice for the third sacrifice...`
`...was Hideyoshi.`
`Just like the two before him, half of Hideyoshi's head was neatly smashed,`
` ...and the right side of his head, which had happened to be facing that direction at the time, ...had been blown away with its contents exposed like a watermelon or a pomegranate.`
`So, still holding Eva, ...Hideyoshi slumped backwards and fell down.`
`Still held by her beloved husband, Eva fell over backwards with him.`
`"Dear...?`
` Dear...?!`
` Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkkk!!!"`
`Eva screamed.`
`...It was only natural.`
`The face she had been looking for...had been half lost,`
` and the crushed skull, the mashed brains, and the crushed jaw all lay bare...`
`"45, Impact, it's a hit...!"`
`"Spectacular.`
` Fire again.`
` Three more remain."`
`"F-Father...!!`
` Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What...what...is this supposed to be?!?!"`
`When Krauss stood up forcefully and was about to rush Kinzo, 00 blocked him.`
`...With her slender-looking body, she held back Krauss with just the palm of her right hand.`
`He still tried to resist and attack Kinzo,`
` so 00 lifted Krauss by the nape of the neck and twisted into his Adam's apple with her thumb.`
`It seemed to be very painful, and Krauss was overcome with agony.`
`"Gghh, oooooooohhhh...!!!`
` Everyone, ...run...!!`
` Get the police...!`
` An ambulance...!!`
` Quickly...!!"`
`"Everyone, let's escape!!`
` Escape!!"`
`Nanjo's sharp words finally dissolved the spell that had been holding them down in their chairs.`
`When Gohda and Kumasawa each tried to escape from the dining hall first, `
`410 moved in an instant and appeared there, blocking the way.`
`"Nihi! You sure are slow nyeeh.`
` Did you think I'd let you escape nyeeh♪"`
`"Hiieeeeeeeeeehhhh!!"`
`"H-Help meeeeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Gohda-san, duck!!"`
`Even though Gohda didn't understand, he crouched when he heard Kyrie's sharp voice.`
`...Then, a burst of air rushed above his head.`
`Kyrie had taken a big swing with a chair to mow 410 down.`
`But 410, still with a mocking expression, easily caught that widely swung chair with a single hand.`
`"...Tch!"`
`"What a scary woman nyeh.`
` You really wanna go the same way as your husband that muuch?"`
`From the cuff of her arm where she had caught the chair, something like a shining golden snake appeared,`
` ...wrapped itself around the chair, and burst open.`
`It was a fearsome power, like a vice.`
`When Kyrie realized that the being in front of her, which looked like a girl,`
` was actually something that surpassed Human knowledge and that a Human could not even begin to oppose,`
` her head was filled with a fierce alarm bell that welled up from deep inside her...`
`Genji, Shannon, and Kanon, all of the servants permitted to wear the One-Winged Eagle, continued to stand calmly at attention by the wall, even with a scene like this before their eyes,`
` making them look very bizarre and eerie.`
`For an instant, Kyrie thought that they'd managed to stay calm because they were with the enemy...`
`and had been given a guarantee that they wouldn't be killed.`
`...But as soon as she thought that, the side of Genji's face was blown away before her eyes.`
`"G-Genji-san..."`
`"45, Impact, it's a hit...!"`
`"...Hohoh, Genji, how unfortunate.`
` ...Rest in peace, my friend.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle* Your death will not be wasted.`
` You will become one of the 13 keys essential to the resurrection of my beloved witch.`
` Fuhhahahahahahahaha..."`
`The half of Genji's expression that remained...`
`was as indifferent as ever.`
`He tilted, ...fell over, and sent a blood-red splatter out across the floor...`
`"......Genji-sama........."`
`"......We're nothing more...than the witch's pieces.`
` ......Nothing more, ......nothing more..."`
`From the meek and frustrated...`
`no, ...resigned expressions on Shannon and Kanon's faces, one couldn't sense any naive hopes that they'd be rescued.`
`That's right.`
` Kinzo was, in the truest sense, ......carrying out these murders at random.`
`In the truest sense, ...he was killing like it was a game to see who would be saved and who would be killed.`
`"Weeell then, whoo'll we go for next nyeh?`
` Nihhihi!!"`
`410 looked at Kyrie for a second.`
`In that second, ...Kyrie was prepared for her own death.`
`But when she readied her golden bow in midair, 410 was looking at someone else over Kyrie's shoulder.`
`...So, as imprudent as it was, Kyrie felt as though she had been saved...`
`Again, an ugly, exploding, popping sound rang throughout the room.`
`...Who was it this time?`
`When Kyrie turned to face the direction of the sound, `
`......she saw blood gushing like a fountain, and Eva lying on her husband's chest.`
`...Of course, her face had been half smashed just like her husband's...`
`410 had mercilessly targeted Eva as she'd clung to her husband's corpse, sobbing.`
`"L-Let go of Nii-san...!!`
` Let go of Nii-san...!!`
` Just stop it, Father!!`
` Just stop this brutality!!"`
`"...Run away, Rosa...`
` Ggh, ack......!"`
`Rosa's objection didn't reach Kinzo as he continued to laugh loudly in the blood-spattered dining hall,`
` and she wasn't able to lessen Krauss's pain at being lifted up by the nape of the neck by 00.`
`So, Rosa had no choice but to use force.`
` She lifted up a chair beside her and gave a warning.`
`"Father...!!`
` Order her to let go of Nii-san!`
` Just stop them from doing this!!"`
`"I cannot.`
` If that is what you desire, then prevent it using your own power.`
` ...Cut a path through to your own fate with your own hands.`
` You who have always hid behind the backs of others in fear, let me see you overcome your weakness one last time in your life...!!`
` Fuhhahahahahahahahaha!!!"`
`"...F-Father...`
` ......Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"`
`'!s0`
`...swung down at the father who had reigned as a symbol of terror for her entire life.`
`It was the greatest...and final...act of bravery and self-control in Rosa's life.`
`What Kinzo had said might have been true.`
`...If she had grasped that courage much sooner,`
` her life might have become more free, unrestrained by anyone else.`
`Then, there was a bursting sound.`
`The sound of Rosa's chair fiercely hitting Kinzo...`
`could not have been this.`
`With the chair still lifted up, `
`......she neatly lost half of her head...and slumped over.`
`Still holding Krauss up with one hand, ...00 had stuck her other hand out towards Rosa.`
`'!s0`
`had constricted Rosa in a helix...`
`and had smashed into her head.`
`"...Defensive Firing.`
` I apologize for the discourtesy of shooting so close to you, sir."`
`"I care not.`
` Hmm, so this makes six people."`
`"Yes, Lord Goldsmith.`
` This makes six people."`
`When she indifferently communicated that, 00 let go of Krauss, whom she had been lifting up this whole time.`
`"Indeed.`
` So, the sacrifices of the first twilight were Eva, Rudolf, Rosa, Natsuhi, Hideyoshi, and Genji.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`It was a massacre that happened in an instant.`
`The interior of the dining hall had been dirtied by blood spatter,`
` ...and the six unlucky victims lay with their heads brutally exposed.`
`In a way that was fitting for that abnormal space, Kinzo's abnormal laugh alone echoed out...`
`"Hahhahahahahaha, wahhahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` The curtain has finally risen!`
` The ceremony to revive Beatrice has begun...!!"`
`"You lucky ones who have managed to escape the first twilight, allow me to introduce you to my friends.`
` Arise, my friend!`
` Ronove...!!"`
`When Kinzo called Ronove's name, the demon butler showed himself in midair, bowing respectfully...`
`"Pleased to meet you, everyone.`
` And good day to those of you I haven't seen for a long time.`
` Pu ku ku ku...!`
` It seems this place is once again spectacularly untidy."`
`"Pay it no mind.`
` It takes a stimulant of this level to wake me from my daydream-like days."`
`"Allow me to introduce my friend, a reliable butler and one of the 72 Great Demons, Ronove."`
`"I am pleased to make your acquaintance."`
`Just who was he making that introduction to?`
`...Krauss and Kyrie, who were still down on their backsides, and Nanjo, Gohda and Kumasawa...`
`could only look up at this middle-aged gentlemen they didn't know in shock...`
`Only Shannon and Kanon seemed to recognize him, and they bowed deeply...`
`"...So, I wasn't able to greet Genji.`
` I hope he was at least able to fulfill his purpose painlessly."`
`"It was an instant death from a direct hit to the head...!`
` He didn't have time to feel the pain."`
`"Is that so?`
` Very well."`
`"Allow me to introduce another friend.`
` Arise, my friend, Virgilia...!!"`
`Once again, a silhouette of someone the relatives didn't know appeared from empty space.`
`She appeared in a refined dress while making an elegant greeting.`
`"......Thank you for summoning me, Master.`
` Although I would rather not have been summoned into a bloody place such as this."`
`"Allow me to introduce her too.`
` This is both my friend and a reliable counselor, Virgilia.`
` ...I desire to borrow your great power as the Witch of the Finite.`
` Lend it to me!"`
`"...Even if I tried to refuse, such a thing wouldn't be permitted for one subordinated by the power of your summonings.`
` As you wish, Master."`
`"......Still, what a fearsome fellow.`
` To think he summoned three of the Chiester Sisters Corps, then me, and even Virgilia...`
` ...Even though it's only in the area of summoning, to think that he surpasses Milady so thoroughly... How frightening.`
` I can't help but shudder at the Ushiromiya blood."`
`"In order to carry out Beatrice's resurrection ceremony, I shall give it my all as a summoner.`
` This still isn't enough.`
` In order to perfectly succeed in the ceremony this time, I shall summon more."`
`"The Pendragon Memorial Troops and Ronove and Virgilia...`
` ...I can still call more... With my magical power, I can still call many more...!!`
`'!s1`
`...one of the 72 demons, Gaap!!"`
`"Gaap...?`
` You can even materialize her...?"`
`"It probably means that the corrosion has advanced even more on this island.`
` ...It had already proceeded far enough to materialize us.`
` By now, we shouldn't be surprised no matter how great a demon he summons."`
`"Has Rokkenjima already been completely sucked into a parallel world then?`
` ......I hope he does not surrender."`
`"......He learned a lot last time, correct?`
` After all this time, he won't surrender over this much.`
` Probably, I should say.`
` Pu ku ku!`
` ......Well then, shall we enjoy the stage we now stand upon?`
` It seems the main character is the Master this time.`
` Let us expect a script of a different flavor than Milady's."`
`When Kinzo strongly concentrated his magical power, ...a pale light gathered in the empty air, twisted,`
` ...and a magic circle was drawn there with a deep-red glow.`
`And with a sound like glass breaking, ......a new demon could be seen there.`
`"...You did well to answer to my call.`
` ...Gaap, one of the 72 Great Demons...!"`
`"......This is one hell of a place you've summoned me to.`
` Did you call me to clean up this blood-stained room,`
` Goldsmith...?"`
`The literally devilish woman, wrapped in a venomous, ominous costume,`
` looked at the scene which should have made her cover her eyes, and twisted her mouth in a grin...`
`"To summon you for such a reason...`
`would be like using a cashmere muffler to mop the floor."`
`"It's been a long time, Gaap.`
` ...To think that a Great Demon such as yourself has finally appeared on this island.`
` ...Perhaps this island is finally submerging completely into fantasy."`
`"This all-star cast is even more surprising than the gruesome state of the room.`
` ......A full three Chiester Sisters, the Great Demon Ronove, the Great Witch Virgilia, and even me."`
`"What's going on?`
` Is this Pandemonium?`
` Are you trying to start a concert from hell or something?`
` ......I see, as a conductor for that, I couldn't think of anyone better than you, Goldsmith."`
`"I will have your assistance as facilitator in the completion of my ceremony to resurrect Beatrice.`
` You have no objections to my summoning contract, correct...?"`
`"Of course not.`
` There's no way I could resist the subordinating power of the legendary Great Summoner, Lord Goldsmith, who forced the famous Great Witch Beatrice to do his bidding."`
`"...I'll assist you.`
` Although I will of course ask a fitting price.`
` ...So?`
` What's my first job?"`
`"Capture the cowards who made it through the first twilight.`
` Fortunately, there are still seven here, aren't there?`
` Nanjo, Shannon, Kanon, Gohda, Kumasawa, Kyrie, and Krauss...!"`
`"Hoh, if these seven are all offered as sacrifices, that's exactly 13 people!`
` Until it's time for the second and later twilights to be carried out, throw them into the cage of sacrifices, *cackle*!!"`
`"......A cashmere mop, huh?`
` Understood."`
`As Gaap shrugged her shoulders, she looked at Krauss, who was still down on his butt.`
`She glared.`
`Then, when she snapped her fingers, ...Krauss was swallowed up by the floor, as though a round pitfall had opened up beneath him.`
`"Uu, waaaaahhh......"`
`"One down."`
`There was no hole in the floor.`
`But it had certainly looked as though Krauss had been swallowed up by a hole and disappeared...`
`"......!!"`
`Searching for her next prey, Gaap's gaze crossed Kyrie's.`
`She snapped her fingers.`
`Kyrie jumped back as though repelled.`
`Her instincts had been right.`
`After all, in the place where she'd been until a second ago, a round, jet-black hole had appeared, the same kind that had swallowed up Krauss.`
`However, before she could catch her balance, another pitfall appeared and swallowed her up.`
`...Even Kyrie had no way of eluding Gaap's capture.`
`"Waahh...!!"`
`When she snapped her fingers again, a shocked Nanjo was swallowed up by the floor and disappeared.`
`When she did it again, 410 let out a short yell and jumped back.`
`This time, a slightly larger pitfall had opened, swallowing both Shannon and Kanon, who had been standing in a line by the door.`
`But because 410 had jumped away from the door, the way was no longer blocked.`
`Instinctively aware that he would be next, Gohda dashed out through that door.`
`Of course, Kumasawa also escaped with lightning speed, chasing after Gohda.`
`As Gaap snapped her fingers over and over,`
` round, jet-black pitfalls opened one after another behind them, chasing them.`
`However, they did nothing but drive the recklessly fleeing pair away...and couldn't swallow them up.`
`Gohda and Kumasawa had escaped in a matter of seconds...`
`"......I've gotten slow.`
` I let two get away."`
`"Don't worry, we are currently locking onto the escapee targets."`
`"Data Link ready.`
` Nihi!`
` Shall we snipe?"`
`"No, I cannot authorize that.`
` They are precious sacrifices.`
` Wait for the Master's authorization."`
`"Great Lord Goldsmith...!`
` We await your orders...!"`
`"It is still too soon for the coming of the second twilight...is what the source of my magical power is whispering to me.`
` It must not be now.`
` Let them do as they please.`
` It isn't as though they can escape from this island."`
`"The source of the Master's magical power is noise and risk and tests of luck.`
` ...Hohohoh, in other words, it means being fickle, it would seem."`
`"*cackle* Perhaps you could also put it that way.`
` Good work, Gaap.`
` Let us steadily advance the ceremony from here on."`
`"......Well then, that is that.`
` Next are my grandchildren.`
` ......I will test them to see whether they are qualified to become my successor.`
` Let's see, how shall I test their qualifications?`
` *cackle*cackle*...!!"`
`"If you decide that they're qualified, `
`...do you intend to abandon Beato's resurrection?"`
`"Of course.`
` And despite that, I will test them.`
` ...Hmph, perhaps a woman cannot understand that contradiction, nor my madness.`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`"......Well apparently, men are as weird as ever.`
` I don't get the very concept of playing around with risk."`
`"Oh my, and I thought you loved that sort of thing."`
`"Of course.`
` If a man whispers to me about dangerous risks and love, I go head over heels.`
` ...But only if he's hot!"`
`"Pu ku ku ku ku ku...!"`
`"Be quiet.`
` Try to refrain from whispering."`
`"Hmph, truly noisy women.`
` But at least they aren't boring.`
` ...This is what makes summoning so pleasant.`
` All of you will bear one side of the scales of noise and risk in my ceremony.`
` That is the work I expect of you...!"`
`Six brutally murdered corpses lay in the dining hall, and it was contaminated with red, gruesome decorations...`
`It was now unimaginable that, until just a second ago, 13 humans had been arranged here in a well-organized manner.`
`Kinzo lined up the famous demons and their subordinates, loudly declared the beginning of a night of overwhelming mass murders,`
` and swore to himself that he would certainly revive Beatrice and open the door to the Golden Land...`
`"Sorry to keep you waiting!!`
` Now the curtain finally rises on the first twilight!!`
` *cackle*!`
` That Kinzo, I see he loves being flashy as usual.`
` So, even that man who can be more persistent than anything when he follows you around...can shine so when on the stage."`
`"Damn...`
` Always killing in a grotesque way, as usual...`
` Smashing half of their heads?!`
` The bad taste you witches and demons have always pisses me off...!"`
`"Smashing half of their heads... I see.`
` So, she's realized that, in the games up until now, that's been the most ideal method of killing."`
`"Ideal?`
` How is such a grotesque way of killing ideal?!"`
`"...Isn't it though?`
` Try and remember the very first game."`
`"You...!`
` So, you're that new demon or whatever that just appeared...`
` Damn, so does this mean that the witch's corrosion continued, and there are now even more creeps wandering around...?!"`
`...The more the witch's corrosion advances, the more Rokkenjima tilts towards the spirit world.`
`That's why strange, insane people keep appearing one by one.`
`This island has been closed off by the typhoon, so no Human can leave it, much less appear as a new character to increase their numbers.`
`But the more the corrosion advances, the more witches and demons can appear, without limit.`
` Increasing one by one.`
`By now, there might be more demons than Humans among the characters appearing in this insane tale.`
` ...Their numbers might be the thing that represents this mad corrosion.`
`Yeah, I'm sure that's true.`
` And the corrosion hasn't just affected the number of people, but apparently their fashion sense as well.`
`If the corrosion advances any further and even more weird people appear, just what in the world will they be wearing?`
` ......It's so scary I can't imagine...`
`...Aaaah, seriously, give me a break...`
`Don't make these weird guys increase in number anymore...!!`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*! I can't do that, they'll keep increasing more and more!!`
` I'll defile the foolish 'closed circle' rule Humans speak of, over and over again...!`
` Welcome to my elegant game,`
` Gaap!"`
`"......It's been a long time, Riiche.`
` Have you been well?`
` ...Why do I ask, you look great!`
` Have you gotten younger?`
` You look two or three hundred years younger than when I last saw you.`
` ......Ah, I see."`
`The demon Grandfather had summoned and introduced as Gaap...`
`took a glance at me, and then grinned as though she'd figured something out on her own.`
`...That smile felt openly obscene.`
`"I guess she's Beato's friend.`
` ...Which means she's gotta be a creep among creeps.`
` By the way, they were saying something about a closed circle or whatever, but what does that mean?"`
`"Serial murder mystery novels that occur in places isolated from the outside world, like Rokkenjima is now, are sometimes called closed circles.`
` Since such a place is isolated from the outside, it's like a circle that's closed.`
` ...Therefore, in general, the characters and suspects are limited in number."`
`"Having new suspect candidates added on one after another from outside the circle goes against the etiquette of mystery novels.`
` ...In other words, the witch is probably trying to desecrate Humans and the mystery genre itself."`
`"......You're Gretel?`
` I see, you look like a wise kid. ...*giggle*`
` I love kids like you.`
` ...You taste so sweet and tantalizing."`
`"Gross.`
` ...Keep the jokes to your clothing."`
`"It's <Devilish Pretty>'s newest, <Jack the Ripper, Christmas Blood>.`
` Sorry for having a style that a country bumpkin from the Human world couldn't understand, okay?"`
`"...At least we know it's well-ventilated.`
` Why don't you add a gap to the head part as well?`
` Let a little air into your brain."`
`"Gaap is always sensitive to the fashions of the spirit world!`
` But this year's fad truly is bold.`
` I think I'll order one sometime...!"`
`"For you, Riiche, I'd recommend Ali-Gray, <Alice and the Graveyard>.`
` Let's go to 666 sometime soon to look at the clothes.`
` You really should drop by the spirit world every now and then."`
`"When this game is over, I'll be sure to do that.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......Still, your two opponents are pretty cute, Riiche."`
`"It looks like this kid has figured out the meaning of the corpses with their heads half smashed.`
` ......Know what that is, girl...?"`
`"...Just now, she told me to remember the first game.`
` ...What did that mean...?"`
`"Just what it sounds like.`
` ...Remember the first twilight of the very first game.`
` ...When the adults' corpses were found in the gardening shed with the magic circle drawn on it.`
` Remember?"`
`Episode 1.`
` The first twilight.`
`Krauss, Rudolf, Kyrie, Rosa, Shannon, and Gohda...`
` All six of them had their heads pulverized and died......`
`"At that time, there were two types of corpses.`
` Some had their faces pulverized, and some had half of their faces pulverized."`
`"That's right.`
` The ones with their faces smashed were Rudolf, Kyrie, Rosa, and Gohda.`
` The ones with the sides of their heads smashed were Krauss and Shannon.`
` ...At the time, I fickly created two types of corpses,`
` but I realized that the former, more atrocious type was actually disadvantageous for me."`
`"...Disadvantageous for you...?`
` ......I see.`
` So that's what this is."`
`That's right.`
`The smashed faces might look atrocious.`
`...But that made it hard to confirm the identity of each person.`
`For example, at that time, Uncle Krauss and Shannon-chan had their heads half smashed.`
`That alone was atrocious enough, but because half of their faces remained, it was easy to confirm their identities.`
`But Dad and the other three were different.`
`Because his face had been completely destroyed, even I, as his son, could only guess by inference that it had to be Dad because of his clothes and the like.`
`...In short, it remained vague until the end whether that really had been Dad's corpse.`
`"If this reasoning battle had taken place during the first game as well,`
` I would probably have claimed that, since the identities of Dad and the rests' bodies were impossible to confirm, there was a possibility that one was a fake corpse.`
` ...After all, Beato didn't state anything in red during that game."`
`"Well done. Correct.`
` ......A faked death is one of the basics of the mystery genre.`
` Even if you make a doctor examine the corpse, you can't trust the results if you suspect him of being the culprit's accomplice.`
` Therefore, corpses that can't guarantee a death for certain are always disadvantageous for the witch's side."`
`"You can suspect faked deaths for all corpses, hypothesizing that one or more of them is the culprit for the crimes that follow.`
` ...It's a move Battler doesn't like, but it's the most elementary move to use against a witch."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` That's why Beato started using the red.`
` ...With the red truth, she can carry out a perfect autopsy."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` That's how it is.`
` Normally, for the first twilight,`
` I would use the red truth right away, confirming the deaths of these six.`
` However, as you know, my battle strategy this time is the complete opposite of previous games, and I'll now use red truth starvation tactics...!"`
`"Since you use it as a grounding from which to counterattack, I will not use the red easily.`
` I'll make you come apart at the seams by using red in just a single place, as rarely as possible!`
` In the end, it means I will permit all rants regarding your guesswork for all the closed rooms,`
` and I only have to smash one of those once with the red truth."`
`"Ihihi!`
` Even though you've always teased me, once I start counterattacking, you now hole up back inside your shell.`
` Quit kidding around."`
`"At any rate, I do not want to use the red, I want to be stingy!`
` I want to bully Battleeer!!`
` But how could I guarantee a death for certain without using red?`
` I worried and worried over it.`
` ...Then, Gaap gave me an idea!`
` It truly is a simple method.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"...I just pointed out something obvious and you hit upon the idea, Riiche.`
` I simply said that you only had to create corpses whose identity could be distinguished and whose complete death would be understood."`
`"Kuhhihihihi!`
` In short, I put those two things together!`
` The face, which is necessary to distinguish their identity, and the pulverization of the head, the vessel for the soul, which is the perfect symbol of death!`
` When I put those two parts neatly together, aah, wonderful!`
` I came up with the perfect answer of corpses with their heads half-smashed!"`
`"I'll bet you love two-colored bread and two-colored ice cream.`
` You're just like a greedy kid..."`
`"......At any rate,`
` even if half of their heads are smashed, we shouldn't assume that they're dead at this point in time."`
`"I get it.`
` ...Since Beato is trying to act tough and is refusing to say anything in red, we've gotta suspect everything.`
` ...Of course, I'm definitely not gonna swallow the theory of magical mass murder by the Chiester ass nee-chans."`
`"*giggle*`
` You sure have gotten prudent.`
` ...If this were the first game, you would've swallowed everything."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` I wouldn't have anything less from a rival.`
` Since there is fortunately no red now, he can imagine whatever he wants and reason over and over again as he likes.`
` At the very end, at the very sweetest spot, I'll cut him down at once with the red truth...!"`
`"......Ah, ......uu......"`
`Silent.`
` Black.`
`Cold.`
` Painful.`
`Rosa regained consciousness bit by bit...`
`And the first thing she thought...was that it would have been better if she hadn't.`
`After all, with her body this cold and hurting, ...the pain grew the more her consciousness returned.`
`It felt like she'd been sleeping on ice-cold marble in the darkness, lying face-down for a long time.`
`...Aaah, this is why I always tell myself.`
`Even if its just for a nap, I've got to at least grab a sofa.`
`I know that, if I naively try to close my eyes for just a second...`
`and end up sleeping on the floor or in the study chair, it'll hurt my body later and make things difficult...`
`Since I slept on such a cold and hard floor, even my bones are ice-cold.`
`Since I slept on such a hard and cold floor, the half of my face pressed down against it hurts a lot.`
`...If I were to look in a mirror right now, I'm sure I'd see an embarrassing mark.`
`I didn't think that just rubbing it would make that mark disappear,`
` but I stroked the hurting side of my face anyway, trying to smooth it over...`
`...I wonder......where this is.`
`I thought it was pitch black, but it looks like it isn't.`
`After all, I can faintly see my own body.`
`...Without a doubt, there was some source of light, `
`but even if I looked up at the ceiling...or else the sky, there was only an expanse of blackness, and I couldn't see a proper light.`
`My body alone was slightly lit, `
`whereas everything else was sunk in darkness...`
` That's what this world was like.`
`It was almost as though Rosa alone had been abandoned in a forgotten world.`
`As her mind grew clearer,`
` she started getting nervous about why she was all alone in a lonely place like this.`
`'!s0`
`...*patter*...`
`*patter*...`
`of footsteps coming towards her.`
`They were light footsteps, so she thought it was probably a kid.`
` She didn't sense anything disturbing, so she wasn't afraid.`
`But they also weren't Maria's footsteps,`
` so, wondering who in the world would be in a darkness like this, she stared in the direction the footsteps were coming from.`
`......As she did, ...a faint, approaching silhouette came into view.`
`It looked...like a child much younger than Maria.`
`...Who is it?`
`I don't know this kid.`
`But, the expression on his face was like a lost child separated from his parents.`
`...As a parent with a daughter herself, Rosa felt as though her chest had been torn apart...`
`『............Uryu.』`
`"...Ah! ......"`
`The instant the kid muttered that infantile word,`
` ...she felt pain in the half of her face that had started hurting from the cold floor, as though it had been pierced by long, thin, hard needles.`
`Without thinking, she pressed her hand against that side of her face.`
`『...Are you all right...?`
` Does it still hurt...?』`
`"...Thanks, I'm fine, little guy.`
` ......Where are we...?`
` It's really...cold."`
`『...Come this way...`
` You mustn't stay here...』`
`That child took my other hand and pulled with a grim expression on his face.`
`...Rosa didn't have a clue what was going on.`
`However, a single honest expression on a child...`
`can often tell the truth better than a hundred words from an adult.`
`She didn't know the situation, but even so, she dashed along with him, still being pulled...`
`But this was a world where nothing could be seen in the darkness except for their own forms.`
`It didn't even really feel like she was moving forwards.`
`...Even though she was running, she couldn't even feel any wind.`
`It was as though she was still inside a nightmare, ...that kind of unreal sensation...`
`So even though I ran, I couldn't maintain my sense of balance, and my legs got tangled and I fell.`
`...Even in a world that didn't feel real, the pain of smashing my face against the cold, hard floor was reality itself.`
`『Uryu, ...are you okay...?』`
`"Ah, ......nn...`
` ...I'm sorry, my head hurts."`
`...When the kid said that...infantile word 'uryu', pain like being stuck with needles ran though my head again.`
`Even though it had only happened twice, `
`I was somehow able to understand that the child's word was the cause of my pain.`
`...So I said so frankly.`
`"I'm sorry.`
` Could you stop saying 'uryu'...?"`
`『Uryu...』`
`"Nng, ...wait a second, didn't I tell you to stop...?"`
`『U, ...au, ...uu-!`
` Sorry...』`
`I had the feeling that this child's apology caused a sharp pain in my forehead this time.`
`......What is...this child...?`
`'!s0`
`...but when I'm around this child, `
`...my head hurts...`
`『...Are you okay...?`
` Let's go, quickly...`
` You mustn't stay here...』`
`"Why shouldn't I be here...?`
` Hey, where is this...?`
` Who are you?`
` Where is your Mama...?"`
`『......The one who made me...`
`...is you, Mama...』`
`"...Huh...?"`
`That child stared at me with round eyes.`
`...This kid's Mama......is me...?`
`...Who?`
` Who is...this kid?`
`I don't remember at all.`
`『Did you...forget about me...?`
` You made me, right...?』`
`"...Wait a second, stop kidding around.`
` ...Maria is my only child.`
` ......That's right, where is Maria?`
` Where is she?!`
` Maria...?!"`
`I suddenly grew nervous about Maria not being there.`
`Why am I all alone in a place like this?`
`Where is Maria?!`
`I'm only able to be me because Maria's there for me...!`
`『...Maria is here, ...but she's not Maria now.`
` It's better if you don't meet with her now.`
` That's better for your sake, and Maria's as well.`
` ......For Maria's sake as well, escape.』`
`"Huh...?`
` What are you saying?`
` Where is Maria?`
` Maria?!`
` Answer me!!"`
`『Maria's gonna find you...!`
` Come this way, quickly, Mama...!』`
`That child pulled on my hand again.`
`...He was probably pulling me in the opposite direction from Maria.`
`So I stopped walking.`
`"Let go...!`
` Just who are you...?!`
` What gives you the right to call me Mama...?!"`
`『...Mama is the one who made me...`
` Did you forget...?`
` For Maria's birthday present, `
`...you made me with your own hands, ...did you forget...?』`
`".........You...couldn't be...`
` ......Maria's...Sakutarou......?!"`
`『Yes......`
` The lion stuffed animal Mama made...!』`
`'!sd`
`A fierce, sharp pain struck me.`
`It came from the palm he had grasped with his hand.`
`When I knocked his hand away without thinking...and looked at my palm, `
`......a hole the size of a thumb had opened there, and deep-red blood gushed out.`
`...It was a hole so big that I could see through to the other side...`
`『U-Uryu...!`
` Are you okay?!`
` Are you okay?!`
` What's wrong...?!』`
`Sakutarou noticed my wound and panicked.`
`...As far as I could tell by looking at him, he couldn't understand why my hand had sustained a serious injury.`
`But in my eyes, it felt like I'd been injured because he'd grabbed my hand.`
`Regardless of whether there was malice in him, `
`...I understood that this child was something that would do harm to me, and he instantly seemed eerie...`
`"Go away...!!`
` You have nothing to do with me...!`
` Sakutarou was just a disgusting, crappy stuffed animal, right...?!!`
` I don't know you, I'm not your Mama...!!`
` Go away...!`
` Disappear!!"`
`『......U......yu......』`
`Slowly, ...the base of Sakutarou's neck...`
`was sliced in a horizontal line.`
`It gaped open, and pitch-black insides peeked out.`
`...No blood poured from it.`
`Only an empty blackness peeked out.`
`Then, ......from the insides of the gash,`
` ...cotton snow poured out, ...and as bits of cotton scattered, he slumped over.`
`Then, ...all that remained was a crumpled yellow cloth...`
`and bits of cotton that looked like sticky, crushed cotton candy.`
`......A lion...stuffed animal.`
`Without a doubt.`
`These were the remains of the Sakutarou stuffed animal I tore apart on that day, while overcome by my emotions.`
`The instant I realized that,`
` ......a long, sharp shriek that could rupture an eardrum tore the world apart...`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!`
` Sakutaroooooooo, Sakutaroooooooooo, waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuhhhh!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuhhhh!!"`
`Like a flood from a broken dam, or like a broken TV...`
`...Maria cried out in a high-pitched voice.`
`......Her voice, which made the ears throb, brought up two emotions in me...`
`One was regret, 'Yeah, I was overcome by my emotions and went overboard'.`
`It was a mother's desire to kneel down right away, hold Maria's head, cry with her and apologize.`
`...In actual fact, I did that right away.`
`I held Maria's head and apologized, crying.`
`But Maria didn't stop crying.`
`On the contrary, she rejected me, the one who had torn her closest friend apart, and pushed me away forcefully with both hands.`
`I had been on my knees in an unnatural position, so I fell backwards easily.`
`Maria scraped together the yellow scraps of cloth and cotton bits, ...buried her face in them, and cried even more...`
`Watching that, another emotion welled up.`
`It welled up rapidly.`
`...And then, it burst.`
`After all, she refused to make up with me even though I'd apologized, and there was nothing else I could do now anyway, and it was all Maria's fault in the first place...!!`
`Since she's too busy playing with stuffed animals all the time like this, she can't make any friends, and that's why people treat her like a freak...!!`
`This is a perfect opportunity to give her some instructive guidance!`
`After all, it's not like I was pampered all the time...!!`
`Everything eventually breaks, is stolen, is destroyed by someone!`
`Even I had lots of toys and treasures stolen, broken, mocked, `
`and thrown away by my brothers and sister and Father and Mother...!!`
`But when I cried about that, ...while I might have shed a few tears, `
`...not once did I sob like this and trouble my parents,`
` throw a tantrum, get mad,`
` hit the floor and kick and make a racket...!!`
`Even though I always wanted to, I thought I'd get in more trouble if I did, so I always, always held it back.`
`It's because I held it back THAT I WAS ABLE TO BECOME THE WONDERFUL ADULT I AM NOW!!!`
`At that moment, I felt something strange.`
`The same feeling as when you use a tool recklessly, and it finally breaks, so that only the base is left.`
`But I wasn't using a tool.`
`I'd just been repeatedly hitting Maria's head with both hands.`
`So, ...I looked at my hands.`
`...From my wrists onwards, my hands had broken off, splintered, ...and disappeared.`
`As though only that part of my arms had become ceramic.`
`...No, as though all of me from the wrists onwards had suddenly become ceramic, and had broken and fallen.`
`They must have gotten filled with cracks because I hit Maria too much...before falling off.`
`...After all, look, ...aren't both of my wrists lying smashed by my feet...?`
`"Ee......?`
` Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkk...!!!"`
`There was no pain.`
`But the shocking sight of my hands breaking off from the wrists onwards made me scream...`
`"Wh-What is this?!`
` What is this?!`
` My hands, ...my hands, my hands...!!`
` Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkkk!!!"`
`".........`
`......This way, ...you won't be able to hit me anymore."`
`Ignoring my confusion, ...Maria spoke with an icy voice,`
` ...slowly moving her hands away from her head, where they had been defending against my barrage...`
`"...What's happening?!`
` My hands, my hands...!!`
` What did you do, Maria, what is this, what on earth is this...?!"`
`Behind Maria's back, a black silhouette had appeared.`
`...It was the silhouette of an adult.`
`......Who?!`
`"...If she'd used those hands for patting her daughter's head, flipping through picture books, or making warm meals,`
` ...it may have been worth leaving them on."`
`"Mama hit my head more than she patted it.`
` ...She never opens picture books.`
` She doesn't even make me food.`
` ...I go to buy it myself."`
`"...But I mustn't go to the same store more than once,`
` mustn't have my face remembered, mustn't talk to the policeman...`
` ......Why?`
` Why is that?`
` Is it my fault?"`
`"Am I not allowed to have Mama pat my head, have picture books read to me,`
` or eat dinner with Mama...?`
` Why not?`
` Why not?!`
` I didn't do anything wrong!!`
` It isn't my fault, it's Mama's!!`
` Mama's fault!!"`
`"Mama wouldn't play with me, but Sakutaro did!`
` He even read books, watched TV and ate meals with me!!`
` He was a much, much better friend than Mama was!!!"`
`"...I-I'm not proud of it...!`
` B-But what am I supposed to do?!`
` I'm busy with work, work I tell you!!`
` You know that, right?!`
` It was unavoidable!!`
` There's nothing I can do!!"`
`"True enough.`
` It was unavoidable.`
` Unavoidable that you'd injure your daughter, tearing her heart apart and making her tears run with blood...!`
` In that case, there's no avoiding the same thing happening again, right here, right now...!!"`
`"Come, MARIA...!`
` Enough of the excuses from a woman who calls herself a mother.`
` Can you forgive her, or not...?!`
` Is she innocent...or guilty?!?!"`
`"I won't forgive her!!`
` Mama's guilty!!`
` I'll make Mama meet the same fate she gave to Sakutaro...!!`
` Take Mama...from the seam at the neck...`
`and tear her apart, so we can see the cotton inside her!!"`
`...Maria's eyes ominously flashed blue.`
`In that instant, invisible, massive arms stuck their fingernails out and tightly grasped Rosa's entire body.`
`As the bones all over her body made a sound like twigs being stepped on, they cracked readily and broke apart.`
`......Rosa had understood vaguely.`
`The massive arms were probably...her own arms, from the time she'd torn Sakutarou apart.`
`From a stuffed animal's perspective, her arms certainly would have been this massive.`
`So she could imagine what would happen next.`
`...The sharp nails stuck deep into the base of her neck, ...and she heard the skin tearing with her own ears.`
`Then, as the two witches watched over her, Rosa's flesh was split in two, top and bottom.`
`When Sakutarou had been torn apart, bits of cotton had flown about like snowflakes.`
`But in Rosa's case, something like black, thick tar came out, filthily flying all over the place.`
`There wasn't even a trace of the red of blood.`
`...It was something black, filthy and thick.`
`It was probably what a bloodless, tearless human kept inside their body.`
`"This is incredible. Hideous!`
` What filthy insides...!`
` Splendidly done, MARIA.`
` Well then, is this enough for your revenge?`
` Can you forgive your mother, or not?`
` Innocent...or guilty...?!!"`
`"I can't forgive her!!`
` Still can't forgive her, she's guilty...!!!"`
`When Beatrice brandished her pipe cane, `
`gold butterflies seeped up and restored Rosa's broken flesh in an instant...`
`"......Ack, ...gwah!`
` *cough*cough*...!"`
`"Feel the depths of your sin, which cannot be repaid by a single human life.`
` And remember your own great sin...!`
` Come, try and remember...!!`
` Remember the scale of your sin...!!"`
`......Hello.`
` ...Is it Mama?`
` ...When will you get home?`
`"I'm sorry.`
` I'm busy with work today, so I'm staying over."`
`...Staying over for work again......?`
` ...Looks like work is tough for you again today, Mama...`
`"Yeah, sorry.`
` I really am busy.`
` I'll be holed up in the company the whole time.`
` I can't even get a breath of outside air.`
` Mama just can't finish her job quickly this time.`
` Unless I give them a better design, I won't be given another job, ...that's how tough this work is.`
` So it'll just have to take some time."`
`...Yeah.`
` I understand.`
` ......I'll be a good girl and watch over the house,`
` so do your best at work, finish it quickly, and come back, okay...?`
`"Thank you for understanding about Mama's work...`
` I promise I'll buy a delicious cake tomorrow and take it home."`
`I don't need cake.`
` ...Instead of taking time to go to the cake store, I'd be happier if you came home that much sooner.`
`"Don't worry.`
` I'll come back quickly, I promise.`
` So let's have some delicious cake together.`
` Let's drink delicious tea together.`
` Let's read a new picture book together.`
` Let's play with that Wolves and Sheep Puzzle I bought the other day.`
` Both of us together.`
` ...I promise."`
`......Yeah, promise.`
` I'll be waiting.`
` ......Do your best at work, Mama...`
`"Hohoh.`
` It's a lonely story, but isn't this mother-daughter love wonderful, with both looking out for the other?`
` Do you see any problem with it, Maria? Rosa?"`
`"............`
`...I-I...kept that promise, didn't I?`
` The next evening, didn't I do as I promised, buying a cake and returning earlier than usual?"`
`"That's not it. I knew...`
` ......That evening,`
` a pay-on-delivery package came for Mama, but there wasn't enough money in the wallet,`
` so I called Mama's company to ask what to do.`
` ...I was told only to call at special times, `
`...but I thought it'd be bad if the package was something important for Mama's work...`
` So I called."`
`"............"`
`"......Then, I was told that Mama had the day off.`
` ...I was told that it had been decided long ago that Mama would have that day off, ......and that she'd gone far away to play.`
` ......I knew.`
` The whole, whole time, ......I knew Mama was lying...!"`
`But you know what? ...Sakutarou scolded me, saying that it wasn't true.`
`Every day, Mama was very busy with work.`
`There was no way she'd abandon Maria and play.`
`He said that the person who told us Mama had the day off must've made some kind of mistake...!`
`That's what Sakutaro said.`
`So I believed it.`
`...I believed it!`
`I love Mama, love her...!`
`Of course, Mama says that she loves me, loves me!!`
`"......Yes.`
` Me too.`
` I love you, Maria..."`
`Rosa let out a deep sigh.`
`...Maybe she felt the weight of her words.`
`Then, she set the receiver on the bedside phone down.`
`The dark room made the starry sky on the ground below the window stand out even more beautifully.`
`On the table in front of the terrace was a very cold wine cooler,`
` and the one she shared a glass with was gazing at the scene below...`
`"......You didn't tell your daughter you were on vacation?"`
`"I told her once, but she was so noisy that I decided not to tell her anymore.`
` It's less work that way."`
`"...If you were worried about your daughter, you didn't have to force yourself to put this in your schedule, right?"`
`"But that way, we'd never get our schedules to match...`
` Didn't I say not to worry about that?"`
`The slender, middle-aged man clad in a white robe gave a small sigh.`
`Rosa reacted instantly to that slight action...`
`"Come on!`
` Let's not talk about my daughter.`
` It'd be a waste of this precious wine."`
`"......I find you fascinating as both a woman and a human being.`
` But for that very reason, `
`I feel bad about taking so much of your time that it strains your relationship with your daughter."`
`"Don't I always tell you not to worry about my relationship with my daughter...?!`
` I try not to talk about her when I'm alone with you, okay?`
` I wouldn't even have phoned from here if it weren't for the noisy drunk laughing stupidly in the lobby downstairs...!"`
`"Rosa-san,`
` can't you reconsider taking sudden vacations like this in the future, for your daughter's sake...?`
` Isn't it enough if we only meet when our schedules match?"`
`"Our schedules will never match up that way, right...?!`
` And I...always want to be with you...!"`
`"That's a child's way of loving.`
` Loving between adults should be a little more stoic.`
` ...Not being able to be with you for long periods of time makes me lonely too.`
` However, I think we can enjoy more than enough adult loving during that limited time."`
`"So you're telling me to go be with my daughter more.`
` ...Be a mother, not a woman?"`
`"...That's what you want too, right?`
` You must also want to spend lots of time with your daughter.`
` I won't run away.`
` I'm trying to say that I think it's sad for you to sacrifice your daughter so you can prioritize your time with me."`
`"............`
`...Did you get back on good terms with your wife?`
` ......Looks like you've had about enough of being separated from her."`
`"I don't want to talk about my wife.`
` Just like you don't want to talk about your daughter."`
`"...I'm sure you think single women with children are a pain."`
`"I've never said anything of the sort before."`
`"......Whenever someone finds out I have a child, they desert me.`
` ...Even if I tell them not to worry about paying that child's living expenses, they all desert me...`
` ...I...thought you understood about my daughter,`
` ......but I guess you don't like single women with children after all..."`
`"That's not what I'm saying.`
` I haven't started to dislike you, Rosa-san.`
` I'm just trying to tell you to take better care of our daughter, something I know you wish for yourself, `
`and I don't want you to hurt yourself by lying to her.`
` That's all I'm saying."`
`"Liar!!!`
` I've just become a burden for you, right?!"`
`"That's not what I'm saying...!"`
`"No, I know, I understand.`
` After being abandoned so many times because of that child, I know,`
` I can tell by your mood, yes, you're already like those other men!!`
` You don't want a woman with a child, you don't want a divorcee, because that's a pain!!"`
`"You don't want to become the parent of a child made with another man, right?`
` Yes, that's right, I totally get it!!`
` I once went out with a man with children, so I really get how you feel...!!`
` That's why...I believed I'd be able to be together with you, a person who understood about my daughter!!"`
`"Gwah!!`
` *cough*, ...*cough*...`
` ...That's right...`
` You were...always in the way..."`
`"............!"`
`"...If only you didn't exist, ...I would've been able to grasp my happiness as a woman long ago...`
` Because you exist, ...you were always in the way of my happiness..."`
`"......Ma...ma......"`
`"......Even I didn't want you to be born...`
` No, that's not it.`
` ...I thought I might be able to build a happy family together with you...`
` ...But that man disappeared right before your birth.`
` He said he'd build a warm family with me, ...tricked me, ...and disappeared from my sight for all eternity...!!"`
`"Only you were left.`
` No love or memories or anything remained!!`
` Where did that man go?`
` He probably just turned my days with him into a warm memory...and met with a new love.`
` And this time, he might have been able to create a happy family...!!`
` And as for me?!`
` I have you!!`
` I can't even look for a new love!!"`
`"Men can go between women as they like and brag about it!`
` But for a woman, for me...!!`
` I have you!!`
` I had you as a stone weight,`
` and because of you, I can't search for romance, I can't find love, and I can only live alone!!"`
`"No, I wasn't even allowed that, I wasn't even allowed a night to drink myself drunk all alone!!`
` Who are you?!`
` Who?!`
` You wasted my life...and won't even let me have a new life... Just who are you to my life?!`
` Die, disappear, I've hated you since the time you were born!!`
` I've hated you since the time you were in my womb!!!`
` I've been doing my best to act like a good mother so that I'd be accepted by the outside world.`
` Yes, I've done my best!!"`
`"As I watched other women of my generation praise being single, sometimes playing with passion or even being joined with someone in love,`
` I was stuck being both a mother and a woman...!!`
` Who ever showed appreciation for my efforts?!`
` No one admired me, no one praised me!!"`
`"I got what I deserved?`
` Secondhand goods?`
` Divorcees should die?`
` You don't want anyone who's not a virgin?!`
` I'm the one who doesn't want anything to do with you, you damn inexperienced virgin brats!!!`
` I was so desperate, I probably looked like a easy woman to you...yes, I was desperate!!`
` You probably couldn't imagine how desperate a woman like me, who's still at the age where she wants to know love, was...`
`when I realized that my time was being filled with work and caring for my child `
`so that I'd probably grow old and end my life still like this!!"`
`"Of course I hate your real father too!`
` But we both share the blame for bringing about that catastrophe.`
` I myself might have been persistent enough to make him run away!`
` But the catastrophes after that were all your fault!`
` When did I ever scold you for that?!`
` Never, riiiiiiiight?!"`
`"The day after one man left me, when I wanted to drink myself dead drunk, was Parent's Day at your school!!`
` When I tried to hide my tear-stained eyes with heavy makeup,`
` the way I felt when you said something off the mark and the whole class laughed at you...`
`is something that not only you, but probably everyone in the world couldn't understand!!`
` I hate you, loathe you...!!!`
` And until now, I've never really loved you even once!!!`
` Whhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"`
`Maria's face was still stiff...`
`If the words really had been blades,`
` ...Maria's whole body would probably be stained red with fresh blood by now.`
`Even after gaining the power of a witch and resolving herself to take revenge for Sakutaro,`
` ...she couldn't stand these curses coming out of her mother's mouth...`
`'!s1`
` ...Uuuwau...`
` Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!"`
`"Ugly.`
` Aaaaaaaahh, how ugly is a woman drowning in lust...!!`
` Now you see this woman's true nature!!`
` Even I, as a witch who has explored the depths of evil, find this most difficult to watch!!"`
`"Aaah, MARIA, now is the time to part from her!!`
` Smash the ugly lump of meat that calls herself your mother...!!`
` It would be pointless for your pure soul to be bound by the chains between mother and daughter any longer!`
` With your own hand!`
` Release your own soul now!!`
` You have now gained the tooth and claw to protect yourself!!"`
`"Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!`
` Now you'll taste the pain I had to go through...!`
` Now I'll take revenge for those days of suffering...!!!"`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Aren't you the one who's been hurting me?!`
` I'm the one who wants revenge...!!`
` I should have done that before you were born!!`
` If only you hadn't been born!!`
` Disappeeeeeeeeeeeaaaar, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!`
`'!s0`
`As Rosa howled, in a way that can only be described by the word *splat*, her upper body was crushed,`
` and in an instant, became something similar to a wrung, bloodstained towel.`
`"Be crushed.`
` I can't forgive you, ...can't forgive you...!!"`
`"Kuhhahhahha...!!`
` What filth.`
` That form suits you...!"`
`...Even though Rosa's waist and below was standing normally,`
` just the upper half of her body had been pinched, and that extreme contrast was bizarre.`
`Then, she fell over, but the instant she fell, her body was restored.`
`"*cough*cough*!`
` *cough*!!`
` ......YOU die.`
` ...Kuhhihihhihhihhi...!"`
`"Come, Maria.`
` Is this the limit of your anger and sadness?`
` Now is the time for revenge!`
` Time for the settlement of anger and sadness...!!`
` Hit her, spit it out!!`
` Push out all of the wedges driven into your chest...and fling them back at her!!!"`
`"Uugaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhoooooooooooooohhhh!!!"`
`Maria's howl was adorned with the ugly sound of flesh and bone being crushed at the same time...`
`As Rosa, who had foully insulted Maria, lay spread-eagled,`
` a neat, perfect circle was cut out of her chest and crushed, as though her chest had been trampled by an invisible elephant.`
`Her heart and her lungs and her ribs were trampled so mercilessly that they were completely indistinguishable.`
`...It might have symbolized the pain in Maria's heart up until today.`
`"So, Maria,`
` are you satisfied now?`
` Can you forgive your mother for her sin?`
` Or not?`
` Innocent?`
` Or guilty?!"`
`"I can't forgive her!!`
` Not yet, not yet!!`
` Mama is guilty, guilty guilty guilty, can't forgive her!!!"`
`"Indeed, how could this level of punishment compare to the bitter days you suffered through?!!`
` Know it, Rosa!`
` Come, try to remember, what form did you have?!`
` Revive in order to be killed!!`
` Be killed over and over, so that your sins can be purified!!!"`
`When Beato waved her cane, the body was restored again,`
` and Rosa sat up, coughing violently in apparent pain...`
`And once again, she spat out curses rejecting Maria.`
`"......You aren't Mama.`
` You're a witch, a witch tormenting me and Mama!!`
` I won't forgive you just because you look like Mama!`
` I won't forgive you!!"`
`"...You're the witch, aren't you...?`
` Always reading creepy books and pretending to play with witches...!!`
` You're the one who should disappeeeeeeeeeeeear!!`
` Because of you, even I'm treated like a freak!`
` Because of you, because of yooooooooooooouuuuuuu!!!`
` If only you hadn't been born!!`
` Don't be born...!!`
` I've hated you since before you were boooooooooooorn!!!"`
`"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!!"`
`......Maria screamed.`
`Was she unable to bear her anger and sadness?`
`Or else, had she been taken over by an indescribable emotion...?`
`It was surely...a cry of hopelessness.`
`And yet, it was a reality that had to be accepted.`
`Maria knew.`
`She knew that she was thought of as a burden.`
`But even though she herself had known that, she didn't believe it.`
`She'd believed that her mother loved her...and had done her best to positively interpret several events that could have made her doubt this, `
`...trusting and clinging to her mother's love.`
`But, ......she had no one except Mama.`
`Even so, she really did like Mama...`
`and wanted to return to the days when she'd believed that Mama loved her...`
`So I howled...`
`I'll erase all of it.`
`I won't accept it.`
` I'll deny it.`
`I'll deny the mother who says these things, the black witch who makes her say them,`
` and......the part of myself that can't forgive my mother...!!!`
`But I can't deny it!`
`This is reality, fact, the truth, the answer.`
`Without any mistake, this is absolute...reality!!`
`Maria turned Rosa into a lump of meat over and over.`
`Over and over, in the dark world that reflected her heart,`
` rang the ugly sound of flesh and bone being torn apart, which would make anyone want to cover their ears...`
`Each time, Beatrice revived Rosa.`
`She dragged her back into the world of endless torture, which could not be escaped from even by death.`
`This was the true, deepest hell that the Endless Witch Beatrice could create.`
`However, this world was not made endless by Beatrice's will.`
`...Because every time Rosa turned into a lump of meat, she asked the same question to Maria.`
`*cackle*cackle*!`
` Are you satisfied, MARIA?!`
` Can your anger forgive your mother yet?!"`
`"How could I forgive her, how could I forgive her?!!`
` I won't forgive, won't forgive her!!`
` I'll teach you all of my pain...!!`
` Teach you much, much more...!!`
` It's still not enough, not close to enough...!!`
` Since I was born, since before I was born...!!`
` I can't get rid of the anger and sadness of being neglected so long...!!"`
`"......Fuhi, hahaha...`
` ...I hate you, haaate you...`
` Fuhihiha, haha..."`
`"Ugaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!"`
`Revive over and over again.`
`Return to a meat lump over and over again.`
`In various ways, she crushed, smashed, beat, and tore to bits.`
`Flying blood spatter and flesh turned the once pitch-black world into a world with mixed red and black.`
`Maria's anger still hadn't calmed down.`
`It was as though she was spitting out all of the suppressed rage from the time of her birth until today.`
`If that all became poison to her heart...`
`Then would the repeated murder of her mother purify her soul...?`
`Would even this wasteful murder save her soul, at least a little bit...?`
`This endless torture...might have become a slight diversion from her sad, unrewarded life.`
`After all, ...it seemed that she'd finally been able to regain her smile.`
`"Learn it!!`
` You, the source of my unhappiness!!`
` Learn it!!`
` Learn that what you're feeling is nothing compared to my pain!!`
` Kihhihihahhahahaha!!`
` What's wrong?`
` Why'd you stop laughing?!`
` Try and laaaaaaauuugh!!"`
`"...Fuhi, fuhihihi...`
` Gyack...!!!"`
`Half of her skull collapsed.`
`Eyeballs flew out and black cranial fluid gushed.`
`Fragments of teeth scattered.`
`"Come on, revive...!!`
` Try and laugh...!!`
` Come on, come oooooon!!!"`
`"......Ihi, ...ihi.`
` ...Gyaggh!!"`
`Her whole chest along with her ribs turned inside out, exposing her filthy innards.`
`All of them writhed, like some kind of impure creature.`
`"Come on, come on, come on!!`
` Revive!!`
` Can you still laugh?`
` Can you still laugh?!`
` Kihhihihihihi?!"`
`"............"`
`Rosa couldn't laugh anymore.`
`...But her face was laughing.`
`It was filled with a twisted laugh...and covered with a malice that rejected her unwanted daughter.`
`I erased that laughing voice.`
`Next, I'll erase that laughing face.`
`I'll erase it, I'll crush it, I'll tear it to bits...!!`
`"Laugh, try and laugh, Mama...!!`
` Kihhihihihihhahahahahahahahaha?!`
` What's wrong, Mama, let's wake up, read a picture book, and go take a walk...!!`
` Let's say we love each other, make a promise for next Sunday, let's go shopping, let's go to the movies...!!`
` And of course you'll break that promise!!"`
`"Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihi, isn't it fun, Mama? Isn't it fun, Mama? I'm playing with Mama now, right?!!`
` Kihhihhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"`
`"That's right, you are now playing with your mother, having fun with her...!!`
` Tell me how you feel right now!`
` I don't believe it's anger or sadness or pain...!"`
`"Yeah, that's right, I get it, Beatrice...!!`
` I'm having a lot of fun now... I'm playing with Mama, so it's tons of fun!!`
` And even though I'm killing Mama over and over again, she can be revived with just a single bit of magic!!`
` I took care of my toys because I couldn't fix them if they broke...!!`
` But if the toy could be fixed, I'd want to break it over and over again!!`
` Kihhihihihihihihihihihihi!!`
` Hihihihihihi, hihi......"`
`"...But......Sakutaro won't be fixed.`
` ...He can't be fixed...... `
`......Because Mama, who made him, `
`...Mama, who gave birth to him, `
`...won't acknowledge him."`
`"............"`
`"I wasn't acknowledged by Mama either, was I...?`
` ...So the broken Maria won't be fixed either.`
` ............`
`......Kihihihi.`
` Kihhihihihihihihihihihihi!!`
` Kyahhahahahahyahhyahhyahhyah!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaahhh, it's fun, it's fun, Mama...!!`
` Since it's gotten so fun, I'm somehow starting to feel that I could forgive you...!`
` Hey, Beato, this is a veeery strange feeling...!`
` Why?`
` Why am I starting to feel like I can forgive Mama?!"`
`"That enlightened state is only reached by witches who have gained the power to control life and death at will.`
` ...You can kill at any time.`
` You can revive her if needed.`
` If that's a pain, then it's all right to kill her again...!`
` Once you've learned that you can do this at any time by simply snapping your fingers, all nonsense spoken in the world of humans becomes a chirping of insects that isn't worth listening to...!"`
`"You didn't begin to think about forgiving your mother because your eyes were opened to your mother's love.`
` It was because now,`
` you stand at the entrance to the world of true witches...!!`
` Welcome, Maria, to the profound and sweet world of witches!!"`
`"I've done it...!!`
` Maria is no longer Maria...!!`
` I may still be an apprentice, but I've surpassed the Human world...!`
` I am now...the apprentice Witch of Origins, MARIA...!!!`
` There's nothing to frustrate me, nothing to make me sad!"`
`"Mama, I'll forgive you.`
` I'm sure I can forgive you!`
` I think I'll be able to forgive you after doing just a bit more!!`
` After all, I'm a witch!!`
` Ki, ...hihhihihhihhihhihhihhihhi!`
`'!s0`
`hi`
`hi`
`hi`
`h`
`!!!"`
`Maria would probably forgive her mother eventually.`
`...After brutally murdering her countless times.`
` Graciously.`
`"......Whoa, that last thunder was loud.`
` Must've been pretty close, right?"`
`"Looks like it.`
` No matter how old you get, thunder still makes you jump."`
`Battler was looking at the dark night through a crack in the curtains.`
`Every once in a while, a pale, white lightning bolt would shine, and he seemed to be enjoying it.`
`"............"`
`"...Oh?`
` Look, you were so noisy, you woke Maria up.`
` Sorry, Maria.`
` Sorry Battler's so freaking loud...!"`
`"What the hell, so it's my fault?`
` Sorry, Maria.`
` It's okay to go back to sleep.`
` Good night."`
`Maria was a bit hazy, with drowsy eyes.`
`...She was probably half-asleep and couldn't think straight.`
`".........Uu-.`
` ...That's okay.`
` I won't sleep."`
`"Nah, go ahead and sleep.`
` You're still half-asleep, aren't you?`
` Ihihi."`
`"...I'm not half-asleep!`
` ......Uu-!!"`
`"Come on, you're totally half-asleep, aren't you?`
` Sleep, sleeeep."`
`"I'm not half-asleep! Not half-asleep!!`
` Uu-uu-!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Quit it, stupid Battler...!`
` Aah, sheesh, what are you thinking, getting a kid who's just woken up into a bad mood...?!"`
`"I'm not half-asleep!`
` Not half-asleep!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"I understand, Maria-chan...`
` You aren't half-asleep.`
` So calm down..."`
`"Not half-asleep, not half-asleep!!`
` Uu-!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`Maybe it was because of her delicate mental state after waking up, but Maria suddenly threw a tantrum.`
`Battler had only been trying to tease her a bit,`
` so he was confused by this extreme overreaction.`
`George held her head, trying to calm her down, but Maria's tantrum wasn't going to be quelled easily.`
`Battler and Jessica were trying to push the blame on each other, saying 'It's your fault' 'It's your fault too'.`
`"Hey, be quiet, you two...!`
` Jessica-chan, there was still some hot water in the pot, right?`
` Could you make some tea for her?`
` ......Did you calm down,`
` Maria-chan?"`
`"......Uuuu---."`
`It looked like her tantrum was dying down bit by bit,`
` but she still glared at Battler, who had made fun of her, with sharp eyes.`
`"Battler-kun was just kidding around.`
` He doesn't really think you're half-asleep.`
` So calm down.`
` Okay?`
` ............?"`
`"............"`
`George noticed.`
`...Maria was staring at Battler with incredible eyes.`
`And, ...despite having just displayed all that emotion, ...she laughed in a small voice.`
`Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
`Instead of a laugh, it seemed more like she was muttering while thinking about, `
`or else counting, each 'hi'.`
`As though each time she said 'hi', something brutal would happen over and over.`
`George felt something creepy for just an instant,`
` ...but he couldn't spot the madness that peeked out of the depths of the girl's eyes for just a moment.`
`After a short period of stunned silence on George's part,`
` Maria stopped her bizarre, quiet laugh and pushed George's arm aside, as though telling him to let go.`
`"......Uu-.`
` I'll forgive him."`
`"R-Really?`
` You're such a good girl, Maria.`
` ...Battler-kun, Maria-chan forgave you.`
` Make up."`
`"Yeah, sorry for teasing you.`
` Forgive me..."`
`"Hey, Maria...`
` Let's make some cafe au lait as a sign that you've made up.`
` I'll put in lots of sugar, so it'll be sweet."`
`"I don't need it.`
` But I'll forgive you.`
` ......Because I'm a witch.`
` ...Kihihihi."`
`One more time, Maria laughed in a creepy, quiet voice.`
`But it was only for a very short time, so Battler and Jessica didn't think much of it.`
`...They decided to think that...`
`it had probably only looked that way when the lightning lit her cheek with a pale, white light for an instant.`
`At that time, they could hear the sound of loud footsteps coming from the hall.`
`It was already about 10:30, late at night.`
`Late at night is usually a time when you aren't supposed to be disturbed.`
`Hearing footsteps like that at this time was far from calming...`
`Then, along with a clearly ominous knock that repeated fiercely, they could hear Gohda and Kumasawa's voices.`
`...That clearly told them that this was an abnormal situation.`
`"Children...!!`
` Are you there? Are you there?!`
` It's Gohda!"`
`"It's Kumasawa, is everyone okay?!`
` Aaaaaaah, what has happened, what has happened...?!"`
`When George opened the door, the two of them tumbled in, sopping wet.`
`It looked like they had dashed here from the mansion without an umbrella.`
`"Wh-What's wrong, you two...?`
` Did something happen...?!"`
`"I-It was, it was...!!`
` Th-Th-The Master and Krauss-sama, and everyone,`
` awawawawawawa`
`...It was...a pitch-black room.`
`There were no windows, and with the weak light bulb, one could just barely make out the state of things around them.`
`It appeared to be an old forgotten underground storage room, with some kind of dusty furniture haphazardly thrown into it...`
`However, even with just a little light, one could at least make out that it probably wasn't a storage room.`
`...After all, that room was sealed off with iron bars.`
`"...Where...is this......?"`
`"I don't know...`
` ...Could this be underneath the mansion...?`
` Has there always been a room like this...directly underneath the dining hall...?"`
`They had dropped into what had appeared to be a pit, `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~falling~ib~`
` into this room.`
`Therefore, it was natural to assume that this room was directly under the dining hall.`
`...However, not even Krauss could bring himself to believe that there were pitfalls rigged in his beloved dining hall, where he had enjoyed his meals for years, `
`...and that this dungeon-like room lay directly beneath it.`
`But the ceiling above was of crude stone craftsmanship, ...and they couldn't understand how they could've fallen from somewhere up there.`
`No, all five people who had been dropped here thought the same thing.`
`Although they'd had the sensation of falling into a pit,`
` ...there was no way there could be pitfalls in the dining hall, nor could this dungeon-like place be directly under it.`
`...But, the truth was that they actually had fallen into this place and were locked in.`
`...So, ...they were confused.`
`"...It is lucky that no one was hurt after falling from such a height..."`
`"......Shannon, Kanon.`
` Did either of you two know about this room...?"`
`"...No.`
` We did not know of this room either."`
`".........Really...?"`
`"R-Really...`
` We really...don't know about a room like this..."`
`Despite their age, Kyrie apparently wouldn't have found it odd if they,`
` as servants allowed to wear the One-Winged Eagle, might know of the mansion's secret tricks.`
`There was a long silence, as if Krauss was evaluating their answer...`
`"...No, it's probably true that you don't know.`
` After all, this is the clean-freak Shannon we're talking about.`
` If she knew about this room, she'd probably scrub this place until it was sparkling.`
` The filth of this room is proof that you two don't know of it.`
` ...More importantly, I think we should worry about what to do next."`
`"E-Exactly...`
` We need to call the police, ...o-or rather administer first aid as soon as possible..."`
`Nanjo's words were hollow.`
`...Obviously.`
`Six people had been killed in the dining hall.`
`Everybody had seen the exact moment when they'd been killed.`
`And since half of their heads had been destroyed,`
` anyone could tell that the deaths had been instant with just a single glance.`
`Everyone understood that first aid no longer held any meaning...`
`"Thank you, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...We already understand that our partners are no longer alive.`
` ......Thanks for trying to console us by mentioning first aid."`
`"......Natsuhi...`
`.................."`
`Once again, a gloomy silence dominated the atmosphere.`
`But Krauss shook his head harshly over and over and, for the time being, `
`decided to forget the pain of losing his wife, and to dedicate himself to figuring out where they were.`
`"Everyone, listen to me.`
` .........Father is...`
`...hopeless now.`
` We've passed the point...`
`of searching for a reason or an explanation that can be expressed in words."`
`Nobody answered.`
`...Without any kind of discussion or mercy, six people had been killed in an instant.`
`And, Kinzo had even been so bold as to proclaim that we'd become sacrifices for a ceremony involving 13 murders.`
`...Since we've been locked up in this place,`
` we too will probably become the ceremony's next sacrifices soon.`
`Around this time, our eyes became used to the darkness...`
`and, bit by bit, we were able to understand more about the dungeon's interior.`
`...What we thought was furniture haphazardly left in the dungeon turned out not to be furniture at all.`
`They were...things like small cages to lock people in, restraints, or else...torture racks.`
`...At any rate, it was obvious that it was eerier than a mere jail cell.`
`Since the objects were rusted together and coated in thick dust, there was no doubt that they had been forgotten.`
`...Maybe you could even call these things Kinzo's sealed and forgotten madness.`
`However, we had been locked away in this room.`
`...Those objects weren't exactly comforting to people who were locked up,`
` hoping to be released without harm...`
`"...At any rate, let's get out of here.`
` We've lost loved ones and friends and would like to spend some time shedding tears, `
`but more than that, ...I'm worried about the children."`
`"......I-I wonder if the children are safe..."`
`"All we can do is pray...`
` ...Come to think of it, Kumasawa and Gohda aren't here."`
`"Perhaps...they were able to get away safely..."`
`"You never know.`
` It would be a relief if they were able to meet up with the children..."`
`"When the going gets tough, Gohda-san is reliable, and Kumasawa-san is knowledgeable and calm...`
` I'm sure they'll be able to help the children..."`
`"...Hahahaha.`
` Yes, that certainly would be comforting."`
`Shannon and Krauss smiled bitterly a little.`
`But they quickly realized how improper that was and stopped, clearing their throats.`
`"......We can't be optimistic, Nee-san.`
` There's a chance they've already been attacked after we were."`
`"I agree.`
` What Father carried out in the dining hall was...`
`the six murders of the first twilight from the witch's epitaph, right?"`
`"Then, the second twilight is to 'Tear apart the two who are close'.`
` ...We can't deny the possibility that Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san may have been killed after escaping together.`
` ...We can't cling to the optimistic idea that they must've gotten to the guesthouse and are protecting the children."`
`Kyrie coldly analyzed the worst-case scenario.`
`For her, it was heartbreaking to have lost her beloved husband.`
`...But right now, the most important thing was protecting that husband's son, `
`along with the other children, from becoming the insane Family Head's sacrifices.`
`She overcame her sadness with the parental urge to protect children from sorrow.`
`...It seemed that both Kyrie and Krauss were strong enough to forget about their grief, if only for the time being...`
`They would let their tears flow later.`
`...In order to protect the children, they had to act.`
`"Anyway, let's get out of here...`
` It seems to be a rather old cell.`
` Couldn't we break the bars with something?`
` Let's try searching the entire room for some way to escape."`
`"I wonder if there are any torture tools lying around all these torture cages.`
` They might be useful as weapons, or to break the bars."`
`Kyrie pulled a lighter from her pocket.`
`She herself didn't smoke, but she kept one tucked away in her pocket to light Rudolf's cigarettes.`
`...It was an extremely valuable source of light for searching in this dim dungeon.`
`"Shannon, help Kyrie-san search the room.`
` Kanon, you help me check out the bars.`
` This is a very old cell.`
` The bars could be loose."`
`"...W-What should I help with...?"`
`"Please just keep up your strength.`
` ...Father will probably come soon.`
` You're the only one whose words will reach him.`
`"...My words...will no longer reach him, I think.`
` I'm sorry, but I don't believe I will be of any use..."`
`"Then lend us your expertise as a doctor.`
` ......I wonder if there exists a drug that can make people instantly faint."`
`"...A drug that makes people instantly faint...?`
` What are you talking about...?"`
`"We believe we fell through a pit and landed in this dungeon.`
` ...In that panic-stricken moment, that's what we believed happened."`
`"...But I measured the breadth of this room and came to a realization.`
` This dungeon can't be underneath the dining hall."`
`"Why do you say that...?"`
`"......You're an idiot, Nee-san.`
` Compared to the dining hall, this dungeon is too cramped."`
`"Exactly.`
` The first person to fall was Krauss nii-san.`
` The second was myself.`
` When you fell into this room, did you move from that spot, Krauss nii-san?"`
`"...It's embarrassing to say, but the landing hurt, and I lay there groaning in pain.`
` Immediately after that, Kyrie-san came crashing down next to me."`
`"The distance between where we were standing and the places where we landed is clearly off."`
`"C-Certainly, when you put it that way.`
` ...I was the next to fall, so I remember fairly well where you two were standing.`
` ...The distance between you two in the dining hall might have been greater than this entire room."`
`"We fell into a pit and directly dropped down here.`
` ...It's not like we fell into multiple interlocking pipes and were all collected here.`
` The fall was instant, wasn't it?`
` I don't remember rolling around in some sort of elaborate water pipe system."`
`"......True, we can't explain it with a pitfall.`
` ...What a strange tale."`
`"What does that have to do...with a drug that makes people instantly faint, like Kyrie-sama was talking about...?"`
`"...............`
`...Kyrie-sama is probably thinking that there were no pitfalls in the dining hall, correct?"`
`"But in reality, we did fall."`
`"More accurately, we felt as though we fell into pits.`
` ...That was only natural.`
` After all, we experienced something that couldn't be described any other way."`
`"I-I see...`
` In other words, this is what you want to say...`
` ...We did not fall into pits...`
` ...We were attacked with something like a blowdart, for example, and lost consciousness instantly.`
` It could be that we just remember the instant we fell to the floor as though it were falling through a pit..."`
`"......I see.`
`"...Nee-san,`
` do you have a watch?"`
`"Huh?`
` ......Y-Yes.`
` I have a pocket watch.`
` ......Umm, it's about 22:40."`
`"......Yes.`
` My watch says the same.`
` ...In short, it's only been a bit more than ten minutes since that uproar in the dining hall, at most."`
`"My watch has the same time.`
` ......That's much too short a time to knock us out and carry us somewhere.`
` ......Judging only from the time, it's reasonable to assume that we did fall through a hole leading directly underneath the dining hall."`
`"They could've tampered with the watch hands as much as they wanted.`
` ...While we were passed out, they may have wound everyone's watches back.`
` We're incapable of proving that this possibility doesn't exist."`
`"...............`
`Whether it was a pitfall or a drug that induces fainting, `
`...it does not change the fact that we need to be on guard..."`
`"...Well then, Doctor Nanjo,`
` is there a drug that can do that?"`
`"Well......`
`  ...It's the same as your reasoning, Kyrie-san.`
` ...I cannot prove that there isn't a drug with that effect that I don't know about."`
`"...As they say, you can never be too careful.`
` ...Sorry, it was a useless question.`
` I just thought that with my hypothesis, I could suggest that this dungeon might not necessarily be directly underneath the dining hall."`
`"I see...`
` ...There's always the possibility that we were carried off to `
`the hidden mansion they say Father built in the middle of the forest.`
` ...If we can escape from here and get outside, then we'll know.`
` We'll save worrying about that until after we get out."`
`"Exactly.`
` I'm truly sorry.`
` I've only been asking about and prying into useless things."`
`"No, it's quite promising.`
` If you notice anything else, please tell us.`
` It might become a hint to escaping from here."`
`"......Rudolf was always talking about you.`
` He said he was always surprised by your ideas, and they would sometimes give him valuable hints.`
` ...The fact that you're here is a blessing within a tragedy."`
`"...Thank you.`
` I heard something from Rudolf-san as well.`
` He said that you usually just swagger about, but when things get serious, you overflow with a sense of responsibility and can be a very dependable older brother."`
`"Hahaha, ...that's too kind.`
` ......Dammit, at any rate, these iron bars won't even budge.`
` How are things on your end, Kanon?"`
`"......No, this side is no better."`
`Krauss and Kanon tried wiggling the bars in various ways.`
`...There were a few bars that could be twisted...`
`and a few had enough space to rattle a little bit around in, `
`but they couldn't be broken with human strength alone.`
`...However, there was still hope if they could use some kind of lever-like tool.`
`It was still far too early to give up yet.`
`The children's lives were hanging in the balance.`
`...Even if there was no hope, they couldn't stop their struggle.`
`And, it was better for them to act this way.`
`...If they were to stop, ...there's no doubt they'd once again be overcome by the grief of losing their loved ones and curl up, clutching their knees...`
`"How are you doing, Kyrie-san?`
` Find anything?"`
`"...I've found some small stones that we could hold onto and hide.`
` Something like this could probably be used as a weapon.`
` Though, it'd probably be impossible to whittle down those iron bars with them.`
` How about you, Shannon-chan...?"`
`"No, nothing.`
` ......Ah, this is...`
`...a phone."`
`"I doubt it's connected.`
` ...But, we might be able to use the cord as some form of string-based weapon.`
` If we break it, we could take out the metal parts.`
` Krauss Nii-san, there's a keyhole for opening the bars, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` It's a pretty large hole, quite old fashioned.`
` ...If we twist some wire into it, we just might be able to pick it."`
`"We might be able to use the metal parts of the phone as a substitute for something.`
` ...This phone will become our weapon."`
`"It's just like investing.`
` Our weapon is information."`
`Krauss and Kyrie laughed together at how they hadn't even thought of using the phone as a means of communication.`
`"......What are you doing, Nee-san?"`
`"Ah, ...um, ...I just wondered if maybe the phone was w-working..."`
`"......You dummy, Nee-san.`
` (*whisper*)"`
`"Huh...?`
` ......What?"`
`At that point, Shannon let out a small, surprised cry.`
`"K-Kyrie-sama...!`
` ...This phone, it's connected."`
`"What did you say...?"`
`It was like when people move out of an office, taking everything with them, leaving only the telephone behind...`
` That's the feeling the phone gave off, having been left in the corner of the cell.`
`The cord was wound into a coil, the tip of it being swallowed by the wall,`
` and just looking at it, there was no reason to assume that it wasn't hooked up.`
`...But, to think that it was actually was...`
`Kyrie took the receiver from Shannon and pressed it to her ear.`
`Certainly, the electric hum of a phone was a familiar sound.`
`...And this phone was certainly live.`
`"Wh-What good luck...!`
` Let's contact the police...!"`
`"Hold on...!`
` This is too good to be true.`
` Could it be bugged...?!"`
`"If they were planning a trick like that, normally they would cut the telephone line.`
` ...There's actually a good possibility that they overlooked this.`
` If they notice, they might actually cut the line this time.`
` There's nothing we could tell the police that would be problematic for us if they overheard."`
`...Surely, that was true.`
`The point of a wiretap is to overhear some important piece of information,`
` but the way things were right then, she couldn't think of a single thing that would come up in a conversation to the outside world that might be troublesome to have overheard.`
`Kyrie instantly concluded that it was more likely to be a mistake on Kinzo's part than a trap...`
`"Y-You do have a point...`
` I believe you start with 0 to make calls through the external line..."`
`"Kanon-kun, I'm going to make a phone call, so will you watch how things are out there for me?`
` If you sense somebody coming, let me know."`
`"Y-Yes...!"`
`Kanon raced off towards the iron bars, silenced his breathing, and strained his ears...`
`As everyone present watched her, Kyrie dialed 110...`
`However, she pushed the hook down and re-dialed many times.`
`...It didn't seem to be working very well.`
`"...The outside line begins with 0?`
` 110 would be 0110 then, right?`
` It doesn't seem to want to go through..."`
`"Hand it over here, I'll try to call...`
`..............."`
`Krauss took the receiver in Kyrie's place and tested various things...`
`But in the end, they were unable to notify the police...`
`The phone itself was definitely live, but the circuit was apparently cut somewhere.`
`...Did this mean that 'they' were not so naive?`
`"...So it's useless after all..."`
`"It means our enemies aren't naive either...`
`........."`
`Kyrie let out a deep sigh, leaned against the wall, and hung her head for a while.`
`As cool-thinking as she was, for a brief moment, she may actually have had the naive hope that the phone might actually work.`
`...She sneered at herself mockingly for holding onto that naive hope for even a single moment.`
`Then, ...she remembered just what was happening here.`
`...Truth be told, ...even after being shown a scene like that right before her eyes...or rather, exactly because of that...`
`...She still couldn't think of that gruesome mass murder as something real...`
`It was less that she couldn't believe it...and more that she didn't want to.`
`Ushiromiya Kinzo killed six family members.`
`He summoned strange, witch-like, demon-like people...`
`...right out of thin air, `
`......and with something like magic, `
`...began to kill people one after another......`
`............`
`It's just all so screwed up.`
`...Even though she definitely saw it, there was no way she could accept that spectacle...`
`"......There's no way that's what happened.`
` ......Those were obviously Father's friends or something.`
` ...They just hid somewhere in the dining hall beforehand and used some tricks to appear suddenly and fool us.`
` ...There's no other way to explain something as screwed up as that."`
`But when those six had had their heads blown apart, a golden arrow had flown around and around the room.`
`...That had truly looked like...`
`...magic.`
`Was that another thing we just saw wrong?`
`There's no way it was magic.`
` It was definitely some kind of setup.`
`...Since those heads were smashed, there's no doubt it was some kind of explosive.`
`For example, a styrene toy plane like they sell at candy stores, painted gold, `
`...and with a powerful explosive loaded onto the end of it.`
`...However, though it had seemed to be flying about at random, `
`Kyrie couldn't imagine that after being fired six times, each time had perfectly hit the victims square in the head, one after the other.`
`It couldn't be that there was a computer control system for finding and hitting targets,`
` making it a high-tech styrene plane on the same level as a guided missile, right...?`
`"......Would he invest such a large amount of money into developing some stupid trick like that?`
` ...For that insane sideshow...?`
` Does this take us back to the old 'I wouldn't put it past Father'...?"`
`A number of mysterious people appeared out of thin air, `
`...six people had their heads demolished by a mysterious golden flying object, `
`...and the five of us were locked away in a mysterious dungeon by a mysterious set of pitfalls, or else put to sleep by some fainting poison dart...`
`The family conference started a bit after 22:00.`
`...It's only been a bit more than 30 minutes since then.`
`Most likely, `
`even though I witnessed it myself, `
`...that event took place in such a short period of time, so I still can't understand it, and I still can't come to grips with it.`
`For argument's sake, even if we did get ahold of the police, `
`it would probably be impossible for anybody to accurately explain what we saw...`
`Even though I saw it just now,`
` ...my brain's fried, and I have no confidence in what I saw myself...`
`Kyrie tried her hardest to cheer herself out of her overwhelming confusion, to just hold onto her sanity...`
`"Dammit, ...what's going on here, `
`...dammit, ...dammit...!"`
`Krauss started to become desperate, hitting the hook multiple times and resetting the dial.`
`...Krauss had also been feigning composure, but he was unable to hide his panic.`
`The more he retried the dial, the more the pretense of serenity peeled away...`
`I don't know what's going on anymore...`
`Kyrie couldn't help but pray that the events that had just occurred were a dream...`
`......At that time, the look on Krauss's face changed.`
`"Nn, ...o-oh...!`
` I got through, I got through...!`
` It's ringing...!"`
`"R-Really, Krauss-san...?!"`
`"I see, how shallow, old man...!`
` Since we can't contact the police, the external line has probably been cut, but he failed to sever the internal line...!"`
`"The internal line?`
` Krauss-san, where did you call...?!"`
`"The guesthouse.`
` I'm calling the room where Jessica and the rest are staying...!`
` ...Ah?!`
` Hello!`
` Hello?!`
` It's me...!`
` You're...!`
` Gohda?!`
` Is Jessica there, is she safe...?!!"`
`"K-Krauss-sama...!!`
` I'm so glad you're safe!!`
` Yes!`
` Lady Jessica and the other children are here as well, safe and unharmed...!"`
`"Dad!!`
` Is it Dad?!`
` I'm so glad you're okay...!!`
` Is Mom okay?!`
` Is she there?!"`
`"......Your......"`
`Krauss choked on his words.`
`...Krauss had clearly seen Natushi's head crushed, had seen her killed right before his eyes...`
`Eventually, he was going to have to tell that to Jessica.`
`...However, Krauss began to fret over whether he should tell her now or not...and lost his words.`
`...But even that was an answer under these circumstances...`
`"...I don't know about your mother...`
` ...Let's pray for her safety.`
` ...For now, I'm just glad you're safe.`
`"............Yeah.`
` ...I understand.`
` ......I'm sorry...for asking."`
`Jessica's voice was filled with tears...`
`...Krauss was certain now.`
`Jessica and the rest had heard everything, start to finish, after meeting up with Gohda and Kumasawa at the guesthouse...`
`When they learned that six people had been killed,`
` they must have been anxious to rush over to the dining hall.`
`......Luckily, he'd been able to call before they'd stormed off towards the mansion.`
`Krauss was relieved at this good timing during such a tragedy...`
`"We have Kyrie-san and Doctor Nanjo, as well as Shannon and Kanon here.`
` We've been locked in a place that's like a dungeon, but don't worry.`
` We'll figure something out."`
`"A dungeon?`
` Where?!`
` We'll come and save you...!!"`
`"Unfortunately, we can't figure out where this is either.`
` We think it may be under the dining hall, but that might not be true.`
` ......Anyway, Jessica,`
` you must stay where you are.`
` You've heard about what happened from Gohda and Kumasawa, yes?"`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, jes_4e44:`
`...everyone..."`
`"Grandfather isn't in a sane state of mind right now.`
` If you encounter him, you'll be in danger.`
` You might be killed...!`
` You mustn't even think about trying to come and save us...!`
` We'll take care of ourselves."`
`"Th-Then what should we do?!`
` Damn you, Grandfather, how dare you do that to Mom and the rest...?!`
` I'm gonna kill that undying bastard...!!"`
`"Jessica, if you talk like that, you'll sadden your mother.`
` Those aren't the words of a lady."`
`"Uuuuuuu, ...uuuuuu...!!"`
`"Anyway, put your own safety first.`
` Lock all the guesthouse doors.`
` ...But you mustn't overestimate how safe that will make you.`
` The large window in the first floor lounge might get broken.`
` Stay in your room, and use a bed to make a barricade.`
` There's a toilet and fridge in there too, right?`
` You should be able to stay holed up until tomorrow morning.`
` ...Listen up, I'll say it again. ...Don't think of doing anything violent.`
` Don't even think about trying to take revenge for Mom!`
` Only think of hiding, of getting through this without provoking our enemies."`
`"Yeah, ......yeah...!!`
` I understand, ...Dad...!`
` Uuuuuuuuuu!!"`
`After that, Gohda took the phone...`
`and was firmly told to supervise the kids well, as an adult.`
`...Gohda, with his face covered in a cold sweat, repeatedly replied "Yes sir, yes sir!" in an excessively tense voice.`
`From there, Kyrie took the receiver and spoke with Battler, and when Shannon and Kanon got their turns, George and Jessica answered.`
` Following that pattern, Nanjo and Kumasawa picked up as well, so that all members of both sides took the receiver in turn,`
` confirming that everyone was safe for now, even if their location was unknown, and encouraging each other, coming to an understanding on the current situation for both sides.`
`They wanted to talk forever, but now was not the time to chat.`
`Krauss explained that they would be hanging up for now, and those in the guesthouse consented.`
`"If anything happens, we'll call.`
` Wait by the phone so you can pick it up quickly.`
` Again, be careful.`
` You mustn't do anything rash...!"`
`"...Y-Yeah, I understand...`
` As long as you and...Kanon-kun and the others are okay, ...then that's good enough for me...`
` ...We'll do our best.`
` Stay safe...!"`
`"Yes, of course.`
` Well then, I'm hanging up for now.`
` Be on your guard."`
`With that, the phone call ended.`
`Gohda and the rest of the men quickly descended to the first floor, closed the shutters, and secured the sturdy locks on the doors.`
`However, just as Krauss had worried, there was nothing that could be done about the beautiful wide window in the first floor lounge.`
`If someone broke that, it would be easy to get inside.`
`It wouldn't be hard for someone like Kinzo, who hadn't hesitated at committing murder, to invade the first floor.`
`"...It's likely that Grandfather and his followers will be armed.`
` Locking ourselves in our room is our best bet, and moreover our only method of forming a barricade.`
` ...It's painful that we have no choice but to hole up in a sealed room, but if our enemies are carrying guns, then that's the only method we have left to us."`
`"I-I have heard that the Master has a collection of working guns.`
` ...That's right, guns, that was a gun...`
` If so, ...it must have been a horribly powerful gun...!`
` W-We can't contend with that at all...!"`
`"......It takes a lot of force to smash someone's head open, right?`
` So it might be a magnum bullet or something like that.`
` That'd probably go through a flimsy door like it was nothing."`
`"If so, then that's even more of a reason to hold out in our room...`
` Let's slide a bed in place, and block the window too.`
` ...If we do that much, then no matter how many guns they've got, they shouldn't be able to raid us."`
`"Crap, ...all we can do is this passive, one-sided defense.`
` ...Dammit, dealing a finishing blow to Dad, and even capturing Kyrie, `
`...that's gonna cost you, you damn geezer...!"`
`"I-I-I-Impossible, there's no way we can compete with them...!!`
` Besides, it's not just the Master, he has his underlings too!`
` Th-There might even be more of them...!`
` ......Just what...are they...?"`
`Battler was filled to the brim with the urge to get revenge for Rudolf...`
`and to rush out of here to save Kyrie.`
`...But just by looking at how terrified Gohda was, there was no doubt in him that this would be reckless...`
`"...It's gotta be hard on you too, ...right, Aniki?`
` And yet, you've got to stay holed up here, ...dammit..."`
`"Of course, I'm torn up about it too.`
` It's not like I can remain calm with both of my parents murdered.`
` But specifically because of that, I have to remain calm!`
` Do you think our dead parents would want us to die in vain?`
` There's no way they would!`
` They'd want for at least their children to escape."`
`"So I will survive.`
` And I'll report this to the police and uncover everything.`
` I'll leave my enemies to the courts.`
` That is my revenge.`
` ...There's no way our parents would want us to die taking revenge for them.`
` Right...?"`
`"...............`
` ...You're right...`
` It's just as you say...`
` ...Dammit, you old bastard, what's this about a ceremony...?!`
` If we're supposed to be sacrifices for something like that, then we'll escape no matter what it takes, ruining this precious ritual of yours..."`
`"That's right.`
` ...Besides, you still have Kyrie-san, Battler-kun.`
` And I still have Shannon.`
` Anyway, let's be cautious and wait for our chance.`
` Any careless actions on our part might just end up causing harm to those who have been captured."`
`"......Hostages, huh?`
` ......But Grandfather captured them so he could use them as sacrifices, right?!`
` If we don't go and save them, then are we just waiting for them to get killed?!"`
`"We don't even know where the dungeon they're being held in is...!`
` Shannon and Kanon-kun didn't know about it, and of course Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san didn't know either.`
` The possibility that they're in a secret location that only Grandfather knows of is incredibly high.`
` ...Under these circumstances, aimlessly wandering about would be practically suicidal!"`
`"...I-I understand...`
`...But still, ...dammit, ...are you saying the only thing we can do is stay confined here until something happens...?"`
`"......B-Battler-sama, I understand how you feel, but...`
`...let's put safety first...`
` ...From what Krauss-sama said, they seem to be in a fairly old cell,`
` and they may be able to break the bars somehow.`
` ...The wise choice of action now is to believe in them and wait."`
`"Grandfather has a number of subordinates, and they're all armed, correct...?"`
`"...Y-Yes, he does.`
` ......And they're probably...`
`all armed..."`
`Gohda had been able to say that Kinzo had comrades with him, `
`...but he hadn't been able to mention that they were mostly young women, like witches, ...who had used strange magic to murder.`
`If he had said that, it would only have cast doubt on his sanity.`
`...No, not only that, he himself still couldn't understand what he had seen, and was doubting his own sanity.`
`...But, regardless of sex or appearance, ...regardless of whether it was done with magic or a gun.`
`The fact that those girls had followed Kinzo's orders......`
`and killed six people in an instant...was an unshakable truth...`
`If that group came to attack the guesthouse as well, ...what would happen?`
`Just closing the doors and windows like this was surely meaningless...`
`Gohda...and Kumasawa...`
`The only thing left for those two, who had witnessed that massacre in the dining hall,`
` was to cradle their heads without knowing how to interpret what they had seen...`
`"......Kumasawa-san, are you okay...?`
` Want some tea...?"`
`"H-Hohohohohoh...`
` Thank you very much, thank you...`
` ...I'm sorry, but may I be left with my thoughts for a little while......?"`
`Maria tried to be nice, but it seemed that Kumasawa still hadn't been able to clear away her confusion.`
`"...Maria, thanks for being so considerate.`
` Let's let Kumasawa-san rest for now."`
`"...Uu-."`
`Jessica was also worried about the shock those two must have received after witnessing such a tragedy, `
`...but her wildest dreams couldn't even come close to the unbelievable scene Kumasawa had witnessed...`
`Nevertheless, with her mother murdered and her father captured,`
` it wasn't as though Jessica could stay calm either.`
`She sealed her anxiety and sadness using her anger towards Kinzo...and walked irritatedly around the room.`
`"......Kumasawa-san,`
` is Mom really......dead?"`
`"...Y-Yes...`
` ...I've never seen such a...horrible way to die before..."`
`'!s1`
`...and that if we fix her up, `
`...we could save her...?"`
`"...............`
`...I-It's not possible for a person to have something like that done to their head......and live..."`
`"..................`
`...Yeah, you're right...`
` ...There's no need for first aid...`
`once your head's smashed, usually..."`
`When Gohda had come flying into the guesthouse,`
` he had, overcome with agitation, told about the massacre in the dining hall without concealing anything.`
`...Except for the part about witches and magic, which they themselves still couldn't believe.`
`In other words, he hadn't even sugarcoated the cold-blooded way in which Natushi and the others had died.`
`...It was too late now, but Kumasawa regretted the fact that they'd obviously said too much...`
`However, while lightly shaking her head and with a slightly painful laugh, Jessica spoke.`
`"...Actually, thanks to what you told us, I was able to stay level-headed.`
` ......If you'd avoided mentioning the part about her head being smashed, `
`...I would've thought she might still be alive.`
` Then I would've run off towards the mansion, met Grandfather, ...and I might've gotten killed.`
` ...That sliver of hope could've been fatal in the end.`
` ......So I'm grateful."`
`"...I'm truly sorry...`
` I'm so sorry we didn't choose our words more carefully..."`
`"Don't worry about that now.`
` There's nothing we can do for Mom, ...but Dad's still alive.`
` Kanon-kun and Shannon, and Aunt Kyrie and Doctor Nanjo too.`
` ...I want to save them somehow, so we shouldn't do anything unnecessary that might make things worse for them.`
` The most helpful thing we can do right now might be to wait by the phone."`
`They might receive a phone call asking them to create a diversion while the others escaped.`
`Or, the others might discover their location and call for rescue.`
`...Jessica understood that in order to act promptly when that time came, the only thing they could do for the time being was to wait in this room...`
`Once they had finished inspecting the downstairs area and locking up, George, Battler, and Gohda returned.`
`Each was holding various objects.`
`George had things like drinks, canned food, crackers, and other types of snacks he had found in the lounge and a storage room, as well as a first aid kit.`
`They were all consumables that would be essential during a seige.`
`Gohda had a large folding ladder and carpentry tools.`
`Those were to seal the door from the inside, just in case.`
`If it came to it, the ladder was for escaping out the window.`
`Battler had brought up objects that could be used as edged weapons or poles.`
`In addition to the obvious kitchen knife, there was a dissembled table leg that could be used as a club...`
`and a pole roughly the size of a person, which he'd apparently made by taking apart a hat stand.`
` Even though the pole had no point, it could surely be used like a spear.`
`...There was a good chance that their enemies had guns, so it was dubious whether these would be of any use.`
`But it was still better than not having them, and if having these could give them at least a little peace of mind, then they'd be useful for their calming effect.`
`Then, the bed and sofa were placed up against the door, barricading it.`
`They didn't go so far as to seal it up with nails.`
`...There was still a chance that Krauss and the others would escape and come to meet up with them.`
`They had apparently set up a barricade at top of the stairs as well.`
`It had been set up in a way that would create a racket, so it would serve as a warning alarm as well.`
`That had apparently been Battler's idea.`
`For that reason, they turned the TV off.`
`......This way, if the first floor window were to be broken, they would hear.`
`Once the switch had been turned, all that was left was an eerie silence.`
`...The sound of violent wind and rain.`
`Were they going to have to spend the whole night being crushed by such suspense?`
`The boat would come tomorrow morning.`
`However, judging by the weather report, most of tomorrow was going to be covered in the typhoon, and the boat probably wouldn't come.`
`...The typhoon was set to pass by in the morning of the day after tomorrow.`
`In other words, the boat would be arriving in the morning after next, ...the morning of October 6th.`
`And right now, it was late at night on October 4th.`
`......They would have to spend more than 30 hours on this island,`
` with Kinzo turned cold-blooded murderer and his weird companions prowling about...`
`Even with the shutters closed, there would definitely be a little bit of light seeping out.`
`It might let the enemy know that they were hiding here.`
`...Battler suggested that it might be best to turn off the lights.`
`But they had already been overwhelmed by a ghastly feeling just from turning the TV off.`
`...There wasn't anyone who directly challenged his proposal, but then again, there wasn't a single other person who agreed with it......`
`"...Uu-.`
` We can't watch TV?"`
`"Yeah, sorry, but you'll have to bear with it.`
` ...We can't just let the sound of the enemy breaking in slip by."`
`"............`
`...Boring."`
`Even though she had been told of her mother's death, Maria alone didn't feel an approaching sense of danger.`
`She just seemed to be upset that the TV had been turned off.`
`......Even though she's in such a bizarre situation, can she not share in our sense of danger?`
`...Is it because she's so young?`
`To Battler, even this faintly unsettling feeling from such a young girl made him sense that there was something very eerie about Maria...`
`"That said,`
` ......we've already done all we can.`
` Do you think you'll be able to do anything about the bars?"`
`"...Unfortunately, they're tougher than expected.`
` I don't know when these were made, but there's no problem with their lifetime guarantee.`
` These truly were built rather well."`
`Kyrie chuckled softly.`
`...They had no moves they could make, but she had calmed just a little.`
`"...This place is just like the capture pile of a chess game.`
` ...So, are there no remaining moves left to us...?"`
`"Not yet.`
` It's still too early to give up.`
` If we stop thinking, we might as well stop breathing, right?"`
`"Exactly.`
` ...Chess pieces in the capture pile may serve no purpose, but in shogi, they can be quite significant.`
` Just one captured pawn should be able to put pressure on the opponent."`
`"I see...`
` But still, there's nothing that can be done about these bars..."`
`"For us, maybe.`
` ......But, if we can figure out where this is and contact Gohda-san, he might be able to come and save us."`
`"I see...`
` But that would mean putting Gohda-san in danger...`
` And if that happens, I would also be worried about the children in the guesthouse, alone without a full-grown adult male..."`
`"When you're afraid of risk, it's all right to bide your time until the price starts to go up.`
` ...However, if you're too afraid to cut your losses, you might end up with just a scrap of paper.`
` ...Though in this case, that represents our lives."`
`"And our dignity as parents, right?`
` After talking big like that during the telephone call, telling them that they should behave because we'll manage something on our own, we can't just start asking for help right away.`
` That would be very uncool.`
` *giggle*."`
`"By this point, I've long since thrown out such useless pride.`
` ......Why don't we put our heads together?`
` Where is this?`
` Is it really underneath the dining hall?`
` Or else, is it a different place, separate from the mansion...?"`
`Krauss, Kyrie, and Nanjo began to discuss this further.`
`Kanon was squatting by the bars, silently trying to sense anyone's presence.`
`...Just as he had been ordered.`
`Shannon came close to him, and they both squatted down together.`
`"......Do you sense anyone?"`
`"......Yes.`
` ...They haven't focused their attention in this direction, but there's somebody relatively close by."`
`"Is it Human...?"`
`"......I think it's the goats.`
` Their breathing is rather noisy."`
`Kanon's ability to sense the presence of others was several levels above that of a Human.`
`He said that their breathing was noisy, but Krauss and the rest couldn't even pick up the slightest hint of it.`
`...Therefore, if he had obediently reported it, they would have merely doubted Kanon's ears.`
`".........They got us, didn't they?"`
`"............`
`...It's rare.`
` To think that they captured us without killing us."`
`"This time, Beatrice-sama didn't make an appearance.`
` And the Master left his study.`
` ...I don't have a clue what's going on..."`
`"I know.`
` ......Whatever happens or changes, it's all for that witch's fickle entertainment.`
` In the end, nothing will change."`
`"I wonder if we'll be able to......go to the Golden Land this time."`
`"Who knows.`
` We have a high rate of losing."`
`"......Come to think of it, it's very rare for us to survive the first twilight together.`
` ...I get the feeling that it's incredibly unusual for us to be able to talk together like this even though the ceremony has already begun."`
`"That may be.`
` ...But even that's just for the witch's entertainment, I'll bet.`
` I can't think of it as anything other than her letting us live just a little longer to ridicule us, since we usually drop out right in the beginning."`
`"I wonder......if we'll be unable to reach the Golden Land again."`
`"I'm sure we won't make it there.`
` ...If we hold onto any foolish hope, we'll get taken advantage of again."`
`"*giggle*`
` That's right.`
` Last time, you got taken advantage of, didn't you?"`
`"...I'm an idiot."`
`Kanon made a sour look and turned his head.`
`Shannon laughed softly and apologetically leaned towards his shoulder.`
`"But...I'm glad Milady is safe."`
`"...She's only escaped from the first twilight.`
` ...She might just be waiting for an even crueler death later on.`
` What about you, Nee-san?`
` ...Aren't you glad George-sama's safe?`
` It'd be nice if you two could reach the Golden Land together."`
`"......Thank you.`
`"I-I wasn't hoping for anything like that.`
` ...It's just as you say.`
` That witch is only having fun, dangling prizes in front of people and watching them vainly try to get them.`
` ......I'm sure no one will be able to go to the Golden Land.`
` ...If I wish to reach the Golden Land with Milady, `
`...then that person will find it funny...and will certainly never let us reach that place."`
`"...You're right.`
` ......Beatrice-sama is thinking about which order of sacrifices will be the most interesting."`
`"The whole thing about them being chosen at random is just a blatant lie.`
` That swindling witch...`
` ...All that about having any wish you want granted in the Golden Land is probably just a lie too."`
`".........That's not true.`
` The Golden Land is...a wonderful place."`
`"Have you been there?"`
`"......Only for a little bit.`
` Though, even that was probably just a joke of Beatrice-sama's."`
`".........What's it like there?"`
`"Well,`
` ......it's a wonderful place.`
` ...I can't really explain it well.`
` It's like a world from a pleasant dream."`
`"A paradise-like place, with roses blooming all over and beautiful butterflies dancing about, or something like that?"`
`"...It's not a place with a tangible image like that.`
` It's really like the inside of a dream.`
` When you're there, it's very gentle, very peaceful, `
`...and you're allowed to sleep as long as you want, like when you wake up early on a day off, lying on a futon."`
`"...Sunlight comes in through the cracks in the curtains, and you think you'll have to wake up soon,`
` but then you realize it's your day off, and you can go back to sleep... It's a place where you can feel like that."`
`"I think it'd be wasted on me.`
` Waking up on accident even though it's your day off is something only you would do, Nee-san.`
` ......So?"`
`"Well,`
` when I was there, it was very satisfying and very calm.`
` When I returned to this world, even though I had just been there a second ago, I couldn't remember it well.`
` It's like when you can't remember a dream you were just having.`
` ...But I still remember that it was a very calm and quiet world."`
`"......That's it?`
` What the heck, that Golden Land she's always bragging about isn't anything great at all.`
` ...I thought it was a place where all your wishes come true."`
`"That's right.`
` It's a place where all your wishes will be granted.`
` ......Well, maybe that's not quite it.`
` It might be better to say it's a place where you won't wish for anything."`
`"...For example, Kanon-kun, if you were cold and wished you had a jacket, you'd be happy to be given one,`
` but if you were in a warm room to begin with, there wouldn't even be a reason to want a jacket, right?"`
`"...That's what the Golden Land is like.`
` There's no need to even wish for most wishes.`
` It's a world where everything is calm."`
`"You could even say it's a place that transcends the concept that having your wishes granted will bring happiness, ...a world released from everything."`
`"............`
`...It sounds somewhat like a religious world."`
`"And there, everything is equal.`
` Anything that can think is equal.`
` ...There are no Humans, furniture, nor witches.`
` ...There, I was equal to everyone.`
` There was no longer any need to feel ashamed that I was furniture."`
`"......It was honestly a happy world where all Humans, and even witches, were equal.`
` I can't really remember it well,`
` but I have the feeling that when I was there, I was equal even to Beatrice-sama, and we were good friends."`
`"......If that witch is there, it can't be much of a paradise.`
` ......So, you want to go to that Golden Land with George-sama.`
` How strange.`
` The Golden Land is a utopia where you can be pleased with everything, right?`
` Wouldn't you be content even if George-sama wasn't there?"`
`"............`
`...The Golden Land is very calm, peaceful, and everything is equal.`
` ...But actually, happiness alone is left out."`
`"It isn't a happy world?"`
`"Of course, just by being peaceful, calm, and equal, it's an incredibly happy world.`
` ...But I guess you could say that it's a world of zero, where you're released from all negative worries.`
` The human world is filled with negatives, so of course a zero world is incredibly happy, ...but it's still zero.`
` *giggle* What a luxurious problem to have."`
`"...It's something like this.`
` When you're nodding off on your quiet holiday morning,`
` ...if the person you love the most is next to you and holding your hand, then it can become an even greater, more wonderful happiness, ...something like that.`
` ...Sorry, your Nee-san is too dumb to be any good at analogies."`
`"...In other words,`
` to you, the greatest happiness would be reaching that world together with George-sama."`
`"Yes.`
` And surely, for you, it would be reaching that world together with Milady."`
`"We'll be released from our worries in a fair world...?`
` ......It's like some kind of strange religion.`
` I'm more worldly-minded.`
` I imagined a world where we would be given some magic medicine, and we could be reborn as Humans, or something more like that."`
`"......If you go, you'll understand.`
` If Beatrice-sama really is a fickle person, then surely some day, she'll let you get a glimpse of it too.`
` ...If so, then you'll be able to understand my analogy."`
`"..................`
`Well, I'm not holding my breath.`
` ...At any rate, it seems like game over for us this time already.`
` I'll hope for another chance."`
`"...You're right.`
` If we cling to any overambitious hopes, Beatrice-sama will take advantage of us.`
` ...It might be best to just stop thinking...and let fate take care of us."`
`"......We can just be simple chess pieces.`
` ...No matter what we think or don't think, we can't escape from the witch's chessboard.`
` Our role is now just to wait and see how we'll be tortured to death.`
` ...For us, the dream of the Golden Land is too empty."`
`".........You're...right.`
` ...Sorry..."`
`Kanon shrugged his shoulders, then told Shannon to leave him alone because she was in the way of his duty, distancing himself from her.`
`Realizing her thoughtlessness in bringing up such an inappropriate topic and instead hurting Kanon,`
` Shannon bit her lower lip and stared at the ground...`
`Shannon wouldn't bother him any more.`
`She went off and crouched down in a corner by herself.`
`"............Nn-"`
`At that moment, Kanon perked up.`
`It was like the ears of a cat when it reacts to a strange sound.`
`"What's wrong?"`
`"...Shh.`
` ......Krauss-sama, someone's coming."`
`"What?!"`
`They ended their conversation and strained their ears.`
`...For a while, they couldn't hear anything,`
` but eventually, they were able to hear the shuffling sounds of a large group of people walking...`
`"...So they've come."`
`"Time to pay the piper, or perhaps this is our first and last chance."`
`"......I shall talk to Kinzo-san.`
` ...I will try to somehow find out where this place is."`
`"We're counting on you.`
` ..............."`
`During the last phone call, Kyrie had asked what the time over at the guesthouse was.`
`...By doing that, Kyrie had learned that it was the same as her watch, and she had learned that their watches hadn't been set back.`
`It wasn't just the clocks on the walls in the guesthouse.`
`Several people's watches, including George's and Gohda's, had matched.`
`...If that was the case,`
` then it had only been a few minutes between the time of the massacre in the dining hall and the time they had been transported to the dungeon.`
`Not enough time had passed for them to be knocked out and carried away.`
`Then were those really pitfalls, meaning that this was the area directly under the dining hall...?`
`All that they could do was pray that Nanjo could find out where this was...`
`"...They're coming.`
` There's probably...four people.`
` ...The Master...and three of those who appeared in the dining hall."`
`"That's enough.`
` You come back here as well.`
` We'll deal with the rest."`
`"Shannon-chan, sorry, but can I have you sit by the phone?`
` Hide it with your skirt."`
`"Ah, ...yes...!"`
`The shuffling came close, ...and there was the sound of a large door being opened in the hallway.`
`The light they were apparently carrying illuminated the hall, stroking the walls with sharp, razor-like shadows.`
`And then, the light from the lantern they held illuminated the prisoners through the bars.`
`...The bars' sharp shadows divided them up lengthwise.`
`There were four silhouettes.`
`......It was Kinzo, ......Ronove, Virgilia, and Gaap.`
`"Silence, everyone.`
` Please welcome the Head of the Ushiromiya family, Lord Goldsmith."`
`"......Goldsmith?"`
`"It's Father's pen name.`
` It seems he always signs with it when writing those bizarre grimoires."`
`"'Kinzo' made English-style?`
` Shouldn't that be Gold Warehouse?"`
`"......Hahhahahahahahahahahaha.`
` What more is a warehouse than a place to keep things in?`
` However, I give birth to gold and use my craftsmanship to further increase its worth.`
` Don't you think 'smith' is much more fitting?"`
`"......True enough.`
` I apologize for butting in."`
`"Kinzo-san, `
`...just what is going on?`
` Where in the world is this...?"`
`"Oh, my friend,`
` can't you remember?`
` True, you may have never entered the prison, but you should remember walking through this corridor."`
`"......Huh, `
`......huh?`
` ......Y-You don't mean......"`
`"...Do you have an idea?"`
`"But, well, ......it is unthinkable.`
` ...Firstly, we fell through a pitfall and were locked up in here after only a few minutes...`
` ...Not only is the distance too great, that's physically impossible..."`
`"For a Human, right?`
` *giggle*."`
`"Father, ...is this the mansion?`
` To think that the mansion had a basement like this..."`
`"Krauuss,`
` wasn't there a place whose existence you all whispered of, and which you followed after me several times trying to find?`
` ......This is that place.`
` No, to be correct, this is its basement.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`'!s1`
`...of Kuwadorian...?!"`
`"...A splendid observation.`
` This is indeed the basement of Kuwadorian."`
`"Kuwadorian...`
` ...You don't mean...Father's rumored hidden mansion...?`
` It really exists...?"`
`"This mansion was constructed for the sole use of my beloved witch, Beatrice.`
` It's truly a shame that I cannot guide you to the above-ground sections, as it is such a beautiful and elegant mansion."`
`"......How lovely, just the two of them alone in a mansion with a prison like this.`
` I guess Father's tastes are a bit more than I can stomach."`
`"...Kyrie-san,`
` ...perhaps it would be wiser to refrain from such rude comments."`
`"*giggle*`
` But I agree.`
` ...If a mansion I was given had this kind of dungeon in it,`
` that'd shake me out of even a century-long love, and I'd take anything of value and run."`
`"Pu ku ku.`
` Oh my, so you don't have an interest in this kind of thing?`
` And here I was thinking you went head over heels for it."`
`"Heheh.`
` ......Of course I go head over heels.`
` Like if I get a collar or something for a birthday present.`
` ...But only if he's hot."`
`"Pu ku ku ku ku!"`
`"Silence!`
` ...Perhaps you could use a gag more than a collar right now."`
`"Oh, you have an interest in that too?`
` You sure aren't picky, Lia.`
` *giggle*..."`
`"D-Don't just go around shortening people's names on your own...!"`
`"Enough, you noisy women!`
` Are you telling me you'd like to be locked up in the same cell?"`
`"I-I apologize, Master...`
` This old body of mine would not be able to stand such a cold prison..."`
`Virgilia quickly apologized, but Gaap and Ronove merely laughed together.`
`It was like they thought they alone couldn't be imprisoned,`
` or else, that even if someone tried to imprison them, it would be pointless...`
`"A prison is a place from which the captured cannot escape.`
` That implies a strong will and love to not let them go for a lifetime.`
` It's not even worth speaking of love to a woman you could give up on if she ran away."`
`"A woman who makes you so insane that you don't want to let her escape, to the point of binding her in chains...`
` Because she was worthy of that, she was a love worth sacrificing my life for.`
` ......I will not ask you to understand."`
`"......No one can bind me, I will not be bound.`
` I don't want to be loved, I want to love.`
` I feel the same as Goldsmith.`
` That's why I understand the madness of your love."`
`"Love and madness are two sides of the same coin, or so they say.`
` How bothersome."`
`"......But learning where we are so easily was a big step.`
` We'll ask the details later, but it seems you know about this place, ...right, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"Y-Yes...`
` ...If that hallway is the underground passage beneath Kuwadorian, `
`...then if we go straight down it, it will become a long tunnel, `
`...and if we stay on that, we should be able to return to the mansion."`
`"...Then if we could just do something about these bars, we could go home."`
`"Father...`
` What are you planning to do with us?"`
`"As I have already declared, you will become sacrifices for the later twilights.`
` There are conveniently five people here.`
` Exactly enough hostages for the five gougings."`
`"...I see.`
` ...Then it's time for us to pay the piper?"`
`"Eventually.`
` That's not why I've come to visit you this time, so relax.`
` Besides, I believe I have said it already.`
` ...If one of my grandchildren is deemed suitable to inherent everything from me, then the ceremony will be called off.`
` In other words, your lives will be spared."`
`"...Wh-What are you planning to do to the children?"`
`"I shall give them a test.`
` A test to see if they are suitable to be the Successor or not.`
` If even one of them can surprise me, I'll call the ceremony off."`
`"......And if there isn't anyone suitable, `
`...what are you planning on doing with the children?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` There's no need to worry about that.`
` After all, you all will be sacrificed first.`
` How could anything that happens after that concern you?`
` Entrust your fates to your own children.`
` ...Your children, the embodiment of what you've born, taught and raised.`
` They should be the most suitable ones for you to entrust with your fate...!`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` Don't look so worried, Kraaauss...`
` Believe in the daughter that you brag is worth ten billion yen.`
` Hehheheh, hehhahahahahaha...!!"`
`"......Exactly.`
` Children are the embodiment of their parents.`
` It's fitting that we put our fates in their hands.`
` That applies even to you, Father, right?"`
`"...Hmph, hahhahahaha!`
` This girl has guts, what a waste on Rudolf!`
` Wahhahahahaha...!!"`
`"...Kyrie-san, ...it would be best not to aggravate him too much."`
`"I agree.`
` Let's bear with it for now..."`
`"That's right...`
` ...After all, we're just fish on the chopping board.`
` There's nothing we can do now."`
`"Hah, though you can insult me with such vigor.`
` I don't dislike that kind of woman, see?`
` Beatrice was like that too, in the beginning.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"......Master,`
` perhaps we should get back to the main topic.`
` We've been off track for a while now."`
`"Ah yes, there was that. Sorry, sorry, my friend.`
` Well then, back to the main event.`
` For that, I've prepared a phone.`
` ...Shannon, how clever of you.`
` You don't have to hide it any longer.`
` That's something I arranged for.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"M-My apologies..."`
`"............"`
`Shannon quickly withdrew herself, and the telephone was revealed...`
`"Krauss,`
` call the grandchildren in the guesthouse.`
` Tell them of the test...and of the start of my trial."`
`Ronove motioned for Krauss to pick up the receiver.`
`".........And if I say no?"`
`"Hohoh, and why do you think you're in a position to negotiate?`
` If you don't make the call, then the grandchildren won't even be given a chance.`
` The Ushiromiya family will end here.`
` And I'll sacrifice you all right away!!"`
`"You'd be lucky to become sacrifices right away.`
` ...Don't you think it'd be more painful to watch the children get sacrificed first, before your very eyes...?"`
`"...Ga...ap.`
` The Master is the one who decides the sacrifice order.`
` Don't say things on your own."`
`"Lia, you just tried to shorten my name, didn't you?"`
`"I-I did not!`
` And I told you not to shorten other people's names on your own...!"`
`"...Women truly are..."`
`"Noisy. Pu ku ku!"`
`The clinic that Nanjo had opened and later passed on to his son still existed on Niijima.`
`This aged doctor was Nanjo's son, but the atmosphere about him was very different.`
`"I am truly sorry to say this after you have come all this way, but I have nothing in particular to tell you."`
`Nanjo's son said that very indifferently.`
`"...After the accident on that island was taken up by the broadcasts in a most indiscreet manner,`
` even my father, who was Mr. Ushiromiya's doctor and friend, was focused upon by many with a wholly regrettable interest.`
` All of it was without proof, and they even managed to defile all of my father's previous achievements.`
` I still feel a great deal of resentment because of that."`
`"......I think that's understandable.`
` The same thing happened to me.`
` I had to put up with it constantly since I was six."`
`"True.`
` My apologies."`
`The doctor finally remembered that Ange was also a victim who had been exposed to the same curious eyes as he had been.`
`"In that case, you can probably understand why I don't want to have anything to do with that incident.`
` ...That was an unfortunate accident.`
` The only ones who want to make a fuss about it being a crime are those irresponsible TV shows and magazines.`
` I am more than fed up with their attitude."`
`......Nanjo had been bathed with attention for being one of Ushiromiya Kinzo's few friends.`
`Because of that, there was probably an aggressive and persistent rush among the Witch Hunters and the press to use Nanjo's son as well, a surviving relative, as a source of information.`
`...The doctor went on and on, criticizing the press indignantly.`
`"I really understand how you feel.`
` For a person like me, who was observed even in her personal life,`
` and whose privacy, likeness, and even human rights might have been violated,`
` it's really easy to pick up on the anger of someone in your position."`
`"......And for that very reason, I want to know, more than anything else, what in the world happened in the incident that so thoroughly ruined my life.`
` So I came here.`
` ......I'm a related party just like you.`
` Not a magazine columnist or an interviewer.`
` Please, don't get the wrong idea."`
`"I didn't come to do this for fun.`
` ...Quit looking down on me.`
` If we're gonna argue over whose life was most screwed up by that incident, you're no match for me."`
`"......Nng, ..."`
`Ange spoke sharply.`
`The doctor, who hadn't imagined that he would be talked back to in such a forceful manner, couldn't help but fall silent.`
`...From Ange's perspective, the doctor really was whining over nothing.`
`She really didn't want to be looked down upon.`
`It was about time to let him understand how many days had passed for her before arriving on this island.`
`The doctor realized that he'd said something wrong and remained silent for a while, looking uncomfortable.`
`"I know it's probably painful to remember what happened at the time, but if there's anything you do know, please tell me no matter what it is.`
` Of course, I'll keep quiet about it."`
`"I visited here today to bring some resolution to my life.`
` ...I'm 18.`
` That incident took away 12 years of my life.`
` And it'll probably keep on taking.`
` ...Since that day when I was six years old, I've remained shut away in darkness.`
` Are you saying that despite that, I still don't have a right to know...?"`
`"......No, ...how rude of me.`
` It seems that since all the others who came were ill-natured folk, I instinctively put up my guard.`
` I apologize for my rudeness.`
` ...I understand.`
` If you'll swear not to breathe a word of this to anyone, I'll tell you everything."`
`"Thanks, Doctor.`
` ...Then if you would.`
` Please tell me anything you can."`
`"...As you know, my father was not only Mr. Ushiromiya's head physician, but his friend through the game of chess.`
` That relationship was very long, stretching back to the time Mr. Ushiromiya moved to Rokkenjima."`
`"Just how close were they?"`
`"Very close, it seems.`
` It seems that their connection through chess led my father to stay at Mr. Ushiromiya's mansion quite often.`
` ...Although I may not be one to talk, Mr. Ushiromiya was extremely moody.`
` And my father was an exceedingly magnanimous man, who excelled at interacting with humans like him.`
` It's not hard to imagine that he was a rare friend for the isolated Mr. Ushiromiya."`
`"That day was the day of the family conference.`
` ...At the Ushiromiya family conference, the inheritance and how it would be distributed were rigorously discussed,`
` making it almost like a financial conference.`
` Which means Doctor Nanjo must have gained a trust so great that he was asked to attend even that, right...?"`
`"My father was a simple doctor,`
` so I cannot imagine that he was in a position to advise on the distribution of wealth for a massively rich family like the Ushiromiya family.`
` He was most likely called there to assist with Mr. Ushiromiya's health, because it was not at its best at the time.`
` ...As Kinzo's close friend, I'm sure my father would have kept his mouth shut, and that he was trusted not to leak the secrets of the family conference."`
`"...Wasn't Ushiromiya Kinzo in very bad health at the time?`
` Were there any medical charts left behind?"`
`"Perhaps he brought the medical charts with him on the day of the accident.`
` I'm afraid to say that the entire folder of Mr. Ushiromiya's medical charts has been lost.`
` He was my father's patient, so I do not know the details."`
`"Around the time of the incident,`
` did anything strange happen?"`
`"......`
`...Yes, there was one thing.`
` ...However, it seems exceedingly likely to invite misunderstandings, so I very much do not wish to discuss it."`
`"...What is it?`
` Please tell me."`
`For a while, the doctor beat around the bush,`
` but after saying that much, he wouldn't be able to fool Ange by dodging the subject.`
`He eventually gave in, and after making Ange swear herself to secrecy again, told her...`
`"The truth is, several days after that accident, I received something by mail at my home."`
`"......By mail?"`
`"It was very curious.`
` The sender was made out to be me, but I had no memory of it.`
` Someone had faked my name and sent it."`
`"The destination was Rebun Island in Hokkaido.`
` ...Excluding the Northern Territories, it is at the northernmost tip of Japan.`
` The recipient was apparently a residence on Rebun Island, but......`
`the name was my father's."`
`"...However, it seemed that there was a problem with the destination address, so it was stamped as Address Unknown...`
`and returned to the sender, 'me'."`
`It was...truly a strange tale.`
`Nanjo's son's name was written as the sender.`
`...However, he said that he hadn't mailed the letter.`
`In short, that meant someone had faked his name and sent it.`
`The destination was 'Nanjo Terumasa', on Hokkaido's Rebun Island.`
`But the lot number written on it didn't exist,`
` so the local post office had been unable to deliver it and instead sent it back to 'the sender, Nanjo's son'...`
`"...What was inside?"`
`"............`
`...I do ask that you keep silent about this.`
` It is extremely troublesome to me as well.`
` And even so, I cannot throw it away..."`
`The doctor stood up and faced a bookshelf.`
`There was packed a group of dictionaries that could only have been ornamental,`
` meant to make it very clear that the owner was an intellectual.`
`When he pulled several volumes out from there, a large, brown envelope peeked out from behind them.`
`He took that out and tossed it onto the desk.`
`It had been been carefully sealed with cellophane tape,`
` and its faded color and dryness made it clear that it had been sealed 12 years ago...`
`"I ask most solemnly for your silence on this matter."`
`Being so persistent that it was annoying, the doctor removed the seal with a paper knife.`
`...Then, when he tilted the envelope, an already opened mail envelope spilled out.`
`The envelope had a weight to it, hinting that there was something other than a letter inside.`
`......The recipient...was certainly Nanjo Terumasa.`
`Just seeing that...was a huge shock.`
`Following that incident, Nanjo's corpse had not been found, and he had eventually been treated as dead after going missing under extraordinary circumstances.`
`...And despite that, this letter addressed to a Nanjo in Hokkaido existed.`
`One could almost take this as a sign that he had faked his own death and escaped to Hokkaido.`
`"...Was Doctor Nanjo really in Hokkaido?`
` Or else, was there another person with the same first and last names in Hokkaido?"`
`"If my father had somehow escaped from the accident and lived on in Hokkaido,`
` that would have made us of his family very happy, regardless of the circumstances.`
` I also thought of that possibility at first.`
` ...However, the envelope's destination address does not exist.`
` In short, this envelope was mail that had no way of reaching him."`
`"......Is there a possibility that the sender miswrote the correct address?"`
`"Of course, I cannot deny it.`
` However, judging from the residence's house number, I find that hard to believe."`
`'!s1`
`Hokkaido, `
`Rebun Island, `
`Rebun County, `
`Rebun City, `
`1-2-34-567.`
` ........."`
`Up until Rebun City, it's fine.`
`...But I just couldn't wipe away the feeling that the sequential number after it, 1234567, was a little insincere.`
`It felt like a fake number that some kid had made up.`
`"They probably wrote a nonsense number that clearly didn't exist.`
` I think it's natural to assume that, from the very beginning, this envelope was sent to a nonexistent residence to which`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~it had no chance of being delivered~ib~`
`."`
`If the destination address doesn't exist, mail is generally returned to the sender.`
`But even in the case of an incomplete address, the local post office will often courteously, and to the best of its ability, `
`research to find whether the sender's intended destination exists.`
`When they still can't find it, the mail is sometimes returned after an investigation of several days.`
`It seemed that the same thing had happened with this envelope, and the stamp was postmarked on October 3.`
`It was postmarked on Niijima.`
`Niijima was a long way away from Rebun Island.`
`On top of that, the destination was also nonsensical.`
`...It had taken more than a week for the mail to be returned.`
`...In other words, there was probably a high chance that having the envelope returned to the sender after an unfixed amount of time...`
`had been the goal from the very beginning.`
`Why do something like that......?`
`Even before asking what it was that had been sent, this envelope was already wrapped in mystery...`
`".........And inside it?"`
`"Go ahead."`
`After getting the doctor's permission, I tilted the already opened envelope.`
`From the inside came a small, folded letter, and a small key with a number plate attached.`
` Then, a magnetic card slid out.`
`A112 was engraved on the key's number plate.`
`...I didn't know what it meant.`
`The magnetic card was pitch black and had gold characters engraved in it.`
`'Members' was written in English.`
`The jet-black, gold-lettered card design made it feel like something very high-class.`
`...But of course, I didn't have a clue what kind of card it was just from that.`
`...I unfolded the letter.`
`Its contents were extremely brief, and only the following was written:`
`07151129.`
`Also written was the name of a certain massive bank known throughout Japan, as well as the words 'Central Branch'.`
`...That was all.`
`"And this is......?"`
`"......`
`......It's a card, a key, and a PIN for a safe-deposit box.`
` And it wasn't a normal safe-deposit box either.`
` It was an unsettling one, which was apparently reserved only for special clients."`
`After he finished putting his affairs in order following his father's funeral, he had visited the bank.`
`...PIN and key and card.`
`There was no doubt that something of great importance was kept there,`
` and he had been naturally curious about what it might be.`
`At first, he hadn't known what to do.`
`...The card wasn't something he'd owned in the first place.`
`When he mustered up his courage and showed the card to a bank clerk, he was then switched to a clerk of clearly high status...and was guided to a large vault on the fourth basement.`
`The security on the way there was strict.`
`The doctor had himself stored valuable items such as real estate transcripts in safe-deposit boxes before,`
` but this was something on a whole different level...`
`"...Unlike the procedure at the deposit box I had been using,`
` with this system, as long as you had a card, a PIN, and a key, you didn't need to have your identity confirmed.`
` ...But, anyway, I was frightened at how imposing that secure vault was.`
` ...And I wondered what kind of shady objects might await me that had to be stored in a place like this."`
`"......And then?"`
`"When I passed the card through the reader, I was asked to input the PIN.`
` And, after that eight-digit number was input and authenticated, I was permitted access to the vault.`
` ...It was an incredible scene.`
` A world like something from a sci-fi movie.`
` The massive, dimly-lit silver room was covered with doors to safes."`
`He had entered that room along with the clerk.`
`It seems that as soon as the card was read, the vaults he had a right to were determined,`
` so that safes he could open were lit with a green light, while those he couldn't open were lit with a red one.`
`"A112 was one of those safes that were marked.`
` ...By the way, there were several other safes marked with a green lamp besides that one.`
` I think there were at least 20.`
` There might even have been more in the other corner.`
` ...In any event, I only had the key to A112.`
` I had no way of checking the contents of the other safes."`
`As the clerk watched, the doctor had unlocked and opened the safe.`
`When he did, a safe drawer like a large cabinet had opened,`
` ...and an expensive-looking duralumin case peeked out...`
`That was carried into a separate room, where for the first time, the clerk left, and he was introduced to the contents...`
`"And the contents were......?"`
`".........`
`......Cash."`
`"Cash?`
` How much?"`
`"I have heard that a pack of one million yen in fresh banknotes is precisely one centimeter thick.`
` Since those were packed tightly into a duralumin case of such a size, `
`...there was probably 100 million in total.`
` I don't know, because I didn't count.`
` I didn't even touch it with my hands.`
` I realized at once.`
` This was dangerous money."`
`It isn't normal to store a whole hundred million yen in cash in a case in a safe like that.`
`...It's much easier to deal with if you put it into an account and turn it into numbers.`
`When someone is unable to do that, then it's clear that there's something wrong with that cash...`
`"...My mind went blank, and I instantly realized that I mustn't get involved."`
`"So, you didn't use it at all?"`
`"Correct.`
` I locked it back up just as I'd found it, returned it to the original safe, and left.`
` ...I have thought about throwing away that key and card, but I don't know what will happen.`
` For that reason, I have been hiding it in the back of this bookcase for a full 12 years.`
` ......I still do not know what kind of money that was."`
`"...Could I borrow this envelope?"`
`"No.`
` Please just view it here."`
`"......`
`...Understood.`
` Then, if you'll excuse me.`
` There's something I want to investigate."`
`I took Onee-chan's grimoire from the knapsack I had set down.`
`...Then I opened to the page with the paragraph Beatrice had written to Onee-chan...and compared the handwriting on both...`
`"............"`
`......There was no mistake about the characteristic handwriting.`
` The one who had sent this hundred million yen in cash......was Beatrice herself...`
`But, ......what is it...?`
`Something's bugging me...`
` What is it......?`
` What could it be......?`
`"......Y-Yeah.`
` I'm pretty sure I got something like that in the mail.`
` Hey Ma, where'd you put that?!"`
`The same envelope and contents had been sent to Kumasawa's son, who had once lived with her.`
`But he had been very busy in the days since, and seemed to have forgotten about it while running around all over the place.`
`However, its strange contents had apparently stayed in his memory, and he remembered as soon as Ange mentioned it to him...`
`After a bit of a wait,`
` his thin-lipped wife found the envelope, complaining that he always forgot where he put things right away...`
`The modus operandi for the sender and recipient was the same as Nanjo's son's.`
`The sender was made out to be Kumasawa's son, and the recipient was Kumasawa Chiyo.`
`And the destination address was in the Okinawa Prefecture.`
`Okinawa Prefecture, Yaeyama County, Yonaguni City, 1-2-34-567.`
`Yonaguni Island was at the western-most tip of Japan.`
`And the lot name was the exact same sequential number that had apparently been chosen without much care.`
`...Now it was certain.`
`This envelope was definitely sent with the goal of having it be returned to the sender.`
`Its contents were exactly the same.`
`A letter with the PIN and the bank's main branch written on it.`
`A magnetic card.`
` A key with an attached number plate.`
`The inscription on the number plate was A113.`
`...The number right after the one on the key that had been sent to Nanjo.`
`Most likely, inside the vault was the same kind of duralumin case, packed with a hundred million yen in cash...`
`"...I get the feeling my dead mother sent it to me from beyond the grave.`
` Don't really get what's inside, and it's creepy, so I just left it alone all this time, and totally forgot about it until today."`
`"...So, you know what this is, girl?`
` Could it be that the same kind of thing came to your place...?"`
`"............Ah."`
`"...What is it, Ange-sama?"`
`『Uryu, ...is it a headache? A headache...?!』`
`"......Sorry, my head hurts...`
` ...I've got it... ......I know..."`
`『What do you mean, you know...?』`
`"You don't mean...`
`...this envelope...came to your place too, Ange-sama...?"`
`......I've remembered...`
` ...I've remembered...!!`
`A strange envelope was also sent to me...12 years ago...!!`
`After losing my entire family, I was depressed.`
`...But it was a really strange thing to come in the mail, so I still had a faint memory of it.`
`It was a strange letter, which I had no memory of sending, but which had me as the sender.`
`I forget the destination address, but the named recipient had been Ushiromiya Rudolf.`
`My father.`
`I remember how disturbed I was when I got a letter I thought was from Father, opened it up,`
` and found a key and a card that I didn't really understand.`
`I felt let down and threw it away somewhere, I think...`
`Where did I put that envelope?`
`I probably lost it somewhere in the chaos that followed.`
`By now, I have no way of checking its contents.`
`However, I have a general idea.`
`...I'm sure the contents were the same.`
`Without a doubt, there had been a key, a card, and a note with a PIN inside the envelope...`
`"...Beatrice...`
` ...What was she trying to do here...?`
` So, did she hand out this stupid money to all the surviving relatives?`
` ......I won't forgive her...for mocking them even after their deaths......"`
`『Uryu, ...uryu, ...Ange......』`
`Sakutarou acted nervously.`
`...As I looked at his worrying face, my agitation began to cool off bit by bit...`
`"I'm sorry...`
` My hatred of Beatrice isn't anything new.`
` ...I was just surprised and angry to find out that I had a connection with the witch already...at the age of six on that day..."`
`"......For the past 12 years,`
` you've been constantly enslaved by Beatrice-sama's curse.`
` ...This might be proof of that a curse.`
` But please, hang in there.`
` Breaking through that was supposed to be part of the goal of this journey."`
`"That's right...`
` Just letting the blood rise to my head won't get me anywhere.`
` Got to think calmly.`
` ......What's going on?`
` What's the meaning of handing out a hundred million yen to the relatives?`
` Is she trying to provoke us...?`
` Damn that Beatrice......"`
`『Ange, ...calm down...`
` ...Uryu...』`
`As Sakutaro buried his head in my stomach, he urged me to stay calm.`
`...I took another deep breath...and started thinking.`
`"......I wonder if this envelope was sent to support the theory that Beatrice was behind that crime."`
`"It was postmarked right before the family conference.`
` And it was intentionally set up so that it would be sent back after some time."`
`『...They wanted it to arrive after the incident, is that it...?』`
`"Yeah.`
` That's what it implies.`
` ......But it raises a few questions.`
` Why use such an uncertain method?"`
`"Uncertain?"`
`"Yes.`
` After all, no one could even guess at how many days it would take for the mail to return before you used this trick.`
` ...Normally, you couldn't even guess at the amount of time it would take for the receiving post office to do their research, determine that the recipient was unknown, and return it."`
`『Yeah, now that you mention it...`
` It'd be more dependable if they just set an arrival date and mailed it that way...`
` Uryu...』`
`"...Maybe, but still,`
` if they mailed it the day before, then no matter how quickly it returned, it would probably arrive Monday or later.`
` I wonder if they wanted to make it seem like a letter from the dead."`
`"...A letter from the dead, you say?`
` ...You're right.`
` It surprised me, and it made me feel bad.`
` ...Some mail with my dead family's name written on the outside in large letters...`
`was thrown into the mailbox with an ominous label attached.`
` ...However, it doesn't really make sense to me.`
` I would've mailed it to arrive on a specified day.`
` I just can't understand why someone would allow the uncertainty of it arriving on a day other than the one they imagined."`
`『.........Uryu.`
` ...But it really does sound like Beato to me.』`
`"Huh?`
` You...know about Beato?"`
`『...Well, I only talked with her a little.`
` ...Still, I can pretty much accept that Beato would do something like this.`
` ......Can't you imagine that happening too, Mammon?`
` Beato likes pranks like this, right?』`
`"......`
`......Yeah, that might be true.`
` ...I wouldn't put it past Beatrice-sama to try a vicious prank like a letter from the dead."`
`『No, that's not all.`
` ......Beatrice would find it more interesting to do it through an uncertain method, instead of one that was absolutely certain.』`
`"......She would find an uncertain method...interesting...?"`
`I remembered Maria onee-chan's diary...`
` ...It had described playing with Beatrice very often.`
`During those times, Beato sometimes played pranks on the adult relatives with Maria.`
`But those pranks always had a touch of witch aesthetics.`
`Which was......that they were more interesting when they were uncertain.`
`One day, Maria onee-chan and Beato decided use a wind-up minicar she had brought for a prank.`
`It was a popular toy at the time, and if you made the minicar back up, it would wind up the spring in the tires, and when you let go, it would race forwards.`
`They had wound up that minicar and set it behind a milk jug.`
`...In other words, the prank was that, if you lifted the milk jug, the minicar would jump forwards and surprise whoever did it.`
`Hoping that someone would get caught in this prank, Onee-chan and Beato had watched the adults from the shadows for their whole teatime.`
`They were looking forward to seeing someone get caught by it, but no one moved the trap milk jug, and the trap ended in a misfire...`
`When Onee-chan had then muttered 'We should've put it somewhere where it would've definitely caught someone',`
` Beato apparently said this:`
`"The most interesting and thrilling traps...are those where you don't know who'll get caught, or even if anyone will get caught at all."`
`...It's probably true that you wouldn't get this kind of excitement from a trap that would certainly go off.`
`...Similar accounts occurred in multiple places,`
` making it possible to guess that the witch called Beatrice had a fickle character and loved a random thrill...`
`A fickle person is very hard to deal with.`
`I can't spin the chessboard around...to find out what that witch from 12 years ago was planning.`
`As Ange examined these, her gaze darted from place to place.`
`Then, she suddenly showed interest in the wall.`
`There, several framed pictures were hung.`
`Many of them were commemorative photos from when the relatives of the Kumasawa family gathered or went somewhere to play, and Kumasawa was in several.`
`...And she still wore a smile that made it so you could almost hear her lighthearted 'hohohoh' laugh.`
`...It's part of my distant memory, but I definitely remember that she was this sort of cheerful old lady...`
`"Did you notice anything different about Kumasawa-san in the days leading up to the incident...?"`
`"Nope.`
` She looked the same as ever.`
` ...The family conference put her on edge, so she was always grumbling about how tough it was."`
`"......?`
` ...What's this?"`
`Among the several frames, there was one that had something other than a picture of people in it.`
`It was a picture of an enlarged relief of a door from a Western-style house or something.`
`...You couldn't see any interesting subject in particular, which actually bugged me a bit as I wondered why anyone had gone to all the trouble of taking it.`
`As I got closer, I realized that some characters had been written with a pen.`
`"...Oh yeah, that's a photo I got when Mother's belongings were distributed.`
` I think it probably has something to do with that 'Legend of the Gold' thing."`
`"The witch's epitaph, you mean?`
` It was whispered that it pointed out the location of the hidden 10 tons of gold...`
` ...So, Kumasawa-san tried to solve it too.`
` But this isn't the epitaph.`
` It's the first time I've seen it."`
`There was an arch above the Western-style door, and that's where the relief was.`
` English words were engraved there, and that seemed to be what the picture was focused on.`
`The pen writing appeared to be a translation into Japanese.`
`".........`
`'This door is opened only at a probability of a quadrillion to one.`
` You will be blessed only at a probability of a quadrillion to one'.`
` ...I don't recognize it.`
` Nothing like this ever showed up in the epitaph or Onee-chan's diary."`
`"In Mother's belongings, there were quite a few photos and notes that looked like her trying to solve the riddle of the epitaph.`
` Mother was actually surprisingly fond of that kind of thing.`
` And there was that rumor that 10 tons of gold bars were hidden somewhere.`
` It's no surprise she got so absorbed by it."`
`In both Maria onee-chan's diary and in her grimoire, there was a description of the witch's epitaph.`
`It had talked about how it was a ceremony to open the door to the Golden Land, Beatrice's resurrection ceremony, Beatrice's succession ceremony.`
` On and on.`
`Maybe the most interesting one was the last part, about it being a succession ceremony.`
`According to Beatrice,`
` if you were able to solve the witch's epitaph,`
` you would receive not only the 10 tons of gold and the Ushiromiya family inheritance,`
` but her own magical power and name, as well as the title of Golden Witch.`
`Among the Ushiromiya family household at the time, the witch's epitaph was thought of as a difficult quiz, which the Family Head, Kinzo, had arranged for to choose his successor.`
`But with the Mariage Sorcière interpretation, the questioner was Beatrice herself,`
` and she had posed the question in part to choose her successor.`
`...There were slight discrepancies in the details of the two interpretations.`
`Either way, its ominous contents brought to mind a bloody serial murder,`
` and both of the message bottles drew a tale of a crime following that pattern.`
`If I could solve the witch's epitaph now, 12 years later, I wonder if I could expose some plot made back then...`
`I tried to solve it many times myself, but I never did have a clue what it meant.`
`It seems that many Witch Hunters tried as well.`
`I also found theories like the La Plata theory and the Enoura theory in certain books.`
`However, neither of these theories were conclusive...`
`"Are there any other materials?"`
`"I think so, but they were all split up between my siblings.`
` I don't have a clue who has what.`
` Sorry."`
`"......Just reading this English text that Kumasawa-san took a picture of, it gives the impression that this was a forbidden door that was rarely opened.`
` ...But where in the mansion is it, I wonder?`
` Judging by the lighting, it looks like it's outside.`
` ...I wonder if Kumasawa-san thought that the gold might be hidden in there."`
`"Who knows.`
` Either way, I do wonder where in the Rokkenjima mansion it was.`
` ...I hate to say it, but there wasn't enough money in Mother's bank account to make me think she found the gold.`
` Uhahahaha, she probably didn't find it after all."`
`...The Golden Witch, Beatrice, gave 10 tons of gold to Kinzo.`
`Which meant that the witch was the true owner of the gold.`
`Beatrice was the owner of all the vast fortune of the Ushiromiya family.`
`The witch holding this vast wealth had massacred the humans on Rokkenjima on that day,`
` ...sending large amounts of money to the surviving relatives like it was a game.`
`...Like hell it's a letter from the dead.`
`This is a desecration of the dead.`
`I was once again convinced.`
`...When my family died on that island that day, they didn't go to heaven.`
`They're being trapped by the witch even now...and are being desecrated and tormented for all eternity...`
`The last place Ange visited...`
`was a store in the region between the housing district and the retail stores, with a signboard saying 'Marufuku Sleep Shop'...`
`There lived the man who had been the boat captain of the ferryboat to Rokkenjima at the time.`
`...Even he, who had once lived as a man of the sea, had retired after contracting a serious illness,`
` and was now taken care of at the house of his son and his son's wife...`
`"I remember it veeery well...!`
` You were still about this small.`
` Look how you've grown...!`
` And...it must have been very tough on you.`
` I know very well how you must feel...!"`
`The former boat captain was in such high spirits that you couldn't really tell why he had retired in the first place.`
`His memory seemed clear too, and he could remember the events of more than a decade ago well, apparently even about how Ange had been at the time.`
`The way he chatted on was very helpful for Ange,`
` ...but at the same time, he also remembered the final family conference very well,`
` and the fact that he remembered even details like Battler's 'fall fall madness' on the boat was actually painful for her.`
`It had been so back then as well, but even now, there was no public way to cross to Rokkenjima.`
`It was necessary to make an individual request to an owner of a boat to make the voyage.`
`I'd been unable to arrange for a boat to Rokkenjima,`
` so if he refused me, such a voyage would probably become hopeless...`
`"I getcha.`
` It won't be easy to find a boat eager to go to that island.`
` ...By now, there are even some who call it by its old name, Akujikishima, instead of Rokkenjima.`
` It's understandable why the sailors around here would turn down your request."`
`From the start, fishermen had feared Rokkenjima as an island of misfortune.`
`And because of that incident 12 years ago, this fear had reached a peak...`
`They respected the sea, feared it, and revered it.`
`There were almost no sailors who would try to take a boat to the cursed island.`
`Because of that, most of the Witch Hunters were unable to cross over to Rokkenjima...`
`and were limited to taking a trip around the island.`
`...Ironically, this had caused the sense of mystery surrounding Rokkenjima to increase even more, `
`which had resulted in the propagation of the bizarre witch stories they loved so much...`
`"......Would you take me in your boat?"`
`"Yep.`
` They're supposed to give it back to me just for tomorrow.`
` Though it seems its engine has been in a pretty bad mood lately.`
` I'll knock it into shape!"`
`The former boat captain promised that tomorrow, he would go back to his previous job and take his boat out to Rokkenjima.`
`Now, my method of transport to Rokkenjima is ensured.`
`This is probably all I can do on Niijima.`
`All that's left...is tomorrow.`
`On Rokkenjima, ...I'll reach the final destination of a journey that stretches back 12 years.`
`『Isn't that great...?`
` This way, it looks like you'll be able to go to the island...』`
`"It sure does.`
` ...I'd heard that it would be hard to find a boat, so the boat captain's helpfulness really saved me."`
`"......Although it may not be the same as it was for you, Ange-sama,`
` I'm sure the incident 12 years ago has been a thorn for the boat captain as well, one that he still hasn't been able to pull out."`
`『...Uryu.`
` ...Even the boat captain wasn't able to sort out his feelings.`
` This whole time...』`
`"That's probably true.`
` ...If that guy had taken his boat out on October 5 as promised, there's a chance that he could've saved a lot of people.`
` If he hadn't been hesitant to go out just because of a little wind..."`
`『Uryu, ...you shouldn't say things like that...`
` I'm sure that's pained the boat captain constantly until today...』`
`Apparently, they truly had been right in the middle of a typhoon on October 5.`
`According to the boat captain, he had known for certain that they'd be trapped by the typhoon if they headed to Rokkenjima on October 4.`
`But the family had been very persistent about the date of their conference, which had been determined beforehand.`
`...It was only natural.`
` All of the relatives had been very busy at the time, and they came to the family conference only after arranging their schedules beforehand.`
`It was probably a situation where they couldn't easily push it back to the next week just because a typhoon was approaching.`
`...It wasn't the boat captain's fault.`
`But perhaps you could say that he wasn't so irresponsible that he could place the blame wholly on the typhoon.`
`Certainly, just as these two said, there's no doubt that the boat captain has been dragging the events of 12 years ago along with him this whole time.`
`...And, by taking me, the last member of the Ushiromiya line, to the island,`
` and bringing me back safely, he might be trying to find some resolution for his past...`
`"The boat is supposed to return just after noon.`
` I'll guide you to Rokkenjima after that, so we should arrive before evening.`
` It's an island without electricity or lights.`
` You won't be able to stay long.`
` ...Will you be satisfied with a landing that short?"`
`"......`
`There's nothing that would make me more satisfied by staying longer.`
` I'm grateful just to have you take me there."`
`"Yep, don't mention it.`
` If I hadn't parted with my boat, I'd be able to guide you to the island as much as you liked, without being stingy..."`
`It's not like I have a goal of doing something in particular on Rokkenjima.`
`So, I'll be there during the evening...`
`...The evening, which straddles the two different worlds of day and night, seemed almost like a borderline between this world and the next...`
`or possibly, 1998 and 1986,`
` and it felt like the most fitting time to visit Rokkenjima.`
`...It's not like I have anything in particular to do there.`
`Just staying there for a few hours should be enough for me to find some closure.`
`At that time, there was a small knock on the paper sliding door, and Amakusa stuck his head in, tapping his watch.`
`I nodded back and told him about how I had succeeded in reserving a boat for tomorrow.`
`"That's great.`
` ...It's about time for us to go.`
` We'll be counting on you tomorrow, Captain."`
`"Sure, leave it to me!`
` I've heard all about what you guys've gone through.`
` I also watched the talk shows at the time...and was disgusted by the people who stirred up that incident just for fun.`
` I'll help out any way I can."`
`"Thank you very much.`
` ...Then we'll see you noon tomorrow.`
` Umm, here.`
` The fare for the boat."`
`Ange took a wrapped wad of ten-thousand yen bills from her pocket.`
`The boat captain should have noticed its thickness as well,`
` but he paid it absolutely no interest and shook his head.`
`"...I'm grateful to you.`
` This is a sign from the heavens.`
` I've been given a final chance to take you to Rokkenjima and bring you back safely.`
` Now, I'll finally be able to finish the final job Kinzo-san entrusted me with.`
` So I'm grateful to you.`
` I got more than enough money from Kinzo-san back then.`
` I can't accept yours."`
`".........Thank you very much."`
`"Watch your step on the stairs.`
` It's steep."`
`...I went down the steep staircase that was the exact opposite of 'accessible'.`
`It was getting hard to believe that there was actually a chest of drawers and a TV in the room upstairs.`
`Most of the first floor was a bedding store, with many futons piled up on each other.`
`We weaved our way through the cramped futon shop.`
`After cautiously checking around outside, Amakusa dashed out first and started up the car.`
`"My grandchild's room is empty.`
` I really wouldn't mind if you stayed there.`
` As you see, we've got plenty of extra futons."`
`"Thanks a lot for the offer.`
` ...But this way, even if the unexpected happens, you won't be bothered."`
`"......I don't know the details, but it seems you've been caught up in a lot of trouble.`
` There's a rumor that some suspicious people are searching for someone.`
` That wouldn't happen to be you, would it?"`
`".........`
`...Who knows."`
`Ange played dumb, but it looked as though the boat captain had guessed.`
`"My job is to take guests to Rokkenjima...and bring them back again.`
` ...That job was put on hold 12 years ago, and it still hasn't ended.`
` So, thanks to you, I'll finally be able to finish it."`
`"........."`
`"So listen.`
` ......Let me finish this job, okay?`
` Do you understand me?"`
`".........`
`...Yeah.`
` It's not like I'm going there to die."`
`But part of me does feel that, if I could die on that island, I'd surely be able to go to where my family is...`
`I've finally become aware of it.`
`...I might have been planning...to die on that island.`
`I might have come all this way, heading towards Rokkenjima, in search of a place to die.`
`The boat captain had guessed that as well.`
`That's why he repeatedly told me not to die.`
`"......Yeah, I won't die.`
` I promise.`
` ......After all,`
` I'm still not sure if there's any reason why I need to go to Rokkenjima."`
`"No, I'm sure there's a reason.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` Even if there isn't one for you, ...there is one for ~ib~them~ib~.`
` The island called you.`
` That's why you came here."`
`"......That might...be true.`
` ...I might...have been called."`
`I was called.`
` For what reason?`
` For them.`
`Father.`
` Mother.`
` Battler onii-chan.`
`...And, Maria onee-chan.`
`......Or maybe, the Golden Witch.`
`Beatrice.`
`What is on Rokkenjima?`
`And what will I achieve?`
`Even though tomorrow is finally almost here, I still haven't been able to understand my own mission...`
`There was the sound of a car stopping in front of the store, and a short honk could be heard.`
`"Then I'll see you tomorrow.`
` If you'll excuse me..."`
`"Yep."`
`Winding between the stacks of futons in the cramped store, I was about to go outside.`
`......Then, my feet stopped.`
`"...What is it?"`
`'!s1`
`Umm, `
`...what is that...?"`
`"Hmm?`
` That?`
` What?`
` What are you talking about?"`
`Trembling all over, ......I pointed at it.`
`But no matter how much the boat captain squinted, he noticed absolutely nothing in that direction that should have surprised me.`
`...That must mean,`
` ......th-that must mean......`
`"......I-Impossible...`
` ...Wh-Why......?"`
`『...U-Uryu......`
` ...Ange, `
`...what does it mean?`
` What's going on here...?!』`
`"...I-I don't have a clue either...`
` There's no way something that ridiculous...`
` Is this magic?`
` A miracle...?"`
`"......Yes, this is probably fate.`
` ...Now, ...I understand.`
` ......This was...my mission."`
`『......Uryu.........』`
`"I......don't have a clue what......"`
`Shaking, I pointed into the thin darkness inside the store...and froze up...`
`"Wh-What is it?`
` You see something there, don't you?!`
` I don't...I don't see anything...`
` Wh-What is it you see...?!"`
`"Thank you, Captain.`
`'!s1`
`...was fate.`
` Even me visiting this place...`
`...was fate.`
` ......This is...`
`...the mission...and the purpose...that I'm going to Rokkenjima for......"`
`"......Ange-san?`
` What is it, is something wrong?"`
`"I-I don't have a clue either...!`
` This girl just froze up while pointing into the darkness...!"`
`"Ange-san...?`
` Are you okay?`
` What can you see...?"`
`"Can't you two see it?`
` It's that, right there.`
` ...Can't you see it?!"`
`"All I can see is a normal display case.`
` There's no one there, right...?"`
`『Uryu , ...Ange, `
`...I don't know what's going on...`
` ...Is this...a dream?`
` Magic...?`
` What is it...?`
` ......?`
` ......Ange......?』`
`Sakutarou lifted his face towards Ange...`
`'!s0`
`...slid a single tear.`
`"......Ange-sama........."`
`"...I understand,`
` Onee-chan.`
` ...And, `
`......Beatrice."`
`『......Uryu......』`
`This is......magic, isn't it......?`
`"......A test...?"`
`"...Y-Yes.`
` Listen well..."`
`Once again, there was a call from Krauss to the guesthouse.`
`...And the message was...that Kinzo wanted to hold a test to see if the grandchildren had the qualifications to become his successor.`
`"......The Head has said that his successor will not be one of us siblings...`
` That he wants...to pick from among his grandchildren..."`
`From Krauss's restrained style of speech, Jessica realized as his daughter that he was being forced to speak.`
`And she was forced to realize that the hostages were being exposed to danger even now,`
` and that if they refused this test, there was a possibility that the hostages would be harmed.`
`"Th-Then, `
`......what should we do?"`
`"...I-Indeed.`
` Hold on..."`
`Krauss put down the receiver, then looked at the grinning Kinzo on the other side of the bars.`
`Kinzo gave his next order.`
`"Before the test, those not involved must be removed.`
` ......Gohda and Kumasawa are there, I believe?`
` It will be a problem if they interfere with the test.`
` Banish them from the guesthouse."`
`"......Banish, ...you say...?"`
`"There should be a gardening storehouse in the rose garden.`
` Lock Gohda and Kumasawa in there.`
` Hmm, we'll begin from there.`
` Tell them to do it immediately.`
` ......My weapons will be watching.`
` If they happen to do anything questionable, I'll instantly stop the test and execute all of you as sacrifices!"`
`"...I-I understand...`
` ...Hello, Jessica...?`
` Listen closely to what I say..."`
`Krauss relayed the orders to lock up Gohda and Kumasawa...`
`"...What kind of test are you planning?"`
`"Hmm?`
` Aah, it truly is a simple test.`
` I only want my grandchildren to show me their resolve.`
` Well then, I wonder what kind of results they'll show me.`
` ...*cackle*."`
`Looking disgusted, Kyrie watched Krauss, who was talking with the children.`
`...I hate it, but for now, we cannot refuse orders.`
`In this dungeon, a feeble resistance won't amount to anything.`
`If we provoke him too much and drive him into a position where he might kill us,`
` there will no longer be any way to stop this murderer.`
`...For now, the only choice left is to obey his rules without agitating him, `
`...all the while waiting for an opportunity...`
`However, if we continue to obediently follow his commands,`
` the children might be attacked in this so-called test, and they might even lose their lives.`
`......Whether we feign obedience or try to resist, ...nothing will cause the situation to improve.`
`Anyway, straining our eyes so that we don't let a single chance escape until the very end...is the only resistance possible now.`
`...While telling herself this, Kyrie watched over Krauss as he delivered Kinzo's orders...`
`"......Kyrie-san,`
` let us be patient..."`
`"I understand.`
` ...It's unfortunate, but all we can do right now is wait.`
` If only we could do something about these bars, we'd be able to return to the mansion..."`
`"...If only we could somehow get out of here...`
` ...I-I'll try something.`
` .........Kinzo-san, I have a request."`
`"Hmm, what is it, my friend?"`
`"We understand well that you want to test the children...`
` ...It is fine for you to do as you desire."`
`"Without your power, the Ushiromiya family might have been destroyed long ago.`
` We truly understand why you want to carefully select the person who will take charge.`
` Besides, that is what the family conference is all about.`
` We won't get in your way..."`
`"Hmm.`
` Your insight is useful.`
` That's right, this is the family conference.`
` The final family conference, where I will select my successor.`
` Fuhahahaha...!"`
`"And yet, Kinzo-san, `
`...it is far too cold here.`
` Since we won't interfere with your test, couldn't you take us to a slightly warmer place...?"`
`"........."`
`At Nanjo's words, the slight signs that Kinzo's mood had been improving were blown away.`
`Nanjo was struck with a moment of silence as Kinzo gazed at him with dangerous eyes, as though appraising him...`
`"...Certainly, this place is cold.`
` It's tough on an old body.`
` ...Master,`
` wouldn't it be all right if we moved them upstairs...?"`
`"I cannot do that!!`
` Are you naive, Nanjoooooo...?`
` So, by acting as though you'll skip this turn, you truly and splendidly advance your strategy?`
` I'm not falling for that, you seeeee...?`
` If you're freezing, then why don't I line the floor with red hot coals!!"`
`"M-My apologies..."`
`Virgilia had tried to help out, but in the end, Kinzo would not comply...`
`".........You two sure are obedient.`
` ...If you felt like it, you could easily break these bars."`
`"...Even if we break them, nothing will come of it."`
`"Of course.`
` ...If you were to break these, it would mean the end of Goldsmith's game.`
` ...All of you, as well as those humans in the guesthouse, would immediately become sacrifices for Kinzo's ceremony."`
`"...But, surprisingly, you two might be the only ones, yes?`
` Perhaps only you two hold the power to break out of this situation, ...right?"`
`"......You want to reach the Golden Land, don't you?`
` You must have many dreams you want granted, right...?`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`"..............."`
`"Gaap,`
` you musn't provoke them.`
` ...This is not your game.`
` It is the Master's, as well as Milady's game."`
`"......What is it, Ronove?"`
`"Oh, no, nothing.`
` ...We were talking to the prisoners.`
` Forgive us."`
`Gaap sent one final sneering smile at Kanon, then turned away.`
`Kanon could only bite his lower lip and shake his fists...`
`"............`
` ...Dammit......"`
`"...You did well...`
` Good job hanging in there..."`
`"We're powerless...`
` Because we're furniture..."`
`"That's right, ...we're powerless.`
` ...However, furniture is sometimes relied upon...and even loved.`
` ...Right now, we've only been stored away in the basement.`
` ...Surely, one day, somebody will love us.`
` Because they'll rely on us.`
` ...That's why, for now, let's ignore their provocation and bear with it...`
` ...Okay?"`
`"...Father,`
` I've ordered them to lock up Gohda and Kumasawa in the storehouse."`
`"Very well.`
` Hang up now.`
` ...Chiester Sisters,`
` observe the grandchildren as they lock Gohda and Kumasawa away.`
` If they do anything suspicious, ...then in that moment, the selection test for my successor will be over."`
`When Kinzo made his order, the Chiester Sisters appeared behind him in a line.`
`"Understood, sir.`
` ...I will scout.`
` 556 and 410 will cover both flanks.`
` 45, you're on wide-area surveillance."`
`"00,`
` 556 is..."`
`"Ah, ......that's right.`
` Sorry."`
`"She was a good kid..."`
`"...That's why I don't like them nyeh.`
` ...Good people."`
`"What are you doing, Chiester Sisters?!`
` Follow my orders!"`
`"......My apologies, sir.`
` Then, let us go observe.`
` ...Move out!"`
`The Chiester Sisters erased their forms simultaneously.`
`Nanjo and Kyrie had witnessed the instants they appeared and disappeared as if by teleportation, `
`but they interpreted this as moving in and out of the darkness in a way that only looked like teleportation,`
` and the two could do nothing but rub their eyes...`
`"...Well then,`
` I shall begin the preparations for the test.`
` Ronove, Gaap,`
` I'm asking you to be the examiners.`
` Virgilia, you'll watch these rats.`
` ......After all, two of my furniture are here.`
` Just in case, be on your guard."`
`He glanced at Shannon and Kanon.`
`Tightly closing her eyes, Shannon gave a silent bow and answered wordlessly, avoiding any unnecessary actions...`
`"...Certainly.`
` I'll be careful."`
`"Isn't this cold hard on your old body, Lia?`
` Should I bring you a hot water bottle...?"`
`"Shut up.`
` Go quickly.`
` Gap!"`
`"Pukukuku...!`
` Well now, what a strange experience this game is, to have a test and examiners.`
` ......I do hope this development entertains Milady."`
`"...Come, arise, goat attendants."`
`Virgilia began to call out into the darkness, and from that spot, three massive goat-headed attendants suddenly appeared.`
`"Ah, Beato's minions.`
` How convenient.`
` Plus, they seem so warm.`
` I see, so you'll use them instead of a hot water bottle.`
` In that case, wouldn't sheep have been better than goats?"`
`"You're the one wearing cashmere.`
` ...They aren't very bright, but they faithfully follow orders and are quite dependable."`
`"Indeed, I leave it to you,`
` my friend, Virgilia.`
` ...The rest of you, follow me."`
`With a dignified gesture, Kinzo fluttered his cloak.`
`Following him were Ronove and Gaap,`
` ...as well as the three recently summoned goat attendants.`
`"...Hey, you three are supposed to wait here with me.`
` Don't follow them."`
`The goats jumped in surprise and then came tottering back.`
`Kyrie, who had been watching stunned as all of this played out, couldn't help but snort.`
`"Heheh...`
` What entertaining underlings."`
`"L-Lord Goldsmith did not give you permission to speak."`
`...She was probably embarrassed.`
`Virgilia had spoken cooly, but Kyrie saw through that, and for a little while, she couldn't restrain her muffled laughter.`
`However, on the inside, Kyrie was surprised at the number of people Kinzo had with him.`
`After all, including Kinzo himself, at least 10 enemies had already been spotted...`
`...The dungeon they were currently locked in was supposedly underneath the hidden mansion called Kuwadorian.`
`Although this mansion had been whispered of, not even Krauss had known of its existence until today.`
`Are there actually several facilities like this on Rokkenjima,`
` where many unknown henchmen that only Kinzo knows of hide...?`
`Just how many humans are on Rokkenjima, locked away by the typhoon...?`
`No, on the contrary...`
`Were we the only ones under the impression that there were only 18 people on this island...?`
`Were we, who bickered over whether Beatrice existed or not and worried about whether a 19 person existed or not, `
`nothing more than the frogs in a well on this island...?`
`No wait, not only that...`
` By now, are there actually more people on the enemy's side than on ours...?`
`"......Just what the hell is going on...?`
` Witches? Demons? Magic?`
` ...Are you telling us to believe in those?`
` Are my eyes screwed up? Or is it my head?`
` ...I think I'm losing it......"`
`A mass murder by magic.`
`Demons forming and disappearing into thin air.`
`Setting aside the enemy's numbers, `
`how should we interpret the various things thrust before our eyes that cannot be explained with the common sense of our world?`
`...Kyrie started to feel like she didn't know what was going on anymore,`
` and while desperately battling the urge to abandon everything and give up, she grit her teeth and tried to hold onto her sanity...`
`Obviously, Gohda and Kumasawa were quite unwilling to be locked in the rose garden shed.`
`...But they were threatened that, if they resisted, the hostages' safety could not be guaranteed...`
`It was fairly hard to get them to agree, `
`but once they started thinking that their safety might actually be guaranteed if the key to the gardening storehouse was to be handed to them after being shut inside,`
` ...and when it was decided that blankets and food would be carried in for them, they were finally convinced.`
`"......This place is pretty chilly...`
` I wonder how long we'll have to stay locked in here..."`
`"...It could be as late as Monday morning at the worst, so a full day and night.`
` ...I really feel bad about doing this to you two..."`
`George and Battler cleared a space on the floor, then spread the blankets there.`
`They also left the canned food, crackers, and other light snacks they had brought.`
`"It'll be hard for you guys to go until Monday with just this...`
` If only we could make a trip to the kitchen..."`
`"They said not to go anywhere we weren't told to.`
` ...Sounds like we're being watched.`
` ...Damn."`
`"...I am honestly sorry that we cannot be of any use...`
` And these are the times that we are truly supposed to be at your sides..."`
`"It can't be helped.`
` ...More importantly, take care of Kumasawa-san.`
` We don't know what might happen.`
` If the going gets tough, I'd like you to play it by ear and come to the rescue.`
` And more than anything, I want you to be safe..."`
`"...Yes, I understand.`
` ...Please be careful, everyone.`
` Right now, the Master...is taking human lives like they're pieces on a chessboard.`
` ...Please look out for yourselves."`
`Gohda stared at the floor, even now unable to believe what had happened as he remembered that atrocity in the dining hall,`
` and he hung his head in shame at his failure to fully describe that terror.`
`"Thank you.`
` ...Make sure you stay on your guard.`
` You too, Kumasawa-san."`
`"...And you all please take care as well...`
` I don't have any idea what's going on anymore..."`
`"Well then, ...we'll be off.`
` Let's go, Battler-kun, Jessica-chan.`
` ...Come on, you too, Maria-chan."`
`"......Uu-."`
`Looking at the pitiful expressions on the imprisoned pair's faces, it got really hard to close the shutter.`
`But we can't disobey.`
`...We're being watched.`
`The shutter was brought down and locked.`
`Then, George walked toward the small window on the side of the storehouse.`
`At that side, there was a small latticed window that could only admit light and ventilation.`
`It looked like something from a jail, making the two of them seem even more pitiable,`
` ...but on the other hand, it would hopefully protect them from Kinzo and his subordinates...`
`He opened the window and called out.`
`"...Are you okay? You aren't cold, are you?"`
`"We're okay.`
` You've given us so many blankets, after all.`
`"I wish we could've brought them a kerosene stove or something..."`
`"...But it wouldn't have ventilation here.`
` It'll probably be tough for them, but there's nothing we can do now.`
` ...Hostages are being held against us.`
` We can't disobey..."`
`"...Dammit...`
` ...If we manage to save Kyrie and the rest somehow..."`
`"Shh.`
` ...They might be listening.`
` ...Gohda-san, here.`
` It's the key to the shutter."`
`"...Indeed.`
` I'll hold on to it."`
`Gohda took the key, showed it to Kumasawa, and placed it in his own pocket.`
`There's only one key to the gardening shed's shutter.`
`That key was being held by the ones locked up inside it.`
`If the children had kept it...and had it stolen from them by some chance, that would do nothing but expose the lives of those in the shed to danger.`
`And even with the key, the shutter could not be opened from the inside.`
` Kinzo's demands were fulfilled this way.`
`However, there was now no longer any way to open the shed from the outside either.`
` This protected them.`
`Kinzo had ordered that they be confined, ...and we could do nothing but trust that this cold closed room would protect them.`
`Jessica watched this while holding Maria's hand, then looked over the thickets in the pitch-black rose garden.`
`...Somewhere in this darkness, somebody was hiding, watching to see whether we obeyed orders or not.`
`Of course, when we pointed our flashlights out there, no suspicious silhouettes appeared.`
`But somebody was surely out there, ...hiding and watching.`
`I was hit many times with an urge to scream at them.`
`...But I was able to hold that urge back through reason.`
`The four children left the area, repeatedly looking back over their shoulders.`
`The light from the faint lightbulb in the gardening storehouse was seeping out slightly.`
`...I wonder if this insane incident will come to an end somehow...so that we can meet those two again.`
`...To George, who had closed the shutter himself, `
`...the resistance of the lock had made it feel as though he'd killed them with his own hands.`
`"...But even so, ...we can't defy them..."`
`"What's with this test...?`
` ...Damn geezer, don't screw with us...!`
` Killing Mom, capturing Dad for that...`
`"...It's okay, Jessica onee-chan.`
` There's nothing to be sad about..."`
`"...Maria..."`
`"Soon, the witch will be revived.`
` ...Soon, we'll be able to meet in the Golden Land.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihi...`
`"Don't laugh indiscreetly like that.`
` ...Seriously, a resurrection ceremony for a witch?`
` ...Getting so many people involved...`
`in delusions he should've just kept inside his head.`
` ...That's gonna cost you, ...bastard..."`
`"...Let's return to the guesthouse.`
` ...It'll be bad if we aren't there when Grandfather calls."`
`Urged on by George, everyone began walking towards the guesthouse...`
`At that moment, Jessica turned in a circle, facing towards the darkness of the rose garden, and roared.`
`".........HEY!!`
` Someone's watching, right?!`
` Tell the old man...!!`
` Tell him I'm gonna fuckin' kill him!!`
`Of course, there was no reply, only the howl of the wind and rain...`
`The children returned to the guesthouse...`
`...While fearing what was waiting for them up ahead...`
`After they left,`
` ...from the exact point in the darkness that Jessica had yelled at,`
` two rabbit ears sprung up...`
`"...S-Sorsorsorry...!`
` They found me ouuuut...!!"`
`"It's because you're too slow nyeh.`
`"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please don't tell Pendragon-samaaaaaaaaaa!"`
`"Be quiet.`
` It was obviously just a bluff.`
` ...Gohda and Kumasawa's imprisonment confirmed.`
` Mission complete.`
` We'll report back."`
`"Ya-i, ya-i.`
` Nihihihihihihihihi!`
` Ouch."`
`"Do you want us all stuck on nothing but carrots and water because of collective responsibility?`
` ...Let's go."`
`The fact that they were being watched certainly seemed to be true.`
`Because, when they returned to the cousins' room, turned the lights on, and laid down on their beds, the phone rang again.`
`Earlier, Jessica had been answering the phone, seeing as this was her house,`
` but now it was the eldest, George, who picked it up.`
`This time, Kyrie-san was on the other end of the line.`
`George handed it to Battler out of consideration...`
`"......Hello.`
` Kyrie-san?`
` Is everything all right over there...?!"`
`"Thanks for worrying.`
` ...At the moment, we're all doing great here.`
` ...............Sorry, I've been ordered to refrain from idle chatter.`
` Listen to what I'm about to tell you."`
`The fact that they were hostages still hadn't changed.`
`Kinzo or one of his subordinates was listening to the conversation.`
`Battler restrained the urge to talk about other things...and focused on what Kyrie had to say.`
`"The test will be carried out by Jessica-chan, George-kun, Battler-kun,`
` and Maria-chan, in that order.`
` ...You'll each be summoned in turn, so until then, do not leave the room.`
` When someone's called out, they'll head to their designated location, alone."`
`Battler repeated it out loud, so that the cousins listening in around him could hear.`
`"...So it'll be Jessica, Aniki, me, and Maria, in that order, and we've gotta stay in the room until we're called, right?`
` ...Got it.`
` ...Maria too?`
` Even a nine-year-old girl... What's the damn geezer trying to force us to do, that bastard...?"`
`"......The fate of the Ushiromiya family rests in all of your hands.`
` ...Do your best."`
`"...Nng.`
` ......Sure."`
`Battler noticed the strange nuance in Kyrie's words.`
`Even without any blood connection, he could still understand thanks to the long-lasting bond they shared.`
`At this point, it doesn't make sense to worry about the Ushiromiya family itself.`
`...That probably wasn't the message Kyrie wanted to send.`
`She probably meant 'There's no way for us to escape from this dungeon, and we can only wait to be rescued.`
` Our lives are in your hands.'`
`...Something like that.`
`"Yeah, leave it to me.`
` We don't know what kind of test it is, but no problem.`
` I'll take it gladly.`
` ......It's gonna be a serious test, right?`
` ...Should we really...`
`go all out?"`
`"...Yes.`
` It's a serious test.`
` Grandfather truly does intend to test you all."`
`"It's useless, it's all useless.`
` ...Some old fart on death's door is gonna give me a serious challenge?`
` Let him spout nonsense after he gets in the coffin.`
` I know he's there, so tell him this for me:`
` I'll be your successor.`
` And my first action will be to shove my fist into your face...!"`
`Even without Kyrie having to repeat it, Battler's powerful declaration of war reached Kinzo's ears...`
`"Fuhahahahahahahaha!!`
` Battleeeeer, I am truly looking forward to thaaat!`
` I can't wait to see just what a man who once threw away the Ushiromiya name has attained,`
` just what lot in life he's reached when he appears before me!!`
` Tell him...!"`
`Unfortunately, Kinzo's voice was not picked up by the reciever.`
` Therefore, Kyrie spoke for him.`
`"It sounds like he's more than up for the challenge.`
` ...Got that, Battler-kun?`
` There's no need to hold back.`
` ......You are Rudolf's son.`
` ...No, you are my son.`
` Show me something I can brag about to anyone.`
` ......I leave everything in your hands."`
`"Understood, Mom.`
` ......Leave the rest to me...!"`
`"......All of us here have lost the right to inherit the position of Successor.`
` ...Now, we're just the same as pieces taken off the game board looking on from the outside.`
` So you'll have to fight by yourselves."`
`".........Kyrie-san......"`
`'!s0`
`'We've already given up,`
` ...so forget about us.'`
`...But...for that very reason, I won't give up...`
`I'll definitely crush this test or whatever...and save everyone...!`
`"In that case, here are his instructions for the first test, Jessica-chan's:`
` ...Go to your room."`
`"Really, go to your room? What's your game, you damn geezer..."`
`"It seems he means Jessica-chan's personal room, the one in the mansion."`
`"...I'll hand it over to Jessica.`
` Tell her directly for me.`
` ...Jessica, here."`
`"H-Hello...`
` ......Yes, I understand..."`
`"......Starting with me, huh...?`
` ...Well, I've been ready.`
` See ya later!"`
`Even Jessica was probably tempted to succumb to the fear of a girl her age.`
`...But she crushed those feelings and strengthened her resolve.`
`"Be careful, ...okay?"`
`"...We're probably being watched, right?`
` We can't do anything we aren't told.`
`"...They say that old geezer killed those six in the dining hall instantly, with no hesitation.`
` ...So, if we try to fight back, we might end up the same way."`
`"I know.`
` ......I'll beat them at their own game."`
`"Don't do anything reckless.`
` ...If you think you're in any danger, your own safety comes first.`
` ...If Uncle Krauss finds out that his daughter sacrificed herself for him,`
` there's no doubt it'll tear his heart apart."`
`"It goes the other way too.`
` ......If Mom and Dad are both killed, and I'm the only one left,`
` my heart will rip itself to pieces."`
`"...............`
`...Battler-kun,`
` what you said earlier is true, right...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Kyrie-san and the others are already...prepared for what will happen."`
`"Then, ...the way things are now is just perfect.`
` ...Everyone's lives rest on our shoulders.`
` The hostages can't do anything while they're locked up.`
` That means we'll have to manage something ourselves."`
`"......If something happens, run back to the guesthouse.`
` At that time, we'll be done playing along with Grandfather's game."`
`"Aniki......"`
`"At that time, we'll declare war.`
` ......Wherever they're locked up, we'll save them, and we'll deal with Grandfather accordingly."`
`"... Are you sure, Aniki?`
` ...Shannon-chan's there too."`
`"............`
`...That's why I'm saying it. I'm not sitting around and waiting for my fiancée to be killed.`
` ......What scares me is not that Shannon might be killed by Grandfather."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"~ib~I'm just worried you guys'll get there first and clobber the damn geezer who made my fiancée experience terror before I do~ib~."`
`"I see...`
` ...This really does sound like a test to see who'll be the Successor."`
`"Yep.`
` ...The first one to bury a fist into that old face will be the next Head."`
`George, Battler, and Jessica each forcefully nodded their heads and put their fists together.`
`Then, Jessica headed off to her own room, as designated...`
`Her form disappeared into the darkness of the rose garden waving in the strong winds.`
`...Watching her go, George and Battler gripped their fists even tighter, making them quiver...`
`Left on the second floor, Maria watched Jessica's back through the window.`
`She wore a blank expression...`
`"...I wonder what everyone's getting so upset about.`
` ......Even though when Beatrice is revived, everyone will be brought back to life."`
`Jessica's form was already being completely swallowed up by the darkness.`
`...At that time, the phone began to ring again.`
`Battler and George heard it and came clamoring back, but Maria picked up the receiver right away.`
`".........Hello."`
`"...I-Is that Maria-sama...?`
` It's me, Shannon.`
` ...Would you please hand the phone to George-sama?"`
`This time, it was Shannon on the phone.`
`And this time, the message was to tell the next person, George, where he was to go...`
`Of course, since the time of her birth, ...Jessica had been raised in this mansion.`
`The atrophied, Western-style house that the cousins called a mansion was her home.`
`And yet, she had never understood her cousins' feelings as much as she did today.`
`...At the same time, she had never felt her own home, which she knew well, to be as alien as it seemed now...`
`Her own......room.`
`This had once been her hideaway, the only place in this vast mansion where she could feel at peace.`
`However, ...she had never felt as much pressure coming from that door as she did now.`
`"......A test, you say...?`
` Tch, what the hell could be waiting in there...`
` I'm not gonna find my desk and stuff dragged around all over the place, right...?"`
`She acted tough, trying to deceive herself.`
`...Trying make herself believe that she wasn't scared of anything.`
`Readying herself, she opened the door to her room.`
`"............"`
`...When she saw that, fortunately, the room didn't appear to be messed up, she relaxed.`
`No one...was there.`
` ...Of course.`
`There was nowhere for anyone to hide here.`
`Right away, Jessica locked the door behind her.`
`...This way, the room was safe.`
`She peeked under the bed and in the closet, but of course, no one was hiding.`
`"...Wh-What the hell.`
` ...Haha, ...haha...!"`
`She looked at the clock.`
` ...It was just past 23:10.`
`As her tension lessened and fatigue came back to her entire body, she realized how messed up this whole day had been.`
`It was still about 23:00.`
`...The plan had been for all the cousins to gather, have fun playing around, and talk animatedly about various things together into the night.`
`Normally, we would've been doing that kind of thing right now.`
`Why...has that turned into this...?`
`"......It's all that damn geezer's fault...`
` ...How could he do that...to Mom...`
`to everyone......"`
`She shook her head back and forth with anger and sadness...`
`But there was no one here to direct those emotions at.`
`...Because of the lock, this room's security was guaranteed.`
`Remembering that one more time, Jessica somehow regained her calm...`
`If it keeps up like this and nothing happens...`
`...I want to go to the dining hall and see Mom's dead face.`
`...Even though Gohda emphasized so strongly that it was gruesome and that I definitely shouldn't go to look at it,`
` even so, I wanted to see her face at the end...`
`But we were warned repeatedly that stepping out of line even a little would put the hostages in danger.`
`...Could it be that locking the door was also against the rules...?`
`If I close myself up in here, I alone might be saved.`
`...But if I don't open it, it'll surely be against the rules, and Dad, Kanon-kun, Shannon, Aunt Kyrie and Doctor Nanjo...`
`will be killed.`
`......There's no way the scales will balance out between five lives and my own one life.`
`Jessica tightly shut her eyes, resisting the other part of herself that said 'Isn't it okay as long as I stay alive?',`
` ...faced the door, and made to unlock it.`
`...At that time.`
`*clap* *clap* *clap*...`
`A crisp applause rang out, making Jessica's heart leap...`
`"If the door had remained locked, it might have been in violation of the rules, and harm could have come to the hostages.`
` ...But despite that, your own life might be saved."`
`"However, you resisted that temptation and were about to unlock the door yourself.`
` That bravery of yours is worthy of admiration."`
`"Wh-Who......"`
`'!s0`
`...searched everywhere a human could've been hiding, `
`......where did this man...come from...?`
`......There was nowhere for a Human to hide,`
` ...but could something non-Human have managed it......?`
`This was supposedly my first meeting with this largely-built, middle-aged man.`
`...I didn't recognize this guy, who looked like a butler and bore the crest of the One-Winged Eagle.`
`"A pleasure to meet you, Jessica-sama.`
` ......I serve as head furniture for the Master, the 27th of the 72.`
` I am called Ronove."`
`"...Rono...ue...?`
` ......Genji...san......?"`
`"...Ah yes, ...Genji is like my little brother.`
` Or perhaps he was my true form while in this world.`
` ...You might even say he was my vessel."`
`"......What's...this guy...saying......?"`
`"Oh, my apologies.`
` This is not something a Human would be able to understand.`
` ......Well then, let us move on to the main event."`
`"So this is...`
`...that test or whatever the damn geezer talked about......?"`
`"Correct.`
` This is the test that the Master has granted you, Jessica-sama."`
`At Ronove's elegant gesture, like that of a butler ordering for a meal to be set out,`
` many gold butterflies flew up out of nowhere...`
`"Gwah?!`
` What the...hell...?!"`
`As the cloud of gold butterflies spun around in a small swirl, they gathered in one place.`
`...Then, that golden mound disappeared like a pile of leaves blown away by a cold wintry wind,`
` ...and there lay a Western envelope with the One-Winged Eagle crest done on it in gold leaf...`
`With a gesture, Ronove urged her to pick it up.`
`Jessica timidly did so...and opened the letter inside...`
`".........What's...this...?"`
`"It is an exceedingly simple test to determine whether one is qualified to become the Successor.`
` ...Please attend to the question written there with a fitting attitude for the Successor who is to support the Ushiromiya family...`
`and tell me your answer, as well as the thoughts that led you to it."`
`".........D-Dumbass......"`
`Shaking, Jessica looked between the paper and Ronove's face several times...`
`...At that time, George, who had been called out after Jessica, could be seen in the arbor of the rose garden.`
`If things had gone normally, ...he had planned to give Shannon the ring that would be proof of their engagement...here, at this time, on this day.`
`...But the woman in front of George now was not Shannon.`
`"...Read it.`
` That is Goldsmith's test for you."`
`"............"`
`George picked up the Western envelope, which was on the table where he'd once had tea with Shannon,`
` and read its contents...`
`Perhaps its message was short.`
` After glancing at it, George's eyes grew sharp.`
`"......What's this supposed to be?"`
`"Ehheheheheh.`
` ...It is as you see.`
` This is the test given to you, to see if you're qualified to be the Successor.`
` ...As you ask yourself whether you truly are so qualified, answer that question."`
`"......What a...stupid question."`
`"That's right.`
` It really is a stupid question.`
` ......Doesn't that mean the Ushiromiya family inheritance is also something on that level in Goldsmith's eyes?`
` ...Heheheh."`
`George lowered his eyes to the surface of the letter once again, examining its contents...`
`George and Jessica.`
` ...While the tests given to them were slightly different, they were almost exactly the same.`
`"...'Among the three mentioned below,`
` in order to gain two, sacrifice one'."`
`"It's a simple three choices.`
` ......Decide for yourself which one you will choose to abandon."`
`"If you refuse to choose, the test will be suspended.`
` I've been given permission to kill you right here by my own hands.`
` ......If you want to include even that as a choice, then there are four options.`
` It's been an awful long time since I've gotten to play with a kid like you, so I can't say I'd be disappointed."`
`"......Are these three choices only a test?`
` Or will the consequence of my choice be carried out?"`
`"Don't be so naive.`
` ...The one you choose will definitely lose their life."`
`"............"`
`Among the three mentioned below...`
`In order to gain two, sacrifice one.`
`1. Your life`
`2. Shannon's life`
`3. Everyone else's lives`
`If you do not choose one, all of the above will be lost.`
`"......Why is Shannon's name here?"`
`"The second choice has the name of the one most needed and most loved by the test-taker.`
` ...I believe Kanon's name is written second on Jessica's test."`
`"......You gave this stupid question to Jessica too...?"`
`"*giggle*giggle*`
` ...You shouldn't be worrying about Jessica, right?`
` Right now, you are the one being tested.`
` It really is a simple three-choice test.`
` Which can you throw away for the sake of the other two?`
` ...Isn't that simple?`
` If you still can't decide, would you like me to lend you a coin...?"`
`"...A coin?`
` How would you choose between three options with something that only has two sides?"`
`"No one would throw away their own life.`
` ...So, there remain two choices that will leave you standing.`
` Will you give up on everyone for the sake of the one you love?`
` Or will you give up on the one person you love so that you can save as many people as possible?"`
`"Either way, you should be able to find a fitting just cause.`
` After all, this Rokkenjima is now a demon island."`
`"...The sentimental relationships of the Human world aren't necessary here.`
` No one will blame you.`
` Do as your heart desires.`
` ...And ask yourself whether you're qualified to succeed the Ushiromiya family Headship..."`
`"Or rather, make your decision as if you truly were the Ushiromiya Family Head, okay?`
` Hehheheheheh..."`
`"............"`
`"......Fuck you guys, ...mocking me like this......!"`
`Jessica crumpled the letter up and threw it on the floor.`
`"I believe your anger is quite appropriate.`
` ...I also find it an exceedingly pitiful...and yet truly humorous question.`
` ...Pu ku ku ku."`
`"How could anyone wish to die themselves?`
` And how could anyone want to remain alive after abandoning the life of the one they...l-love.`
` ...And...how could anyone massacre everyone else, ...as long as it's good for the two of them...?!"`
`"No, Jessica-sama.`
` Such a person could exist.`
` This is Rokkenjima, the demon island!`
` It is now completely cut off from the Human world and fully immersed in the spirit world like cheese fondue.`
` Values of the human world get taken out with the trash."`
`"Pu ku ku!`
` So please.`
` Rank the things you desire from the bottom of your heart.`
` Whatever remains will become a fitting answer for you in this insane evening."`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, jes_4e139:`
`"'If you do not choose one, all of the above will be lost'...`
`also makes for a fine fourth option.`
` Even choosing that should give us an amusing show."`
`"But since that choice will result in the loss of your own life in the end, I believe it would be more wise to be pure and choose the first one, 'your life',`
` so that the other two will be saved.`
` ...Everything has been entrusted to your decision, Jessica-sama."`
`"Please, let me hear an answer and conviction fitting for the Successor to the Ushiromiya Family Headship...!!`
` I, Ronove, am sincerely hoping for a wonderful answer, fitting for the Master's descendant who shares his blood!!"`
`"...D-Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt..."`
`That scene was observed through the magic crystal ball Kinzo held.`
`Kinzo finally couldn't hold it back and, spreading his arms and facing the heavens, began laughing in an explosive voice...`
`"Fuhahahahahahaha, waahhahhahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` What are you wavering for, foolish grandchildren, my descendants?!!"`
`"Isn't this problem so easy that you could answer right away?`
` Isn't this a question that should cause you to waver less than whether to put butter or jam on your morning toast?!!`
` ...Do you people know the correct answer?"`
`He turned to face the Chiester Sisters, who had been waiting on him.`
`"N-N-No, my apologies, I don't know, Lord Goldsmith!"`
`"Fool, not choosing at all means game oveeeeeeeeeeeer!!!`
` You foolish rabbit, who cannot even choose a reason or a goal for your own life...!!"`
`"You aren't worth a single ant that anyone might step upon without even noticing!!`
` Die! Be crushed!! Disappear faster than I can blink!!`
` ...And what of you?"`
`"...I would sacrifice the first one, 'your own life', sir.`
` Weapons fight and die in battle.`
` And weapons exist to destroy enemies and protect allies.`
` Being able to protect those we love and then die is our satisfaction, sir."`
`"Hoh.`
` A truly splendid model answer for a weapon.`
` The immediate reply is very nice.`
` ...So, have you been raised to think you'll be given an extra carrot for answering that way?`
` Heheheheh, that's wrong, seeeeeeeee?`
` Even that is wrong, seeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...?"`
`"Answering that way when you are asked is nothing more than giving the answer you have been indoctrinated with!!`
` You are the same as that other rabbit a second ago.`
` You still live without having chosen a purpose or goal to strive for...!!`
` You filth that doesn't deserve to live...!`
` It would suit you well to be crushed and used as fodder for the other livestock!!"`
`".........!`
` ...Yes sir!`
` Animal fodder...would be an honor...!"`
`"That's wrong, riiiiiiight?`
` You don't want to see anyone else die anymore, riiiiiiight?`
` Why can't you accept that?`
` Accept that the depths of the depths of your old wound are still festering and rotting...!`
` Yes, the rotting stench would make the nose wrinkle, you foolish rotten rabbit!!`
` These are words of praise for you!!"`
`"......Th-Thank you very much, ...sir..."`
`"Well then, what about you, the last one?`
` Which of the three choices would you choose...?"`
`"Nihi.`
` Without wavering, I'd chose the second one."`
`"Hoh...`
` The second.`
` There are not many who could stick their chest out and choose to offer 'the one they love' as a sacrifice.`
` Tell me your reason."`
`"Because the one you love will be lost eventually.`
` If you don't love anyone, you won't get hurt, and if you lose someone, you still might be able to love again.`
` So,`
` the person you love right now isn't worth that much at all nyeh.`
` ...Nihi!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` I see, so that is why you reach such an answer, you rabbit who has become cowardly from pain caused by love...`
` I have heard that rabbits can die from loneliness, but just when was it that your heart was killed...?"`
`"Then, rabbit, I shall alter the question.`
` Why don't I change the second option to, not 'the one you love', but 'the memories of the one you loved'?"`
`"...How is that?`
` Can you still select that one?`
` What's this about the one you love not being worth much at all, foolish rabbit...?!`
` Filth who cannot even face up to the depths of her own love!!`
` Try and choose it, try and choose to have the one you loved forgotten!!"`
`"You can do it, right?`
` I'll bet you can, riiiiiiiight?`
` Cooooome on, try saying that you can, okaaaaaaaaaaaayy?!?!"`
`"Y-Yes, I can choose it...`
` I can choose it...!!`
` Nihi, ......nihihihihihihihihihiiihii..."`
`"L-Lord Goldsmith...!`
` Please, stop this...!!"`
`"Hihiiihiii...`
` ...Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnggg...!!"`
`"Enough, rabbit filth!!`
` Go to Virgilia and help keep watch on the dungeon.`
` Disappear!!"`
`The Chiester Sisters, with their respective old wounds of the heart gouged out,`
` escaped by disappearing.`
`After that, even though there was no one to hear, Kinzo continued talking by himself as though in a play...`
`"...Indeed, that is the nature of this charming test.`
` In truth, no choice can be said to be correct.`
`'!s1`
`without hesitation, `
`quickly, `
`and with a resolute conviction and their own strong, unshakable will!!"`
`"It's their reason and their willpower that are most essential.`
` That is what I want to learn.`
` Yes, my descendants, I am truly looking forward to what kind of answer you will show me!!"`
`"......Hmmmm?`
` Me?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Yes, of course I once had the same question thrust upon me.`
` Because I splendidly answered that devil's question, I was able to obtain gold and honor, and that witch as my possession.`
` Which answer did I chooooooooooose?`
` ......Do you really need me to say it out loud?`
` Wahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!!"`
`"Well then,`
` have you nearly decided on your answer...?"`
`"............"`
`As Jessica stared at the letter that had been crushed and lay on the floor,`
` ...she hung her head in constant silence.`
`All that filled the room was the stir from wind and rain shaking the treetops.`
`Regardless of how noisy that was, it actually made the stillness more apparent.`
`Ronove waited for Jessica's answer.`
`...However, Jessica didn't answer.`
`Whether she was lost in deep thought or had stopped thinking, Ronove couldn't tell.`
`...No, ...he might actually have known.`
`But cruelly, like a demon, ...Ronove urged Jessica to voice it.`
`"......If you cannot choose any,`
` ...I can at least bring you peace without pain, ...but..."`
`"............`
`......me."`
`"...Yes?`
` I had trouble hearing.`
` Could you say it again please...?"`
`Jessica lifted her face...and looked straight into Ronove's eyes.`
`...It seemed that she had decided on her answer.`
`"......Kill me."`
`Jessica said it one more time, ...clearly.`
`Perhaps Ronove had imagined that this would be her answer from the very beginning.`
`...Without any surprise, he smiled lightly and nodded.`
`"...I thought you would choose that answer, Jessica-sama.`
` ...Well then, there is no right or wrong answer to this test.`
` The essential part is what thoughts led you to that answer."`
`"Come now.`
` Please answer with a fitting attitude for the Successor."`
`"......It's not like I chose the first one 'cause I wanna die.`
` ...The second one was letting Kanon-kun die.`
` Of course, that was out of the question.`
` So I excluded it.`
` ...The third one was everyone else's lives.`
` Of course, that was also out of the question.`
` So I excluded it.`
` ...After that, only the first choice remained."`
`"Process of elimination, ...is it?`
` So, it was not something you chose proactively..."`
`After chuckling slightly, Ronove dropped his gaze.`
`...A Human couldn't even imagine what answer a demon would have been expecting.`
`...All she could understand was that this was apparently slightly below Ronove's expectations.`
`"...That answer is neither bad nor good.`
` ...60 percent, I believe you could call it.`
` ...I'm a little disappointed."`
`"You're a pretty selfish bastard, telling me to answer with self-confidence and then being disappointed when I do."`
`"......Apparently there was more to it than process of elimination.`
` ...It's a failing grade either way, ...but there seems to be a little more to your thoughts.`
` Allow me to ask."`
`"People don't want to die.`
` ...So no one would want to choose the first option.`
` ...People want to live in happiness...and struggle as much as life will let them.`
` So normally, the first choice should be impossible from the beginning."`
`"......However, you took that first choice.`
` You chose to throw away your own life.`
` Only that choice remained for you."`
`"I tried...thinking of the future that would come after choosing each one."`
`"...Hoh.`
` And what did you see...?"`
`"First, ......I tried letting Kanon-kun die.`
` ......I tried to imagine the rest of my life after having abandoned the one I love."`
`"What kind of life was it...?"`
`"It was a horrible woman, who didn't deserve to live.`
` A shabby woman who always lamented her own decision and lived only to regret.`
` ...I could never forgive a horrible woman who'd choose to live and abandon the person she loved.`
` ...I put an end to her myself."`
`"Heheh, how brave.`
` ......So, did you also consider the third option?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` I tried letting everyone but me and Kanon-kun die.`
` ...There's no way Kanon-kun would like me if I did that."`
`"So again, even with Kanon-kun, I was forced to bear the cross of abandoning so many people.`
` ...And even Kanon-kun was forced to bear it."`
`"......I'm not gonna make a foolish choice that leaves Kanon-kun bearing that cross.`
` I wouldn't be able to forgive a future me who did something like that.`
` ...I put an end to that woman myself too."`
`Jessica had pictured it in her mind.`
`The future her beyond each of the three choices.`
`There were three Jessicas.`
`...Of the three, two had regrets.`
`Only one could hold her head high and smile at Kanon.`
`"...You know, `
`I once had the nerve to preach something to Kanon-kun.`
` ...Something about trying to live life to the fullest."`
`"Live your life to the fullest.`
` ...Meaningful words.`
` And a surprisingly difficult thing to do."`
`"So yeah.`
` I've gotta stand proud and show Kanon-kun.`
` ......Show him how to live by holding your head high and looking straight at the sun, with a full smile."`
`"...Will Kanon be able to accept your self-sacrifice?`
` Haven't you thought that your selfish decision might hurt him more than is necessary...?"`
`"That's why...I want to leave a message..."`
`"Hoh.`
` ...I will listen, but I am after all a demon.`
` ...I may not keep my promises, you see?"`
`"......Keep it!`
` Your promise!"`
`Jessica spoke that looking quite unconcerned.`
`She had asked the demon who was about to take her life to pass on a message, and she didn't think at all that she would be betrayed.`
`...At that extremely innocent smile, Ronove closed his eyes lightly and shrugged his shoulders.`
`"Hmph...`
` ...I see nothing wrong with that.`
` So?`
` What shall I tell him...?"`
`『...Tell Kanon-kun...to live his life to the fullest.`
` ...No, that's not quite it.`
` Not...Kanon-kun.`
` ...He still hasn't told me his real name yet.`
` Tell the real Kanon-kun to live his life to the fullest.`
` ...Tell him that.』`
`"......Mi...lady..."`
`"...Jessica, `
`...you really are......"`
`"Ronove is fickle, so he might not have passed the message on.`
` ...You certainly are fortunate `
`to have me here showing you this scene."`
`A musty three-sided mirror was set beyond the bars, ...and the scene with Jessica was reflected on it.`
`On the next mirror, ...the scene with George was reflected in the same way.`
`None of them questioned how a three-sided mirror had appeared from a group of butterflies,`
` nor did they wonder why these scenes with Jessica and George were reflected on it.`
`...Because the reflected scenes themselves were more important.`
`"......Are you so prepared...`
`...to throw your life away......`
`...for his sake......?"`
`".........`
`...My...apologies..."`
`Krauss looked at Kanon with a complicated expression mixed in with a bitter smile.`
` ...Kanon wouldn't meet his eyes.`
`"...Virgilia-sama,`
` ...there is no reason for Milady to throw away her life.`
` ...Please kill me.`
` Please change it to the second choice.`
` ...That way, everything should resolve itself."`
`"Hohhohohohohoho...`
` I am not capable of granting that wish.`
` ...After all, this is Jessica's own decision, which she herself chose."`
`At that time, suddenly, the air split and the Chiester Sisters appeared, flying into Virgilia's chest.`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, s41_4e34:`
`"So mean, so mean, Lord Goldsmith is so meeeeeeeeaan, waaaaaaaaahhhh!"`
`"I'm...doing the best I can...`
` Crushing me for animal fodder, ...that's just too much.`
` ...Uuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!"`
`Virgilia, who still didn't have a clue what was going on, was mobbed by the sobbing Chiester Sisters.`
`"Th-There, there. Everything's all right, don't cry...`
` I'll make you some delicious tea...`
` ...I'm leaving it up to you all to guard this place.`
` If they do anything suspicious, inform me immediately...!"`
`The goat attendants all faced each other, nodding their heads.`
`Virgilia took the Chiester Sisters and left.`
`The sound of them going up stairs could be heard, so they had probably gone to an upper floor.`
`"......This is our chance.`
` ...It looks like these goat heads are morons.`
` ...I wonder if we can trick them..."`
`Kyrie realized that an opportunity had arrived, but even so, she hadn't thought of a way to break the metal bars...`
`The Jessica reflected on the three-sided mirror had her eyes closed, as though in contemplation.`
`...The way she had both hands stuck into her pockets, wanting to be defiant until the very end, might have been her own aesthetic stance.`
`"......That's all I have to say.`
` ......Kill me."`
`"...Understood.`
` ......Well then,`
` ...fear not, for I shall make your death more gentle and merciful than any sleep."`
`As Ronove raised his palm, ...he slowly approached Jessica...`
`'!s0`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kla_4e316:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kla_4e317:`
`Realizing that his daughter was about to be killed, Krauss went half-mad and repeatedly body-slammed the metal bars.`
`The goats looked like they were sneering at how a mere Human didn't stand a chance at breaking those bars.`
`Krauss's pointless efforts certainly may have been comical.`
`...But Krauss was giving it everything he had.`
`He was now living with all he had as Jessica's father, so that he could save her.`
`......Kanon made tight fists with both hands.`
`If he used his cursed power, he might be able to cut through even metal bars.`
`...But there were a full three goats.`
`...There was no way he could defeat three of them in an instant.`
`It would instantly be reported, and then even Virgilia and the Chiester Sisters would probably dash in.`
`Even if he could break the bars, ...that would be the end of it.`
` ...It was useless.`
`...Kanon already knew that the witch sneered at useless efforts like that,`
` ...so he could do nothing but stare at Krauss's repeated body-slams...`
`"...Ah, ......George-sama..."`
`Shannon, who had been looking at the three-sided mirror, raised her voice.`
`...When they looked, they could see George, who had been silent the whole time, lift his face.`
`...It seemed that George had also decided on an answer...`
`"......Have you decided?`
` On your answer?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......I've decided."`
`"Is it an unwavering answer...?"`
`"Yeah. It's unwavering."`
`"Then let me hear it.`
` ......Oh, by the way,`
` it seems Jessica decided to take the 'your life' option.`
` Surely, such an indecisive person as you isn't going to choose the same answer, right...?"`
`"...Jessica gave her own answer.`
` ...No matter which choice that was, it was Jessica's answer.`
` It doesn't influence my answer in any way."`
`"I see.`
` Then let me ask again.`
` ......Among the three mentioned below,`
` in order to gain two, sacrifice one.`
`1. Your life.`
` 2. Shannon's life.`
`3. Everyone else's lives.`
` ......Which one will you choose?`
` Could it be the first one, like Jessica?"`
`"......Wrong."`
`"Oh...?"`
`Gaap looked a little surprised.`
`...Because she had thought this timid-looking man would obviously choose that option.`
`".........`
`...Very well then.`
` I'm glad the most boring option for me has been removed.`
` ...Then, as crazy as it sounds, ...could it be the second option?`
` Can you abandon Shannon's life...?"`
`"......You must be joking.`
` Why would I do that to the person I was going to give an engagement ring to tonight?"`
`".........`
`......How bold.`
` Is that your answer...?"`
`"......That's it.`
` ...My answer is...`
`the third option."`
`George took......the third option.`
`...'Everyone else's...lives'.`
`Unsurprisingly, Gaap hadn't imagined that he'd give an answer like that.`
`...She had been sure that he'd choose the same one as Jessica...`
`So, she was interested in how he had reached that answer.`
`...How he had reached an answer that had surpassed the imagination of the 33rd ranked of the 72 demons?`
`"I want you to tell me.`
` ......I want you to tell me the circumstances that made it possible for you to sacrifice the lives of everyone else so that you and the fiancée you love would be safe.`
` ...Did you use the process of elimination, like Jessica?"`
`"Wrong.`
` I clearly have no choice except this one."`
`"......So, you don't care what happens, as long as it's good for you?`
` So, you can sacrifice the world for the woman you love...?"`
`"What are you even talking about?"`
`"......What......?"`
`George faced the demon as he spoke, almost as though he was disgusted.`
`"...Tonight,`
` I planned on calling Shannon right here and giving her this ring as proof of our engagement.`
` ......There probably are quite a few people who wouldn't celebrate an engagement between me and Shannon.`
` I was prepared to make enemies of the entire family by announcing my engagement to her."`
`"I have been prepared.`
` Since the time I came to this island......no, that's not it.`
` ......Since the time I confessed that I wanted to engage her."`
`"......So, you can sacrifice everything else as long as you can get married...?"`
`"Marriage means...`
`...continuing to be your wife's ally for your whole life.`
` ......At that point,`
` ...I was prepared to have the entire world as my enemy for her sake."`
`Those words, through the three-sided mirror, ...also reached Shannon's ears.`
`And that determination reached her eyes.`
`...Shannon certainly had promised to be given an engagement ring tonight.`
`Then, this incident had occurred, and she hadn't been able to receive the ring.`
`But now...`
`...Even though it wasn't in the form of a ring, `
`Shannon had received something even greater.`
`...And as proof of that, `
`...a single tear with the same sparkle as a diamond...`
`dripped down.`
`"Heh, ...heheheheheheh...!`
` What a courageous answer.`
` I see, if I really think about it, this was an easy decision for you."`
`"After all, your parents were already killed on the first twilight, right?`
` By now, there's no one whose death would trouble you."`
`"Hahhahahahahahaha, I see, truly an easy choice.`
` Ahahahahahahahaha..."`
`"Say whatever you want.`
` This determination and choice are mine, ...and mine as the Successor."`
`The sparkle in George's eyes was brilliantly sharp.`
`...For just an instant, Gaap felt the same sense of threat as Kinzo's...and was slightly overwhelmed.`
`"......I see.`
` ...Yes, the same decision as Goldsmith...`
` ...So even with your innocent face, ...you will also become a terrible demon in the future.`
` ...What do you know, we might get along pretty well."`
`"You will succeed Goldsmith.`
` Eventually, I may even be summoned and serve you.`
` ...That could be surprisingly interesting.`
` ......Heheh."`
`Gaap had needed to change her opinion of George.`
`...This man bore a determination and resolve unimaginable from his outward appearance...`
`and not just now, but since the very beginning.`
`"I am prepared to inherit the Headship right away.`
` ......No, that's not it.`
` You told me to think as the Head in this test.`
` So I answered based on the premise that I am the Head."`
`"......No, even that's not it.`
` I thought as the Head himself.`
` ...I am now...the Head of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"............`
`Hehheheheheh...`
` Splendid, to think that you'd be able to go so far.`
` It seems you truly are one to be reckoned with.`
` ...Battler's and Maria's tests remain, but I've got a good feeling that you'll pass."`
`"......But only if that is your true, unexaggerated answer, you see?"`
`"......Do you doubt my resolve?"`
`"Can you carry out the option you chose?`
` Can you, right now, with your own hands, offer all the lives that exist on this island as sacrifices...?`
` By your own hand...?"`
`"I can.`
` I've said I was prepared to do so several times."`
`"Ha, ......hahahahahaha!`
` Then return to the guesthouse right away...and kill Battler and Maria!`
` When that's done, I'll bring you the other hostages.`
` Execute each of them except Shannon before her eyes!`
` You can do it, right?!"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"~ib~I can~ib~.`
` My resolve is on a whole different level from yours."`
`"............Nn.`
` Then carry it out!`
` Death for them all!`
` Complete this bloodstained ceremony as the new Ushiromiya Family Head...!!"`
`"...Understood.`
` I'll carry it out.`
` I'm already the Ushiromiya Family Head."`
`"Yes, that's right!`
` Stain that throne red by your own hands...!`
` You will become the king of the spirit world who controls the demons...!!"`
`Gaap was convinced.`
`This man truly was fitting to succeed Kinzo's madness...!`
`"Blow wind, cry thunder!!`
` Celebrate the birth of the new demon king!!`
` The demon island has now welcomed its new lord...!!"`
`In response to the demon's call, a tempest raged more and more.`
`Then, a massive lightning bolt fell, its tearing thunder and brilliant light giving the sensation of a moment of silence...`
`"So,`
` ......about the order of the murders.`
` I get to choose that, right?"`
`"Please, as you wish, your Majesty, the new demon king of Rokkenjima.`
` As your heart desires...!"`
`"......Well then, to start, `
`that means the first one's gonna be you. Got a problem with that?"`
`"............Huh?"`
`A gust of wind blew, ...stirring up George's jacket as if it was a cloak.`
`It was very much like the cloak worn by the Head.`
` It definitely carried that impression of dignity...`
`...At that time, ...Gaap truly did see the storm wiped away, and the sky covered with a pure-white and vast full moon.`
`'!s0`
`bore the full moon on his back...`
`and sneered at the demon.`
`"Even the lives of the entire Ushiromiya family...are now part of my fortune.`
` Reparations will be made for the damage that's been done.`
` And it won't come cheap."`
`"...You didn't seriously think you could take my parents, Aunt Natsuhi, Uncle Rudolf, Aunt Rosa,`
` and Genji-san's lives and expect me to overlook it, right?"`
`'!s1`
`......hohoh, `
`......impertinence..."`
`Ronove was trying to press his palm against Jessica's chest and stop her heart.`
`But right before he could, his hand stopped...`
`'!s0`
`...one...two small red flowers bloomed with a *plop* *plop*.`
`The seed of those flowers...`
`was way up high, `
`piercing into the heavens...`
`...on Jessica's fist.`
`Ronove's nose was stained red with spewing blood......`
`and those drops had been dripping onto the carpet.`
`"......By the way, that just now was my answer as a maiden.`
` ...My answer as the Successor is different."`
`"Allow me to ask..."`
`"...The person I love, my family and my relatives, everyone, everyone!!`
` I'll protect them.`
` If I'm the Head, then that's my duty!`
` Dad wasn't just swaggering around.`
` He protected me and Mom!!`
` ...He fought the pressure of succeeding the Ushiromiya family...for decades!!"`
`"That's why I know.`
` ...Being the Successor is nothing trivial.`
` ...So you know what?`
` I can give it up.`
` ...Betting my own life is something I can do easily!!"`
`Jessica knew.`
`She knew that in order to protect her family, her father had bluffed and fought alone continuously.`
`Jessica understood something that his back had been telling her!`
`Another left straight was buried into Ronove's face.`
`...That terrifying strike wasn't due just to the brass knuckles she was using.`
`It was a strike...`
`of a person, a Family Head, who could throw away everything in order to protect.`
`"If Dad's lost his qualifications to be the Successor,`
` then I, the next in line, will succeed the Headship.`
` ...Head of the Ushiromiya family, Ushiromiya Jessica!!`
` I'm not the kind of coward who'd let you do whatever you like any more!!"`
`"......A wonderful answer.`
` I shall change your score from earlier.`
` Plus 10 for that answer.`
` ...Plus 10 for that splendid left straight."`
`"Which means that...plus 20 more would make for a perfect 100, yeah?"`
`As Ronove jumped backwards, somersaulting in midair, he violently wiped away the blood pouring from his nose.`
`...It had become, not blood, but petals of a red rose.`
`The blood on his face was wiped off, ...and in its place...`
`was a grin filled with a delight he hadn't felt in so many centuries that he couldn't remember.`
`"I, Ronove, `
`will test to see whether your resolve is worth full marks, understand...?"`
`"Shut up, shut up!!`
` Come at meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`"Come, into the Abyss...!"`
`"Whaaa?!"`
`Suddenly, beneath George's feet, a pitch-black pitfall opened its mouth wide.`
` Of course, George had no way of resisting.`
`After being swallowed up by that, George fell out of a pitch-black hole that had opened up in the ceiling of the arbor.`
`As George fell down, `
`he was hit by a reverse roundhouse kick from a sharp stiletto heel, like a strike from a carefully aimed bee...!`
`The instant George, after being blown out of the arbor, thought that he'd be swallowed up by a rose bush...`
`Another pitch-black hole opened there and swallowed George up.`
`And this time, a pitch-black hole opened at Gaap's feet before her eyes, spitting a defenseless George out of it.`
`...At that time, Gaap had already finished the preparatory motions for the next reverse roundhouse kick.`
`"Ghh, ...what is...this...?"`
`"Welcome back. *giggle*!"`
`Right side of the head.`
` Below the right armpit.`
` Side of the right knee.`
`As Gaap danced and spun like a small cyclone,`
` she kept hitting him, left foot right foot left foot right foot, with successive roundhouse kicks.`
`The fourth one became a sweep, cutting George's feet out from under him and making him fall down, `
`but of course, there was no floor there, but a pitch-black hole, and George was swallowed up once again.`
`Gaap once again spun around like a small cyclone.`
`George was once again spat out from the ceiling of the arbor.`
`"......Take this and reflect. The Abyss ends with a single strike.`
` ...Die...!"`
`The sharp strike of the queen bee pierced the heavens like a rising cyclone.`
`It kicked through George's lower chest as he fell from the ceiling...`
`And then, ...time froze.`
`George was pinned in midair by Gaap's raised leg...`
`"Gah, ......mmph......"`
`Still pinned in midair, George moaned...`
`Then Gaap, with George still hung up on her foot, `
`...grinned.`
`"......I'll admit it.`
` At least your attitude is that of an adult.`
` But that's no good unless you have power to go with it.`
` ...Did you know?`
` They say you need three kinds of power to rule this world.`
` The first one is influence.`
` The second is wealth.`
` Do you know what the last one is?"`
`"I read it in a book.`
` ...Force, right...?"`
`"Correct.`
` And that's where you're lacking."`
`Gaap finally released George.`
`She kicked upwards one more time, changing into another roundhouse kick and knocking him into a pillar.`
`"No one will fear a monarch without influence, without wealth, or without force.`
` Kinzo possessed all three of those.`
` That's why he reigned as a tyrant!`
` ...If you're going to call yourself Kinzo's successor, try showing me a bit of that majesty, okay?"`
`"...Come ooon, how long are you gonna sleep there?`
` Stand up, okay?`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` If you don't, you'll `
`~ib~fall~ib~`
` again, see?"`
`"Pu ku ku ku.`
` Not bad movements.`
` But I feel they are slightly unfitting for a lady."`
`"Bastaaaaaaaaaaaaaard!!`
` Swaying around all over the place!!`
` Aren't you gonna strike back...? Don't take me lightly, you fuckin' bastard!!"`
`Ronove dodged skillfully, jumped back, and avoided Jessica's fist,`
` but he still didn't strike back himself.`
`Because of his dodge that was as rapid as a fluttering flag blown by strong winds, Jessica's fist wasn't even able to touch him.`
`Amidst the sensation that her own blood was boiling, Jessica regained her offensive composure.`
`Even though this room was large for a bedroom, it was a very cramped place to keep up such exaggerated dodges in for long.`
`...She calmly realized that and started using not just her fists, but her legs as well.`
`"...Hoh.`
` Boxing with just your arms makes you but half a fighter.`
` Your arms must be like the hot roar of a lion.`
` And your legs must be like the cold snake closing in on its prey."`
`"Snakes don't have legs!"`
`"Pu ku ku, true."`
`Jessica began cornering Ronove towards the wall with perfect footwork.`
` She didn't let him get around her.`
`...Ronove's magnificent dodges looked flashy, but they needed a large footing.`
`Once cornered, he wouldn't be able to dodge anymore...!`
`Jessica knew the characteristics of her weapon, the brass knuckle, very well.`
`This powerful weapon's most notable characteristic was how it didn't give the opponent a chance to defend.`
`Even if they blocked with their arm, that arm would receive direct damage.`
`...If it hit the wrong way, it might even break the bone.`
`So she cornered him.`
`With this fist, ...she'd whittle away at this demon who'd lost any way to escape!!`
`"Whoops...!`
` Oh, when did...?"`
`"Looks like I've finally cornered you, right...?`
` Where is everyone being held?`
` Where's that damn geezer?`
` You tell me everything, and I'll let you off with nothing more than plucking that mustache off, got it?"`
`"That would be a problem.`
` It does take me an hour every morning to set this."`
`"Once you're in a cast, you won't even be able to do that, right?!"`
`"......Whoops.`
` .........Gggh."`
`Ronove had blocked Jessica's fist with his arm.`
`He tried to act as though it was no big deal, but it must have hurt a lot.`
`...Jessica grinned.`
`Ronove smiled the same way, but twitched slightly.`
`"...I see.`
` This certainly does hurt."`
`"Here's my last bit of advice.`
` Cry and apologize."`
`"That, I cannot do.`
` It would ruin my image."`
`"Then just crumple.`
` Rapid fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiire!!!"`
`Jessica's fists were buried into Ronove.`
`But there was a resistance that seemed too hard...and the sound of breaking glass, which startled Jessica.`
`At a glance, it looked like Ronove had caught Jessica's fist with his palm.`
` ...That wasn't quite true.`
`When Ronove opened his hand, a faint, purple, glowing barrier like a glass shield appeared,`
` stopping the attack by a hair's breadth.`
`Pulling herself together, Jessica let her fists fly again, but with a truly magnificent gesture, Ronove caught all of them...`
`"I am, after all, a demon.`
` This level of magic is nothing.`
` ......Even so, you aren't bad at all.`
` If I were a Human, I would probably resign right here.`
` Because I am a demon, I can still continue to fight."`
`"...Wh-What are you trying to pull......?!"`
`"Is this the end?`
` ...Are you simply going to attack all the time, while neglecting your defense?"`
`'!s0`
` ...Waaah!!"`
`Ronove's palm shot to within a hair's breadth of Jessica's stomach.`
`Jessica was knocked away by the purple shield, rolled backwards, and smashed her head on the bed.`
`"My shield cannot be broken by a mere Human.`
` Don't think that you'll ever be able to touch my body again."`
`"...In that case, ...I'll just burst through that shield...!!"`
`"Persistent, I see.`
` Yes, a truly fitting spirit for the Successor.`
` ...Perhaps I'll be your opponent for just a while longer.`
` This is also part of an examiner's role.`
` ......Pukkukukukukuku!"`
`"Breeeeeeeeeeeaaaak, aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!"`
`Gaap looked down on George, sneering.`
`George was on a path in the rose garden, lying face-down in a puddle.`
`The merciless rain beat down on him, so that it looked as though even the heavens were mocking him...`
`"......Ahhahahahahahaha.`
` Stand up, okay?`
` You'll fall again, right?"`
`"............"`
`George stood up shakily.`
`...It seemed his spirit hadn't given in, but the damage done to his body was fairly significant.`
`"Beg for your life.`
` What you're doing now is the same as the fourth option of choosing nothing.`
` ...You chose the third option, right?`
` If you get down on your hands and knees and apologize, I'll forgive your rudeness towards me."`
`"Then, I'll guide you down to the dungeon.`
` There, for your beloved Shannon and your own powerless life, you will kill the other hostages one by one.`
` ...You can do it, right?`
` You did boast about having that resolve.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"............"`
`George didn't answer.`
`...But his gaze was still obstinately resisting surrender.`
`"...If you are too obstinate, then this time you really will fall to the deepest depths of the Abyss, okay...?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`Gaap's strength was evident.`
`...That was probably clear, even more than it was to George himself,`
` to Shannon's group watching through the three-sided mirror...`
`"......George-sama...`
` ...That's...`
`......enough......`
` ...For someone like me..."`
`"Nee-san..."`
`'!s1`
`...you wouldn't have to fight with anyone, right, George-sama...?`
` Then please, abandon me...`
` Please forget me..."`
`There was no way that voice could have reached George.`
`...But, even so, `
`...George answered.`
`"No way.`
` ......I won't...surrender."`
`"...Oh?`
` Why not...?"`
`"......Because that's...my resolve.`
` ...I'll fight everything for Shannon's sake.`
` And I'll make everything accept us...`
`...and bless us."`
`"Hey, could you tell me something?`
` Why are you willing to go so far for that furniture called Shannon?`
` ......She's just a washout, isn't she?`
` Rubbish furniture that couldn't even make a satisfactory waitress."`
`"......I won't permit any more insults against the woman I love."`
`"So what are you going to do about it?`
` How could a weak kid like you resist me...?"`
`"Loving someone is strength.`
` ...Because I learned that, I was able to become strong.`
` ......'Shannon,`
` I love you'.`
` With just those words, I can stand back up, over and over again."`
`"Shannon's in the dungeon, right?`
` Professing your love to me won't-"`
`"No.`
` She heard.`
` ...That's because it's love.`
` Shannon can hear my words right now.`
` The reason I can believe that...is because of love."`
`".........You......"`
`『Shannon,`
` you aren't furniture.`
` ...Even if you are furniture, you're mine alone, the only one for me in the world.`
` I want you to be close to me as long as we live.`
` ...I need you for all eternity.』`
`"......G-George-sama........."`
`"...I'm jealous.`
` He's surpassed my husband in smooth talking."`
`"...Th-That's youth for you."`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` The strength of love?`
` Then why are you so weak, boy?`
` Does that weakness mean your love is also that weak?`
` *giggle*giggle*!`
` Even your love for your fiancée is weak.`
` The way your parents died so quickly was weak.`
` Everything about your life is weak."`
`"......Shannon taught me about love and strength.`
` If you're trying to measure my love towards Shannon by my strength alone, `
`...let me teach you about my love."`
`"*giggle* So you say.`
` ...I get it now.`
` You're saying that the way you can still stand up after being kicked down so many times is the strength you received from Shannon."`
`"In that case, what did you receive from your parents, who got killed way too easily?`
` ......?"`
`At that time, there was a blackout.`
` ...Even though they were outside?`
`"......N-No.`
` ......Th-This is......"`
`'!s0`
`......was the bottom...`
`of George's...`
`...`
`shoe...`
`"......Side kick.`
` Nasal bone fractured."`
`It had stopped right in front of the tip of Gaap's nose.`
`"The thing I got from Mom was this kick."`
`Several moments after, Gaap jumped back.`
`Of course, that was too late.`
`If George hadn't stopped, he would probably have caused the damage he'd announced.`
`"And what I got from Dad...`
`...is fortitude."`
`Anger with a low boiling point isn't something to be truly feared.`
`...True anger is disciplined by fortitude.`
`"......I recognize your violent method of declaring your intentions.`
` ...I also see that you've slandered my fiancée and my parents' honor.`
` And you have no intention of taking back what you said, yes...?"`
`"...Y-You..."`
`"I now understand your attacks more than enough, `
`......so maybe it's about time. Time to start fighting back."`
`"Q-Quit prattling, foolish boy...!!"`
`A pitch-black hole opened its mouth at George's feet.`
`But George rapidly opened his legs, straddling the hole.`
` The same move won't work again...!`
`It was an extremely smooth dodge, and the upper part of his body didn't even quiver.`
`"Fortitude means calmly analyzing how your opponent will act, instead of losing your cool.`
` ......Why?`
` Isn't it obvious?`
` Can't you guess?"`
`"N-N-No, I can't..."`
`"It's to counter, to give back exactly what you got, to make them not want to take another pass at you,`
` to make them cover their face in tears and snot and forget to wash it off,`
` to make them want to rub their forehead on the ground and apologize over and over, to completely, perfectly, and thoroughly...!!!`
` ...Beat them until they can't get up."`
`George dashed.`
`Pitfalls opened one after another, but George didn't step in them again.`
`And, because he was persistent, he was able to reach Gaap a second time...`
`"......Reverse roundhouse.`
` Jaw fractured."`
`".........!"`
`It was stretched out more forcefully and beautifully than Gaap's had been.`
`Of course, while it centered directly on Gaap's face, it stopped a hair's breadth away.`
`Perhaps she couldn't rely on pitfalls at this close range.`
`Gaap kicked at George's shins as a diversion,`
` and in the instant of weakness when he tried to deal with that, she aimed a kick at his stomach.`
`It was a bee-like stab by her stiletto heel.`
`...But it sliced through the air where George no longer was.`
`"......High axe kick.`
` Collarbone fractured."`
`"......Gah-"`
`By Gaap's side,`
` George calmly announced that, his foot still raised.`
`If that monarch's heel had swung down, a collarbone fracture would probably have been the least of her worries.`
`"This guy's...`
`...stronger than me...at close range...?!`
` I need distance...!"`
`She jumped backwards to open a large gap between them.`
`She jumped and jumped and leapt and even flipped in midair, increasing that distance.`
`It should have been magnificent, but for some reason, it was very similar to the movements of a small, scared animal.`
`If she opened the distance between them, she'd be able to fight at the range that was her specialty, using a mixture of pitfalls and kicking techniques...!`
`"You fool, ...you'll regret the pride that made you let three chances of defeating me slide...as you fall into the depths of the Abyss!!`
` .........Huh?"`
`When she magnificently landed and tried to aim a pitfall,`
` a razor-sharp wind cut Gaap's bangs.`
` ...Yes, it cut them.`
`It happened twice.`
` ...This time, it didn't just stop a hair's breadth away, but scattered her bangs with its air pressure...`
`"......Armada com martelo.`
` ...The fundus of the eye fractured with the first strike.`
` Cerebral contusion with the second strike."`
`"............!!!"`
`Gaap was too shocked to speak.`
`George had closed in over all that distance in an instant, letting off a fearsomely nimble midair double-kick.`
`...Furthermore, with the accuracy and edge of a razor, it had cut nothing more than several of her bangs.`
`"I learned the power of kicks from karate, `
`speed from tae kwon do, `
`and freedom of range from capoeira.`
` ...Mom was pretty fickle.`
` But I've learned from studying various merits."`
`"...Wh-Why don't you hit me...?`
` ...You aren't going to say it's because I'm a woman, right?!!"`
`"...You spoke of force as a monarch's third power.`
` It looks like you still misunderstand the meaning of that force.`
` ...In this situation, force doesn't mean hastily wielded violence.`
` ......It refers to a deterrent, knowledge that if someone opposes the monarch, that person won't get away unharmed."`
`"A deterrent, ...you say...?"`
`In short, this is what it meant.`
`This was why all of George's attacks up until then had stopped a hair's breadth away.`
`These bare misses, which were more difficult than hitting directly, had all been performed so splendidly.`
`...Also, if George had wished it, any one of those would probably have crushed Gaap.`
`He had, daringly, not done that.`
`"You said it yourself, right?`
` Force is the power to control.`
` ......If you crush your opponent with force, you won't be able control them, right?`
`A monarch's force is something that is only shown.`
` He does not crush.`
` He makes others surrender and adds them to his own fortune."`
`"If you start blowing bubbles, I won't be able to make you guide me to where the hostages are."`
`Gaap had to admit it.`
`She had to admit that George understood force in its truest sense...!`
`"You'll take me to where everyone is.`
` I would advise against resisting.`
` ...I won't stop short next time."`
`"...Ack!!`
` ......Sorry, Lia. Lemme borrow your troops.`
` This guy's too much for me alone to handle!!"`
`As a large, pitch-black hole opened in the sky,`
` *thunk* *thunk* *thunk*, three muscular goat attendants fell out.`
` They surrounded George.`
`"......Reinforcements?`
` Should I take this to mean that you take back all that about me being weak?"`
`"...I-I admit it.`
` ...I made light of your...Human power..."`
`"That's wrong.`
` This is the strength of a man who's experienced love."`
`"H-How can you say stuff like that with a straight face?!!`
` Come, goats!`
` Crush this man and turn him into meatballs!"`
`"*giggle* These goats are stupid, but it looks like they at least have power.`
` I'll turn you into a corpse that even your fiancée won't be able to recognize!"`
`"You refuse to surrender and intend to continue fighting. Understood.`
` ...Know that from now on, you will receive real harm proportional to your own attacks."`
`"If you still plan on attacking me, prepare to sustain a great deal of damage."`
`When George proclaimed that, `
`...a faint, red magic circle rose up around him.`
`It seemed that George couldn't see it.`
`However, Gaap, being a demon, could.`
`"...M-Magic?!`
` Why does this guy have a defensive barrier...?!`
` And that's also...a counterattacking type...?!`
` Is this...wh-what you meant by a deterrent...?!"`
`From a demon's perspective, that may have been magic.`
`But in George's eyes, it was...determination.`
`It was a determination filled with certainty, ...which would be merciless to anyone who wished to fight anymore...`
`and which would force them to prepare for a significant counterattack.`
`Determination with certainty...becomes magic.`
`Ronove had been accurately blocking Jessica's fists with his shield.`
` ...But something felt odd.`
`Even though he was certainly catching them on the shield, `
`he felt his arm get jarred, and it hurt.`
`It should have prevented all physical damage.`
`...However, the damage from her fists was gradually being transmitted to his arm, piling up.`
`Ronove tried to act like he was composed, so that this wouldn't be noticed...`
`"H-Heheh...!!`
` I'm not gonna get worn out.`
` What's wrong, old guy?`
` Starting to get a little tough...?!"`
`"...No matter how much you attack, it is useless.`
` Why can't you understand that you cannot break my shield?"`
`"I'm not gonna stop hitting you just because it won't break.`
` ......No matter how hard someone's heart is, if you keep on talking to them little by little, it'll eventually start to crack...!`
` I believe it!!`
` I believe that useless effort doesn't exist in this world!!"`
`"That's why I can live...to the fullest!!`
` If words will eventually make it through, then the same goes for fists...!!`
` 'Give up' isn't written anywhere in my dictionary!!"`
`Those words were probably aimed at Kanon...`
`Kanon, who had seemed to reject Jessica's words.`
`...But Jessica knew that, no matter how stubborn his heart was, those words would eventually soak through.`
`She believed that they would surely reach his heart, that the day would come when he would stop calling himself furniture and disparaging himself,`
` ...and that he'd step out into a new life.`
`So Jessica didn't give up.`
` She didn't lose heart...!`
`"It's stupid, right?`
` I'll bet a guy couldn't understand, right?`
` A girl in love doesn't even think about giving up just because it's useless!!"`
`At that time, Ronove certainly saw.`
`He saw the reddish glow of light that encircled Jessica's fists.`
`"......This is...not good.`
` ...An enchantment, is it?`
` ...This permeating upgrade...will be troublesome."`
`Inside her unrelenting fists and determination...dwelled the power to succeed no matter what.`
`From a demon's perspective, that was magic.`
`Determination with certainty...becomes magic.`
`"See?`
` Nothing useless about it.`
` ...Looks like my fists are making it through.`
` Guard your arm, old guy."`
`"......It seems I will have to get a little more serious.`
` ...It appears it is as you said.`
` ...In this world, nothing is useless."`
`"That's right...!`
` If you give up because something's useless, that's when your life ends...!`
` You'll get through.`
` ...You can be sure of that...!!"`
`I'm an idiot, so this is the only way I can live,`
` but even so, ...I'm sure I'll be able to teach Kanon-kun...`
`about a new world someday!!`
`So I'm not gonna lose heart in a place like this...!!`
`I'll definitely defeat you...`
`and save everyone!!`
`"Damn!!`
` Got to somehow...open a hole... Aaaaaaaaaaaaargghhh!!!"`
`Krauss was repeating his useless effort to somehow open a hole between the metal bars.`
`...Useless.`
` ......Nothing is useless.`
` There's nothing...`
`The lookout goats had been swallowed up by those black pitfalls and disappeared.`
`...Now was their once-in-a-lifetime chance.`
`This was their only chance to break the bars...`
`"S-Stop it, it's impossible, Krauss-san!`
` There's nothing we can do with our bare hands!`
` Let's look for a tool, don't waste time on the impossible...!"`
`"If you give up because it's useless, then it's all over. That's what my daughter said.`
` ...Even if my body won't fit, as long as a small person like Shannon or Kanon can make it through...!!"`
`"...Now that we've reached this point, action is more important than racking our brains.`
` Let's work together, I'll do it too...!`
` ...Kanon-kun, you're a boy, aren't you? Lend a hand...!`
` ...Kanon-kun?!"`
`"......Krauss-sama,`
` please stand back."`
`"What?`
` What are you planning...?"`
`"...Okay, Nee-san?`
` ......Just one more time, let's try struggling."`
`"......Yes.`
` ...I too...will struggle one more time.`
` ...No, not just one more time.`
` ...Over and over again."`
`Jessica's voice had reached Kanon.`
`It certainly had permeated into his cold, rock-like heart.`
`And George's voice had reached Shannon.`
`If the love he had shown was embodied by strength, she would have to respond in the same way.`
`An incredible metal sound rang out.`
`......In the first flash, several metal bars were severed horizontally, and in the next flash, they were severed horizontally again,`
` causing many metal bars to clatter to the ground like bamboo shoots cut by a sword.`
`Krauss, Kyrie, and Nanjo didn't even have a clue what had just happened...`
`"...Doctor Nanjo,`
` which way down the corridor goes to the mansion...?"`
`"......O-Oh, of course!`
` In and to the left, ...in and to the left...!"`
`"Let's go, Krauss-sama.`
` ...Virgilia-sama will notice us at any moment now."`
`"What in the world...`
`...are you guys...?"`
`"......We are..."`
`When Kanon hung his head a little and faltered, Shannon slapped his shoulder, smiled, and spoke.`
`"We're Human."`
`"V-Virgilia-sama!!`
` Response from the lookout web, it's a jailbreak!`
` The goat guards aren't there for some reason...!!"`
`"...Whaaat?! Why?!`
` ......It's Gaap, isn't it?`
` Taking someone else's summonings without asking!!`
` ...Gap!`
` Gapgap!!`
`"`
`"...Confirming Battle Regulations.`
` Requesting permission to fire at the escapees."`
`"Do it...!`
` Kill them, kiii-!!`
` Gapgapgap, `
`gap, `
`gya!!!"`
`"Understood.`
` 45, 410, Prepare for Sniping Pursuit Combat.`
` Ammo Type, Guided Cluster Rounds.`
` ...Virgilia-sama, an escape prevention barrier, if you would."`
`"Owowowow...`
` Y-Yes, you're right.`
` Hohhoho, I won't let you escape from here.`
` ...Owow, bit my tongue saying Gapgap..."`
`The underground passage in front of them was once again blocked by metal bars.`
` The door was, of course, locked.`
`...However, that was no problem for them now.`
`"Kanon, it's those metal bars again!`
` We're counting on you...!"`
`"Yes, Krauss-sama...!"`
`"...Still, that's incredible.`
` ...I wonder what kind of principle it works on."`
`"I'm not interested in principles.`
` All that matters is that he can sever the metal bars...and that we can escape from here...!"`
`"Don't worry, Kanon, do it!"`
`"Leave it to me...!"`
`Kanon sliced the metal bars again with his red curved blade.`
`But there was a harsh, strange noise, and the metal bars only had a slight scratch.`
`"Wh-What's this?`
` ...These are sturdy..."`
`"Wrong.`
` ...They're enchanted!`
` It's one of Virgilia-sama's magic locks."`
`"Can you cut through it?"`
`"Of course.`
` But it will take time."`
`"We'll wait three minutes...!"`
`After taking a deep breath and concentrating his mind, Kanon extended a red curved sword again.`
`When he pressed it hard against the metal bars, sparks sprayed, almost as though he was melting through it with a burner.`
`"It looks like we'll be able to cut it, ...but it'll be tough."`
`"......Krauss-sama,`
` you've been targeted by the enemy.`
` Please move back."`
`"Huh?`
` Pursuers?`
` There's no one coming!"`
`"Please get behind me.`
` They're aiming for you...!!"`
`"45, Data Received.`
` Target Lock Acquired. Commencing Terrain Calculation Error Correction.`

`"45, Firing Preparations Concluded.`

`"410, nihhihihihi!`
` Firiiing!!"`
`A golden arrow that sparkled gold was fired, leaving a gold tail streaming behind.`
`It drew a curve, went through the door, through the keyhole, down the stairs, towards the underground path at full speed...!`
`"S-Something shone!!"`
`"...You can't block the golden arrow with a shield.`
` Kanon-kun, Interception Stance.`
` Let's link."`
`"Gatekeeper, understood.`
` ......It's been a long time since I've fought with you, Nee-san.`
` Don't screw up."`
`"Yeah.`
` I'll be serious."`
`"Then there's no problem!"`
`Kanon stopped cutting the bars and stood in front of Shannon.`
`Behind him, Shannon closed her eyes, concentrating her mind deep, deep into the darkness of the underground path...`
`A Guided Cluster Round is a special kind of arrow made up of 48 sub-rounds bound together.`
`It explodes mid-flight and divides into 48 mini-arrows.`
`The strength of each individual one is low, but they pierce through all shields and possess a perfect wounding and killing power against personnel.`
`And on top of that, each one of the 48 possesses autonomous guidance towards their individual targets.`
`"......It shone.`
` ...It's divided..."`
`"Confirming Guided Cluster Round Division.`
` 46...7...8... ...48 Sub-rounds, All Rounds Locked Onto.`
` Interception Control. Data Link to Kanon."`
`"Kanon, Data Received.`
` ...You're incredible, Nee-san.`
` You can actually 'see' all 48."`
`"Concentrate on Interception Prioritization.`
` Trust your Nee-san."`
`"Of course.`
` I don't even need to open my eyes."`
`"Commencing Interception."`
`"T-Target Unharmed!!`
` I-It was intercepted...!!"`
`"Nihyah?!`
` All 48 of them?!"`
`"Hohohoh...`
` After all, Shannon and Kanon were originally a furniture pair.`
` They're strong when they're together.`
` ...Owowow.`
` ...Is this gonna become a mouth ulcer or something...?"`
`"Calm down, Reload.`
` ...Updating Ammo Type.`
` Precision Light-Speed Sniper Rounds.`
` Preparing for Precision Sniping."`
`"Sounds good nyeh, impossible to intercept super high-speed rounds!`
` Impossible for a mere Gatekeeper to defend against nyeh!"`
`"Precision Sniping, roger that.`
` Commencing Collection of Precision Firing-use Data......"`
`"Wh-What in the world was that just now...?"`
`"Don't worry, I don't have a clue either...`
` All I know is that we would've died if not for these two..."`
`"Kanon-kun, thanks.`
` Go back to the metal bars.`
` The next shot will probably be one we can't intercept."`
`"How can we defend against such an attack...?!"`
`"We don't let them shoot.`
` ...Kanon-kun, Initiate Spirit Particle Combat Countermeasures."`
`At those words, Kanon closed his eyes tightly and ground his teeth.`
`...With Shannon at the center, a pressure and impact that only nonhumans could perceive struck.`
`"...Huh?!`
` Firing System Error!!`
` No good, Rebooting...`
` Huh huh?!"`
`"It's Spirit Wave Jamming! Activate Spirit Particle Safeguards, hurry!`
` What are you doing?! Cover your ears quickly, 45!!!"`
`An unseen, unheard impact had struck the Chiester Sisters.`
`00 and 410 crouched down, covering their ears, ...but 45 didn't make it in time.`
`...As she stood bolt upright, her eyes rolled.`
`'!s0`
` ...Kyuu? Kyu-!`
` Kyu-`
`kyu-`
`kyu-!!!"`
`"45 got damaged...!`
` Her IME's busted...!!`
` ...Nn, gya, ...the noise...is also horrible for me nyeh..."`
`'!s1`
`410, `
`...and 00, `
`Damaged...`
` Abandoning Sniping Posture.`
` ...Ack, it came straight through the link...`
` I-If we don't reboot..."`
`Raising their spirit particle sensitivity for precision sniping had backfired.`
`They had taken the full brunt of the spirit particle shock wave Shannon had released,`
` and not only 45, who had been hit directly, but also 00 and 410, who had been linked with her, were taken down.`
`"Are you okay?!`
` ...I'll make you some more delicious black tea later, so get ahold of yourselves!"`
`"...M-My apologies, sir...`
` Rebooting.`
` Please wait several hundred seconds..."`
`All of the Chiester Sisters had fallen over.`
`They would probably get back up eventually, but it looked like it would be hard for them to return to the battle lines for a while.`
`"So, furniture was able to repel weapons, if only for a moment.`
` ......I see, a plot to entertain that child truly will be filled with unexpected turns!"`
`Virgilia tore the air with a large gesture, motioning as though opening a door.`
`"Come, arise, goat attendants...!`
` It's time to work.`
` Catch and kill the escapees.`
` Corpses are fine, we can just revive them anyway!"`
`A gold-colored door opened in the air...and countless giant goats with muscular bodies peeked their faces out...`
`"Come now, hurry.`
` There are five escapees, so the fastest five of you win!`
` There will be a wonderful prize, so give it your all, give it your all!"`
`Virgilia clapped her hands, urging them on.`
`A prize?!`
` After facing each other at those words, the goats all rushed to the door at once, trying to get out,`
` making the exit as packed as the Touzai or the Yamanote rail lines in the morning.`
`Each wanted to get out first, so none of them could get out.`
`...Virgilia held her head in frustration.`
`By that time, Kanon had managed to cut enough bars to make a crack that could be slipped through.`
`It had been a bit of work for Krauss, large as he was, and Nanjo, with his lethal waist,`
` but even so, they all managed to make it through.`
`But after they did, they only had a couple seconds to be relieved.`
`Immediately, another set of metal bars blocked the way in front of them.`
`"This certainly is secure.`
` ...I'll bet they really didn't want the people in here to escape."`
`"Kanon, sorry, but I'll have to ask you again.`
` ...It may be tough, but please...!"`
`There was sweat on Kanon's forehead.`
`You could tell at a glance that cutting the metal bars, which had been made even more solid by magic, had physically exhausted him.`
`"...Yes, leave it to me, Krauss-sama."`
`"Only you can do it!`
` Please, we're counting on you...!"`
`Only he...could do it.`
`...Holding tightly onto those words,`
` Kanon concentrated his mind once again and set himself to the task of cutting metal bars again.`
`"......Enemies are coming from behind. Multiple targets."`
`"Yeah, this time even we can tell.`
` ...The ground's really shaking.`
` I can tell that some ridiculous monsters are rushing at us."`
`"Don't worry.`
` I'll use a magic lock to make a blockade of the metal bars we just came through.`
` Mere goats won't be able to break it."`
`Shannon held her hand out towards the metal bars they had gone through.`
`...But she stopped right away.`
`"Wh-What is it...?"`
`"Virgilia-sama has started neutralizing the Spirit Wave Jamming...`
` It'll be bad if it's broken, and we'll lose the initiative once the Chiester Sisters are rebooted...!"`
`"I'll make you pay in full for bullying these cute bunnies."`
`"If you're trying to gain the advantage with those clever spirit particles of yours, I'll tear all that away and rob you of them."`
`"Nee-san, concentrate on the Spirit Wave Jamming! The gap in those metal bars is too narrow for those goats.`
` It should hold them back for a while...!"`
`"I don't have a clue what you're saying, but-"`
`"We know it's something pretty bad."`
`Kyrie picked up a metal bar that Kanon had just cut.`
`Krauss had no weapon, but he rubbed his fists, and the two of them glared into the depths of the underground passage where the shaking was coming from.`
`"...I believe these are the final metal bars blocking the way."`
`"How far is it to the mansion from here?"`
`"Quite a walk...`
` The path is even, but I seem to remember walking for 30 minutes..."`
`"So if we run all out, it'll be half that time."`
`They couldn't tell for sure, since they didn't have the three-sided mirror,`
` but there was no guarantee that George and Jessica would still be all right against demon opponents after all this time.`
`"...If we run at twice the speed of walking, it'll be 15 minutes.`
` And twice that speed would make it eight minutes."`
`"And if we sprint all out at double that speed, it won't even take 5.`
` No problem."`
`"Wh-What an unreasonable calculation...`
` But that's how you calculate in a fire...!"`
`"...My sincere apologies, everyone.`
` Please watch my back...!"`
`"Leave it to us.`
` Kanon, you cut the bars as fast as you can.`
` Shannon, you concentrate on jamming this witch called Virgilia or whatever.`
` Kyrie-san and I will defend against our pursuers...!"`
`Then, the roars of beasts rang out from the darkness, and several fiery, glowing, bright-red eyes appeared.`
`Goats that were several levels more massive than the guards were rushing with an incredible force.`
`The tremors they created were almost like an earthquake.`
`They brought a frightening intensity and terror, but Kyrie actually laughed with relief.`
`...Those massive bodies wouldn't be able to go through the crack in the bars!`
`The group of goats crashed into the metal bars with a fierce sound like that of a train colliding with a dead end.`
`Clumps of dirt fell here and there from the ceiling, and you could tell that the metal bars had bent as if collapsing.`
`...Their charging power probably was on par with a train.`
`If the metal bars hadn't been there, they would likely have overwhelmed the five of them and crushed them in an instant.`
`When the group of goats pressing up against the metal bars noticed the five people right in front of them,`
` they let out a terrible howl, trying to intimidate the five.`
`...Or maybe that was out of pain from their game of push and shove.`
`One calm goat among them figured out what should be done about the metal bars, `
`then grabbed two of them with its massive arms and began bending them as though opening double doors.`
`'!s0`
` The goat let out a roar of anguish.`
`It probably hurt a lot, but that was all.`
`It wasn't enough to bring it down...`
`"Krauss-san...!!"`
`"Whoooaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`Still holding the metal pole she had stuck out, Kyrie relinquished the opposite tip to Krauss.`
`Krauss ran there with all his might, jumped up and kicked down with all his weight and kicking power combined...!`
`All of that destructive power was focused on a single pole, drilling it in!!`
`"...A-Are you okay?`
` Please don't rub the affected area.`
` I'll prescribe some medicine later. Take care..."`
`As the goat who'd taken a pile bunker to its vitals writhed with teary eyes,`
` it nodded its head.`
`"Looks like our link isn't that bad either.`
` We won't lose to Shannon-chan and Kanon-kun."`
`"Naturally, for a loving family like us."`
`"We can do it if we take them together!`
` Next, that one on the right!"`
`"Understood...!`
` You really are a good wife. That Rudolf must have grumbled a little too much."`
`"Ooh, tell me about it later.`
` Rudolf-san, suddenly turning pale in heaven won't do you any good, okay?"`
`The goats' massive bodies were buried in rose bushes.`
`Even taking into account that a leg's power is three times that of an arm's, this strength surpassed common sense.`
`To think that those massive bodies had been kicked in the chin and flown through the air... It was too fierce!`
`Even George seemed a little surprised.`
`"...To think that my kick works on monsters too.`
` Now there's a shock."`
`"......It's because of your counterattack-style barrier.`
` ...The attacking power that grazes you is added on to your own.`
` ...Your kick has been supplemented by those monsters' superhuman strength..."`
`"Oh...?`
` ...I don't really get it, but isn't that just perfect for me?`
` ...No matter who attacks me, they should be prepared for a counterattack of equal measure.`
` Nonaggressive defense.`
` That's my policy."`
`That's why Gaap couldn't easily touch him.`
`The counterattack-style barrier had no defensive power.`
`However, because of its countering ability, it could be useful in defense by making the opponent hesitate to attack.`
`The goats had been foolish and so had attacked without worrying,`
` but this second effect had worked in full against Gaap.`
`"These guys really are dull.`
` When your power's even, it's always an advantage to have a smaller build."`
`He lightly dodged the log-like arms.`
`When those arms touched the barrier that protected George, they let off a strong, red light.`
`...The tip of the counterattacking foot would then gain the same sparkle...and the superhuman power of the goat added to its own.`
`The second goat fell forward and floated in the air for a second.`
`Then, George's next roundhouse kick missed right over the falling goat's head.`
`...For an instant, the goat hoped it might get away with its life.`
`But no!!`
` A heel was dropped onto the back of its head, and it was forced to kiss the ground.`
`"...Going from a high roundhouse kick into a neri chagi is pretty basic, right?`
` Works pretty well every now and then."`
`"This guy's...a problem, `
`...seriously, a problem...!!"`
`"What do you mean, demons? What do you mean, witches?`
` ......The rulers of Rokkenjima are the Ushiromiya family.`
` I'll make you physically aware of that."`
`"......Yoooooooooooouuuuuu......!!"`
`The only way to finish off George, now that his body was wrapped up in a counterattack-style barrier, ...was to deny him a chance to counterattack.`
`...Nothing to do but suck him into the Abyss next, then kick and drop him, kick and drop him, kick and drop him...`
`until she kicked him to death!!!`
`But George had already completely seen through the faint warning signs that told of the appearance of Gaap's pitfalls.`
`...If he could jump over that next pitfall,`
` ...then this time, he would probably pulverize Gaap's head with his whirlwind-like kick, without holding back in the slightest,`
` ...just as had been done to his parents.`
`She was able to envision that scene vividly.`
`Gaap hated Kinzo more than ever for calling her out to this ridiculous island...!`
`Even though Ronove held out a shield, he had finally started using his hands.`
`Without a more powerful shield, he wouldn't be able to block Jessica's fists anymore.`
`The enchantment on Jessica's fists grew the more she fought.`
`The permeating upgrade had already grown several times,`
` and those fists had also been given an impact upgrade, a piercing upgrade, and a speed upgrade, making them fists worthy to fight on par with a demon...`
`"......What's wrong?!`
` Starting to get tired?!`
` You're getting all slow!!"`
`"No.`
` Your movements and thoughts and kinetic vision have been rapidly enchanted.`
` ......My movements have not changed from the beginning.`
` ...Your movements are beginning to catch up to me."`
`"And you still won't fight back...?!!"`
`"This is my style.`
` ...However, I cannot allow it to continue at this rate.`
` It's about time for me to get serious and end this...!!"`
`Ronove's face turned into an expression he hadn't shown before.`
`It was full of respect for Jessica in a truly demonic way.`
`Because it was an expression he only showed for enemies who made him get serious.`
`"Whooaa?!?!`
` What the?!"`
`With a gesture of his whole body that you couldn't call elegant, Ronove held out a shield with all his strength, a shield the size and thickness of a wall.`
`It was more tenacious than a simple shield.`
`It literally was a wall.`
`And on top of that, with all of Ronove's magical power, it pushed Jessica back bit by bit.`
`...Did he plan on pushing her back against the wall and crushing her to death?`
`Jessica tried to break through the wall with both fists, but it was solid.`
` ...Without any exaggeration, it was solid!`
`"Is this what you call serious...?!!`
` No problem, I'll break right through iiiiiiiiiiitt!!"`
`"I will not let you this time.`
` This wall is somewhat different.`
` ...Here, allow me to enchant it as well."`
`When Ronove made a magic sign almost like a ninja, `
`the wall glowed red for just an instant...and some kind of ominous power dwelt within it.`
`Jessica was able to recognize that almost immediately with her body.`
`Every time her fists hit the wall, pain as though glass fragments had scattered and hit all over her body rebounded against her.`
`"I upgraded it with attack-reactive armor.`
` An exceptional item that will decrease the force of your attacks by counterbalancing them...`
`and which can even counterattack with reactive fragments."`
`"...It's perfectly fine to keep punching it, but doing so will damage you as well."`
`"Heh, ...heheh!!`
` In short, it's an endurance test between me and your wall?!!`
` No problem!!"`
`"Will you fall to your knees first, or be pushed into the wall first?`
` ...Allow me to observe."`
`"Except I might break through it and smash that whole wall along with your face, right?!`
` Watch iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`Without hesitation, Jessica punched using both fists.`
` Each time she did, a large amount of shards scattered, torturing her entire body.`
`Instantly, several red gashes appeared all over her...`
`She grimaced at the intense agony, but her eyes were burning with fighting spirit, and her lips curved in a grin that stood in sharp contrast to the pain...!`
`"Kanon, are you done yet?!`
` We're fine, `
`...but the metal bars blocking them don't seem to be...!"`
`"Just...a little more...!"`
`"There's no stopping these guys...`
` These metal bars might break just from them shoving each other!"`
`The group of goats made the metal bars creak.`
`Several arms grabbed the bars, twisting them with superhuman strength.`
`...However, some bars were being pulled in opposite directions by different hands.`
`Apparently, they really were stupid.`
`The way those countless hands grabbed the metal bars...sometimes happened to match up by chance.`
`Several hands grasping two metal bars neatly put their power together and pulled the bars to the left and right.`
`The incredible sound of metal bending could be heard, and that crack was getting larger bit by bit...!`
`They attacked the arms of those goats one by one, but they weren't getting anywhere.`
`They couldn't stop the gap from spreading left and right...!`
`At that time, there was a loud metal sound behind them.`
`Kanon had finally finished cutting.`
`"Quickly!!"`
`"Kyrie-san, ladies first.`
` You go next, Doctor Nanjo!"`
`"Krauss-sama, please leave this place to me...!`
` Nng, ...this is?!"`
`Kanon's red sword that had cut the metal bars disappeared.`
`"...Sorry!`
` We've entered Virgilia-sama's Spirit Particle Area of Influence!!`
` Our magic power has been neutralized!"`
`"Hohhohhoh.`
` How dare you resist me this far... I, who was called a Great Witch.`
` You can no longer use your magic in that underground passage."`
`A magic circle column drew a complex magical formula with Virgilia at the center.`
`...With such genuine magic being used, Shannon's power couldn't even compete.`
`On the contrary, it was surprising that she had withstood as long as she had.`
`"Spirit Particle Supremacy Ensured.`
` Come, Chiester Sisters. It's your turn now, right?`
` Wait, are you still rebooting?!`
` Why are kids these days so bad at waking up...?!"`
`"M-My apologies...!!`
` We're all different versions..."`

`".........`
`Y-You take your time fixing yourselves...`
` I'm going..."`
`""Sorryyyyyyyyy-!!""`
`The narrow underground passage was packed with goats, truly like a commuter train in the morning.`
`Virgilia was again shocked by this congestion.`
`"What are you doing...?!!`
` Huh?`
` You want to go first because you want the prize?`
` You're getting in each other's way because you don't want the other goats to steal the prize from you?`
` You stupid goooooooooooooaaaats!!!`
` I'm going, so make way!!"`
`"What?!`
` You don't want to?!`
` Virgilia-sama is trying to steal your prize?!"`
`"Why are you all standing arm in arm?!!`
` Aaah, tight, cramped!!`
` When did this become a goats-only car?!`
` Ugyu-!!`
` You, that kid who just touched my butt, get off at the next statioooon!!!"`
`"......Hmm? What's with you?`
` Come this way, you say??"`
`The five in Krauss's group dashed through the passageway with all their strength!`
`They couldn't dawdle around in an underground place like this.`
`They had to quickly join up with the children on the surface!`
`If they could meet up, there would no longer be any more sorrow!`
`At that time, a terrible rumble started chasing them.`
`Had their pursuers finally made it through the metal bars?!`
`But they couldn't see anyone when they turned around.`
`However, that rumble and the dirt that fell here and there from the ceiling grew closer and closer,`
` finally catching up with them and even going past them.`
`It felt almost like being chased by ghosts.`
`For a second, they thought they'd gotten away, until the ceiling in front of them fell in...and a single goat stood in their path.`
`...Virgilia was sitting on its shoulder.`
`"This wise child knew a shortcut.`
` What a good kid, you get first prize.`
` Later, you can have some handmade mackerel curry."`
`Maybe it really was happy about that dubious prize.`
` The massive goat showed its joy by putting its hands together and writhing.`
`Virgilia leapt down, laughing that this time, it was finally checkmate.`
`"...Damn, ...it's no use...`
` ...Our magic has been completely killed..."`
`"...Not yet...`
` ...Even without magic, we still have these bodies..."`
`"D-Don't be ridiculous...!`
` There's no way you could fight a monster like that without that strange power...!"`
`"...St-Stay back, children...`
` I'll do something about this, so escape past the sides of that monster while I distract them...!"`
`"I won't let you.`
` Hohhohohohohoho!"`
`When Virgilia clapped her hands, a purple magic circle wall appeared behind her,`
` stealing even the faint hope that Krauss had been betting on.`
`"Is there...nothing more to be done...?`
` ...N-No, not yet.`
` ...Even Jessica fought.`
` I must do so as well..."`
`"A-Are you serious?!`
` It's not possible, not against that massive monster...!"`
`"Don't be absurd...!`
` Krauss-san, let us think of another way..."`
`"If you think of something, say it.`
` Until then, it looks like I'll have to manage something...`
` ...Come on, get back."`
`"...Take care."`
`"Hohohoho, ...hohhohohohohohohoho!`
` My, my, Krauss.`
` You intend to fight this child alone?"`
`".........Nngg...`
` Y-You never know.`
` In a fight, it's always possible to get in a lucky shot..."`
`"Hohhohohoho.`
` You think you can win even with a fluke...?`
` Allow me to explain so that even one who so blissfully unaware of his place can understand."`
`"What...?"`
`"Hohohoho...`
` If you were to wield 100% of your strength, your power level is at most 6.`
` In comparison, this child has a power level of 1000.`
` In short, even if there were 100 of you, you definitely couldn't win.`
`Well, it's true that there are uncertain elements in a fight.`
` Let us admit that your power level has a slight scaling factor to it.`
` But even so, your chances of defeating this child are at perhaps 0.00001%.`
` Do you understand?`
` You don't even have a one in ten thousand chance of victory.`
` Hohohohoh...!"`
`Virgilia and the goat guffawed together.`
`"D-Damn it...`
` If I've got a one-in-ten-thousand chance, that means the payoff will be ten thousand times greater, right?`
` ...A splendid dark horse.`
` Seeing a ticket like that makes me want to buy it right away..."`
`"Hohohohoh!`
` But the coin to buy it is your life, and you've only one of those, yes?`
` However, I can understand why you'd still want to entrust that miracle to fate."`
`"...Therefore, I shall praise your courage for standing against us without fear...and give you a bit of a handicap.`
` This child will fight with only his left arm.`
` Well, even so, I have absolutely no intention of losing to you."`
`"......Come to think of it, what's that *bing*bong*bing*bong* noise I keep hearing?"`
`"...V-Very well.`
` I'll take that challenge...`
` Whether it uses its left arm or not, I'm sure I'd be killed with a single strike.`
` ...I also only have a single chance at a strike.`
` I can only bet everything on that."`
`"That's absurd, Krauss-san...!`
` I know you used to do boxing, but wasn't that as far back as your college days...?`
` No, no, even if you were a pro boxer, there's no way you could defeat a monster like that with one strike...!"`
`"...That would be true if it were a match in the ring.`
` But while Krauss nii-san's chance to bet on this hope is faint, it does exist.`
` ...He's betting everything on that hope..."`
`"Y-You aren't saying...`
` But there's no way that would work out..."`
`"...Krauss-sama......"`
`"W-Watch me...`
` I'll settle this with a single strike..."`
`Hohohohoh...`
` How shallow.`
`I know what you're after.`
`The distance between the two of them is more than 10 meters.`
`If the goat and Krauss both step in with all their strength to settle the fight with a single blow, their power will be double what is normal.`
`Both will crash together, so it's a relative four times normal.`
`Even if, on top of that, the strike lands on a weak point for a critical hit, that will only double the power again.`
`......In short, Krauss's maximum power level of 6 times 8 would be 48 at the most.`
`He might or might not be able to win if he repeated that lucky shot a full 20 times.`
`Hohhohohohoho, if you're killed every time you take a hit and your damage still accumulates,`
` ...let's see, perhaps you might finally win when we get to Episode 24, yes?`
`Hohohohoh, if only this series could stretch on so long...!!`
` Either way, you don't even have a slight chance at victory!`
`...Hey, seriously, what is that *bing*bong* sound?`
`"Let me bet everything on a single strike...`
` You have no reason to hold back either, goat-kun.`
` Come at me seriously..."`
`"Hohohoho, he's requesting that you go all out.`
` Smash him with a single serious strike...and turn him into chunks of meat."`
`As the goat got excited and beat its chest over and over, it took a position as though preparing for a sprint.`
`Hohohohoh, is this what you wanted?`
`Bet your hopes on the greatest limits of your power level...and despair when even that gets you nowhere!`
`It rang again!`
` What the heck?! It's really starting to get on my nerves!`
`"Here I go...`
` Ready?"`
`The goat howled in response.`
`Then, with a matched timing that only the men confronting each other could comprehend,`
` ...the two leapt forward like bullets shot out of a gun.`
`The men howled, collecting the strength from all over their bodies into one arm each.`
`The goat's fiery glowing eyes clearly locked onto Krauss's face.`
`...He could perfectly see a vision of when he would step forwards, `
`when he would punch through Krauss and blow him away, `
`and when he would win perfectly.`
`The long, painful days up to that point drifted through the goat's mind...`
`Those painful days of training when his senpais had picked on him...`
` Those faint glimpses of the warm concern his senpais felt for him.`
`And the joy of that day his power had been acknowledged, when he had been accepted as one of the comrades...!`
`I never showed proper respect to my parents.`
`...That's right, didn't I plan to wash my hands of this business when this job was over...and return to my hometown?`
`I'm sorry, little goat sister... Your Onii-chan always caused you so much trouble.`
`And I...a-actually have a childhood friend, ...and I'm gonna marry her when I got hooooome!!!`
`"Gyaaaaaaaaahh!!!`
` Nooooooooooo!!`
` Stop tripping all those loser flaaaaaaaaaaags!!`
` You can't handle that punch, dodge iiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`It happened the instant before the two crashed and their punches crossed.`
`"You fool, Virgilia.`
` Looks like you failed to make a calm and rational decision."`
`"You mustn't take that punch!!`
` Knock it aside!!"`
`"?!?!"`
`The very instant the goat's left straight and Krauss's right straight crossed...!`
` The goat obeyed Virgilia's order with super-fast reflexes and pulled his straight back, repelling Krauss's punch!`
`"......Nng-"`
`That's right, Virgilia's decision probably had been wise.`
`After all, the number of loser flags amplifies the power level of one's opponent!`
`"That was close,`
` if you had taken that punch after tripping so many loser flags, imagine just how great a force it would have been amplified to...!!"`
`"Come on, from there, smash the completely open right side of his face with a right straight!!`
` What?`
` That promise about fighting with only your left arm?`
` Hohohoh!!`
` Aren't promises made to be broken?!!`
` Gyaah, tripped another ooooooone!!"`
`"I'm disappointed, Virgilia.`
` You really have lost your composure."`
`"What's that...?!`
` How was I not composed by noticing it beforehand and making him avoid it...?!"`
`"Wh-Why is that, Kyrie-sama...?`
` If they had crashed like that, wouldn't it have been Krauss's..."`
`'!s1`
`...even with 20 loser flags, `
`...that's not enough!"`
`Krauss's and the goat's double rush made for times 4.`
`With a miracle as an ally, the firm promise of a critical hit doubled it again for times 8.`
`On top of that, there was an amplification of times 20, equal to the number of loser flags, making for x160.`
`At a glance, that was an incredible amplification, but even so, Krauss's power level was 6.`
`Even multiplied by 160, it only made for a power level of 960.`
`Just barely below the goat's 1000...!`
`"That's why I said you weren't composed.`
` It's your blunder.`
` If they had crashed like that, you would have won."`
`"H-Hohohohoh!!`
` Even if that were so, it all comes to the same thing if this right straight smashes Krauss's head!!`
` Die, Ushiromiya Krauss!!!"`
`"...Take this, the strongest strike of the boxing world."`
`After repelling Krauss's right straight,`
` the goat's right straight attacked the right side of Krauss's face, which had been left open...`
`But there, it crossed Krauss's left straight...`
`The two punches crossed, and time stopped as each aimed for the face of the other...`
`"Ho, ......hohohoho.`
` To think that it would be timed for a simultaneous strike!`
` But his power level stops at x160, making it 960!!`
` It doesn't reach up to my child's 1000...!"`
`"......No.`
` Virgilia-san, `
` ...it's your loss."`
`"Why?!"`
`"You made him repel the first cross-counter.`
` ...Certainly, if another right straight after that were to hit, Krauss-san would probably be in pieces."`
`"...However, that was crossed...`
` ...That's no good.`
` Sorry, but this is a complete loss for you and this goat."`
`A cross-counter has four times the destructive power of a normal punch.`
`This is common knowledge in the boxing world.`
`And if it's blocked and the right straight hits, then it's a double cross-counter, with 8 times the destructive power.`
`This is also common knowledge in the boxing world.`
`And if that is crossed...`
`Then, by the principle of leverage, the triple cross would multiply the destructive power by 12!`
`This is also painfully common knowledge in the boxing world!!`
`It's even written in a Minmeishobou book!`
`"......Krauss-san's power level is 6."`
`"The rushing from both sides is times 4."`
`"Th-The critical hit is times 8."`
`"And times 160 for tripping too many loser flags."`
`"...And times 12 again for the triple cross-counter."`
`"...T-Times 1920..."`
`His power level is 11520...!!`
`Krauss's punch now had the power to easily win the first Tenkaichi Budokai...!!!`
`"...This result was brought about by Krauss-san's persistence in not giving up on victory until the end...and your pride.`
` Without either, this strength would not exist..."`
`"...You fought well.`
` ...You may now fall..."`
`Nanjo clapped the goat on the shoulder...`
`...Y-Your Onii-chan...gave it his all...`
`As the sparkling drops from the goat's eyes scattered, he bent backwards,`
` and fell on Virgilia.`
`"Ugyu-!!`
` Heavyyyyyyy, get off meeeeee!"`
`The goat's massive body was too heavy for the slender Virgilia.`
`She wriggled around with it on top of her, but it didn't look like she'd be able to escape.`
`In that instant, the barrier Virgilia had sealed broke.`
`"Don't take it personally.`
` It was the principle of leverage that led to your defeat."`
`"...I wonder how the principle of leverage applied to that counter.`
` It's an eternal mystery."`
`"Let's escape while we can...!!`
` You take care too, goat-san...!"`
`"W-Well then, excuse us, Virgilia-sama!"`
`"......*bow*."`
`"Waaaaaaaaiiit!!`
` Wait uup!!`
` Get this off meeeeee!!`
` Kiiii---!! Gapgapgapgap!!!"`
`After that, there was nothing to block their way.`
`...They ran intently through the underground passage...!`
`Jessica had finally been cornered, with the wall at her back.`
`...Ronove advanced with his magic circle wall bit by bit...and would probably crush her against the other wall eventually.`
`Considering the distance, she threw out her fists... This would be her final strike.`
`Jessica had dealt out many punches so far.`
`...The wall wasn't invincible.`
`It had already started to crack, and it wouldn't be strange for it to smash at any moment.`
`However, due to the rebounding damage,`
` Jessica also had cuts all over her body...and was all worn out.`
`"...Please put a stop to this.`
` I don't intend to crush you.`
` It is up to the Master to decide how to deal with you.`
` ...However, I also intend to congratulate you specially for your good fight."`
`'!s1`
`Quit fucking a-`
`around...`
` ...Not yet...`
` It isn't...over yet......"`
`"...You have wounds all over your body.`
` It's all you can manage just to stand, is it not?`
` ...It seems you plan on putting all your strength into this final strike.`
` However, that final strike will be fatal for you."`
`The damage reflected by Ronove's magic circle wall was proportional to the strength of the attack.`
`Jessica's all-out punch would be bounced back onto her.`
`...The more all-out she went, the more suicidal it would be for Jessica.`
`"I-I get it, `
`...I know that......"`
`"I am warning you.`
` Stop this now.`
` This is for your own good."`
`"Stop bluffing.`
` Your wall is already about to break, right...?`
` I can tell by the feel of it after punching it so much, okay......?"`
`"............"`
`That was...a fact.`
`Ronove's wall was already on the verge of breaking.`
`And on top of that, `
`Jessica's fists had been imbued with an unimaginable magical attack power by now, and their destructive strength defied the imagination.`
`...In the worst case, that destructive power might even pierce the defensive wall, smash Ronove as well,`
` and create an expansion connecting this room to the next.`
`...However, that damage would rebound on Jessica as well.`
` She wouldn't escape unharmed!`
`"I will say it just one more time.`
` Stop.`
` I say this out of consideration for you!"`
`"Shut the fuck up...`
` ......Prepare yourself."`
`Jessica howled.`
`...Putting all the strength of her greatest and final destructive power into her fist, she roared...`
`The three goats had been beaten down long ago.`
`Without straining to breathe in the slightest, George cautiously closed the distance between him and Gaap.`
`...He was after her.`
`He was planning on bringing her down with a single strike...`
`Gaap was also aiming for a single strike.`
`......If she let that chance slide, she would be killed this time...`
`"...Aren't you going to use your pitfalls?"`
`"......Ack..."`
`Even the tiny opening during the time it took to open the hole would prove fatal with George as an opponent right now.`
`...Gaap cautiously calculated the distance and timing, but even as she did, George closed the gap between them...`
`"......If you won't come, I will."`
`"...G-Go ahead...`
` There's no point in cheap tricks anymore.`
` ...I'll settle it...`
`with this kick of mine!"`
`For an instant, she thought George's body blurred, ...and then only his jacket was floating in the air.`
`The moment she thought 'Ah-', darkness covered Gaap.`
`George, with his heel swung up high, was attacking from the sky like a massive dragon.`
`"I-It worked...`
` ...This is my victory, Ushiromiya George!!"`
`"What?"`
`Gaap opened a vast pitfall with her in the center, swallowing up George along with herself...!!`
`The two were swallowed up by the pitfall...and spat out from the ceiling of the arbor.`
`But that was what Gaap had been after, so she alone landed lightly.`
`...However, there was another pitfall in George's landing spot.`
`"Ehheheheheheheh, aaaahhahahahahahahahahaha!!!`
` Gotcha, Ushiromiya Geoooooooooorge!!"`
`"It was fun, so die.`
` The Ushiromiya Family Headship would be wasted on the likes of you,`
` so I'll finish you right here, right now!!!`
` Aaaaaahhhhh, nngaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`George once again fell from the ceiling of the arbor.`
`He had probably been dropped the same distance as falling off the roof of a two story building.`
`In the sky, he couldn't control his posture in any way.`
`It was impossible to resist or defend or avoid!!`
`As Gaap spun like a whirlwind, she concentrated all of her energy on the sharp tip of her stiletto heel.`
`...This was the final strike...to perform his requiem.`
`The final strike of the queen bee that would bore into heaven, knocking him down into the true Abyss!!`
`"Welcome to the Abyss!!`
` This is the end of the line for you!!!"`
`She closed in on her prey...and stuck her foot up into the sky.`
`...At that time, she saw George's face.`
`......Even though he was in midair, he was calmly adjusting his glasses with the middle finger of his right hand.`
`And his posture was still preserved as that of an axe kick.`
`Without the faintest deviation, he aimed for Gaap's forehead...`
`"......I had already hypothesized that this move would come up."`
`"......Wh...at......?"`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"If I'd jumped to make the person ~ib~on the ground~ib~ taste my heel, my posture would have collapsed long ago.`
` ......However, my posture hasn't collapsed in the slightest.`
` Do you know why?"`
`'!s1`
`don't...`
`mean..."`
`'!s1`
`...I aimed to make a person two stories below taste my heel!!!"`
`"Uu, ...oooooooooooooohhh, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"`
`"It's your loss, Miss!!!"`
`'!s0`
`"Whooooooaaaaaaahhh, take thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiss!!!"`
`'!s0`
`reached the wall...`
`and was sucked in.`
`It was sucked into a black, large hole that had suddenly opened on the wall.`
`"Well, ......I did tell you to stop."`
`"This......is......"`
`"...Gu, ......ah..."`
`"Actually,`
` ......I wasn't even close to being in a pinch.`
` Sooorry..."`
`...Jessica's fist had gone for George's stomach, `
`...and George's axe kick had lined up on Jessica's head.`
`The shocking destructive power imbued in Jessica's fist crushed George's organs and scattered his abdomen.`
`The same destructive power in George's axe kick smashed half of Jessica's head...and scattered its contents in the same manner...`
`"Pfft, ...ahhahahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` Didn't I tell yooou?`
` About a witch's acting proweeeeeeess?`
` Hey, hey, Beato, what do you think, were you watching...?"`
`"Wahahaha, waaaahhyahhyahhya, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` Not bad, just as planned!`
` You really do get it, Gaap!!`
` Woohoo!!"`
`Beato and Gaap casually high-fived each other.`
`'!s1`
`...aaah, `
`......whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"`
`"Thanks, Ronove.`
` Thanks for the gift.`
` I'll return Jessica's corpse.`
` ...Separate the corpses of the two who are close.`
` ...Does this mean the second twilight is over?"`
`Gaap dropped Jessica's corpse through a pitfall...`
`and all the chunks were thrown into Jessica's room,`
` as carelessly as throwing something into the trash...`
`Jessica's corpse and lumps of flesh fell from the ceiling and poured out all over her room.`
`Ronove shook his head slightly at this gruesome change of scenery.`
`"......My apologies, Jessica-sama.`
` I did warn you."`
`"However,`
` ...the true art of us demons...that is, foreseeing this conclusion and giving you advice I knew you wouldn't listen to, really isn't something a Human could understand.`
` ...Pukkukukukukukukukukuku!"`
`"It really was fun, kid.`
` ...But you play with words a bit too much.`
` ...Is 'Maybe it's about time I started fighting back?' really the best you've got?`
` Heheheh, are you trying to be someone from a light novel or something?`
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`In the arbor brutally decorated by George's and Jessica's scattered blood and guts, `
`Gaap enjoyed a loud laugh for a while...`
`...But she quickly realized that, in all seriousness, this was a little too filthy and undignified, and she snapped her fingers.`
`As she did, a cloud of gold butterflies rose up around her, `
`stuck to each of the bits and blood stains, and dropped them.`
`...Then, George's corpse returned bit by bit,`
` and the brutal corpse with its guts torn out was repaired into a clean corpse that looked like it was sleeping.`
`Was this some act of sportsmanship towards a dead rival......?`
`The heavens were split.`
`...Because Gaap had lifted her leg high, pointing at the sky.`
`"See you, lover boy.`
` This is Game Over for real."`
`*splat*.`
`......Without a trace of mercy, that foot stepped down...`
`and was buried into George's forehead.`
`The stiletto heel that was sharp as a weapon pierced George's forehead.`
`With a *bloop*, ...it was pulled out...`
`It was like a mark proving that Gaap certainly had finished him by her own hand...`
`Ronove also returned Jessica's corpse to its original form.`
`...And unlike how it had been with George, he restored Jessica's life...`
`"...Uu, ......*cough*, *cough*...`
` ...What in the world...is this...?`
` ...A dream...?"`
`"No, that is wrong.`
` ...You certainly did pass away, Jessica-sama.`
` You should be well aware of the memory of your final moments."`
`Jessica's mind was burning.`
`...For some reason, she remembered being thrown somewhere...and having George's heel smash her head...`
`"Am I...alive...?"`
`"No, you are dead.`
` With my magic, that will only be postponed for a scant three minutes.`
` After three minutes, the magic will end, and you will return to being a tragic corpse with half of its head crushed."`
`"...Wh-What'd you say......?`
` ...Heh, ......heheheheh..."`
`"Death is brutal.`
` In most cases, you aren't even given the time to ready your heart.`
` ...But to praise you for fighting so bravely, I've decided to give you this time.`
` Perhaps you should sort out your regrets from this world in those three minutes."`
`"I can also...decide to take you along with me during those three minutes..."`
`But the power that had burned through Jessica's body until a second ago had been completely lost.`
`...Jessica was aware of that herself.`
`She was already dead.`
`"And that is all for me.`
` If you would excuse me.`
` ...It was fun, Jessica-sama."`
`Ronove turned his form into a cloud of gold butterflies and disappeared.`
`All that remained was the sound of the wind and rain, and the figure of Jessica as she crouched down, leaning against the wall...`
`Jessica could tell.`
`She probably really would revert to the corpse she had been after three minutes.`
`...Was there anything she could do in those three minutes......?`
`She stood up, and with a shaky gait, `
`...took the phone that was on the desk...`
`"...H-Hello?`
` ...Is that Jessica?`
` Jessica?!`
` What is it, are you okay?!?!"`
`"......Heh, ...heheheheh... `
`...They...got me..."`
`"Are you okay?!`
` Did you get injured?!`
` I'll come to save you right now!!"`
`"No, ...it's already too late.`
` I'm...already dead, or so I hear...`
` Ahahaha, by the time you got here, Battler, I'd be a corpse with half its head split open."`
`"Craaaaaaap, that damn geezer!!`
` Wait there, I'm coming right now!!"`
`"Listen to me, Battler!!`
` Listen closely, okay...?`
` ......Now I totally see why Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san were evasive about the time the six in the dining hall got killed.`
`'!s1`
`......aren't...`
`...Human."`
`"Wh-Whaat?!`
` What are you talking about......?"`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, jes_4e296:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, jes_4e297:`
`"...Ahhahhahhah...`
` ...From the very beginning, fighting was useless...`
` They really aren't opponents that you'll be able to fight with that hat-stand spear you're so proud of..."`
`A line of blood dripped down from Jessica's forehead...`
`"George nii-san's done for too.`
` That was...an instant death...`
` ......Heheh, the next test is yours, Battler.`
` ......I wonder if your test will go the same way as ours...`
` ......Be careful...and don't misunderstand."`
`"Y-You mean about the test...?"`
`"No.`
` ......Don't misunderstand...`
`and assume that your enemy's Human.`
` ......The enemy...isn't Human.`
` ...They're demons...that can freely wield a terrifying magic.`
` No matter what, ...don't get the wrong idea about that...`
` *cough*, *cough*cough*!! Be...careful..."`
`A line of blood dripped down from Jessica's mouth as well.`
`...The left half of her head started hurting.`
`Jessica realized that she was about to return to the corpse she had been.`
`".........When 13 people die, the Golden Witch...will revive.`
` Six were killed including Mom.`
` That's the first twilight.`
` ...Then George nii-san and I were killed...for the second twilight.`
` ...So once five more people are killed, the ceremony will be complete, ...and the witch will revive."`
`"......I hope Dad and the rest are safe...`
` ...If they aren't, `
`......the one to test you...`
`might be the resurrected Beatrice herself..."`
`Battler already didn't understand what Jessica was saying.`
`But from her tone, he realized that she knew she was about to die.`
`So even though he didn't understand the situation, he urged her to give it her all.`
`"...Haha, I said I'm already dead.`
` ......See ya.`
` It looks like it's time.`
` ...Good luck on your test.`
` I hope you...can become the Head.`
` ............"`
`"Jessica?`
` Jessica?!`
` Hey, answer me!!`
` Jessicaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`Battler's sorrowful voice could be heard from the dangling receiver.`
`...As she leaned against the wall in that corner, crouched down...`
`...Jessica's head had been half smashed......`
`"This place is...?"`
`"...Is this...a well...?`
` Where is this...?"`
`Kyrie stuck her face out of the well, and then Krauss showed himself too.`
`When he realized that they could see the back of the mansion from beyond a grove of trees, Krauss knew more or less where they were.`
`...To think that here, in a certain well, there had been a hidden underground passage,`
` which led to a hidden mansion...`
`"Th-This really is tough on this old body...`
` ...I usually came up from a different spot, with real stairs.`
` If you just unlock it..."`
`"...I will ask you to tell me about the layout of this place in detail later, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...Shannon, are you okay? Grab hold."`
`"...I-I'm fine.`
` Kanon-kun, quickly."`
`Kanon climbed up a ladder out of the shaft that was disguised as a well.`
` ...It was probably quite deep.`
`When he looked down, for the first time, he realized how far he'd come up.`
`'!s0`
`*bang*.`
`......As Kanon was about to finally crawl out of the well, a hole the size of a basketball opened up in his chest.`
`...Everyone there looked through the hole in Kanon's chest to the scenery beyond...`
`"......K-Kanon-kun!!!"`
`'!s1`
`...e-sa...`
`......"`
`Kanon slumped backwards...`
`and was swallowed up into the depths of the well...`
`"E-Everyone, run!!`
` The Chiester Sisters!!`
` They've locked on, we can't avoid them!!`
` Run!!`
` Let at least one of us remain alive...!!!"`
`At that time, Krauss and Kyrie and Nanjo...`
`certainly saw a golden curved line appear from the well...`
`and sew itself through the side of Shannon's head......`
`"Shannon!!!"`
`Her head had been pierced.`
`The three had witnessed it perfectly until it had shot out the opposite side, blowing it away.`
`'!s0`
`......blood gushing from both sides of her head, `
`and flopped to the ground.`
`"W-Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhyaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"They're after us!!`
` Run!!`
` We'll be killed!!"`
`"...R-Run, ...runrunrun!!!"`
`As Nanjo doubled over in shock, stunned by how Shannon had died, the Chiester Sisters did not allow him to escape.`
`A curved line again appeared from the well...and pierced from Nanjo's forehead to the back of his head in an instant, sewing through him.`
`...*thump*.`
` And so, Nanjo passed away.`
`"What the, why...?!!`
` Where's the enemy coming from?!"`
`"We're being sniped!!`
` I don't know where from, but they've honed in on us perfectly!!`
` Let's escape into the mansion, block their field of vision!!"`
`The two dashed towards the back door of the mansion.`
`Then, right as Krauss was about to shut the door behind him, `
`...a golden curved line appeared for the fourth time, piercing Krauss from the back of his head to his forehead and smashing that forehead...`
`'!s1`
`......oooh......"`
`"Eeek!!`
` Eeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!!"`
`Krauss's body leaned over, fell down, and drew a neat radial pattern with the insides of his head...`
`Kyrie ran wildly through the hallway, flew into some room, and locked the door.`
`......But even so, she wasn't even remotely convinced that this had saved her life.`
`She would probably die soon!`
`This was apparently one of the guest rooms.`
`...At that moment, Kyrie's eyes fell on a phone on a side table...`
`After hanging up the call from Jessica, Batter had been about to dash out.`
`In that instant, the phone rang again.`
`"H-Hello!!!`
` ......Huh?`
` Kyrie-san?!"`
`"...Yes, Battler-kun.`
` ...I got lucky.`
` I managed to escape the dungeon somehow.`
` I really did have luck on my side."`
`"Where are you?!`
` Is everyone okay?!`
` Over here, it looks like Jessica and George-aniki are-"`
`"Listen!!!`
` I probably won't be alive for long."`
`At that time, right after she thought the keyhole of the locked door might have glowed gold, `
`a gold, curved line drawing a helix...`
`no, a golden sewing thread penetrated in from there at an incredible speed and bored a hole into the floor by Kyrie's feet.`
`...Oh, that's unusual.`
`The enemy, who sniped the other four one after another with extraordinary skill,`
` apparently really does have trouble shooting me between the eyes with a single shot while I'm holed up in this room.`
`But the next strike will probably hit...`
`At this point, Kyrie finally remembered the first massive killing in the dining hall...`
`...That's right...`
` ...This is what killed Rudolf and the rest, all six of them...`
`"...Listen, Battler-kun.`
` I'm going to tell you everything exactly as I saw it.`
` ...I'm sure you'll think there's something wrong with my head.`
` ...Yes, it's okay for you think that.`
` Even I still haven't sorted out what it was I saw."`
`"......Today,`
` after you all returned to the guesthouse, the family conference began in the dining hall, `
`...and I'll tell you everything that happened next.`
` Listen until the end without butting in.`
` ......The call might be suddenly cut off partway through.`
` If it does, at that time, I'll be dead."`
`"......Kyrie...san..."`
`'!s0`
`...about Kinzo appearing and the family conference starting, `
`...about the six being killed and the five of them being confined...`
`...About how she had escaped somehow...and ran away to where she was now,`
` and how everyone had finally been killed...`
` It was all spoken dispassionately, with no dramatization, just as she'd seen it.`
`...She even spoke about how everyone except her had been killed, and how she had observed the moments of all their deaths,`
` ...and how even now, someone was trying to kill her.`
`"......Actually, `
`even while we've been talking, ...I've been attacked three times.`
` Something like a strange gold thread keeps flying in through the keyhole, spinning around and aiming for me.`
` First it was by my feet.`
` ...Next, it was close to my shoulders.`
` ...Just now, it grazed my ear.`
` ...Its aim is getting more and more accurate.`
` Looks like it'll go right between my eyes pretty soon..."`
`"R-Run, Kyrie-san...!!`
` Run awaaaaaaaaaaay!!!"`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kir_4e385:`
`run this far, `
`...shut myself into a room, and even locked the door, right...?`
` ......Now that I'm still being pursued, `
`......just where should I hide, `
`...hey..."`
`'!s1`
`ri...`
`e...`
`...san......"`
`"Hey, Battler-kun...`
` Are Jessica-chan and George-kun...still alive?"`
`"......`
`...Not long ago, ...I got a phone call from Jessica...`
` ......It kinda...sounded like they were...done for..."`
`"......Thought so.`
` ...Yeah, when we were being killed one after another, I had a kind of premonition.`
` I thought that perhaps the second twilight had been finished in the ceremony of killing 13 people...before our twilights had been reached.`
` ......In short, when I die, that's 13 people.`
` This way, the ceremony is complete.`
` ...The Golden Witch, Beatrice, will resurrect."`
`"......I wonder what in the world will happen.`
` ...On this island filled with demons and witches...and swarming with goat monsters, `
`...I wonder just what will happen...`
`...when even the leader of them all, the Golden Witch, appears...`
` ...By now, `
`I don't...`
`...have a clue what's going on anymore."`
`Kyrie-san's voice...had completely given up on her own life.`
`Because Battler understood that, `
`...he couldn't stop the tears...`
`"...There's just one thing...I can advise you on."`
`"What...?"`
`"......If...`
`a demon or a witch does appear in front of you..."`
`"Yeah..."`
`"There's no need whatsoever to doubt whether it's real or not.`
` ...Understand that it is what it seems to be."`
`"............"`
`"You might think there must be some trick, or that there's some true nature hidden behind it.`
` ...If you have the time to think of something like that, `
`...it'd be much more constructive to plan out how not to damage the mood of whatever you're facing.`
` ...Even mistakenly, ...you must not say 'In that case, try showing me magic'...`
` ...Because to prove that, they'll probably use an even crueler way than before...`
`...to show you."`
`'!s1`
`...believe it...`
` ...Even if I hear...`
`...something like that coming from your mouth, `
`...I can't believe it......"`
`"I understand.`
` I understand why you can't believe.`
` ...So, that's why I can give this advice.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`...`
`~ib~Believe~ib~`
`."`
`"......You're telling me to believe in Beatrice...and demons and witches and monsters...?"`
`'!s1`
`...I think we still weren't able to believe any of it.`
` I'm still like that now.`
` ...The true form of this thing that keeps attacking me, trying to shoot through my forehead, `
`...is something I don't understand, `
`......and I can't believe it."`
`"So, `
`...I want you alone to believe, to understand, `
`......to accept the existence...`
`...of what we couldn't accept.`
` If you do that for me, our deaths won't be wasted.`
` ......It'll also have been worth it for me to make this phone call...`
` ...Ah...!"`
`"K-Kyrie-san?!?!"`
`"...I'm still okay.`
` It scratched me, but it missed again.`
` ...It looks like...`
`...I probably won't get another chance.`
` ......Thank you.`
` And goodbye, Battler-kun.`
` I treated you coldly sometimes because you were Asumu-san's son.`
` ...Forgive me...for those days."`
`"What do you mean, forgive you? Right now, you are a mother to me, Kyrie-san!!"`
`I felt as though I'd heard an incredible sound at the other end of the receiver.`
`Then, a noisy clacking sound.`
`...As though the receiver had fallen to the floor.`
`"Kyrie-san?!?!`
` Kyrie-san!!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!"`
`'!s0`
`......answer through the phone......`
`...again......`
`"...I don't know why you're mad, Battler."`
`"You don't?!`
` Everyone was killed!!`
` By that damn geezer!`
` Who was saying something crazy about Beatrice's resurrection ceremony or whatever!!"`
`"So, by now, 13 people have been offered as sacrifices,`
` ...and it's already time for Beatrice to revive, right?"`
`"Sure, that sounds great!!`
` I'll find Beatrice too and kill them both!!"`
`"......We've survived the ceremony.`
` So, we'll receive an invitation to the Golden Land from Beatrice.`
` Over there, all wishes will be granted.`
` If having your family killed is painful, then you just have to resurrect them.`
` ...That's what I plan to do.`
` I'll revive the really nice real Mama, the one that isn't possessed by the black witch."`
`"...So Mama will always be with me.`
` ...There won't be any more overtime or working on days off.`
` ...She'll always be with me, and think only of me, kihhihihi, and she'll always fight against fearsome enemies for my sake.`
` Kihhihihihihihi...!"`
`"...There's something wrong with you.`
` ...Why are you saying something so incomprehensible in a situation like this...?!"`
`"......Didn't Kyrie just tell you, Battler...?`
`'!s1`
`to believe...`
`in the witch?"`
`".........F-Fuck.`
` This is no time to get in an argument with you over something like this...!!`
` Now, there are no hostages or anything...anyone left alive!`
` This weird, shitty ceremony game is already over...!!"`
`"Let me do what I want now.`
` Someone might still be alive.`
` Or someone might be hiding!`
` I'll search everywhere, find them, and beat the shit out of them!!"`
`In a rage, Battler grabbed his hat stand spear and flew out of the room.`
`Maria watched him go, looking bored...`
`"......Even though Beatrice will grant our wishes soon anyway.`
` ...Stupid Battler.`
` ...Kihhihihihi."`
`At that time, the phone rang out again...`
`Maria stood up and grabbed the receiver.`
`"Uu-.`
` Hello.`
` ...Uu-?`
` Uu-!!!"`
`Of course, the sound of the phone also reached Battler's ears as he was about to dash out of the house.`
`With a violent forcefulness, he turned around and dashed into the cousins' room...`
`"M-Maria...!`
` Who...was the phone call from...?!"`
`With a terrifying look on his face, Battler yelled at Maria, who was on the phone.`
`You couldn't blame him...`
`Right now, the only humans left alive on the island were himself, Maria, Gohda, and Kumasawa.`
`But there was no way those two could call after being locked up in the gardening storehouse.`
`...Which meant......there was only one person left.`
`It had to be Kinzo.`
`After continuing her pleasant chat with the person on the other end of the phone for a while, Maria slowly turned to face Battler.`
`......Then, with an unsettling expression on her face, she laughed 'Kihihihihihihihihihi'.`
`...It felt almost as though the person on the other end of the line was chatting about Battler.`
`"Maria, ...who's on the phone?`
` ...Grandfather...?!"`
`Battler couldn't imagine that this was the case.`
`...After all, it was inconceivable that Maria would talk intimately with Kinzo,`
` ...and that she would be chatting about Battler with that eerie smile on her face.`
`So just what kind of person could be on the phone......who could make Maria chat with a smile like that?`
`......At that time, in the back of his mind, the words Kyrie had spoken to him drifted up.`
`If a witch does appear, there's no need to doubt it.`
` ...Just......believe that it exists...`
`"Yeah.`
` Battler just came back.`
` He sure is jumpy.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`"Maria!!`
` Who's on the phone?!`
` Who?!?!"`
`"...Hand it over?`
` Sure.`
` ......Here, Battler."`
`After getting the consent of the person on the other end, she held the receiver out to Battler...`
`".........Nng."`
`"Here."`
`Maria held the receiver out for him to take, ...as though it was perfectly normal.`
`Battler hesitated just a little bit before taking the receiver.`
`...After all, ......by accepting the existence of the person at the other end, `
`......he'd have no choice but to acknowledge them.`
`......As Kyrie said...`
`'!s0`
`...any need...`
`...to doubt that they exist.`
`Battler took the receiver.`
`As he did, Maria briskly left the room.`
`Battler, who was a bit scared to find out for sure who was at the other end of the receiver,`
` questioned Maria before taking the call.`
`"H-Hey!`
` Where are you going...?!"`
`"To where my test is.`
` ...I wonder who the next Ushiromiya Family Head will be, Battler or me.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihihi."`
`"......D-Don't go!!`
` You'll be killed!!"`
`"I won't be killed.`
` The ceremony is already over.`
` ...And even if I'm killed, I'll be revived.`
` ...Whether one of us becomes the Head or not, we've already been invited to the Golden Land.`
` See you."`
`"Wait!!`
` Maria...!!!"`
`Battler stretched his hand out to Maria's back as she left,`
` ...but the cord of the receiver that he was gripping stopped him, just like a chain.`
`...He readied himself.`
`...Battler put the receiver to his ear...`
`"......H-Hello...?"`
`'!s0`
` <And I'm fiiine>!!`
` <And yooooooooooouuuuu>?!`
` Aaaaahhhhyahhyahhyahhyaaaaa!!!"`
`Screwed up, mocking English filled his ears.`
`...It was the voice of a woman he didn't know.`
`...Who was it...?`
` The inside of his head was starting to freeze up...`
` ......Who was it......?`
`"What do you mean 'Who is it?', Ushiromiya Battleeeeer...?`
` Normally, you'd answer <yeees, I'm fine>!`
` Right??`
` That takes me back, ...you do that one in middle school, right?`
` That thing you do in pairs!`
` Uhhyahyahyahyahyahyaaaaahh!!!"`
`"Y-You're insane...`
` Who are you?!!`
` Answer me!!!"`
`"Say it in Engliiish.`
` Isn't that your specialtyyyyy?"`
`"...D-Don't fuck with me...`
`Who are you?!!`
` An underling of that damn geezer?!"`
`"Underling is a mean way to say it, is it not?`
` At least say prisoner.`
` ...And Kinzo is my prisoner!`
` Riiight?`
` Wahhahahahahahahahaha..."`
`That last laugh didn't sound like it was aimed at Battler.`
`...It was almost as though Kinzo was right next to the phone, cackling as well...`
`"...S-Say your name!!`
` Who are you?!`
` Who?!!!"`
`"Guess right, and you could win a free trip to Hawaii!`
` Ahhyahhyahhhyaaaah!!`
` Fffinally.`
` Finally!!`
` Mmmmmmm, it was so looooooong, the days leading up to today were reeeeeeally long...!!`
` I seriously waited a thousand years for today, get it??`
` I owe it to you!`
` My big resurrection!!`
` <Thank you>, Kinzo!`
` Just for you, I'll lend an ear to that last `
`'I'll take that move back' of yoours!!!"`
`"...My, my, aren't you getting a tad too excited?`
` Couldn't you act a bit more ladylike?"`
`Kinzo and Beatrice sat facing each other over the chessboard on the reception table.`
`There was expensive cheese and snacks to go with drinks.`
`And there were several empty wine bottles lined up.`
`As Beatrice rolled around on the sofa in an unseemly way,`
` she happily held a wine glass in one hand...`
`and was probably completely drunk.`
`"I'm in the beeest mood today, so here's a huge bonus for you!!`
` Hey, hey, Kinzo, don't use Chateau Petrus as a decoration!`
` It's from 1947, right?!`
` If you don't open it today, just when do you plan on opening it?!`
` Let's drown ourselves in it and plaaaaaaaaay!`
` Then let's whack each other with the empty bottles!`
` Uhhyahhyahhyahhya!!"`
`"Hahhaha, how amusing.`
` You're too excited.`
` And you're letting loose too much."`
`"And what about you, Kinzoooooo?!`
` Aren't you happy to be reunited with meee?`
` Ah, it's the living world! The earthly world!!`
` Long live my flesh!!"`
`"...What...are you going on about......?`
` ...Are you saying that you're...B-Beatrice or something...?"`
`"<Ye-eeeeeeeeeeeeeeess, I aaaaaaaaaamm>!!`
` Thanks to Kinzo's 13-person murder ceremony, I've finally been resurrected...!!`
` It's nice having a mouth, it's nice having a tongue!`
` How fun it is to be able to talk to you like this!`
` Come to think of it, even though we slapped each other with abuse so many times, over and over again, `
`this is the first time we've had a conversation like this on the board during the game, isn't it?`
` How very fresh!!"`
`"Oh, did you hear that *pop* sound just now?!`
` He opened it, he seriously opened that Chateau Petrus!!`
` Do you know how much a single bottle costs?!`
` Almost as much as a whole 10 kilogram ingot, you seeeeeeeeeeee?!?!`
` Hii-hhahhahhahhahha!!"`
`"C-Cut the crap...!!`
` Beatrice...?!!`
` The Golden Witch, you say?!`
` Give it a rest!!`
` Where are you?!`
` Is that damn geezer with you too?!`
` I'll beat the shit out of both of you!!`
` Where are you now?!`
` Answer me!!"`
`"Oh, so you want to meet me?`
` Uhhihihihi, it's tough being such a popular woman!`
` But please, don't try to chat me up when Kinzo's around, okaay?`
` This guy gets seriously jealous, so he has a bad temper, you see?`
` ......But when Kinzo isn't around and we're all alone, I'll love you all ya want in secret, okay...?`
` Uhyaaahhahhahhahha *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!!"`
`"Y-You're insane......"`
`"Kinzoo, I've changed my mind.`
` I won't do Maria's test.`
` You go."`
`"How fickle.`
` So, are you saying you'll do Battler's test?"`
`"Nothing wrong with that, riiight?!`
` That guy's so much like a younger you that it makes my heart race.`
` Don't worry, I won't cheat on yooooou.`
` This'll be the only time I'll be alone with him.`
` ...I'm always alone with you in bed, riiight...?`
` But no more tying me to the bed with a collar, 'kay?`
` Kuhhyahhahhahahahahaha...!!!"`
`"Well then, Battleer!`
` I, the Golden Witch Beatrice, will be conducting your test myself!`
` As for the place, ...yes.`
` Let's make it the front entrance to this mansion!`
` Battleer, make sure you try seriously hard in this test to become the Successor, okaay?`
` ...I mean, Kinzo's practically dead on his feet.`
` If you become his successor, you'll be the new owner of everything on this island.`
` ...If it's you, ...I wouldn't mind becoming all yours, see...?`
` Rule over me just like Kinzo did, 'kay...?`
` Kuhhihihihihihihihi, uhhyahhahhahahahahahaha!"`
`"Th-The front entrance of the mansion...`
` Perfect...!!`
` You drunk bastard!!`
` I'll sober you up.`
` I'll fix that hangover with a burning punch!!`
`'!s0`
`Battler impulsively slammed the receiver down.`
`There was no need to talk through it anymore.`
`...I'll meet her face to face and settle this!!`
`I took the spear I'd made from the hat stand...`
`and went outside without even an umbrella.`
`...It's hard to imagine that the young woman calling herself Beatrice is waiting for me alone.`
`...I should probably assume that, as Gohda-san and the rest said, she'll be waiting with supporting troops.`
`Going alone would be too reckless...`
`"Gohda-san, Kumasawa-san...!`
` It's me, Battler...!"`
`I headed for the gardening storehouse first.`
`I need all the help I can get.`
`Gohda-san is big, so I can probably count on him for some firepower.`
` Kumasawa's knowledge and familiarity with the terrain as a senior servant might become a huge weapon.`
`Both of them have master keys, and they know more about the mansion than I do.`
` They'll be pretty reliable allies.`
`As I banged on the shutter and called out for them to open it, I remembered that there was nothing they could do from the inside.`
`I would have to get the key back from them before opening the door.`
`I rounded the corner, knocked on the small latticed window there, and opened it.`
`"Gohda-san, Kumasawa baa-chan...!`
` It's Battler...!!`
` Hey, come on, get up, ...h...ey......"`
`The scene in the shed, lit by a dim lightbulb, ...was very...strange...`
`'!s1`
`sa...n...`
` ...Kumasawa...sa...`
`n..."`
`'!s0`
`...hung two thick ropes, `
`...and at the ends, `
`...Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san...`
`...were hanging...by their necks...`
`It was dim and cramped because of the various pieces of equipment strewn about, so I couldn't make out the situation clearly.`
`...But when they showed not even a tremor after I called out to them,`
` and because of the way the loops around their necks seemed to carry the full weight of their bodies, I could sense no trace of life from them...`
`"You've gotta be......kidding me, ...right......?`
` ...Why......?"`
`The shutter was still closed.`
`...And there was only a single key, which had supposedly been given to Gohda-san.`
`So how had the culprit...opened the shutter and killed both of them inside...?`
`No, wait, they weren't necessarily killed...`
`If this is a suicide...`
`...That way, this closed room makes sense, but I don't know why they would hang themselves and commit suicide...!!`
`Feebly, ...I slumped down on the spot.`
`'!s0`
`...are me, Maria, `
`...and that damn geezer.`
`......No, there's also that insane woman calling herself Beatrice...`
`There's Maria, who had acted like the witch's ally from the beginning.`
`And that geezer, the ringleader who revived the witch.`
`And...the witch herself.`
`...What the hell.`
` ......By now, I might as well be...`
`...the only one on this island......`
`Using my pole as a cane, I feebly rose.`
`...Damn, I can't do it like this...`
`I've got to avenge...everyone...`
`"Damn iiiiiiiit, ...it's useless this way...`
` Aaah, it's useless, it's all useless...`
` Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiitt......"`
`Might as well cry while I can...`
`...So that my frail emotions will be squeezed out with my tears...`
`Then, ...I straightened up and gazed into the darkness in the direction of the mansion.`
`......At the entrance to the mansion, the witch is waiting.`
`I'll go...and settle this.`
`I'll find the source of this weird, insane night...and crush her with my own hands...!`
`Amidst the pouring rain, ...I walked through the rose garden without an umbrella, letting myself get soaked.`
`...I could see the arbor on the other side.`
`According to Jessica, it seemed that George-aniki had also been killed...`
`Well, by this point, there's no need to worry about the lives of any hostages.`
`...I left the path, aiming for the arbor.`
`Then,`
` ......I saw George-aniki's weather-beaten corpse...`
`"......Aniki...`
` ......Damn......"`
`The corpse was in front of the arbor.`
`If he had died under the arbor, he might have at least been spared being beaten down upon by the rain...`
`In Aniki's forehead was a gaping hole, as though he'd been shot with a gun.`
`Perhaps because the rain had washed everything away, his face wasn't covered with blood, ...so he looked almost like he was sleeping.`
`...However, his clothes were stained a deep red, and there were still signs that a large amount of blood had flowed out...`
`How happy I'd be if he were sleeping, or else pretending to be dead...`
`...But even though the rain sprayed against Aniki's eyes, they remained open.`
`...And...the hole in his forehead was no joke, `
`...but absolutely real...`
`There had been a faint chance that even Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san hanging by their necks in the gardening shed had been them playing a bad joke.`
`But that naive possibility had now been completely denied.`
`And, as I looked at this corpse, I became completely sure.`
`Just as Gohda-san had once said.`
`...The enemy had come to take lives like pieces on a chessboard.`
`"......Aaaah, ...there's no mistake.`
` ...It seems that old geezer and the witch...`
`...really don't view our lives as anything more than that..."`
`...That damn witch said something over the phone...`
`Something about us being 'on the game board'...`
`"...Perfect...`
` ...I see, she thinks this is a game...`
` Then, ...if you killed everyone like it was a game, `
`......it's okay if I kill you all like it's a game, right...?`
` ......Prepare yourself,`
` ...Beatrice......"`
`The lightning caused the mansion's vast shadow to rise up.`
`...Finally, ...the mansion.`
`As the massive shape came into view, there was no silhouette of any person.`
`It seemed that there weren't any underlings waiting for me in a pack, or anything like that.`
`......According to Kyrie-san, there were massive amounts of attendants with goat heads.`
`At least for now, I couldn't sense a large group of them hiding and staring at me...`
`What's this...?`
`Beneath the roof of the entrance, `
`......there's something set down.`
`"...What is this?`
` ......A...box?"`
`It looked like the kind of small box that girls often keep trinkets in.`
`...Or maybe it was the same kind of extravagant cigar case you'd find in a reception room.`
`Either way, it didn't look like something that should be here...`
`It clearly looked...as though I was being told to open it.`
`But for some reason, opening something being offered to me was irritating.`
`...However, it didn't look like we'd get anywhere if I didn't open it.`
`Could it be that it's set up with some trap to make it explode when opened...?`
`Thinking things like that, forgetting even to come under the overhang,`
` I continued to glare at the box, still beaten down upon by the rain.`
`Then, ......mixed in with the thunder...was some kind of...music?`
` ...It sounded like that.`
`...It was the tone of the big clock in the hall announcing 24:00.`
`It was also a sound announcing that this insane day, October 4, had finally ended,`
` ...and that the much more incredibly insane day of October 5 had begun.`
`That sound quieted, ......and I could hear an eerie laugh coming out of nowhere...`
`I got the feeling that the voice was coming from the heavens, ...and I looked up at the sky.`
`...What I saw there......was a woman I'd never seen before.`
`No, it's not true that I never saw her before.`
`...I saw her once today.`
`Yes, in the portrait inside the mansion...`
`The clothes were different, ...but that face was just like the witch of the portrait...`
`Aaah, who am I kidding, ...I already know who this person is...!!`
`"...A-Are you Beatrice?!!!"`
`"Yahhoooooooooi, Battleeeeeeeeeeeeer...!!"`
`From the second floor balcony, ...leaning out under an umbrella and waving high-spiritedly,`
` ...was, without a doubt, the witch of the portrait, ...Beatrice......!!`
`Was the plan for the boss to take a birds-eye view and let the goat underlings torture me to death...?!`
`I adjusted my grip on the spear, `
`and, imagining goats creeping out of the nearby shadows and the entrance and surrounding me, I raised my guard in all directions...`
`"Ahhaha, be at ease, there's no one here but you and me, see?`
` No goat furniture, no demon butlers or Teacher, not even the demon who's my close friend."`
`"And, there's none of the gold butterflies that compose my flesh, no magic circles, and no summoners as witnesses!!`
` ...Do you know what that means?"`
`"No clue.`
` Quit babbling..."`
`"It is true that I have met you several times even in this world.`
` Almost as though we just missed each other.`
` ...As you know, this world of Humans is filled with a toxin just by your existence and your doubting of me."`
`"Almost like solid ramparts strengthening the guard around you, the king!`
` And through multiple games,`
` I have advanced pieces one by one, split them apart, and cornered them, leveling your ramparts bit by bit."`
`"Then, a faint crack finally opened, and I sent a bishop in, so that it could approach right up next to you.`
` ......But as you know, bishops are pieces with blind spots.`
` As long as you stay on the black squares, a bishop on black can wield a massive influence,`
` but if you escape just one step to a white square, even if I close in right next to you, I will not be able to touch you."`
`"That is why I have progressed through this game by sending in various pieces to prevent you from staying on a white square,`
` forcing you out in front of me, the one who controls the black squares next to you."`
`"Howeeever!!`
` There are now holes opened all over your ramparts,`
` and I was able to send in not a bishop, but a full queen!!`
` Do you know what kind of piece a queen is?"`
`"A rook+bishop.`
` ...Is this what you're trying to say?`
` ...That now, you not only control the black squares that are part of the illusion of the witch, but have been able to eat into the white squares of the human world at will...?!"`
`"That is correct!!`
` You have been calling the squares with the gold butterflies that are my minions 'the Illusion of the Witch',`
` and you have denied them as unobserved unrealities, right...?`
` *cackle*cackle* I know...!!"`
`"For that very reason, I have openly descended to the white squares like this!!`
` Do not worry, I'll call plenty of gold butterflies and goats, demons and witches later!`
` If you wish, I'll invite you to the Golden Land!!`
` There, any wish can be granted...!!`
` Wahhahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`"...It's starting to look like someone knocked an ink bottle over the chessboard of this island."`
`"I see, a pleasant phrasing...!`
` *cackle*cackle* Soon, you will be covered in ink as well.`
` You will finally become covered with pitch black...and will surely become a black king...!`
` You really are pitiful, drowning in a sea of ink right now, aren't you?"`
`"No, that's wrong.`
` I'll admit that the island has been stained completely black from your ink bottle,`
` ...but there's still a white square left."`
`"Hoh, where...?!!"`
`"Right under my feet.`
` ......Your ink of magic tried to cover the entire island, but it can't cover the ground my feet are standing on.`
` ...Even if this island seems to be stained pitch-black at a glance, I am me.`
` I'm here, stepping on a white square!!"`
`It's strange...`
`Until a second ago, I was shivering all over.`
`...But now that she's appeared openly right before my eyes like this, my terror has actually lessened.`
`Interesting.`
` Ghosts are most terrifying when you can only sense them.`
`When you can see them, and they have a face you can plant your fist into, there's nothing scary about it...!!`
`...However, she definitely isn't an interesting or a friendly person.`
`...She can kill me instantly by snapping her fingers while rolling around giggling.`
`Whether we interpret the result of her snapping her fingers as magic flying at me or underlings showing up to shoot me, it doesn't matter.`
`...Anyway, whether this is fantasy or mystery,`
` that queen is in a position where she can kill me by just snapping her fingers...!`
`'!s0`
`@`
`...she's the queen of this island, `
`...who reigns over both the white and black squares...?!`
`"Well then,`
` it might be amusing to wait until you catch a cold in all that rain, but it's about time to move to the matter at hand.`
` ......Can you see the box down there?`
` Your test is inside it."`
`"Wait.`
` ...After all that's happened, I'm not interested in some stupid game about who'll become the Successor."`
`"My game is to take you and that damn geezer...and all of you guys who killed everyone...and smack 'em with a Gian punch.`
` One of those face-crushers."`
`"Hoh.`
` So, you will fly through the air up to my balcony?`
` Very well, very well, *cackle*!`
` Then, look, come on right now, here here, up up!"`
`"...Damn you, acting so carefree just because you're in a completely safe place...`
` I'm coming over there right now, so prepare yourself and wait for me!!"`
`"Aah, no, no.`
` The door is locked.`
` Of course, the shutters are down for all the windows.`
` My castle isn't so fragile that a single knight like you could break in!"`
`I tried opening the door to the entrance anyway, ...but it really was locked.`
`When I looked around, I noticed that the shutters were closed on the windows after all.`
`...Normally, those wouldn't be closed.`
`"...Tch.`
` Looks like you've prepared for everything.`
` ...Where's the key?!"`
`Gohda-san and Kumsawa-san probably had master keys, but they were in the closed room of the gardening shed.`
`...I can only give up for now...!`
`"Damn...`
` ...Guess she's no fool herself."`
`"Do you really want to be right beside me so muuch?`
` All right, if you impressively pass your test, why don't I grant you an audience?`
` If you pass, then you'll become the Successor and my new master.`
` ...My flesh and soul will be yours to do with as you please.`
` For I am no more than the Ushiromiya family's furniture!`
` Ahhahhahhahhahha!!"`
`"......Well,`
` it looks like you want to make me take this test no matter what.`
` ...Okay.`
` I'll give it a shot.`
` ...If I pass, my first prize will be a punch to your face."`
`"Scary, scaary...`
` But it's not like I mind being controlled by violence, you see?`
` Grab onto my head!`
` Make my face twist in pain, tear me apart like a hawk does with its talons to its prey, scratch at me and trample upon me...!!"`
`"Aaah, remind me of Kinzo in his younger days once more...!!`
` That single time in my thousand-year life!`
` Remind me of that day I was taught the joy of being controlled, surrendering and being reduced to furniture!!`
` Uhyaaahhyahhyahhyahhya!!"`
`"...You damn drunk, we aren't getting anywhere."`
`Ignoring the stupidly smiling witch, I picked up the box.`
`"Yes.`
` Open it.`
` Inside is a letter.`
` Read it."`
`"........."`
`I opened it.`
` ...There was a faint smell of cigarettes.`
`Apparently, it really had originally been a cigar case.`
`But there were no cigarettes or cigars inside.`
`Instead, there was a Western envelope with the One-Winged Eagle crest.`
`And when I opened that too, ...there was a letter inside.`
`I looked up at the witch.`
`She was grinning down at me.`
`...It seemed she was looking forward to seeing what kind of reaction I'd have to the contents.`
`...Damn, just perfect.`
`Its contents were something like this...`
`Among the three mentioned below...`
`In order to gain two, sacrifice one.`
`1. Your life`
`2. ＿＿'s life`
`3. Everyone else's lives`
`If you do not choose one, all of the above will be lost.`
`"......What's this?`
` Some pretty creepy stuff's written here.`
` More importantly, the second one's blank, so I don't even know whose life it's supposed to be."`
`"Indeed.`
` That second one is where you put the name of the one the test-taker loves the most.`
` For Jessica's test, it was Kanon's name, and for George's test, it was Shannon's.`
` ...Since they had obvious feelings for certain people, those names were written in beforehand,`
` but I don't know whom you have feelings for.`
` So I didn't know whose name to write and left it blank."`
`"That's perfect.`
` I love you, Beatrice.`
` I'll stick your name in here.`
` In that case, I'll choose the second choice.`
` Happy now?"`
`"Hey hey, quit joking, quit joking.`
` Heey, please, Battler.`
` Tell me the name of the person you have feelings for.`
` If you don't, then this won't be a test, right?"`
`"Sorry.`
` I don't have any girl in particular.`
` Even if I did, why the hell would I tell you?"`
`"In that case, this test will not work for you.`
` Hmmm, what a shame, what a shame.`
` And I was really wondering what kind of woman was your cup of tea!`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......What would you do if I said I liked flat-chested lolis with long, black hair?`
` That wouldn't match you at all, right?"`
`"Lies, you breast sommelier!`
` Blonde and bouncy is best, right?`
` Am I not truly the embodiment of your ideal, *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"If guessing your three sizes is the test to become the Successor, I'll take it gladly."`
`"Ah, yes.`
` This was the test to choose the Successor, wasn't it?`
` It was so fun chatting with you that I've been getting a bit off topic."`
`"...Then let us begin the test.`
` I will question you to see whether you are qualified to be the Successor to the Ushiromiya Family Headship.`
` Answer with care."`
`The witch, who had been joking around like she was drunk until a second ago, suddenly regained her dignity.`
`...She looked as though she truly had stepped out of that majestic portrait...`
`"......I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, the Golden Witch and the Endless Witch, Beatrice.`
` ...Do you have the qualifications to inherit the Ushiromiya family and all of my gold?`
` That is what I will test.`
` ......State your name."`
`"......Ushiromiya...Battler."`
`When faced with a dignity you wouldn't have imagined from her appearance a short while ago,`
` I answered without any hesitation.`
`...And from that...yes, I see,`
` ...I can tell why she's worthy of calling herself the true queen of this island.`
`"Very well, Ushiromiya Battler.`
` ......However, for these six years, you have thrown away that Ushiromiya name, have you not...?`
` Why was that...?"`
`"......Nn......`
` ...Because I ran out of love for that old bastard."`
`"I know.`
` It was because you felt that your father's remarriage disgraced the death of your mother, whom you respected, yes...?"`
`"I see, you have no blood relation to your new mother whatsoever.`
` It's not as though I can't understand why you'd be unable to accept that mother.`
` ...However, no matter whom your father remarried, that wouldn't change the fact that his blood runs in your veins, correct?"`
`"......What are you trying to say?"`
`"I can somewhat understand the childishness that led you to resist your father's remarriage, since you wanted him all to yourself."`
`"However, was throwing away the Ushiromiya name as a means of resistance not a disgrace to your family and blood?`
` ......You were born and raised Ushiromiya, were you not?`
` Do you think you had the right to forget that debt and throw away the Ushiromiya name?"`
`"...It's got nothing to do with you.`
` This is between me and Dad...!"`
`"The Ushiromiya name does not belong to you and your father alone.`
` That was your childishness, nothing more than your inability to forgive the fact that your father was stolen away by an unknown woman.`
` ...Those six years during which you threw away the Ushiromiya family register were a significant period during which you covered the Ushiromiya family in mud.`
` Know the depths of that sin."`
`"......Well, sorry I'm so childish..."`
`"However,`
` even though it occurred around the time of the deaths of your grandparents, you did well to return to the Ushiromiya register.`
` For that, let us give you a chance to purify that sin yourself.`
` Now is the time to compensate for your sin of six years ago."`
`"Come, try to remember, remember your own sin.`
` Remember that, confess, and repent.`
` ......That is the test I shall give you."`
`...At that time, a massive thunderclap rang out, making my mind go blank.`
`".........`
`...What do you mean, ...repent?`
` ......Are you trying to tell me to apologize?"`
`"......The test has already begun.`
` You may think as you wish."`
`The witch's expression did not look like a person forcing a tough question on someone and sneering at them.`
`...She was asking seriously, and he could even sense a quiet determination.`
`Even though the rain fell on Battler, he did not shift his eyes from that gaze.`
`...The witch threw her umbrella away.`
`She abandoned herself to the falling rain.`
`So that the rain would fall on her until Battler answered that question.`
`...She had chosen to let the rain fall on her as well until he reached an answer.`
`For some reason, Battler understood that.`
`...And yet, ...he didn't understand.`
`"...W-Well,`
` ...if you put it that way, I do think I was being childish...`
` All things considered, even Dad getting remarried didn't cancel out the debt I owed for him raising me."`
`"...I hear that Dad always kept on paying for my living expenses...`
`and that he even said he wanted to participate in school events.`
` ......The only reason he couldn't come...was because I told Grandpa and Grandma not to let him come, no matter what..."`
`"..............."`
`"...I-It's true that...I can't argue back if you wanna call that my childish resistance.`
` ......But you know, ...in that case,`
` ...who would clear away Mom's...Ushiromiya Asumu's regrets...?!`
` Even though Mom was so devoted to our family and did the very best she could...?!"`
`"Despite that, Dad was cheating with Kyrie-san.`
` He even got her pregnant with Ange...!`
` And then, along with her birth, he rushed to move them into his register.`
` ...If that wasn't a betrayal of Mom, then what was it?!`
` Who...`
`will clear up...`
`Mom's regrets?!!"`
`"...But what you're saying is also right.`
` Even though the cheating was a fact, the debt I owed for being raised was real too."`
`"In that case, they cancel each other out, so there's absolutely nothing wrong with me leaving the family, is there?!!`
` That's right, I had the right...no, the duty to smack Dad in Mom's place, didn't I?!"`
`"But I didn't do that!`
` I left without saying anything, as though I hadn't been there in the first place!!`
` And Dad forgot all about me and started a new family with Kyrie-san and Ange!`
` Doesn't that settle everything?!!"`
`But since then, six years have passed.`
`...Time healed the anger.`
`Kyrie-san understood my anger,`
` and even so, she tried to interact with me, even if it meant tearing her heart apart.`
`Ange didn't know anything about the situation,`
` and even though I lived in a separate house, she was raised believing that I was her real big brother and loved me as if it were true.`
`...Dad casually said to come home any time I wanted.`
`"It started to feel more and more ridiculous!!`
` I thought it was about time for me to cool my head as well.`
` So I said I'd put it all behind me as long as Dad apologized.`
` Then came the day of Grandpa's funeral!`
` Then, he really did put his hands on the floor and apologize...!!`
` Looking unbelievably pathetic...!`
` Dad did that and seriously bowed his head to me, you see...?!`
` ...When I saw that, it felt like it'd be stupid to keep it up any longer."`
`"I'm sure Mom thought the same thing!`
` Every time Dad and I fought, Mom would always laugh and mediate for us.`
` 'Oh, were you fighting over something that silly?'`
` is what she'd say.`
` ...I could feel Mom saying that and laughing...!!"`
`"So, `
`...though I couldn't actually say I'd forgive him, `
`......I thought it might be okay to start over again from square one.`
` So I decided to wind everything back to how it was six years ago.`
` ......Then, I returned to the Ushiromiya family register...!!`
` I'd also cried, raged, and worried for a whole six years!"`
`"It might've been the same for Dad...and for my dead Mom.`
` Maybe even for Kyrie-san and Ange.`
` ...So we went back to square one, and I returned to being Ushiromiya Battler!!!`
` That's my immediate family's problem...`
`and has nothing to do with the Ushiromiya family!!"`
`"You have no right to judge that as a sin, and I have no obligation to show repentance to you!`
` If there was anyone I should've done that for, you've already killed them!!`
` So I won't apologize for anything!`
` I won't repent!!`
` That's my answer for this test!!!"`
`"...............`
`...Is that all...?"`
`"What......?`
` ........."`
`Part of me had fully responded to her provocation,`
` and I'd supposedly vented out all the stuff I'd kept inside my chest, stuff I hadn't wanted to show anyone.`
`That was what the witch had supposedly been expecting.`
`...And yet, the witch's blank expression didn't change in the slightest.`
`I'd been sure she'd start cackling and guffawing,`
` sneering at my childish, foolish, and shameful past.`
`But to the contrary, I could feel a sense of disgust about her,`
` ...something you could almost call disappointment.`
`"......What do you mean 'Is that all?', ...I've exposed everything about me, right?`
` What more could you want?"`
`"That still isn't enough to clear away your sins."`
`"Clear away?`
` ...What the hell, are you asking me to prostrate myself right here and apologize like Dad did...?!"`
`"......That's not it.`
` I have no interest in matters concerning your immediate family or your home.`
` Where are we?`
` Rokkenjima.`
` The main residence of the Ushiromiya Head Family.`
` ...Isn't there a sin you ought to remember, fitting for this place...?"`
`"......Are you...saying that I have...another sin...?"`
`"...Remember, Ushiromiya Battler.`
` ......Not being able to remember that is your sin.`
` For that reason, I shall forgive you.`
` If you can remember it, I shall forgive you.`
` ......Remembering that is my test of atonement for you."`
`"......Even if you...tell me to remember..."`
`"......Remember.`
` ...That's what makes it a sin."`
`"Sorry, Beato.`
` ...I have absolutely no memory of it."`
`"...You make it sound like I caused you trouble six years ago or something,`
` but I supposedly met you for the first time at this family conference.`
` It's true that your legend also existed six years ago,`
` but I shouldn't have been acquainted with you."`
`"...Naturally.`
` On the Rokkenjima of six years ago, I had not yet materialized."`
`"Then what kind of sin are you saying I have?`
` ...Are you saying...I've sinned against you somehow...?"`
`"Don't make me say the same thing twice.`
` I had not materialized six years ago.`
` There was no way for me to become acquainted with you.`
` In the world that you are, it was as though I didn't exist."`
`...Beato's cold eyes...felt as though they were pursuing some kind of sin.`
`At a glance, it felt as though she still hated me for something I'd done to her...and that she blamed me for it.`
`However, ...I naturally didn't have a clue, and Beato had said it herself.`
`Six years ago, there was no link between us.`
`Six years ago, no person called Beatrice existed for me.`
`"......At least give me a hint.`
` ...Does this sin...`
`have anything to do with you and me...?"`
`"I had no connection to you six years ago.`
` Remove me from your thoughts already.`
` ...Why...do you think it is a sin against me?"`
`"......Your...eyes."`
`"My eyes...?`
` ......Hoh."`
`"Because...your eyes are whispering at me to apologize.`
` ...But I had no connection with you six years ago, and it looks like you acknowledge that too."`
`"......Is that true?`
` ...Is it really not a problem between me and you...?"`
`"......I already said it wasn't.`
` No problem between me and you has anything to do with this."`
`"But still, ...your eyes are telling me differently.`
` ......So I don't even have a clue."`
`"......Can you say it in red?`
` Can you proclaim that the sin you're telling me to remember isn't something between you and me?"`
`"............`
`...Very well."`
`#ff0000The sin I am now demanding that you remember is not between Ushiromiya Battler and Beatrice.#ffffff`
`"......Then...why are you looking at me with those eyes...?"`
`"I don't know.`
` ......I am simply gazing at you blankly.`
` If it feels that way to you, `
`...perhaps there's something making you feel that way."`
`".........`
`......What kind of sin are you saying I have?"`
`"#ff0000Ushiromiya Battler has a sin#ffffff."`
`"...And I'm asking you what kind.`
` I'll bet it's just some trivial sin, like hitting someone or tricking someone."`
`"#ff0000Because of your sin, people die.#ffffff"`
`"L-Liar...!`
` I've never killed anyone...!!`
` Then say it!`
` Who did I kill?!`
` When? Who? How?!"`
`"#ff0000Due to your sin, a great many humans of this island die.`
` No one escapes, all die.#ffffff"`
`"...Wh-Whaaaaat?!?!`
` Wh-What kind of incomprehensible thing are you saying?!`
` Are you saying I killed everyone?!`
` I'm a killer?!"`
`"It doesn't mean you carried it out directly.`
` ......However, because you committed a sin, from an imperfection in the cogs that stretch back a full six years, a distortion was created,`
` ...and tonight, this many lives are lost.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ~ib~You are one of the causes of this tragedy~ib~."`
`"...Qu-Quit messing around!!`
` I'm the cause?!`
` Then what?!`
` Are you saying 13 people died because I abandoned the Ushiromiya register six years ago?!`
` Are you saying that 13 people died because I came back to the Ushiromiya family after six years?!"`
`"Don't fuck with me, give it a rest!!!`
` For these six years, I've been the man farthest from the Ushiromiya family, right?!`
` How could I have influenced anything in any way?!"`
`"It's not like I came to the family conference because I wanted to, right?!`
` I'd returned to my family after six years, so to make up for that lost time,`
` I came to Rokkenjima reluctantly...!!`
` It's not like I had some duty to come here today!"`
`"I came back, and because of that, a massacre occurred?`
` Then what?!`
` Are you saying that if I hadn't come back, no one would've had to die?!`
` Say it in red!!`
` Can you say in red that, if I hadn't come back, this massacre crime wouldn't have occurred?!`
` ...There's no way you can say it, because you're the culprit for everything!!"`
`"Repeat it!!`
` 'If Ushiromiya Battler hadn't returned to Rokkenjima, this crime wouldn't have occurred'.`
` If you can say it, try saying it...!!`
` ...Can't do it, can you?`
` You can't say it! The culprit is you, not me!!`
` Don't try to rub that responsibility off onto meeeeeeee!!!"`
`"............"`
`"...Answer in red!!`
` Try to repeat it...!!`
` You can't!`
` My existence has nothing to do with the crime."`
`"Quit saying incomprehensible stuff and trying to confuse meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`I began to remember the coldness of the raindrops that kept pounding down.`
`...The rain earlier had just hurt,`
` ...but now I felt a tormenting cold from those raindrops...`
`"............`
`...Is there nothing that you remember?"`
`"......Sorry.`
` I don't even have a clue."`
`"............"`
`"...Hey.`
` ...I'm starting to get a little pissed off.`
` ...If there's something you wanna say, then say it.`
` If you have a grudge against me. you just have to say it out loud.`
` ...Don't do it in such a dirty way, forcing me to remember."`
`"......I'll ask one more time.`
` ...Can you remember any sin?"`
`"No!!`
` I can't remember anything...!!"`
`"......So, `
`...he says that he can remember...nothing."`
`With this, are your regrets at an end...?`
`"............`
`......I-Indeed..."`
`Even a hopeless bet can leave behind regrets if you do not take it.`
`...That's enough.`
`The betting itself has meaning.`
`"......That may be true.`
` ...In that case, this is...`
`the end of my regrets...and my game."`
`What will you do...?`
`"...Who knows.`
` ......I'm not interested at all anymore.`
` ...Sorry, but I wish to leave the game board now."`
`............`
`...I see.`
` ...I understand.`
`"I will take over for the rest of the game.`
` ......You may rest."`
`"...Indeed.`
` ........."`
`"All that remains, I will finish.`
` ......You may forget everything and bury your head in your pillow.`
` A feather futon should gently protect you from everything."`
`"......I'll be counting on you...to finish up the rest."`
`"Leave it to me.`
` ...Leave everything else to me...and sleep."`
`The witch who had questioned Battler hid herself,`
` and the other witch, who had appeared from behind, remained.`
`She certainly was identical, the same witch,`
` ......but her expression was somehow indifferent and ice-cold,`
` ...completely removed from the one who, despite seeming drunk up until then, had been in high spirits.`
`"......Hey!!`
` Are you listening?!`
` Isn't this enough for that test thing?!`
` I don't care whether I passed or failed!`
` I won't be satisfied until I can bash your face!!`
` Come down here!!`
` Or else open this door...!!"`
`The witch did not answer.`
`Her eyes were as ice-cold as Battler's shoulders.`
`...She was now clearly a different person since the time she'd first appeared on that balcony.`
`The witch gazed into my eyes...and gave two small shakes of the head.`
`Even without words, I was able to gather that she was expressing some kind of disappointment...`
`Without saying anything, the witch turned on her heels.`
`After that, only Battler remained, the cold rain still beating down on him......`
`The study was in the middle of a lively party.`
`It seemed that Gaap was making fun of Virgilia, having tripped her up in some stupid way.`
`...They were spitting 'Lialialia' and 'Gapgapgap' at each other.`
`With this as a sideshow, Kinzo and Ronove had opened a new bottle.`
`"Oh, you're back.`
` How were the results of Battler's test?!`
` Maria's test got passing marks with no complaints, you see?`
` I've despised her as a little girl, little girl,`
` but see, but see, why, why, oh my, oh my, not bad, not bad!`
` Wahhahhahhahhahha!!"`
`It seemed like Kinzo was dead drunk.`
`Facing Beato, who had returned, he laughed with the same level of tension as the time they'd left for the tests.`
`...However, Ronove and Virgilia instantly noticed the change in enthusiasm.`
`Gaap also froze her expression and went silent.`
`"Wahhahahahahahhahha, what is it, Beatrice, my beloved witch?`
` Not enough to drink? Not enough on the side?`
` Let's pour it all over a cow or something and roast it whole, ooh, not bad!"`
`"Ronove, prepare one right away!`
` Beatrice, let's leave the results of Battler's test for later.`
` Why don't we have a toast with spare rib first, uwahhahhahhahhahha!!"`
`".........Roast yourself whole."`
`"-hahhahhahha, `
`...what?"`
`The witch, who had spoken bluntly, coldly passed by Kinzo's side as he doubled over laughing in a great mood.`
`...Then, behind the witch's back, `
`......the old summoner's body suddenly went up in flames...`
`"Gyaaaaaahhh!!!!`
` Gwohh, gah, ...gyah, ......w...h...y......?!"`
`As crimson flames spat from his eyes, mouth, nose, ...every hole on his body, Kinzo rolled around.`
`...Even though it was a terrible hellfire, it didn't burn anything except Kinzo.`
`Kinzo didn't have a clue what was going on.`
`...Unable to understand why Beatrice, who had been in such a good mood,`
` had suddenly turned so cold, he rolled around...`
`The dancing silhouettes of the witch and demons created by that massive rolling torch...`
`looked like a group of excited spectators around a burning at the stake.`
`However, the eyes of the demons who watched over it were indifferent...`
`When Kinzo finally stopped moving, the fire disappeared, leaving a pitch-black corpse.`
`The inside of the room was commanded by the stillness of the sound of the rain...`
`"...What has happened, Milady?"`
`"I've gotten over...my excitement.`
` ......Clean up those bothersome cinders."`
`Beatrice's expression...was unbelievably indifferent.`
`...There was an iciness that might easily bring the others to the same fate as Kinzo if they annoyed her.`
`"......Y-Yes.`
` I will clean it up..."`
`Gaap made a jet-black pitfall swallow up Kinzo's cinders.`
`...If she hadn't carried that out quickly, Gaap might also have been burned.`
` You could even feel that thirst for blood.`
`No, a thirst for blood probably isn't the best way to describe it.`
`...Just like humans don't have any particular emotion when they step on an ant while they're walking...`
`...That was how much, unconsciously and mercilessly, Beato was now filled with a brutal emptiness that wouldn't hesitate at burying a passerby...`
`"...Wh-What is it, Beato?"`
`"I don't want to answer.`
` .........No, even answering is too much of a pain to do now."`
`"...What is it? This isn't like you.`
` ...Did something happen?`
` Did Battler say someth-`
`......ack, gah, gyah-"`
`Beatrice didn't even answer.`
` It seemed that she even ignored it.`
`But there was a change in Gaap.`
`From her feet, a creaking, cracking sound rose, like thin ice breaking,`
` ...and in an instant, turned Gaap into a glass sculpture.`
`"...G-Gaap..."`
`"......Disappear for a while.`
` I'm in a very bad mood."`
`Beatrice spoke that...`
`in a truly cold voice, which could freeze the heart just by hearing it.`
`"...Certainly.`
` Then, please allow us to retire.`
` ......If you need anything, call at any time."`
`After bowing, Ronove turned into a cloud of gold butterflies and hid himself.`
`After turning Gaap, who had become a sculpture, into a cloud of gold butterflies, `
`Virgilia also turned into a cloud, which mixed in with the others and disappeared.`
`......In the study made untidy by drinking,`
` ...Beatrice stood still, alone.`
`Since the time she had returned, her expression hadn't changed in the slightest...`
`...However, when she saw the fallen empty wine bottles and scattered cheese plates,`
` her brow furrowed, and she looked a bit displeased.`
`And when she whispered 'disappear', in that instant, the room was cleaned up in a flash, as though nothing had happened.`
`The reception chairs were neatly arranged, and there was no wine or cheese.`
`There were no stains or scattered trash either.`
`...To the contrary, even the air had frozen over,`
` and, enough to make one doubt whether a large number of noisy people really had been in this room until a short while ago, `
`......the study had returned to silence.`
`......In that silent, ...frigid study where even the air had frozen,`
` Beatrice stood still...`
`Then, she called, muttering.`
`".........Battler,`
` are you there?"`
`"...I've been here for a while.`
` ......What the hell's going on with you?`
` You've been strange since a short while ago."`
`"Do I seem strange?`
` My apologies."`
`"......Even though you were drinking so happily with that damn geezer, you suddenly burned him up,`
` and your demoness friend is a glass sculpture.`
` ...When you told the demon butler and your teacher to leave, they disappeared right away at your words.`
` ...Just how fickle and selfish are you?"`
`"Battler, I'm done."`
`"Done with what?"`
`"......I've grown bored of this."`
`"Huh?`
` ......That's...well...you were the one who started this game.`
` Heh, if you've had enough, that's great for me.`
` So basically, you're giving up?"`
`"I am not giving up.`
` I am simply ending it.`
` No, I won't even end it.`
` I am just abandoning this game for all eternity."`
`"Doesn't that mean you're giving up?`
` ...Nah, the words 'got bored of it and threw it away' fit you perfectly."`
`"That is correct.`
` I grew bored of it...and am throwing it away.`
` I don't care what happens next.`
` It can remain abandoned and gather dust as much as you like."`
`".........`
`...What's going on with you?`
` You've been kinda hard to deal with since a short while ago."`
`"...Are these still the aftereffects of that incomprehensible test from earlier?`
` If you've got a grudge, all you have to do is say so clearly.`
` You said in red that it has nothing to do with you, but that's gotta be a play on words, right?`
` It's written all over your face.`
` You have a grudge against me."`
`"How many times will I have to say I have no grudge against you before you'll understand?`
` At the time you committed your sin, I did not exist."`
`As Beato spoke with an offended expression, her face twisted to look even more displeased.`
`Fickle.`
` Inconsistent.`
` Moody.`
` Temperamental.`
` ...Selfish and simple-minded and cruel.`
`But even so, she hadn't shown an expression as strange as this even once until now...`
`"......Well, you were the one who provoked me into this game.`
` I'm a bit let down that it wasn't resolved, but feel free to invite me again if you feel like it."`
`"But when that happens, allow me to politely refuse, okay?`
` Heheheh."`
`He intentionally spoke in a mocking tone, but Beato showed no reaction.`
`...Battler hung his head and clicked his tongue...`
`"We've circled around October 4 and 5 over and over again, but I've finally had just about enough of this role.`
` ...This way, the boat will come tomorrow."`
`"...That's right, and then the seagulls will return to the harbor.`
` ...I'll finally be able to hear Rokkenjima's signature nya-nya- cries.`
` After all, maybe because of the weather, they weren't there at all when I came to the island."`
`"......When the seagulls cry, everything will end, I guess.`
` All done, the end.`
` What a relief."`
`"......Exactly what is it that you're misunderstanding?"`
`"Hmm?`
` What'd you say?"`
`"......I said that nothing would end.`
` With this, everything will be abandoned.`
` The game will be forgotten, and the pieces on the board will be abandoned as they lay.`
` There will be no advancing or returning, no taking and being taken.`
` No victory, no defeat, not even a tie.`
` Just abandoned."`
`"......Doesn't that mean it's over?"`
`"Wrong.`
` On my turn, the game will stop for all eternity.`
` Your turn will not come.`
` So there will be no victory nor defeat nor a tie."`
`"......In the past, I couldn't let you do that.`
` After all, one of my goals was winning against you.`
` However, I've lost interest.`
` So there is no longer any point in making moves any longer."`
`"......What do you mean...by my turn not coming...?"`
`I'd thought that Beato getting tired of the game meant I'd be released...and that I'd be able to escape Rokkenjima.`
`But for some reason, Beato's repeated words...about the difference between abandoning the game and settling it...`
`caught my attention...`
`......Just what is it she's been saying, ...and why the bad mood...?`
`At that time, I suddenly heard a voice from behind me.`
`When I turned around, ...there was someone I thought I might, or might not, remember from somewhere...`
`...A mysterious girl, with no light in her eyes, was standing there.`
`"......What this kid's saying goes something like this.`
` ...She means putting the lid on this game and leaving the pieces as they are.`
` The game will be locked away for all eternity, without ending."`
`"The only way for you to return to your original world is to win against Beato.`
` ......So, if Beato abandons the game, `
`...get it?"`
`Suddenly, in a different place...was a girl wearing a bright pink dress.`
`...I had a feeling I'd met her somewhere too, but I couldn't remember.`
`More important was the meaning of her words.`
`...If the game is abandoned, then...huh?`
`"......That's right.`
` A match won't be resolved unless enemies and allies meet.`
` ......It would mean that you'd never be able to win and escape from this world for all eternity."`
`"What it comes down to, I guess, ...is something like taking the key to the cage that you're locked in,`
` fastening it to the collar of a pigeon or something, and letting it fly."`
`"......This isn't funny, Beato.`
` We didn't come this far to watch such a boring game.`
` Calling it a day like this is no joke."`
`"......I agree with Lambda.`
` I came here to make Battler win and to make you writhe in defeat.`
` I still haven't achieved that goal.`
` ...I won't stand for you abandoning the game at a time like this and running away."`
`"I acknowledge that it would mean the curtain call for a game that disappoints you Ladies.`
` ...However, I, the host of this tea party, am fickle.`
` Once it's lost its fun, I know no way of entertaining.`
` ...I believe that's been my witch-like way of doing things from the very beginning.`
` There are no problems, yes...?"`
`".........`
`...Certainly.`
` I won't go against your creed."`
`"I won't accept it...`
` ...Quit fooling around, how much do you think I've supported you...?`
` You think I'd be okay with that after all this preparation?`
` Don't mess with me...!!"`
`"I am saying that I have tired of it.`
` Nothing more, nothing less."`
`"That's not gonna fly...`
` We'll have you continue this game.`
` You wanna win against Battler, right?`
` You wanna win and make him surrender, right?!`
` You're almost there, aren't you?!`
` Am I right?!"`
`"......D-Don't ask me that.`
` ...But...I have an opinion too.`
` Let me say it."`
`"......What?"`
`"This is a fight you picked.`
` I'm prepared to settle this once and for all.`
` ...I've come close to surrendering many times, `
`but I've never had any intention of escaping partway through, leaving the match undecided."`
`"...Since I'm here, showing the will to fight,`
` ...you'd better not run away, Beatrice."`
`"......I agree.`
` Getting Battler involved and then leaving without giving him victory or defeat is just too irresponsible."`
`Suddenly, even Gretel was there.`
`...And everyone was calling Beato irresponsible.`
`"Hoh.`
` ...It seems I'm mostly being called irresponsible because Battler will, as my opponent, be stuck.`
` ......In that case, Battler,`
` will you step down from being an opponent, as I shall?`
` That way, I will have done nothing worthy of criticism."`
`"If I step down, will I be able to leave Rokkenjima...?"`
`"There's no chance you'll be able to leave.`
` Just be covered in dust and let it pile up on your shoulders."`
`"......Quit fooling around.`
` What an irresponsible person.`
` You've killed such a large number of people.`
` On top of that, using a witch's power, you've done it over and over.`
` Killing in gruesome ways!`
` ......I definitely won't let you escape without taking responsibility...!"`
`"Responsibility.`
` ...Hoh, what is it I should do to take this so-called responsibility?"`
`"Fight until a resolution is reached.`
` Battler will sit in the chair across from you, never giving up and fighting until he beats you.`
` So you too, fight until you're defeated.`
` If you don't like that, try and defeat Battler...!!"`
`"I won't forgive you...if you leave everything unresolved and abandon Battler in this chair, `
`...locking him up and never letting him return...`
` ......I won't forgive you...!!"`
`"...Gretel."`
`To be perfectly honest,`
` I didn't really understand from what standpoint Gretel was trying to save me.`
`...But in her words, `
`I could feel a strong determination to save me from this insane game world no matter what.`
`So, I responded in kind.`
`"Beato,`
` face me."`
`"........."`
`"I am here.`
` Across from you, in the seat of your rival.`
` ...Get it?`
` As long as I continue to sit here,`
` I won't allow you to escape.`
` ...So don't escape. Fight."`
`"Isn't this a fight you started?`
` You did all that crap over and over, making a complete mess of things!`
` How could I let you end it because you're tired, after all this time?!!`
` I am your opponent!!`
` As long as I'm here,`
` I won't let you escape!!"`
`"Are you listening, you irresponsible witch?!`
` Try saying somethiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing!!!"`
`After I yelled at her, ...Beato went silent for a while.`
`Whether my words had reached her, or whether she was thinking about something completely different, ...I couldn't tell.`
`But for a while, she was silent,`
` ...gazing at me with an expression I could read no emotion from,`
` ...and when she realized that I'd noticed, she averted her gaze.`
`Then, she turned her back to me...and said this...`
`"So, since Battler will not quit as my opponent, ...the Ladies are saying that my abandonment of this game will not be acknowledged.`
` ......In that case, let's ask.`
` Let's see if the man over there was qualified to be my opponent in the first place."`
`"......Qualified?"`
`"...Probably has something to do with that test or whatever just now."`
`"......What are you planning to do...?"`
`"...D-Don't tell me you're..."`
`"I will now determine whether or not you are qualified to be my opponent.`
` ......Ready, Battler?`
` If those qualifications are acknowledged, I will stay in my seat and continue the game.`
` And I shall promise to fight for all eternity until the outcome is decided."`
`"Heh!`
` I was ready for that from the beginning."`
`"......However,`
` if you are not qualified,`
` ...you must disappear.`
` If the opponent disappears, there is no game.`
` I can leave this place openly.`
` ......Are the Ladies satisfied?`
` Interruptions will not be necessary."`
`"............`
`...Go ahead, do as you like."`
`"......B-Battler...`
` You...make sure you answer well..."`
`"The very reason I'm here is because I'm qualified, right?`
` Heh, there's nothing to be scared of...!"`
`"......`
`......Y-You couldn't be..."`
`Gretel grew suddenly pale.`
`...I'd thought her to be the calm, collected type, so that expression surprised me.`
`"...Well then, Battler.`
` I shall have you repeat it in red."`
`"Y-You're telling me to repeat something?`
` Heheh, ...damn you, stealing my signature move.`
` ...But can I use the red truth too?`
` How...?"`
`"......I-If you wish for it to be that way, you can do it.`
` It's easy."`
`"#ff0000My name is Ushiromiya Battler#ffffff.`
` ...W-Whoa, pretty cool."`
`"Stop it!!`
` I know what you're after...!!`
` But stop that!`
` He's...!!"`
`When Gretel yelled, Beato glared at her.`
`Then, her form was wiped away in an instant.`
`"Shut up.`
` Leave your seat for a while.`
` You too, Ladies.`
` If you interfere, I will not hold back."`
`"......We won't get in the way.`
` Go ahead, do as you like."`
`"B-Bern, this is bad!!`
` She's trying to erase Battler!!"`
`"...What's that...?`
` What's...she planning...?"`
`"Well then, I shall question your qualifications.`
` ......Interesting.`
` Attack and defense are reversed from a normal game.`
` This is a very precious experience, coming at the very, very end.`
` ......Ready? Listen carefully.`
` I will speak with the red first."`
`'!s0`
`#ff0000And I opened this game in order to fight Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler.#ffffff`
`"...I know that.`
` So what?"`
`"Repeat it.`
` ......'Ushiromiya Battler's mother is Ushiromiya Asumu'."`
`"What?!`
` ...Why's Mom's name popping up all of a sudden...?"`
`"I do not require chatter.`
` Just repeat it in red."`
`Beato urged me with the same indifferent tone.`
`...But I don't have a clue what she's trying to do.`
`...I have absolutely nothing to feel guilty for that would trouble me if thrown in my face, and there's nothing that I'm hiding.`
`There's nothing that could trouble me by demanding that I repeat it.`
`...So, why do something like this...?`
`"Sure, I'll repeat it.`
` #ff0000Ushiromiya Battler's mother is Ushiromiya Asumu.#ffffff`
` ...The red sure is convenient.`
` No need to bother myself with bringing a copy of the family register."`
`"Idle chatter is unnecessary.`
` Let's continue.`
` 'Your name is Ushiromiya Battler'."`
`"...Sure.`
` #ff0000My name is Ushiromiya Battler#ffffff."`
`"It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that Ushiromiya Battler was born."`
`"#ff0000It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that Ushiromiya Battler was born.#ffffff"`
`"It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that you were born."`
`'!s1`
`...`
`...nguh, `
`......?!`
` ...?!?!"`
`At that time, my throat suddenly closed...`
`I was rapidly assaulted with a choking suffocation.`
`......Wh-What's going on...?`
` ...O-One more time...`
`"It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born...`
` ...Damn, `
`it was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born...`
` ......Wh-What the hell?`
` Even though I was doing it so easily a second ago, I suddenly stopped being able to get the red to work...?!"`
`".........Do you refuse to repeat it?"`
`"I'm not refusing anything...!!`
` It's not working for some reason...!!`
` It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born...!!`
` Why?!`
` Dammit, why can't I use the red?!`
` What the hell?!?!"`
`"......Nngg..."`
`"........."`
`My Mom is Ushiromiya Asumu, right?!`
` Why can't I say that fact in red?!`
` What's going on...?!`
` Th-This is...gghh-!!`
`"If you try to forcefully speak red that cannot be spoken, you choke.`
` There is no need to strain yourself.`
` ......Allow me to use the aforementioned fact to press you in blue.`
` ...Do you remember?`
` The blue is used to proclaim a theory for the opponent to deny.`
` They are then burdened with the responsibility of denying that in red, and if they do not, it becomes your victory.`
` ......Then let us begin."`
`#5decffDue to my previous demand to repeat and your subsequent refusal, `
`I proclaim that you are not qualified to be my opponent.#ffffff`
`#5decffAfter all, Beatrice opened this game...`
`in order to fight with 'Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler'.#ffffff`
`#5decffThis gave you the responsibility, as my opponent, `
`to declare in red that you are 'Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler'.#ffffff`
`#5decffYou have refused to repeat that.#ffffff`
`#5decffThis means the loss of your qualifications.#ffffff`
`"...D-Deny something about that in red...`
` ...Quickly!!"`
`"S-Sure...`
` I-`
`#ff0000I am Ushiromiya Battler#ffffff...!`
` Because I can say that in red, I should be your opponent!!"`
`"It may be a fact that you have the name Ushiromiya Battler.`
` However, `
`#5decffpeople's names are not exclusive.#ffffff`
` #5decffThere is a possibility that multiple humans have the name Ushiromiya Battler.#ffffff"`
`"#5decffIn short, this is what it means.#ffffff`
` #5decff...You are a different person with the same first and last names as Ushiromiya Asumu's son, Ushiromiya Battler.#ffffff"`
`"...Wh-What'd you say...?!!`
` Don't be so stupiiiiiiiiid!!`
` I'm Mom's child!!`
` Ushiromiya Asumu's child!!`
` `
`#ff0000It was from Ushiro`
`#ffffffmiya Asumu that...`
`ah, `
`ngagh, `
`...nnnggghh...!!!`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, but_4e825:`
`"Damn!!`
` Why?!`
` Why can't I say that I was born from my Mom?!`
` How could something so stupid be true?"`
`"No need to suffer.`
` I will not toy with you.`
` ...This is checkmate.`
` #ff0000You are not Ushiromiya Asumu's son#ffffff."`
`......Wha......`
`"You're...`
`kidding...me......"`
`"Who are you?`
` What person calling themselves Ushiromiya Battler?"`
`"W-Wait a second...`
` ...I am...Ushiromiya Battler...`
` It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born, and I'm Dad and Mom's son...!"`
`"No.`
` There is no way that you're my opponent, Ushiromiya Battler.`
` With this as proof."`
`"Proof, you say?!"`
`"You do not know of that sin six years ago."`
`"......Uh, `
`......th-that's......"`
`"No, the true Ushiromiya Battler would not have committed a sin.`
` But a sin did occur in the end, that span of six years became a blank space,`
` and a man who knew nothing of that time took on the name Ushiromiya Battler and appeared on Rokkenjima.`
` ......That truth...goes like this."`
`Six years ago, ...my opponent, the true Ushiromiya Battler, was already dead.`
`You were part of a plot by Rudolf having something to do with distribution of the inheritance, `
`...a body double set up in Ushiromiya Battler's place.`
`"...H-How could something that stupid be true......?`
` ......That's...so...ridiculous......"`
`"...B-Battler...!`
` Get ahold of yourself...!!"`
`"............Well, `
`...if he can't counter back, there's nothing more to do.`
` ...Battler did not possess that qualification.`
` That's how it is."`
`"A-Are you okay with that, Bern?!`
` If you accept that, you'll lose too, right?!"`
`"Won't you win?`
` ...Why are you taking Battler's side...?"`
`"...N-Nnnn..."`
`"What a shame, Battler.`
` ......What a real shame that you didn't have the qualifications to be Beatrice's opponent.`
` I was careless myself,`
` betting on an unqualified piece.`
` ......It's my utter defeat, Beatrice."`
`"...There is no victory or defeat.`
` The opponent will simply disappear.`
` Or perhaps I should say that he was never there to begin with."`
`"But then, ...who......am I...?`
` Am I...not Dad and Mom's kid...?!`
` Who am I...? What am I...?`
` ......If I'm not Mom's kid, ...then what, are you saying I'm a kid they picked up somewhere, like a stray cat?!"`
`"If that is the case, it would mean that you do not share Kinzo's blood.`
` Either way, you are not qualified to compete in this game."`
`'!s1`
`......you're kidding me......"`
`"Enough.`
` ...From the very beginning, I was faintly aware of the possibility that you weren't Ushiromiya Battler.`
` ...So, I had to question you.`
` I had to ask about something the real Battler would have known."`
`"......What a shame.`
` I even bet on the one-in-a-quadrillion chance of a miracle...`
`that you might really be Ushiromiya Battler.`
` But it seems you really are a different person with the same first and last names."`
`"......Nnng, ...nnnnn......"`
`Bit by bit, ...Battler's form began to be clouded in darkness...`
`No, maybe it was the other way around.`
`...The whole world was clouded in darkness, leaving only Battler...`
`Battler was down on all fours, hanging his head and repeatedly questioning himself.`
`...However, he was not given an answer...`
`In the world stained with darkness, Beato spoke something and Lambdadelta ran up to him, yelling something very quickly,`
` but it already seemed very far away, and it didn't reach Battler's ears...`
`'!s0`
`...not knowing who he himself was, `
`...erased...`
`himself......`
`"Battleeeeeeeeeeeeer, ...aahhh......"`
`"Now my opponent has disappeared.`
` ...Well then, if you'll excuse me.`
` And Ladies, you should get ready for your journey.`
` No more festivities have been prepared for in my territory.`
` It was good seeing you.`
` ...Goodbye."`
`Without saying anything more,`
` she clouded her own form in darkness as well...and disappeared...`
`"......A-Are you...okay with this?!`
` Battler...d-disappeared, right?!`
` I know how much you hate losing. Are you really okay with this?!"`
`".........Weren't you betting on my defeat?`
` Good for you then.`
` Congratulations, Lambda.`
` Let's meet again in some other world, okay?"`
`"Well, this is a world of endless Fragments.`
` The chances of us having some connection again somewhere are probably less than one in a quadrillion.`
` ......Anyway, it was fun.`
` Bye-bye."`
`"Ah, ...wait up, Bern...!!!"`
`Chasing after Bernkastel, who had disappeared first, Lambdadelta disappeared as well...`
`After that, everyone was gone, ......and the study was now completely empty.`
`It returned to silence, almost as though no one had been there from the outset.`
`...No one was here in the first place.`
`The silent study spoke that wordlessly, and the sound of the wind and rain began to fill the room bit by bit...`
`In a world where everything had sunk into darkness, Beato questioned herself.`
`"...As I thought, ......from the very beginning, magic should only have been used within Mariage Sorcière."`
`"......Seems so.`
` ...I also...`
`...thought that with Ange."`
`"The witches' alliance is you and I.`
` It started with those two.`
` ...Including other people was our first mistake..."`
`"......It's just so fun.`
` ...We wanted to add someone close to us into that circle."`
`"And we wished that the witches' alliance would get really large,`
` that everyone would be able to use fun magic together, and that we'd all be happy."`
`"However, ......only you and I were able to understand magic after all."`
`"We are...the only two witches in this world, who were brought together by a miracle.`
` ......And now, as long as I have Beato, I don't need anyone else."`
`"......Me too.`
` As long as you are here, I don't need anyone else anymore."`
`"In the very first moment that Mariage Sorcière was formed, `
`...it was already complete."`
`".........That is...so.`
` That is truly so..."`
`It was once a witches' alliance to make everyone happy together with magic.`
`...I wonder when it got this screwed up?`
`What did I want to do when I started this game?`
` ...I can't really remember even that.`
`No, I may remember,`
` ...but that's a feeling I now wish to throw away to the far side of oblivion.`
`"......It's okay.`
` Why not forget everything?`
` Let's have a Mariage Sorcière for just the two of us.`
` ...We'll acknowledge each other.`
` And no one will hurt us.`
` So we won't be hurt. We won't cry.`
` Let's forget everything.`
` ......Hey, Beato.`
` ...We are...eternal..."`
`"............Maria...`
`......uuuuuuuu, ......uuuuuuuuuuuuu...!!"`
`"Amakusa, could you turn that off?"`
`"Whoops, my bad.`
` You don't like M. Zakky?"`
`"I'm just not in the mood."`
`Amakusa turned the radio off.`
`The world of cheery sounds was immediately swallowed up by the roar of the sea...`
`and blotted out by the ocean's gray...`
`"......Can you see it?`
` Over there's where the harbor was at the time."`
`"............"`
`The boat captain pointed, but I couldn't really recall that scene of 12 years ago.`
`...I thought I'd surely be able to immediately remember how things had been at the time,`
` ...but no memories came back to me.`
`After that incident, the island was sealed off and left to the wild.`
`...I couldn't satisfy myself with the thought that this was just inevitable, and it felt sad and painful for some reason.`
`......Ah, but I at least remember one thing.`
`You might say that it'd probably be the same anywhere on the sea, ...but I remember at least one thing.`
`The cries...`
`of the seagulls.`
`I do remember...those.`
`...When I was young, I rarely went to the ocean.`
`...So everything that symbolized the ocean meant Rokkenjima and a family gathering to me.`
`In short, ...it was a symbol for the happiness of going out with my family.`
`However, at this point in time, it seems doubtful whether that even was happiness.`
`In my younger days, the trip had felt like a relaxed family vacation, but considering my parents' situation at the time, `
`it was surely a very difficult trip to handle, with the distribution of the inheritance filling the place with the smell of gunpowder.`
`I can remember giggling all over the place, completely ignorant of my parents' feelings...`
`"...Rokkenjima, huh?`
` The place of all beginnings, and the end of the line for all journeys."`
`Amakusa, in an attempt to speak for my innermost feelings, tried to sound cool.`
`The boat slowly rounded the island.`
`...I hoped that viewing it at a different angle might bring back my memories of the island's silhouette at the time just a little,`
` but in the end, even when that inlet was hidden completely by cliffs, I wasn't able to remember anything...`
`"...Captain, please tell me...`
`about that other harbor you mentioned."`
`"Sure.`
` ......Rokkenjima supposedly has only one harbor.`
` But that's only for public appearances."`
`"On the back of the island, there's another hidden harbor.`
` ......Like Rokkenjima itself.`
` It has a second face, which no one knows about..."`
`"......Rokkenjima is an island owned by the Ushiromiya family.`
`"So this island...has two harbors and two mansions.`
` He sure spent a lot just to keep a mistress."`
`"Who knew about this other harbor...?"`
`"Very few.`
` Kinzo-san, the butler Genji-san.`
` Those of us involved with the boats,`
` and a very small number of the oldest servants.`
` ...Both the previous owner of the Nanjo clinic and that Kumasawa baa-san knew.`
` Naming them off like this makes it sound like there were quite a few, but basically, there was a small number of people who knew."`
`"Please...tell me about that other mansion."`
`"...I was only told that there was a mansion called Kuwadorian.`
` Since I wasn't allowed to leave the boat, I never saw it, not even once."`
`"So it was far enough away that you couldn't see it from the harbor?"`
`"I don't know.`
` ...But it was a hidden mansion, after all.`
` It was probably built where you couldn't see it from the outside.`
` ...Anyway, Kuwadorian was the biggest secret of that island."`
`"There's a theory that Beatrice lived in Kuwadorian, or else was confined there.`
` What do you think, Captain?"`
`"...I did sometimes carry miscellaneous goods to Kuwadorian.`
` And that included a lot of stuff that only women would use, and expensive stuff at that.`
` ...I'm also convinced that theory is true."`
`"So does that mean you never saw Beatrice directly, Captain?"`
`"Nope.`
` Came and went for about 20 years, and I never saw her once."`
`"Twenty years...!`
` Whew, that means she was at least 20+.`
` Look's like she wasn't some mademoiselle."`
`"But one day, *bang*, all coming and going to and from Kuwadorian suddenly stopped.`
` That was about 30 years ago, `
`...so around Showa 43 (1968), I think."`
`"*bang*?`
` You mean suddenly?"`
`"...We came to the Hidden Side on a set schedule to carry food and trash back and forth.`
` ...Ah, right, the Hidden Side's what we called the harbor linked to Kuwadorian."`
`"I get it.`
` ...So then?"`
`"One day, we got an urgent message from Genji-san.`
` He said that until we heard differently, there was no need for us to go to the Hidden Side anymore."`
`"And did you hear differently?"`
`"Not really.`
` Long story short, one day, I was suddenly told that they wouldn't need regular service to the Hidden Side anymore...and that I didn't have to take food there either.`
` ...At first, I thought I was being fired.`
` But I quickly figured it out.`
` ...Going by the reactions of the servants who knew of Kuwadorian, I managed to guess somehow."`
`"......Beatrice died, and there was no longer any need to take food or people to care for her?"`
`"That's what I think.`
` From that point on, I was never told to take a boat to the Hidden Side.`
` However, after that, Genji-san came to see me face to face and got pushy, `
`strongly urging me never to speak of anything related to the Hidden Side until I died."`
`"So, if that hidden mansion was abandoned for 20 whole years, `
`......why was Aunt Eva there?"`
`On that day 12 years ago...`
`...Ushiromiya Eva somehow escaped harm alone in a hidden mansion 2 kilometers away from the mansion.`
`Why was she in a hidden mansion that had been forgotten for 20 years......?`
`"I saw on the talk shows.`
` Even I don't have a clue what happened.`
` Not once did I guide Eva-san to the Hidden Side.`
` I have no idea how or why she knew about or reached Kuwadorian."`
`"I wonder if it was possible to reach this Hidden Kuwadorian by land."`
`"...If, as we heard, the forest was dense and uncultivated,`
` I seriously doubt a well-dressed lady person'd be able to bush-crash it."`
`"So what about by sea?`
` Maybe there was a motorboat or something."`
`"Are you kidding?`
` That two-nighter typhoon was awful.`
` No way you could'a used a boat."`
`"So what if...there was an underground passage or something between the mansion and Kuwadorian.`
` Wouldn't it have been a pain to have to charter a boat each time he wanted to visit his mistress's house...?"`
`"You mean a tunnel long enough to connect mansions on opposite sides of a 2 kilometer island like Rokkenjima...?"`
`"...Well, I'd like to laugh at the thought, but this rich guy made a whole hidden mansion for his mistress.`
` Guess I can't deny the possibility.`
` ...What do you think, Captain?"`
`"I'm a man of the sea.`
` I don't know about holes.`
` But the Japanese military dug a 25 kilometer tunnel on Iwo Jima.`
` Wouldn't surprise me if 'that' Kinzo-san could dig at least 2 kilometers."`
`".........There really is something wrong with this island.`
` Even now, not one of us really knows a thing about it."`
`The boat reached the shore.`
`They would have to walk a short ways to reach the mansion.`
`"...I'll wait here.`
` The mansion's that way.`
` The path from back then's probably still there, but I'll bet it's covered with plants.`
` Make sure you don't get lost."`
`"Right, let's go."`
`"Thanks for everything, Amakusa.`
` You wait here too."`
`"......Well, I had a feeling you'd say that."`
`"I'm just delivering something.`
` It'll be troublesome for them if you come too.`
` I imagine your toxin is strong."`
`"Toxin?`
` Oho."`
`"I'll be back soon.`
` Today, our main goal is Kuwadorian.`
` ...After I deliver this, I'll come right back."`
`Ange put on her knapsack, holding the flowers she would offer.`
`"Give her some space, young'un.`
` ...See you soon, little lady.`
` Your family's waiting for you."`
`I had never been on a road like this, but I had no trouble finding my way.`
`If I walked straight ahead, it would probably guide me to the final destination for everything.`
`It was true that the vegetation was incredibly thick, and if I didn't pay attention, I would lose track of the path.`
`...But the road that was left was much clearer than I'd guessed it would be.`
`Still, that didn't change the fact that it was a bad road.`
`...Contrary to the distance shown on the map, I was forced to walk a long way...`
`...The forest was deep and dark.`
`At the time, I had been threatened into staying away from the forest because a witch lived there.`
`Of course, that fear is gone now, ......but...I feel it.`
`Because I was me,`
` ...I could feel the presence, like an aura, of the Golden Witch, Beatrice...`
`Here and there were massive fallen lumps of rock along with overgrown trees and ivy.`
` ...And the voices of birds and bugs.`
`Yeah, I feel it.`
`......I feel...that the witch...is here...`
`Ahead, an ivy-covered construction site fence and warning sign stood.`
`'No entry, Tokyo Metropolis'.`
`That was written on it.`
`Yeah, that's right.`
` When you think 'Tokyo', you tend to think of a city,`
` but Rokkenjima is also located within the Tokyo Metropolis.`
`...Apologizing to the sign for my rude mistake, I climbed the fence.`
`When I crossed the steep slope beyond that, ......my field of vision rapidly expanded,`
` and a fresh sea breeze blew through my hair...`
`It was like the top of a little hill.`
`...Below me was a vast view of the island.`
`I could only see desolated forest and rock walls spread out below me.`
`...But I realized that the mansion was probably somewhere around there.`
`The steep downward slope beyond this hill had probably been caused by earth and rocks collapsing from 12 years of wind and rain.`
`It had become a slant filled with crags that you might even call gentle cliffs,`
` and it would be easy to tumble down, though it looked like climbing back would be pretty difficult.`
`......In any event, it seemed that proceeding any further would be impossible.`
`If I continued any further, I wouldn't be able to return.`
`In other words, ......this is...the border.`
`This place is 1986 and 1998.`
`And, it is that day and today.`
`The boundary between this world and nirvana.`
`"......This spot is...`
`this journey's final destination, it seems."`
`As the strong winds blew Mammon's and Sakutaro's hair, they looked down from the hilltop...`
`"...From here, I can't really tell.`
` Where's the mansion?`
` Let's get closer."`
`『Uryu, ...that's impossible.`
` We won't be able to come back.』`
`...We won't be able...to come back.`
` ...Is that it?`
`I see.`
` ...This is 1998, `
`...and I am the Ushiromiya Ange who has been left all alone.`
`At first, this was a journey to die.`
`But not anymore.`
`It's become a journey to accomplish something...`
`"Yeah.`
` ...So, I'm sorry, you two.`
` Although, as I was back then on that day, I would've gone down that cliff without any hesitation."`
`"Come on, this is pretty lame for the skyscraper-jumping Ushiromiya Ange."`
`"Sorry."`
`『This place is as good as any.`
` ......After all, you can feel the wind of that day.』`
`"......`
`...Was the wind...really like this?"`
`『Yeah.`
` Very soon, they will come.`
` .........Everyone.』`
`Sakutaro said it as though it was completely natural.`
`...And...I believed it.`
`Dad.`
`Mom.`
`Onii-chan.`
`All of my relatives, and those fun servants.`
`And......Maria onee-chan.`
`"It's me.`
` ...It's Ange.`
` ......I've...come back."`
`When I started my journey to expose the past of 12 years ago, my goal had been abstract, and I hadn't understood.`
`But now, ...I have no doubts.`
`This journey...was induced by several thoughts and fates over 12 years.`
`A journey to reach an end for me, Ushiromiya Ange.`
`And, a journey reach an end as the last witch of Mariage Sorcière.`
`I came here as the last daughter of the Ushiromiya family...`
`and as the last witch...`
`"...Dad, Mom, Onii-chan.`
` ...Sorry.`
` Let me greet Maria onee-chan first."`
`A strong tailwind urged me on.`
`That tailwind took just my soul out from inside my body...to the vast forest beneath me.`
`And, though from here on I couldn't see, I believed that it flew me to the mansion on that day, to where everyone was, ...to where Maria onee-chan was.`
`And so, `
`...even though my body was on the top of a hill, a strong wind blowing against me,`
` ...my soul was now certainly dancing through that sky...`
`The vast, vast sky of Rokkenjima.`
`...Below me was the green of many trees.`
`But...I understand.`
`I can comprehend the presences of my family and relatives...and all the servants.`
`......And...Maria onee-chan too.`
`I could even comprehend...Maria onee-chan as a witch.`
`It was vast, more so than any vast space I had imagined up until now.`
`"......Maria onee-chan,`
` can you hear me...?`
` Listen...!!"`
`Ange called to the Maria of that day.`
`She told her of the long journey she'd undergone.`
`Of her long-delayed realization of just how much she'd wounded Maria in her youth.`
`She understood magic...and now understood everything about the world Maria had wanted to show her.`
`It was very warm, overflowing with love and happiness.`
`...She wanted to become even happier by sharing that world, `
`but I trampled it.`
`"So now, I finally understand everything.`
` ......I understand magic...!`
` Our magic is surely very faint and fills the space beside us.`
` ...But it isn't something that anyone can see with their eyes.`
` ......Magic is...`
`...yes, I can say it clearly."`
`——Without love, it cannot be 'seen'.`
`Sorry, Onee-chan.`
`...I've already been excommunicated from the alliance of witches,`
` but now, I understand how wonderful it is.`
`And......I know that, after the day I wounded you, Mariage Sorcière...`
`was transfigured into something different from what you truly desired.`
`......Even the magic that spat anger by cursing people was probably important to Onee-chan in those days.`
`Onee-chan's environment was sad enough to permit that.`
`"But now,`
` ......those sad days...are over.`
`'!s1`
`...let's return Onee-chan's alliance of witches...`
`...back to the original Mariage Sorcière."`
`The grimoire was in my hands before I realized it.`
`...The strong winds were rapidly blowing its pages one after another...`
`That world had been kind in the beginning.`
`How could you give birth to magic that would make candy fall from the sky?`
`How could you give birth to magic that would make tomorrow's dinner creme croquette?`
`How could you give birth to magic that would make the weather good when you went out the next day, making your whole day fun?`
`New spells of happiness were created one after another, coloring her world with kindness...`
`Those days were flipped through one after another,`
` ......and months began to flash by...`
`The pages with drawings that had once been colorful...`
`gradually began to change into the color of black ink...`
`...Eerie magic circles and demon summonings.`
`Evil magic for harming people.`
`How could you give birth to magic that would cause the class bully to catch a cold?`
`How could you give birth to magic that would seriously injure someone in class so that they died?`
`How could you give birth to magic that would cause a bus loaded with all the bullies to fall off a cliff?`
`Malicious spells were created one after another, `
`...burying the pages and her heart...`
`"Because I hurt Onee-chan, `
`Mariage Sorcière ended up like this.`
` ......Onee-chan isn't a black, evil witch.`
` ...She was a white, ...pure, innocent, `
`...kind witch..."`
`"...I'll...return it to how it was.`
`I'll bring back the original Maria onee-chan, `
`...the one who scattered magic to make people happy across the entire world.`
` ...That's the reason I came here.`
` I was guided by fate.`
` ......Maria onee-chan, can you hear me...?`
` ......Show yourself before me......!!"`
`That voice rode an even stronger wind and was sent 12 years into the past...`
`'!s0`
`...the wind gradually ceased, `
`......and silence fell...`
`*crunch*, *crunch*.`
` ...I could hear the sound of gravel being stepped on.`
`I listened to those footsteps, surprised at this miracle.`
`...Without a doubt, those were Maria onee-chan's footsteps.`
`"......M-Maria onee-chan......"`
`"It's Kasumi.`
` ......Looks like I finally found you, eh, Ange-chan......?"`
`"............"`
`...Before I knew it, Aunt Kasumi and her black-suits, a total of seven people who didn't resemble Maria onee-chan in the slightest,`
` were standing there, surrounding me.`
`And it felt like my voice had been just about to reach Maria onee-chan, too...`
`...Because of these guys' toxin, ......that magic was cut off...`
`Ange clicked her tongue at that, but Kasumi probably didn't hear it that way.`
`"......Hmmmm.`
` Are those flowers for your deceased family?`
` ...How admirable.`
` You're going to throw them, right?`
` Go ahead, we'll wait that long."`
`...Just what are you waiting for...?`
`...But Ange could more or less guess.`
`The way the black-suits unnaturally stuck their hands into their pockets clearly brought to mind the likelihood that they had handguns.`
`......This is a deserted island.`
`There could be no more convenient place to dispose of someone.`
`I have absolutely no interest in the family matters of the Sumadera family.`
`...But if I die, all that wealth will go to them.`
`Unlike me, they're probably very interested and concerned about this matter.`
`Of course, it seems that if the massive amounts of stock I own suddenly go to them, it'll be pretty bad for the Ushiromiya Group as well,`
` and they're apparently having a secret feud, fighting over me all by themselves.`
`...That's probably why President Okonogi gave me Amakusa as a guard.`
`......Having Amakusa wait on the boat was a regrettable mistake...`
`"Aunt Kasumi, how long have you been waiting for this ambush...?"`
`"Since early morning.`
` Thanks to that, I'm completely tired of waiting.`
` After all, there are no cafes or dressing rooms here."`
`"No toilets either, so I guess you had to elegantly drop a load behind a tree.`
` ......ack-"`
`"A lady with half Sumadera blood flowing through her veins will not use such filthy words.`
` ......You really are Sumadera Kyrie's child.`
` Not a trace of grace."`
`She grabbed me by the hair and forced my face up to hers.`
` And then spat at me.`
`...My words might be filthy, but they're no worse than her spit.`
`"......Every time you talk to me, Aunt Kasumi, it's always about Mom.`
` ...Am I really that much like my mother?"`
`"Yes, you are.`
` ......That impertinent gaze.`
` Your mouth and nose are the same too.`
` ...Freewheeling and irresponsible.`
` ...You thought nothing of the long history and tradition of the Sumadera family...and selfishly flew out of the house.`
` Thanks to that, my entire life has been devoted to cleaning up your mess...!"`
`"I guess your life really has been covered with crap."`
`When I was slapped on the cheek, my ear was smashed, and for an instant, my head rang...`
`......My hair was pulled, spinning me around, and I fell to the ground.`
`And in a flash, the ground was kicked and I was struck with sand.`
`"Yes, you truly are like Nee-san.`
` That gaze!`
` That gaze like you're mocking me somehow.`
` Yes, I remember so many things!"`
`"......You're a sad person.`
` I'll bet that since you were young, you always got compared to Mom and scorned.`
` ...And for your entire life, you'll never be released from that wretchedness."`
`"A little girl like you couldn't possibly understand.`
` ...You see, your mother is a loser who threw everything away and ran away from the Sumadera family, right...?`
`'!s1`
`how much trouble I went through because of that loser?!!"`
`"Any trouble you went through has nothing to do with me.`
` Sorry, but what am I supposed to do about something that happened before I was born?`
` ......When will your life begin?`
` ...It never will.`
` For all eternity, you'll always, always continue to be sneered at by my dead mother until you die.`
` ...If only you'd just die.`
` Why are you living?"`
`"You little piss...!!`
` You all...!`
` Make her some tea."`
`"Heheheh...`
` Leave it to us..."`
`"You big-mouthed shitty brat.`
` Let us teach you a little lesson."`
`The black-suits dashed up to me, violently grabbed me by the nape of the neck, and dragged me down.`
`"Do whatever you want to her until my break is over.`
` Teach my cute niece her place."`
`Sumadera Kasumi.`
`When I think about it, she was a pitiable person.`
`To the outside world, women of the Sumadera family were trained to be in a position that supported and deferred to men.`
`...But in actuality, strong leadership was required from them, so that they could manage all the common people.`
`The role demanded of them really was that of a 'female commander', like a literal reading of the word 'okami' (女将).`
`Managing the Sumadera family with all its traditions was not something that could be accomplished with just an ordinary level of dignity.`
`It was an unimaginably heavy responsibility.`
`Normally, this would have been demanded of Kyrie.`
`Kyrie had undergone that harsh training.`
`And Kasumi, as the younger sister, should have been able to take it easy.`
`No, on the contrary, she had lived like a lazy, selfish and affluent princess, sneering at Kyrie, who had been given the heavy responsibility.`
`...However,`
` Kyrie had suddenly been disinherited.`
`She had refused the fiancé her parents had arranged...and had gotten pregnant by her lover, Ushiromiya Rudolf.`
`From the Sumaderas' perspective, even though the Ushiromiya family held a vast fortune, it was a low-level family that had already collapsed.`
`And to become not even a legal wife, but a mistress to the second son of that family...`
`Normally, a daughter of the main family would be shown no mercy for such dishonor.`
`They would wrap her up in a mat, place a pole on end, `
`and throw her either into the Pacific Ocean if the pole fell to the right or the Sea of Japan if it fell to the left.`
`......But Kyrie's punishment ended with disinheritance, an unbelievably warm-hearted decision.`
`After that, the Sumadera family began receiving favorable treatment from a section of the Ushiromiya group.`
` ...There must've been some kind of backroom deal.`
`In other words, Kyrie openly left the Sumadera family under the pretense of gaining financial support from the Ushiromiya family.`
`Kasumi had watched it happen in shock.`
`No, she even disparaged her dishonorable sister as a loser.`
`...But, eventually...`
`She realized that the heavy responsibilities Kyrie had borne would be passed on to her,`
` and then, for the first time, she saw that she'd been outwitted...`
`"Because of your mother, my life was ruined.`
` ...No, you could even say she killed me once.`
` On that day, I was killed once and thrown into a hellish life..."`
`"......Isn't that what you get for making light of life until then?`
` ...Gyack!`
` ......Gah...gah..."`
`"Don't you ever stop talking, girl?!`
` Hyaah!"`
`The black-suit punched me in the gut, and I doubled over.`
`But I was quickly grabbed by the nape of the neck and made to stand up again.`
`Kasumi cold-heartedly looked down at me, smoking a cigarette...`
`The painful days after Kyrie had left were floating through her mind.`
`Until then, she had been allowed to be a simple lady, freewheeling and naive.`
`...Only the older sister, Kyrie, had been harshly trained, and she, the younger sister, had been able to live as nothing more than a princess.`
`Then, suddenly, everything got flipped over...and her life came crashing down...`
`"My life, lifestyle, and the way I lived...were all stolen from me.`
` ......Do you know how much I was derided by those relatives who didn't know the details, all because of my sister's dishonor...?`
` I detested her.`
` I detested your mother enough to make me spit blood..."`
`"Glad to hear it.`
` Keep up the good work.`
` ......Graggghh!!"`
`A kick landed in Ange's side as she crawled on the ground.`
`Ange didn't stand up again.`
`...So, she continued to lie there like a caterpillar as she was kicked each time she spoke up.`
`"...I saw Nee-san at an Ushiromiya Group party once.`
`'!s1`
`......looking very happy......`
`and laughing.`
` ...She...`
`pushed everything onto me...`
`and found happiness...`
`...only for herself......"`
`"......So what?`
` How is taking it out on me going to make you happy?`
` Will taking it out on me turn back time and change history or something?`
`'!s1`
`......gah, `
`......ghackk...!!"`
`"You said something a short while ago...`
` When will my life start?`
` ......No matter how much I despise you or take out my frustrations on you, I can't turn back time.`
` ...So, must I keep hating my sister even though she's gone, until I die?"`
`"You've got to be kidding me.`
` ...How long will I have to be tormented by my sister's ghost?`
` So I thought of something.`
` ......If I could accomplish one thing, I'd be able to forget all of my hatred and start over."`
`Ange was about to lash back out at her, but stopped.`
`...Because she'd be kicked again if she responded.`
`...Even if Kasumi didn't say any more, Ange had a pretty good idea what she meant.`
`Kasumi thought that by taking revenge against Kyrie's daughter, Ange, she'd be able to put an end to her hatred.`
`......Talk about pushing your problems onto other people.`
`"Come on, stand up.`
` If you like this island that much, I'll bury you deep in it.`
` ......You don't want to die at your age, right?`
` Don't you feel like saying 'Sorry my mother caused you so much trouble', or something?"`
`'!s1`
`say something like that?`
` ......Gwah, `
`......ghhh...!!"`
`『Uryu-!!`
` Ange, Angeeeeee...!!』`
`"Ange-sama, no...!`
` You mustn't provoke them...!!`
` You should at least make it seem like you're going along with them, so you can buy some time...!"`
`'!s1`
`you should throw your foolish pride...`
`out with the garbage..."`
`『Oh, what about Amakusa-san...?!`
` If Amakusa-san comes, I'm sure...!』`
`"...It's no use, I can't see him...`
` ...You idiot, Ange-sama...!`
` Why did you leave Amakusa behind...?!"`
`I didn't need Mammon to tell me.`
`...I was seriously regretting it already.`
`I walked a long way.`
` The forest was very thick.`
`...I've got no doubts that signs of activity here won't reach the boat...`
`During the time it took for Kasumi to finish casually smoking a whole cigarette, `
`I was continuously tormented by the black-suits, as she had told them to.`
`The moment I grabbed at my head, my scalp was kicked by someone at a bad angle, and my head was filled with stars...`
` The feeling of stars flickering in this gray, twisted world...`
`was one I remembered clearly.`
`My life was very similar to the one Sumadera Kasumi led.`
`...After all, as the Successor to the Ushiromiya family, I was tormented constantly with various kinds of bullying...under the guise of education and training.`
`Yes.`
` Having the inside of my head filled with stars like this...is a feeling I know well.`
`When being reprimanded for some error in manners I seemed to have made,`
` the discussion always turned to whether I was fitting to be the Successor or not.`
`...On and on about the honor of the Ushiromiya family, and how deep that was.`
`...By the time the conversation reached that point,`
` I'd forget what mistake I was being blamed for in the first place.`
`No, in fact, it was the same for Aunt Eva.`
`After all, sometimes she'd ask herself "Umm, what was it again?"`
`...But in the end, she wouldn't be able to remember, and would say something like...`
`"If I'm angry, it must be your fault, Ange.`
` The fact that you're at fault is what matters, so who cares if I can't remember what it was you did."`
`...There'd be some ridiculous reasoning like that, and then she'd keep on punishing me.`
`Yes.`
` Aunt Eva's punishment wasn't something that would continue until I learned something, or acknowledged my mistake, or apologized.`
`......It would continue until Aunt Eva wanted to stop.`
`So this violence was a bit nostalgic, in a way that made me want to vomit.`
`...I opened my eyes...and look, there's Aunt Eva.`
`Right next to Kasumi, who's smoking a cigarette,`
` I can see Aunt Eva, almost as though the two of them are laughing together.`
`When I think about it, even Aunt Eva's life might be a thing worthy of my sympathy.`
`...The responsibility and pressure of being a member of the Ushiromiya family, which she often mentioned to me,`
` had probably caused her great pain.`
`After all, people can't make insults that they've never been the targets of themselves...`
`It was probably the same for Aunt Rosa as well.`
`...As the youngest child of the honorable Ushiromiya family, she must've gone through many tough times.`
`So, it was just like what Aunt Eva did to me...`
`Just like what Sumadera Kasumi is doing now...`
`...Aunt Rosa...must have been the same.`
`People tend to push the pain they're burdened with onto other people.`
`Otherwise, they can never escape from that pain.`
`...So on and on, in eternity and perpetuity, the chain of pain and sadness does not end.`
`'!s0`
`...Maria onee-chan's magic was...`
`so incredible.`
`With her magic, ...she didn't have to bear the pain caused by Aunt Rosa.`
`The pain probably was pushed onto her.`
`Its weight probably tormented her.`
`...But Onee-chan didn't carry that burden on her own shoulders.`
`......She purified it...and filled her world with happiness.`
`So I'm sure...`
`...If Maria onee-chan had had children in the future...`
`She probably wouldn't have pushed the pain that had been forced on her onto her children.`
`...That chain of pain and sadness that stretched back for who knows how long, `
`which she couldn't understand and which she had inherited, which had been forced onto her...`
` ......Maria onee-chan cut it with her magic.`
`"......Whaaat's wrong?`
` Got a bone to pick with me?"`
`"............"`
`In the past, I would have snapped back.`
`...I would've met her hatred with hatred, so that they'd cancel each other out.`
`...No, nothing got cancelled out.`
`The thing being forced on me ended up right there on my shoulders.`
`Just like how even now, ...I hate her.`
`So, now that I...`
`...know of magic,`
` ...I'll look at the human called Ushiromiya Eva again.`
`......What I could see through to...`
`...was a sad human form, no different from me, who had lost her family and who bore deep wounds in her heart.`
`Unable to withstand the pain of that torn heart,`
` she was doing nothing more than howl sadly, like a lion crying in pain, ...like a child.`
`...Even Ushiromiya Eva was someone I should have felt compassion for.`
`She needed someone to understand the difficulties and pain of her childhood years.`
` ......Even she, who was the only survivor of the Rokkenjima crime,`
` who was faced with the curiosity of all of society, who was publicly slandered and forced to have salt continually flung into the wound,`
` had needed someone's compassion.`
`In order to let Eva forget her pain and sadness at least a little,`
` ......the black witch...taught her magic, just like the times it had possessed Aunt Rosa.`
`It was the same magic of anger and sadness...`
`that Beatrice had taught Maria onee-chan when she was mourning for her torn-apart friend, Sakutarou.`
`...That same magic...that witch...had probably dwelled inside Aunt Rosa too.`
`......So I mustn't hate Ushiromiya Eva.`
`...Maybe...`
`...I should've become her ally,`
` as the only person in the world who could understand her.`
`...What did I say to her when I was young, when she returned alive all alone...?`
`Could it be...`
`...that I acted...`
`...as though she'd killed my family and returned on her own...?`
`............`
`...I can't believe it.`
`...Aunt Eva, who has never been more than a object of and a synonym for hatred throughout my life,`
` ......is turning into...a 'human' I can understand...`
`So,`
` ......I can see, right next to Aunt Eva, ...the form of the black witch, who taught her the black magic...`
`Aunt Eva...was crying.`
`It was only natural.`
`......Not only was no one willing to understand the pain of losing her husband and son at once,`
` ...but her only relative had insulted her, ...saying 'Give me back my Dad and Mom'.`
`......I can make the excuse that I was merciless because of my youth.`
`...However, ...to her at the time,`
` it had probably been cruel enough to sever the last thread in her heart.`
`.........In the following days, the talk shows and magazines publicly slandered her.`
`The truth of her husband's business and character...and even her beloved son were negated.`
`She no longer had anything left.`
`She could do nothing but cry and howl, ...trying to forget the pain and sadness at least for a while.`
`After all, she could only feel a tiny bit of release, and only during the time that she howled.`
`And so, ......the black witch taught her how to howl.`
`The one I hated...was the black witch.`
`Black magic can probably release one from that pain for an instant.`
`...However,`
` it never lifts that weight from a person's shoulders.`
`On the contrary, it forces that weight onto further victims,`
` ......filling the world with hatred.`
`......If only Aunt Eva knew of white magic...and had a true witch nearby...`
`...Shouldn't that...`
`...have been...`
`...me......?`
`Didn't I learn the magic to create happiness from Maria onee-chan?`
`......If I'd taught her...with that magic,`
` ......could we have...`
`...built a future with a completely different relationship?`
`Up until now, `
`......I've hated Aunt Eva constantly.`
`...So I didn't notice the black witch beside her.`
`...Without love, it could not be 'seen'.`
`I didn't...`
`...have any love for her...`
`So now, finally...`
`......I'll glare at the black witch, `
`...the one I truly should hate.`
`"...Oh.`
` ......Whaat's this?`
` You can 'see' me?`
` Hehheheheheh...!"`
`".........I 'see' you.`
` ...The one I should've hated wasn't Aunt Eva.`
` ...It's you."`
`"Whoa, awesome.`
` To think that a lowly Human could 'see' a witch like me.`
` ...So?`
` Are you trying to say something with that glare?`
` Do you hate me?"`
`"......Hate?`
` ...Yes, I do.`
` ...But...that's not quite it.`
` ...I just think you're sad."`
`"Sad?`
` ...*giggle*giggle* Ahhahahahahaha!`
` What're you saying?! Come on, go ahead!`
` Why not hate me as much as you waant?!"`
`"...I won't hate.`
` Hating you...`
`...means I'm doing nothing more than inheriting Aunt Eva's hatred.`
` ...I'll put a stop to hatred.`
` ...I'll accept Aunt Eva's pain, ......purify it, and throw it away."`
`"Ahhahahahahahahaha!!`
` What kind of epiphany do you think you've had?`
` Is your head all right?`
` Seriously, if only you'd just give up and diie!`
` Kyaahhahhahahahahahaha!`
` You guys, kick her more and more, okay?`
` Not her face, though.`
` 'Cause it'd be boring if her pitiful face got any better!"`
`'!s0`
` ......Gwah!!`
` ......Nngg..."`
`The black-suits persistently kicked my stomach and back.`
`...As though they had been ordered to by the black witch.`
`"...My, my, are you still not suffering after all that...?`
` ......You keep staring right at me.`
` Do you hate me?`
` I'll bet you do.`
` Same here.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*..."`
`Kasumi sneered at me.`
`...But for some reason, I had the feeling that she was crying behind that expression.`
`Just like me, the pain of being forced into an unreasonable life would never, ever heal.`
`...The sad lion gasping in pain from the thorn he can't get out continues to howl...`
`"Hey, Sumadera Kasumi, take a look.`
` Over there, it's you as you used to be.`
` ...Don't you feel better now?`
` You used to be standing there, but now you're on this side, right?`
` Heheheh, isn't it great?`
` Don't you like having the roles switched?!"`
`'!s1`
`...great......`
` Ahhahahahaha, how can you make that kind of face, Ange...?!`
` Go on and cry, you want to, right?!"`
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha!!`
` Yes, yes, of course she wants to cry!`
` Make her cry.`
` Didn't someone make you cry back then?`
` So make her cry too.`
` *giggle* You too, Ange.`
` If only you'd just break down and cry!`
` Kyaaahhahhahhahhahha!!"`
`"...Aha, ...ahahahahahahaha!!`
` Cry, Angee!`
` I want to see your crying face!`
` Cry, and try saying 'I'm sorry, Aunt Kasumi'...!!"`
`"Yes, make her say those words.`
` ...Aren't those words painful?`
` Isn't being made to apologize for something that isn't your fault...just the worst pain...?`
` Make her feel the same way...`
` By doing that, you can relieve your pain.`
` ...Hehheheheh, yeah, that's it.`
` Be a little more honest with yourself, okay?`
` If only you'd just let your emotions run free more, and more, and mooooooooooore!"`
`...The black witch provoked Kasumi.`
`And Kasumi began to give herself over to that dark emotion.`
`...By turning deep sadness into an evil alcohol and forcing it down, trying to forget it for just an instant, `
`nothing would change.`
`'!s0`
`...were themselves...`
`sad.`
`And, I couldn't forgive the black witch who had imposed that sadness on Kasumi......`
`......I had gone limp, which seemed to have stopped the black-suits' kicking competition.`
`...Or maybe the kickers were getting tired too.`
`Kasumi didn't order them to stop, but at some point, they did.`
`However, I was reflected in Kasumi's eyes, and they burned me with flames of hatred.`
`...She had been tempted by the witch to do that in order to relieve her own pain.`
`"......Sumadera Kasumi,`
` you aren't done yet.`
` You've got much more trampling to do, right?`
` Can you forgive what happened to your entire life with just a little violence?"`
`"...I can't.`
` ...I still can't forgive her with just this."`
`"Right?`
` There's no way you can forgive her!`
` Do it more!`
` More of the flames of hatred!`
` Nothing can warm you except the fires of hate.`
` After being frozen in the snow fields of anger and sadness, the only flame that can warm you is hatred...!!`
` Say it, okay?`
` Scream it!!`
` If only you'd just burn yourself to ashes with a roar of haaaaaaaaaate!"`
`"...U-Ushiromiya Angeeeeeeeee!!`
` I cannot live...without hating you!!`
` Hehhehehehahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"Sumadera Kasumi, look at that bundle of flowers.`
` ......These flowers are for your dead family, right, Ange?"`
`The black witch grinned at me unpleasantly, using her chin to signal Kasumi to pick it up.`
`Kasumi picked up the flowers I was going to offer,`
` ......brought them all the way over to me, dropped them, and made a show of trampling them...`
`Her expression was filled with hatred...and a frantic quality that couldn't be explained with hatred alone.`
`...She trampled them over and over again as though her sadness was reaching the bursting point.`
`So the sound of her trampling it was just sad.`
`"......Oh, still not suffering yet?`
` Then what about this?`
` Sumadera Kasumi!`
` Use this."`
`"...N-No, `
`...not that......"`
`The object the black witch pointed at......was Maria onee-chan's grimoire.`
`Kasumi also noticed it...and picked up that book, which was heavier than it looked...`
`"Whaat's this?"`
`"*giggle*`
` ...Why not read it?`
` Eheheh, you might fall over laughing, okay?"`
`Kasumi opened the grimoire,`
` ...skimmed over the contents, and snorted derisively.`
`"Give it back...`
` ...That's...Onee-chan's......"`
`Of course, my hand couldn't reach.`
`...My stomach was once again kicked by the black-suits, and I doubled over...`
`"See?`
` This book's really important to Ange, right?`
` Gotta belittle the things that are important to her, okay?`
` That'll work better than punching or kicking for a girl like her.`
` ...You know that better than anyone, don't you...?"`
`As though remembering something painful, Kasumi's face twisted for an instant.`
`...But that quickly disappeared, changing into a scornful smile directed at me.`
`"*giggle*giggle*`
` Whew, what a creepy book.`
` ...Did you write this......?"`
`"...Stop it, ...give it back......"`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*!!`
` Look at that face...!`
` Belittle it more, belittle it more...!`
` Teach her the pain of having your dignity trampled, that's the only way to soften your own pain...!"`
`"Heh, heheheheh, what's with this embarrassing book...?`
` ......I'll admit I did have a little interest in fortune telling as a girl."`
`"But isn't this going a bit too far?`
` Magic? Ew.`
` ...You're one of those, aren't you?`
` It's like in those cartoons, where a girl says that something-somethiiiing spell and transforms into a witch, right?`
` You like those, don't you?`
` ......How pathetic.`
` *giggle*giggle*."`
`Cackling, Kasumi opened to a random page and showed it to the black-suits.`
`The black-suits looked too and guffawed.`
`That sneer didn't wound me.`
`...But I couldn't forgive it.`
`...After all, that sneer was ridiculing Maria onee-chan.`
`I don't hate Kasumi.`
`...But for forcing that unhealing anger and sadness on Kasumi, ...I cannot forgive the black witch...`
`That black witch ate into Aunt Eva, Sumadera Kasumi, and Aunt Rosa,`
` ...tormenting them for an eternity without letting their wounds be healed.`
`......I can't forgive her...`
`...I can't forgive......the black witch...`
`"Wow, this is just great...!`
` ...Magic for making candy fall from the sky, ...you say?!!`
` Ahhahahahaha...!`
` What's this?`
` Sprinkle water cleansed by the sun with sugar...?`
` Stick the magic staff in, and then an incantation, ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ahhahahahahahahahaha!!`
` What the hell?!`
` Ahhahahahahahahaha...!!`
` It huuuuuuuurts!!"`
`The black-suits were also rolling around, guffawing.`
`Then, grinning, the black witch whispered something into Kasumi's ear.`
`...After glaring at me with a grin, ...Kasumi took that page-`
`"...Ah..."`
`Kasumi grabbed hold of that page, tore it off, crumpled it up, ...and threw it away...`
`『...S-So cruel. ...That was...Maria's magic......』`
`"Oh, really?`
` Heheh, how sad."`
`...It was one of the spells to summon happiness...`
`that Maria had made with Sakutarou.`
`Anyone knows that making sugar water, coloring it, and leaving it by the window...`
`isn't going to make candy fall from the sky.`
`But after repeating that every day, ...one time on her way home from school...`
`She had found several pieces of candy scattered around...`
`......How happy must that miracle have made Maria onee-chan?`
`...Didn't she treasure that candy, eating it during her night alone with Sakutarou to distract herself from her loneliness?`
`'!s0`
`...had been torn and thrown away...`
`and had disappeared...`
`The whole miracle of happiness that magic had given birth to...`
`had been torn and thrown away...`
`"Oh, this part's great too...!`
` Magic to make tonight's dinner cream croquette?`
` Ahhahahahahaha!!`
` ...What's next?`
` Magic to make bell peppers taste good?`
` Heh, that's not bad either, so stupid!`
` Ahhahhahhahha...!!"`
`"Tear that too.`
` Eheheh!!`
` If only you'd just tear it more and moooooooore!!"`
`With a brutal, loud laugh, `
`...the black witch made Maria onee-chan's spells get torn out one after another...`
`'!s0`
`...torn, `
`...and thrown away...`
`"Stop it, ...stop it...!!`
` Don't...defile Lady MARIA's magic...!!`
` Don't defile it...with your filthy toxin...!!"`
`Mammon cried and yelled, ...but she had no way of reaching Kasumi.`
`"Come on, why not defile it?!`
` Miracles of magic?`
` Magic to bring happiness?`
` No way, nothing like that exists!`
` Don't you know that you can't heal pain and sadness without pushing it onto someone else?`
` ...Hey, you also had those magic friend things, right?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Sumadera Kasumi, open to that page."`
`"What's this?`
` Magic friends?`
` ......The Seven Sisters of Purgatory?`
` Aha, what a creepy name!`
` *giggle* It says they can fly at awesome speeds and finish off the enemy.`
` Ahhaha, Ange, if you can use this kind of magic, shouldn't you use it right now?`
` ......Ahhahahahaha.`
` Foolish!"`
`The page that wrote of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory was also heartlessly torn away.`
`...The page itself was just paper.`
`It wasn't Mammon's vessel or anything.`
`But the tearing, denying toxin burned Mammon from the inside...`
`Mammon's face twisted from that heat and pain...`
`"......Gah, .........ack, ......"`
`『Are you okay, Mammon?!`
` Hold on...!!』`
`"...This much is...no problem...`
` ...It's not me, ...but Ange-sama......who's in pain......"`
`However, Mammon's expression was twisted with unbearable anguish and humiliation...`
`『Stop it, black witch...!!`
` Why are you doing something like this?!`
` Why...can't you use magic for happiness?!!』`
`"...Oh, you're a magic friend too, right?`
` *giggle* I'll defile you too.`
` Sumadera Kasumi, look for this guy's page too, okay?"`
`"What's this one?`
` What's with this crappy scribble of a lion?`
` ...Sakutarou?`
` What a weird name!`
` My best friend, it says.`
` Really?`
` This is your friend? A close friend?`
` This lion is? Is it, is it?"`
`"Ahhahahahahahaha!!`
` It really is a crappy scribble.`
` This ugly lion is totally you."`
`"To think she had something like this as a friend... That Ushiromiya Maria kid's mind is so pathetic it's embarassing, what a joooke.`
` ......She's like, a moron.`
` If only she'd just give up...and diiiiiiiieee...!"`
`『U...ryu...`
` ......Don't make fun...of Maria...』`
`".........St...op...it......`
` ...Don't break it......"`
`""No waay.""`
`There was a shrill sound.`
` ......The page had been filthily ripped out...`
`'!s0`
`that Onee-chan had drawn...`
`was violently ripped in half......`
`"What a crappy pictuuuure.`
` Kyahhahahahahahahahahahaha...!"`
`"You all laugh too, okay?`
` Ahhahahahahahahaha...!"`
`A pair of the black-suits laughed vulgarly...`
`and heartlessly trampled the two halves that had been torn and thrown away...`
`『Uuuuuuuuuuuu, ...hic!`
` ...Uuuuuuuuuuu...』`
`"...Sakutaro, ...hang in there......"`
`『I'm...not sad...`
` ...I just...can't stand it...`
` ...I can't stand that...`
`...Maria's being made fun of, `
`and I can't do anything about it...』`
`".........`
`...To Humans who can't 'see' us, ......it's as though we don't exist...`
` ...We can only interact with Humans that need us.`
` ......That's why......we're furniture......"`
`As Sakutarou and Mammon...supported each other,`
` ...they crouched down, ...sobbing...`
`I couldn't stand it either...`
`...Those who can't 'see' how wonderful the world of magic is...can't understand it.`
`You can't explain to humans who can't understand.`
`So it gets belittled.`
`......If you could show them it...`
`...But you can't...`
`Because, in front of Humans who are filled with the magic-resisting toxin and who can't understand magic,`
` magic cannot be used...`
`"I really don't get it.`
` From this delusional diary, I've got to assume that something's wrong with your head.`
` ...It really is fun to take a peek into your mind.`
` You creepy child."`
`"Both you and Maria.`
` ...And that stuffed animal and the furniture over there too, right?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` Ahhahahahahahahahahaha!"`
`"Aah, I could laugh.`
` You don't have any friends, do you?`
` You're aaalways all alone, so stuffed animals are your friends?`
` What a pitiable child.`
` Heheheheheheheheh...!`
` Don't worry, I understand.`
` I know what it's like to live that way.`
` ......So I'll accept it.`
` You really are a pitiable child, right?`
` Ehhehehhahahahahahahaha!"`
`......To you, it probably would look...`
`...like something made by a pitiful child.`
`That's right.`
`If a hundred people were to read Onee-chan's diary, a hundred people would probably think the same thing.`
`...I used to be like that too.`
`'!s0`
`......despite all of that, `
`...Maria onee-chan...`
`...summoned a world of happiness.`
`......Don't deny...`
`...that magic, ...that happiness...`
`"Such a stubborn child, you are.`
` ...Very well.`
` This is the last one.`
` I'll tear apart the source of the truly foolish magic that you and Maria believed in.`
` Sumadera Kasumi, read this page, okay?"`
`"Hmmm, what's this colorful page...?`
` ...What's this?`
` ......Magic to...`
`...always be friends with my beloved mother...?"`
`『St-Stop iiiiiiiiiiit!!`
` Not that page...!!』`
`"Aha.`
` This magic's really simple, isn't it?`
` It looks like even I could do it.`
` ......Even I could remember an incantation this short.`
` Shall I give it a whirl?"`
`"*giggle*giggle* It really is a short incantation, isn't it?`
` Okay, give it a try, let's have everyone spit it out!"`
`With expressions that ridiculed it from the bottom of their hearts, the black witch and Kasumi...tapered their mouths.`
` ......And they said it aloud...`
`"Uu-uu-."`
`The black-suits stared blankly, asking what the hell that was supposed to be.`
`Then Kasumi answered, cackling.`
`"This is supposed to be an incantation.`
` Are you kidding me...?!`
` Ahhahahahahahaha...!!!"`
`"Come on, why don't you guys try it too?`
` Uu-uu-uu-."`
`The black-suits imitated that moaning voice, making fun of it...`
`————'Uu-uu-.'`
`That was the incantation...for the magic that would let her always be friends with her beloved mother.`
`"What the hell, how stupid...!!`
` If you could make family relationships better just by saying uu-uu-, the world would always be peaceful.`
` Ahahahahaha!!"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!`
` A stupid moaning voice!`
` Too bad that if you do this over and over again, people'll think you're a pathetic, stupid kid!`
` Are you a moron?!`
` Wahhahahahahaha, waaahahahahahahha!!"`
`『Stop iiiit... At least don't belittle...that magiiiiiiiic...』`
`......It was the day of a picnic, when Maria onee-chan and Aunt Rosa were alone...`
`It was written that this was one of the top five happiest days of her life.`
`Onee-chan was singing a song she'd just learned from her Mama.`
`...Her mother had been delighted.`
`But partway through, Maria forgot the lyrics.`
`But, since she saw that her mother was so happy, she tried to sing until the very end.`
`With 'uu-uu-uu-'.`
`...Even though she'd only pretended to know the lyrics, her mother had enjoyed it a lot...`
`After that, 'uu-' remained as an incantation to remember that day she'd spent in fun and happiness with her mother.`
`Of course, even though she seemed to find it funny at first, Aunt Rosa eventually tired of hearing it,`
` and eventually started scolding Onee-chan when she said it,`
` ...but to Onee-chan, it was a memory of a fun day that she'd never forget...`
`So among the spells that Maria had created, it was the oldest and the first...`
`Kasumi stuck her fingernails into that page too...`
`"...Stop it, `
`......don't tear it...`
` At least spare...`
`...that page......"`
`"Hahahahahahahahaha!`
` No waay!!"`
`'!s0`
`was...`
`erased.`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!`
` Aaaahhahhahhahhahha, aaaaahahahhahahah!!`
` Is this your magic of happiness?`
` Hilarious, hilarious...!!"`
`"There's no way there could be magic to make you happy, right?!`
` Magic is made out of anger and hatred, right?"`
`"Happiness is what you call the feeling of release you get only when you've pushed all the hatred you bear onto other people.`
` The happiness you all are talking about is a phantom that doesn't show up outside picture books!!"`
`As Kasumi laughed her head off, she slammed the grimoire against the ground and stepped on it.`
`"Can't stand it?`
` Hey, you can't stand it, right?!`
` You white witches of happiness?`
` If you can't stand it that much, why don't you show us?!`
` Show us your magic!!`
` If it exists, then you just have to show us, riiiiight?`
` ......A witch who can't use magic isn't a witch!!`
` That's why we're the real witches.`
` You're just brats trying to escape reality with a dream!!"`
`'!s1`
`...if I can show you magic, `
`...will you...`
`believe in Onee-chan's magic......?`
`"Huh?`
` Kyahhahahaha, yeah, sure!!`
` I'll believe!`
` If you can use magic and show me, that is!!`
` Let's see it, you stupid braaaaaaaaaaaat!!"`
`............`
`......`
`Silently, slowly,`
` ...I stood up.`
`...Sensations of this cramped world, such as the pain in my body, felt truly trifling...`
`"Oh, looks like you've still got enough energy to stand up, Miss Great Witch.`
` *giggle*giggle*!"`
`"Now that you've stood up, what are you going to show us?`
` Show us some magiic...!"`
`"......Magic...exists."`
`"Whaat?`
` What's this kid saying...?!`
` Did you guys hear that?!"`
`"Silence!!!`
` ......Heh, isn't that interesting.`
` ...You people always refuse to show this power of miracles because of the magic-resisting toxin.`
` ......Disciple of the white witch, MARIA,`
` let's see some magic...!!"`
`"........."`
`"...Do you have any clue how many humans have believed in that miracle before being betrayed?`
` ......*giggle*`
` Everyone believes!`
` Everyone is betrayed and despairs!`
` And they learn that true magic can only be gained by the power of black witches, like me...!!"`
`"......Hitting someone with your hatred is nothing more than a sin.`
` That isn't magic.`
` ......I'll show you real magic."`
`"......Y-You........."`
`The black witch winced slightly.`
`However, Kasumi sneered at me even more.`
`"Then let's have a look.`
` So, what kind of magic will you show us?`
` Magic to make candy fall from the sky?`
` Or else magic to make cookies multiply?`
` ......Whaaat?!"`
`The instant I opened my eyes, a tremendous wind arose.`
`"...Wh-What is this, all of a sudden......?!"`
`"Come, arise, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory."`
`"......Whaaat...?"`
`There was a flash behind me, and in an instant, seven pieces of high-level furniture were gathered there.`
`It was a power that far surpassed the magical strength I'd had in my prime.`
`It was a power that matched even Maria onee-chan and Beatrice.`
`"The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here...!!"`
`"...A-Ange-sama...!"`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, enj_4e1677:`
`...I couldn't use you or your sisters.`
` ...This isn't some cheap emotion, like wanting to get back at my bullying classmates."`
`"...In order to protect Maria onee-chan's......Mariage Sorcière's world, `
`...I now order you to show me the miracle of magic."`
`"I-It's impossible...`
` No matter what you try, before such a mass of toxin......"`
`The Seven Sisters also remembered what had happened in that classroom.`
`...If they could have obeyed Ange's order, they would have.`
`...However, ...surrounded by the toxin that runs thick in Humans, they hadn't been able to display the miracle of magic.`
`...And they remembered very well how deeply that had hurt Ange...`
`But Ange spoke very quietly.`
`"In that case,`
` you all believe too."`
`"...Huh?"`
`"......Mariage Sorcière was created to bring people happiness.`
` ...And also to fight the black witch."`
`"In order to show that miracle to the foolish black witch, `
`...who denies the world that one of the founders, the Witch of Origins Lady Maria, gave birth to, `
`...and in order to protect that world, `
`......believe.`
` In magic.`
` In witches.`
` In miracles, right now...!"`
`When Kasumi gave an order to the black-suits, one of them took out a gun and pointed it at Ange.`
`"You'll show us magic, right?`
` Then let's have it.`
` Use magic to shoot this man down with a fireball or lightning or something.`
` You get one chance.`
` ......Show us before I count to three, got it?`
` If you can't, then you'd best prepare yourself, okay?`
` Ehheheheheh!"`
`"............`
`.........Shoot."`
`"What's with this kid?`
` Hehheheh, she's lost it."`
`The black-suit pointing the gun laughed at Ange's detached attitude.`
`"Ahhahahahahaha!!`
` Are you serious?!`
` This girl's lost her mind!`
` In that case, get yourself shot! If only you'd just diiiiiiiiiiiiie!"`
`『Ange...!!`
` ...I-It's impossible!`
` You can't block bullets with magic...!!』`
`"No.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of.`
` ......Compared to my magic, to the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, bullets are nothing."`
`"A-Ange-sama......"`
`Mammon was perplexed by Ange's absolute trust.`
`...If she could comply, she would have.`
` On that day as well.`
`But, ...because she had been unable to do anything, she had hurt Ange......`
`"Hehheheh, you brat.`
` If you can use magic, let us have a look right now."`
`"What's wrong?`
` We're tellin' you to show us magic, right?!!"`
`"Come on, no need to hold back, okay?`
` *booom*!`
` Show me some magic!!`
` Hihhehhehheh!"`
`The black-suits jeered at her.`
`But Ange simply concentrated her mind in silence...`
`"If only you'd just shoot!`
` She's even telling you to try and shoot, you guys!"`
`"...This kid's already lost her mind from fear.`
` Bye-bye, Ange-chan.`
` ...Go and pretend to be a witch as much as you want in heaven.`
` ...Fire."`
`"Heheh, you sure?"`
`"Fire!`
` Die, Ange!!"`
`"If you can do it, then give this magic of yours a try!!!"`
`The black-suit cocked the gun, and sneering...pulled the trigger.`
`"............"`
`The sound of gunfire rang out, `
`...and the world...stopped.`
`A red spray scattered out...`
`...and chunks of flesh flew.`
`"...Huh, ......ah..."`
`"What are you doing, Mammon?`
` ...Don't tell me you'd let a boorish pebble of a bullet like this reach Ange-sama."`
`Lucifer lined up the bullet perfectly, and with a single swing, ...sliced it...`
`And, ...in the chest of the black-suit who had apparently fired the gun, ...was a hole as big as a fist...`
`"......Every now and then,`
` I get to go first."`
`Half of Leviathan's body was covered with blood, and a cold smile was on her face.`
`...Then, slowly, ......the pitiful prey that she had brought down...fell over.`
`"...Y-You pierced...a Human...!!!"`
`"Idiot!`
` Do you still not believe?!`
` In our master's magic power...?!!"`
`"Are...you...kidding me......?!?!`
` Y-You materialized...in front of this many Humans?!?!"`
`"...Wh-What is this? ...What?!"`
`Kasumi and the rest were flustered...`
`He certainly seemed to have fired his gun...`
`'!s0`
`...it hadn't hit Ange, `
`......and why...`
`...was the person who fired...`
`hurt instead...?!`
`"...This is...magic.`
` ...Great job, Leviathan."`
`"I'm most honored...!!`
` You foolish Humans who dare oppose our master!`
` Now is the time of judgement! Prostrate yourselves!!"`
`"Wh-Why...?!!!`
` You shouldn't be able to bring magic into the world of Humans...!!`
` They shouldn't be able to 'see' magic, and they shouldn't be able to be touched by magic!!`
` ...Why?!!"`
`"......Because this...is true magic."`
`"...Gah, ...aaaaaaaaaaarrrggggg...!!"`
`"Wh-What are you people doing?!`
` K-Kill, kill!!!"`
`'!s1`
`"Like I'd allow you the disrespect of pointing a gun barrel at our master...!`
` Die."`
`Those words were a requiem.`
`...The man's chest had already been pierced by Lucifer, who had become the Stake of Pride in an instant.`
`*thump*!`
`With the sound of the second person falling, the black-suits now realized for certain that their lives were in peril...!!`
`"W-Waaaaaaaah, s-s-save me...!!!"`
`The instant one of the black suits doubled over in shock...and turned on his heels to escape from that place,`
` ...the Stake of Sloth...`
`"......Be thankful that your violence against our master will be repaid with this alone.`
` Die!!"`
`In his right eye, a hole as big as a walnut opened, and his head split.`
`Belphegor was sprayed with blood, and her face twisted demonically with the joy at being able to use her full power...!`
`"Ooh, waaaaaaahhh?!`
` Who's that?!`
` Who's there?!`
` Where are you?!"`
`The black-suits were flustered, pointing their guns in every direction.`
`But they didn't understand what was happening.`
`They knew that something terrifying was coming for them from somewhere,`
` but they didn't know where...!!`
`"Dumbass!`
` Th-The enemy is right before your eyes!`
` The witch's furniture is after you!!!"`
`But they couldn't 'see'...!!`
`Because they didn't believe in magic, they could not 'see'...!!`
`Just as the black witch said, Satan was standing boldly right in front of a black-suit.`
`However, the black-suit couldn't 'see' her at all...!`
`"*giggle*...!`
` Did you think Humans could see our forms?`
` That they could follow us?`
` Ahhahahahahahaha, stupid Humans!!`
` Time to pay a fool's price for forgetting your awe of magic!!"`
`"Eee, eeeeeeeeeeeekk!!!`
` What is this?!`
` What's going on?!"`
`"......You can't 'see' it.`
` Because you have no love."`
`"...Impossible!!`
` Even though there are so many Humans here, even though the magic-resisting toxin is everywhere, ...why can you manifest your magic?!`
` Who...are you?!?!"`
`"......A witch.`
` And unlike you, a real one."`
`"Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaat, damn iiiiiiit, you biiiiiiiitch!!"`
`As though announcing his candidacy for becoming the fourth victim, one of the black-suits pointed his gun at Ange.`
`...And the trigger was...`
`Ange glared at him coldly...and simply ordered.`
`"D-Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Next one.`
` Satan."`
`"Satan of Wrath, already right here!!`
` Blockhead!!`
` You think a simple bullet could hit Ange-sama or us now?!!!"`
`The Stake of Anger...pierced and smashed the bullet fired by the black-suit...`
`and continued straight on, towards the man's face-`
`"......Know your foolishness...and regret in hell!!`
` Die!!"`
`With a terrible explosive sound, the upper half of the man's head was smashed.`
`Bathed in scattered flesh and blood, Ange quietly asked one more question.`
`"...Hey, Aunt Kasumi.`
` ......Do you still...`
`not feel like believing in magic?"`
`'!s1`
`There's no way...something so ridiculous...`
`could exist...!!`
` I-I won't accept it...!!`
` There's no way magic exists...!!!"`
`"Yes, that's right...`
` There's no way magic exists...!!`
` There's no way witches exist!!"`
`『...M-Magic exists!!`
` Witches exist...!! Uryu-!!』`
`"......That's right.`
` Magic exists.`
` Witches exist.`
` ...And, in this world filled with anger and sadness, it can become the key that opens the door to the world of happiness...!!`
` I won't let...someone like you deny that!!"`
`『The key to a world of happiness lies in every person's hands...!`
` No one...has any right to steal that away...!!』`
`"You pitiful Human who cannot understand this.`
` ......If there had been magic in your life, it would probably have turned out differently, becoming much more peaceful."`
`"When I think that in your entire life, you were never able to meet with a true witch, `
`...I pity you."`
`"Eee, ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!!"`
`Kasumi let out a piercing scream.`
`At the same time, two of the black-suits came for me at once, thrusting their guns at my head.`
`...Like they were trying to use me as a hostage against something their eyes couldn't 'see'.`
`...Against the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, who had now reached the level of weapons, this was completely pointless.`
`"Damn, where are you?!`
` Keep on attacking, and this bitch is dead!!`
` Show yourself!!"`
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha!!!`
` What the hell's he sayin'?! And his guts look so tasty too.`
` ......Ange-sama, leave the next one to me!"`
`"Go ahead. Kill him."`
`"Thank you so much!! I'm so happyyyyyy!!`
` Diiiiiee!!!"`
`The man's chest split, and his guts poured out.`
`...This terrible way of dying threw the other man into a total panic.`
`However, Asmodeus's form was already at his back,`
` grasping his neck...and smiling obscenely...`
`"What a cutie.`
` ...Hey, hey, where do you wanna get pierced?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* Ange-sama, got any ideas?!!!"`
`"The head."`
`"Certainly, my masteer!!`
` Die!!"`
`The final black-suit had his head smashed by the Stake of Lust,`
` and as his insides scattered, he twisted and fell.`
`In the gruesome world where six people lay in a sea of blood, `
`......witch and Human confronted each other.`
`"......Sumadera Kasumi.`
` I sympathize with your sad life from the bottom of my soul.`
` ...I'm willing to grant you magic that can seal up that unfillable hole in your heart.`
` If you can believe, that is."`
`"D-Don't be...ridiculous...!!`
` I-I...will never accept something like this!!`
`As Kasumi, who was scared out of her wits, stepped backwards,`
` ...she picked up a handgun that someone had dropped.`
`Then, shaking, she pointed it at Ange...`
`"That's right, Kasumi...!`
` Shoot with that gun...!!`
` Turn your hatred into a bullet and shoot...!!"`
`"Eeek, eeek...!!`
` I'll kill you... I'll kill you...!!`
` If I don't kill you, I'll never be paid back for the life I've lived...!!"`
`"Yes, kill!`
` Pull the trigger!!`
` Take all of the anger and pain from your shabby life until now!`
` Use it all against her!"`
`"If you don't, you won't be released from your pain and anguish!!"`
`"......Stop it, Aunt Kasumi.`
` ...You mustn't listen to the black witch."`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, kas_4e252:`
`...my entire life...`
`...has been a wreck...!!"`
`"In that case, my magic might be able to turn that life into something bright and peaceful, bit by bit, starting now.`
` If you can believe in magic...and just have a change of heart, `
`I'll be able to open the door to a new world for you."`
`"There's no such thing!!`
` The salvation she speaks of is obviously just some fairy tale!`
` Your life is gonna be covered with thorns until you die anyway...!!`
` Let her hear that cry of agony!!`
` You can't regain anything that was lost, ...right? Sumadera Kasumiiiiiiiiii?!?!"`
`"That's right, you might not be able to regain anything.`
` However, I know you'll be able to create something new.`
` So, Aunt Kasumi,`
` throw that gun away.`
` ......I might be able to teach you too...about a world of happiness."`
`'!s1`
`...eeeeeeeeeekk...!!`
` Y`
`......You know,`
` because your mother ran away, `
`......I was forced to marry her fiancé in her place...!!"`
`"There was a man I swore I'd spend my life with!`
` And I was forced to break up with him!`
` You think you understand how I felt when I was forced to be wed in your mother's place...`
`and was held by a man I had barely even talked to?!?!"`
`"I wanted to kill her!!`
` But Nee-san just went and died on her own!`
` That's why I'll kill you!!`
` Otherwise, my thorn-filled life will never eeeeeeeeeeeeeeend!!"`
`...From Kasumi's eyes,`
` tears of passion dripped down.`
`So pitiable...`
`...This person's tears were so clear and beautiful.`
`But for that very reason, ...she hadn't been able to fully withstand her sad pain,`
` and had been given no choice but to listen to the black witch's temptation...`
`".........So sad.`
` ...In that case, I'll at least release you...your soul...for all eternity, and free you from the bonds of resentment.`
` ......That might be the only bit of charity I can give right now."`
`"Diiiiiiiiiiiee, Ushiromiya Angeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`"Goodbye, Aunt Kasumi.`
` ......Take a long rest in a quiet world."`
`I no longer feel anger or hatred for you.`
`I just want to let your soul rest in peace.`
`Kasumi's handgun spat fire.`
`Slowly, that bullet continued through a world frozen to the utmost limit, ...aiming for ANGE's forehead.`
`"Mammon."`
`"...Y-Yeah!!`
` Mammon of Greed, right here...!!"`
`"Thanks."`
`"Because I met you and Sakutarou, I was able to understand everything."`
`『...Ange...』`
`"Look away, Sakutarou.`
` ......Mammon,`
` release that woman.`
` And protect the honor of Mariage Sorcière...!!"`
`"Y......Yes!!`
` ...Prepare yourself, Sumadera Kasumi!!"`
`Even though the world was frozen, the Stake of Greed flashed like lightning...`
`...and had already gotten behind Kasumi...`
`"If there's any virtue in you, we'll meet again on the mountain of Purgatory!!`
` ......Diiiiiiiieee!!!"`
`The upper half of Sumadera Kasumi's head was smashed.`
`...Her cage of flesh was shattered, `
`...and she was finally released...`
`"......Next is you.`
` ......The black witch.`
` ...By now, I think even the fact that you look like Aunt Eva is inexcusable to her."`
`"Heh, ...heheheheheh.`
` ...If my form still looks like Ushiromiya Eva,`
` that means you still haven't been able to forgive 'me' inside yourself."`
`"I understand, Ange.`
` ......Even you want to be released from your thorn-filled life more than anything."`
`"............"`
`"In that case, ...I thought of something interesting.`
` I'll show you magic as well.`
` ......I won't be the one to kill you."`
`With the worst of smiles on her face,`
` the black witch changed her form into something like a black mist,`
` ...or else a vast swarm of black flying insects, which began to swirl around me.`
`Then, that black mist began to gather bit by bit, ...shaping itself into the form of a human.`
`".........What's this supposed to be...?"`
`Hehheheheheh!`
`You've got at least a vague idea, don't you?!`
`It's the woman you hated and despised the most!`
`The woman who hated and despised you the most...!`
`'!s0`
`......over there was...`
`Aunt Eva's form, `
`...as she had been during her life.`
`...Her hands...were holding a gun.`
`"......Aunt Eva...`
`died."`
`"*giggle* Long time no see, Angeeee.`
` ...I've come back from hell to kill youu!`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`Aunt Eva glared at me with a mad laugh.`
`"But...I'm not that surprised.`
` Aunt Eva was that kind of person."`
`"I imagine my funeral came as quite a relief to you, right?`
` I feel the same, since I'll never have to see your face again...!`
` But I had just one regret."`
`"And this is it!!"`
`"......Killing me?`
` ......Was that your last request?"`
`How pitiful.`
`...Even after death,`
` ...my aunt wasn't released from her pain...`
`"The black witch's power is itself the source of my magic.`
` Anger and hatred taught me how to work hard and persist.`
` Completely different from this magic to escape reality that you speak of!"`
`"...The magic you speak of is nothing more than stress reduction through outbursts of anger.`
` ...Our magic is different.`
` It can remake the entire world.`
` ......It's in a totally different class than your wicked magic."`
`"*giggle*!!`
` In that case, let's settle which is the victor right now, black or white...!!`
` You see my black magic miracle, reviving even after death and pointing a gun at you like this.`
` How exactly do you intend to stop that with a miracle of white magic?"`
`"I've surrounded you with the magic-resisting toxin.`
` You can't call the Seven Sisters anymore.`
` That miracle just now won't occur again...!!"`
`"......Having it occur despite all that is why it's called magic.`
` ...Okay.`
` Mammon, lend me your power."`
`...But Mammon didn't respond.`
` She didn't appear.`
`Certainly, as she'd said,`
` the magic-resisting toxin had burned everything up like a wasteland parched by a blazing sun...`
`......This...might be a little tough.`
`"It's useless to call out.`
` Never again!`
` The Seven Sisters of Purgatory will never answer!"`
`"And...`
`being able to call them even so is what makes it magic, right?"`
`".........`
`...How pitiful.`
` So long, Ange.`
` The few days we spent together were fun in their own way.`
` This is goodbye.`
` ...Aren't you glad...that the end of the line for you turned out to be this place?"`
`"Yeah, seriously.`
` How thoughtful of you."`
`"Thanks.`
` Then this is farewell."`
`The barrel of the gun rose slowly, `
`...so that you could see all the way down it.`
`Then, `
`......the trigger was slowly......`
`At that moment,`
` ...the gun exploded.`
`...It wasn't that it fired.`
`...It burst.`
`......You're...kidding me...`
`...In shock, inside a frozen space, `
`...Eva looked at the ruptured gun.`
`When time melted, the fragments would probably smash into her face all at once...`
`"...Mammon of Greed,`
` right here."`
`"............You're...kidding me..."`
`Behind Eva's back, Mammon stood.`
`......She had already penetrated the target I had given her.`
`...Which was...the gun.`
`"Is this...enough magic for you,`
` ......Aunt Eva?"`
`'!s1`
`Angeee......"`
`Then, time melted.`
`The fragments of the burst gun and exploding gunpowder burned her face.`
`Letting out a shrill scream, she covered her face and rolled around...`
`...It was pitiful.`
`"...Your luck was bad.`
` ...This is game over,`
` Aunt Eva."`
`I signaled to Mammon.`
`...So that Eva would be freed quickly from the pain of her burnt face as she writhed around.`
`"......Thank you, Mammon.`
` ...This time, I want to apologize again, and from the bottom of my heart, for calling all of you powerless on that day in the classroom.`
` You were excellent furniture for protecting witches."`
`"......I'm the one that's grateful.`
` ...I feel truly honored at being able to meet a good witch...a good master in the end, and at being able to fulfill my duty as furniture...!"`
`Mammon had understood.`
`This would be the final job I'd give her.`
`Mammon quietly walked up to me.`
`Then, she looked down at Eva.`
`"...Aunt Eva,`
` thanks for sticking with me for so long.`
` This is farewell.`
` <Have a nice dream>.`
` <See you in hell>."`
`'!s0`
`Then, ...the light sound of her forehead being bored into rang out.`
`...The battle of gunpowder smoke and fury...of white and black magic...ended.`
`I get the feeling it was a long......truly a long journey.`
`And the world slowly...`
`sank into darkness......`
`The stars that should've been sparkling......lay not in the sky, but were scattered beneath me.`
`...When I realized that the pearl and ruby made a red and white stream,`
` I noticed that it was a vast nighttime scene spread out below...`
`I was in the sky of that nighttime scene, neither standing nor flying,`
` ...but simply floating.`
`...From nowhere in particular, I could hear a *clap*clap*clap*,`
` a truly dull applause.`
`I know.`
`...It's the one who ordered me to go on a journey, `
`"......Congratulations, `
`Endless Witch, ANGE Beatrice.`
` At the end of your travels, you understood everything about magic."`
`"...Yes.`
` ......I now...understand everything about magic.`
` ......I am...a witch.`
` ...The last witch who inherited the magical world created by Mariage Sorcière."`
`"......No one besides you...can tear Beatrice's world to pieces."`
`"Because I know witches, ......I learned how to resist them."`
`"............"`
`"...Magic is made of love and sadness and anger.`
` ...No matter how cruel a witch Beatrice might have been,`
` the source of her magic is exactly the same."`
`"......And that's why I wish I could leave that world of hers alone.`
` ...After all, in her eyes at least, that world is complete."`
`"......But then you'd have to give up on your family."`
`"............`
`...That's right.`
` So, I don't like doing it, but I have to fight.`
` ......The very reason I left on this journey to become a witch...`
`...was so I could bet on the faint chance that I'd be able to take my family back someday."`
`"Unless you kill Beatrice, only worlds of isolation can exist for you.`
` ...As one who has traveled to billions of Fragments, I guarantee it."`
`"......I understand.`
` ...I can't afford to have compassion.`
` ...I must make my heart a demon...`
`...and tear her heart to pieces."`
`"...It's good that you're steady in that resolve.`
` I was worried that, as another witch like her, you might grow attached and lose your will to continue."`
`It felt a bit hollow hearing that from a person whose face was almost always expressionless.`
`Bernkastel.`
`...The mysterious witch who invited me on this journey.`
` ............`
`"At times, I've suspected that you might've lied to me."`
`".........Why?"`
`"...I am the Ange of 1998, so even if I save my family, they will only be saved for the Ange of 1986.`
` ...They won't be saved for me.`
` So I've sometimes felt like I was being deceived."`
`".........`
`...That is correct.`
` I deceived you."`
`"...But now I'm grateful.`
` ......After all, `
`in the end, you did teach me how to get my family back."`
`"......I didn't teach you anything.`
` ...If you know something, it's because you've reached that mental state by yourself, as a witch.`
` That mental state is different from my own.`
` ......I personally cannot understand it, but if that's the truth, then congratulations."`
`"I'm not a player in this game, but a piece.`
` You said that to me, right?"`
`"......Yes, I said it."`
`"Now, I fully understand that role.`
` ......A piece doesn't need emotions.`
` It just has to give its all for victory's sake."`
`"......Yes.`
` That is correct.`
` A game requires that you each make the best possible moves, right?`
` If your moves get distorted by hesitation and confusion, your opponent will be confused as well."`
`......Sorry, Beatrice.`
`But...don't hate me.`
`...'Ushiromiya Ange' still needs her family.`
`So, I have the right to fight you, ...so that I can take them back.`
`And, you have the responsibility to be challenged by me to a fight.`
`......So...don't hate me.`
`In exchange...`
`If you do win in this game, `
`I'll give you my blessing as well.`
`Come on, let's go.`
`......As the piece I am, it's finally time for my true turn.`
`Sorry, Beatrice.`
`I won't hand Onii-chan over to you...!!!`
`The world whitened...`
`It wasn't white.`
`...It was a gold color as bright as can be.`
`There...was the beautiful Ushiromiya family rose garden.`
`However, the flowers on the roses were all gold.`
`...The nectar was also gold-colored.`
` The butterflies gathered there were gold as well.`
`......This is...the Golden Land......`
`The promised land that the witches of Mariage Sorcière had finally been guided to...`
`There, all wishes are granted, and all magic and dreams are born.`
`......In that garden of gold roses...`
`were two...and only two...witches.`
`I appeared as an uninvited guest,`
` making that atmosphere tremble with unrest.`
`......What was to them a wind of misfortune shook the golden roses.`
`The incredibly beautiful scene formed by the golden rose petals scattered by the wind...`
`was clearly something not of this world...`
`The two who had been taking a walk on a path of golden roses noticed me and were surprised.`
`"...Ange...?`
` ......Beato, it's Ange...!!"`
`"......How did you get here...?`
` ......Leave us alone.`
` I shall no longer invite anyone here."`
`Beato spoke coldly.`
`......She seemed like a completely different person from the boldly sneering woman she had once been.`
`She had closed off her heart...and shut herself up in a world where she was alone with Maria onee-chan.`
`A world where she could always be alone with a friendly Maria onee-chan,`
` lecturing about magic while drinking tea.`
`...With no one to hurry them...and nothing to hold them back.`
`A world where not a single person who might hurt them existed.`
`Yes, to the two of them, it was a small, perfect universe...`
`"......Sorry.`
` ...I can't have you shutting yourself up in here.`
` ...We can't continue the game unless you come back."`
`"I said I stopped because I'd tired of it.`
` I will not return to the game again."`
`"......Beato will always be here with me.`
` Here, we'll drink tea together and think of lots of ways to play...!`
` You can play with us too, Ange."`
`"...MARIA,`
` I believe I said that mustn't happen.`
` I am satisfied as long as I have you alone."`
`"Say that you too are satisfied as long as you have me."`
`".........`
`...Yeah.`
` ...Thank you.`
` The only person who needs me that much is you, Beato.`
` So, I'll be with you.`
` Just us is enough."`
`"......MARIA, ...thanks...`
` ......I am grateful......"`
`Beato held Maria tight,`
` even creating a small, warm universe between their joined arms...`
`......It was probably the birth of the smallest universe in the world.`
`...The smallest universe in the world, which a pair who needed each other could give birth to...`
`No matter how small it was, it was a complete world.`
`......But, I had to tear it apart.`
` ............`
`"...Sorry,`
` ......but I can't let it go like that.`
` I came to smash this Golden Land of Mariage Sorcière."`
`'!s1`
`...are you going to break...`
`...my world......?`
` A-Are you saying that this world is causing anyone other than Maria and me trouble...?!"`
`"You've left Onii-chan waiting all this time...`
`in a game you started and then abandoned without finishing!`
` If you don't return to your seat, the contest won't end for all eternity...!!"`
`"......Hahahahaha, ha...!`
` There is no longer a single player in that game.`
` Battler vanished, and I did as well, coming here.`
` That game is already over."`
`'!s0`
`'!sd@:dwave_eng 0, enj_4e1819:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, enj_4e1820:`
` Will you defeat Battler and give birth to the world you truly wished for?!`
` Or will you be defeated and everything swallowed up by your magic released?!!`
` Take responsibility until the very end!!"`
`"......Don't, Ange.`
` Beato will spend her time in this world, alone with me for eternity.`
` ...And I don't need anything else, as long as I have Beato.`
` ...Here, all wishes are granted.`
` Everything is here."`
`......This Golden Land is made up of nothing more than the crystallization of Beatrice's and Maria onee-chan's thoughts.`
`'!s0`
`@`
`destroy it......`
`.........I will destroy this Golden Land, `
`......which must be a final, peaceful world in Beatrice's eyes...`
`"Onee-chan, that's wrong.`
` This Golden Land is a liar.`
` It won't grant the one wish you truly want granted."`
`"......That's not true!!`
` Anything can be granted here!`
` Look, there's even a nice Mama here!!"`
`Gold butterflies gathered behind Maria,`
` forming into a kindly smiling Aunt Rosa.`
`......After smiling sweetly at me,`
` it became golden petals and crumbled.`
`"Here, anything can be created.`
` Even Ange, even Battler, even George onii-chan, even Jessica onee-chan...!!"`
`"You can summon as many as you want, and everyone is nice...!!`
` You come too, Ange, and let's play together...!!"`
`......Sorry, Onee-chan......`
`"And what about Sakutarou...?"`
`"......!"`
`Upon hearing Sakutarou's name, Onee-chan looked like she was choking.`
`"Stop it...`
` Do not speak that name..."`
`Beato's expression changed as well.`
`And she hugged Maria, guarding her shoulders.`
`...Sakutarou's name was still taboo for Onee-chan.`
`"Why can't I say it?`
` It's the name of Maria onee-chan's best friend.`
` ...Why won't you invite that close friend to this wonderful Golden Land?`
` Why, in this Golden Land where any wish can be granted, is Sakutarou the only one you cannot summon?"`
`"Th-That is...`
` ...It's all right, MARIA.`
` You don't have to remember Sakutarou-"`
`"......Sakutaro was killed by Mama!!!!"`
`Maria onee-chan flew into a rage with a terrible expression on her face.`
`Surprised by that voice, the butterflies throughout the garden flew up, `
`...blowing around like a typhoon of flower petals.`
`"Yes, I know.`
` Aunt Rosa...took your precious stuffed animal, Sakutarou, and tore him apart...!!"`
`'!s0`
`Maria's scream became a storm that violently scattered the golden petals and leaves.`
`It truly was a storm of gold.`
`"Stop...!!`
` Stop stop stop...!!!`
` Why are you trying to reopen the wound in MARIA's heart...?!`
` Don't defile the sleep of this precious friend to both Maria and myself...!!"`
`"In that case, why don't you revive that precious friend for her with your magic?"`
`"I'd do it if I could...!!`
` But that stuffed animal was an article Rosa created herself!`
` The magical meaning of that individual object being torn apart is-"`
`"Don't try to fool anyone.`
` Why can't you revive Sakutarou?`
` There's only one answer.`
` It's because you aren't a real witch!"`
`"......I can revive him...!!`
` With my magic, I can revive him as often as I want, like this!!`
` I could even bury this garden in Sakutarous...!!"`
`"Yeah, I'll bet you could, with your magic!`
` But Onee-chan definitely wouldn't be able to see the Sakutarous you create!"`
`"......You know why, right?`
` I'll say it again.`
` It's because you aren't a real witch...!!"`
`"Stop iiiiiiiiiit!!`
` Why do you keep saying such mean things, Ange...?!`
` Beato can use a lot of magic...!`
` She's a wonderful witch...!!"`
`"She couldn't revive just Sakutaro, ...but she can do absolutely anything else...!!`
` So, I can at least...do without...`
`Sakutaro..."`
`"No, Onee-chan, that's wrong.`
` ......There's nothing a witch can't do.`
` As soon as she couldn't do that,`
` it was clear that Beatrice wasn't a real witch."`
`"Th-That's wrong...!!`
` It's because Sakutaro's stuffed animal vessel was something Mama made specially herself, and-"`
`"And that's why she can't revive him?`
` Is Beatrice's...your magic so inconvenient?"`
`"Gah, ......i-in that case, ...are you saying you can revive Sakutarou?!`
` Are you saying you can do that with your magic?!"`
`"I can."`
`"......What......?"`
`"Maria onee-chan!!`
` I'll show you some real magic.`
` I'll revive Sakutarou for you!!"`
`'!s1`
`Really...?`
` Even Beatrice couldn't do it, right...?`
` ...R-`
`Really...?!"`
`"Yes, I can!`
` In exchange, promise me.`
` Once I've revived Sakutarou..."`
`"Yes...!"`
`"...Leave this Golden Land."`
`"......!"`
`"I-I will not permit that...!!`
` This world is MARIA's and mine!!`
` If MARIA leaves, `
`...it will break...!!"`
`The minimum number of Humans it takes to create a universe is two.`
`Otherwise, that world is destroyed.`
`To drag out the witch shut away in the Golden Land, I'll have to destroy this world...!`
`"...Yes, that's the proof that you aren't a witch.`
` ...A real witch can create a universe alone.`
` The Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches!`
` ...The very existence of this alliance proves that you aren't a witch...!!"`
`"N-No...!!`
` I won't hand MARIA over...!!`
` I hate you, leave right now...!!`
` Get out of heeeeeeeeeeeere!!"`
`"Dragging everyone into a game of your own accord, then getting bored and chasing them out when your mood changes!!`
` How selfish can you be?`
` Take a look, Beatrice!!`
` And you, Maria onee-chan!!`
` This...is true magic......!!!"`
`"...W-Will you really revive Sakutaro...?!"`
`"There's no way you can!!`
` This is a Golden Land for Maria and me alone...!`
` There is not a single spell that an outsider like you could use!`
` As you are now, you couldn't even create a single butterfly!!"`
`"Be quiet, Beato!!`
` Don't get in Ange's way...!!"`
`When Maria yelled, `
`...the storm suddenly stopped, and the area returned to silence.`
`......The scene, as a massive number of golden petals that had been blown upwards quietly drifted down,`
` ...was fantastical, as though a golden snow was falling...`
`Maria, thinking about this unlikely, if-only miracle,`
` had unconsciously joined her hands together as though praying.`
`...Beato watched Maria do this, her heart racing.`
`'!s0`
`...Maria would...`
`...this world would...`
`But...it's unthinkable...!`
`Absolutely impossible...`
`That stuffed animal, which had been the only one in the world, was torn apart and thrown away,`
` and not a thread remained.`
`Reviving it was certainly and absolutely impossible...!!`
`#ff0000This is my Golden Land#ffffff...!`
`#ff0000A world where magic that isn't mine certainly cannot exist#ffffff!!!`
`'!s1`
`If you think you can do it, `
`...let's see what you've got, Ushiromiya Angeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`At Beato's scream-like cry, the world lost its sound.`
`I slowly...recited the incantation...for true magic...`
`"......Come, try to remember.`
` Maria's close friend, Sakutarou."`
`"...Try and remember what form you had."`
`"......Try and remember what a lovable stuffed animal you were."`
`"Huh, .........ah, ...ah......"`
`"............!"`
`...Expressions of shock rose to both of their faces.`
`Then, ...pushing Beato's elbow aside, Maria dashed forward...`
`"-kutaro......`
` ......Sakutaro......!!"`
`Then, `
`......she clung to us both.`
`"...It's all right.`
` Sakutarou...isn't going to disappear.`
` ......`
`『Uryu.`
` Maria, I'm home.』"`
`'!s1`
`...Sakutaro, `
`...uuuuuuuuuuuuuuu, `
`waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuu!!`
` Sakutarooooooo, `
`...I wanted to see you...`
`...so much......"`
`'!s0`
`......that stuffed animal lion, `
`...Sakutarou.`
`Its softness, its texture, its stitches, its everything, `
`......Maria had forgotten.`
`But, `
`......the instant she hugged that stuffed animal, it all came back to her vividly...`
`『Uryu.`
` Maria, `
`...I'm home.』`
`"Sakutaro, Sakutaro...!!`
` Is your body all right?`
` Does it hurt anywhere?`
` Even though...something so horrible was done to you, are you all okay...?!"`
`『Uryu...!`
` Ange revived me with magic, so I'm perfectly fine...!』`
`"Thank goodness, `
`...thank goodness...`
` Welcome back, Sakutaro...`
` Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!"`
`『From now on, I'll always be with you, Maria.`
` Together for eternity.`
` ...So,`
` don't let go of me, okay......?』`
`"Yeah, ...won't let go...`
`...for all eternity........."`
`Then, still hugging Sakutarou,`
` she looked up at me with tear-filled eyes...`
`"...Thank you, Ange...!`
` ......Ange's magic is amazing...`
`...How?`
` How can you revive Sakutarou?!`
` When Beato couldn't do it...!"`
`"......Impossible...`
` ...Impossible...`
` ...How?`
` ...How can a human other than me use magic in my Golden Land?!?!`
` This is...`
`...completely impossible...!"`
`"What are you so flustered about, Beatrice?`
` .........This is...magic, right?"`
`"There's no way that's magic...!!`
` #ff0000This is my Golden Land#ffffff!!`
` #ff0000A world where magic that isn't mine certainly cannot exist#ffffff!!`
` And my `
`#ff0000magic was not able to revive Sakutarou#ffffff...!!"`
`"There's no way it could!!`
` #ff0000That is a special stuffed animal#ffffff!`
` #ff0000Made by Rosa for her daughter's birthday, and in the entire world, the only#ffffff-"`
`"......Ah,`
` .........nngg,`
` .........aaah..."`
`".........See,`
` ...it's magic, right?"`
`'!s1`
`...ooh, `
`...aah, `
`...aaahhh, `
`......aaaaaaaahhh..."`
`'!s0`
`@`
`She looked at Maria and Sakutarou innocently frolicking around, `
`...looked at me, `
`......and then...`
`...fell to her knees, `
`...with even her hands pressed to the ground, `
`......and cried.`
`"Beatrice...! This really is magic, right...?!`
` It's magic, right?!`
` Beatrice...!!!"`
`"......Indeed...`
` ...It is magic...`
`'!s1`
`real...`
`magic......"`
`"Why can Ange use a magic that even Beato couldn't?!`
` Why?!`
` Why?!`
` Ange's amazing, Ange's an amazing witch!`
` A real witch who's much, much more amazing than me...!!!"`
`"Yeah, that's right, Onee-chan.`
` .........I am the Witch of Resurrection, ANGE.`
` ...There's nothing that can't be revived by me."`
`"Amazing, incredible!!`
` Even Beato said that the magic of resurrection was the hardest!!`
` ANGE's incredible!!`
` A really real Great Witch...!!!"`
`At that time, Maria's and Sakutarou's forms flashed gold,`
` ...and the forms of the two became golden flower petals...that crumbled away...`
`As the two became a golden wind and swirled together,`
` ......they left for some other peaceful place, not here.`
`Beato had, ...as promised, banished Maria from the Golden Land.`
`"...Goodbye, ...Maria onee-chan.`
` And...be happy forever.`
` ......Don't worry, you definitely exist in Onee-chan's world too.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` But that isn't ~ib~you~ib~."`
`'!s1`
`...Maria...`
` ...As your close friend, `
`......I celebrate this reunion...from the bottom of my heart......"`
`On Beato's face...was a mixture of what was probably every expression a human could muster.`
`It was `
`joy,`
` anger, `
`and sadness.`
`"......That's...the source of magic, isn't it?`
` ......Without love,`
` without sadness,`
` without anger,`
` ......magic cannot be 'seen'."`
`The ground shook.`
` ...An earthquake.`
`......It gradually summoned greater and greater fissures...`
`and began to tear Beatrice's final paradise apart.`
`Golden butterflies fluttered about, trying to escape, but there was nowhere to escape to.`
`...And...Beatrice was the same.`
`The Golden Land began to crumble away.`
`The earth crumbled downwards like a floor falling through, `
`......and Beatrice was sucked into the depths of a jet-black darkness.`
`Then, she was mercilessly slammed against a jet-black floor.`
`...It was a dimly-lit...smoking room.`
`There was no door to exit by, and while there was a window, it let no light...`
`into Beatrice's shadowy smoking room.`
`Even though Beato was moaning from the pain of being slammed against that cold, hard floor,`
` she shakily rose to her feet...`
`There was a seat there...`
`...And the game table, ...still just as it had been when she'd left it.`
`The game board also remained in the same state that Beato had left it in.`
`"That's your seat.`
` Sit."`
`'!s1`
`...for me to sit in......?"`
`Beato put a hand against her own seat...and laughed sadly.`
`"Win or lose.`
` That's all you've been given.`
` A tie during the process of reaching that point will probably be permitted."`
`"......However, you won't be allowed to suspend the game and throw it away!`
` Will you win and survive, or lose and disappear?`
` Until one of those two things happens, you will not be permitted to rise from that chair!!`
` That should be your only duty as the host of a witch's game, as the Golden Witch, Beatrice...!!"`
`Laughing weakly, Beato...`
`sat in that seat.`
`...Then, she rested her elbows and covered her face with both hands, `
`......showing off a smile with nothing but her mouth.`
`"......Not permitted to escape an unwinnable game...`
` ...Then, very well.`
` ...Why don't I repeat this...until I lose...?"`
`"Quit being so fainthearted!`
` Win.`
` Use the best moves you have...!!`
` You started this game!`
` You have a duty to make the best moves possible!!`
` Give all that indecisive fooling around a rest!"`
`At that time, there was a violent sound.`
`...Beato felt a cold, pathetic sensation on her leg.`
`"...Gotcha...!`
` I finally got you, eh, Beatooo?"`
`"Oh, Great Lady Lambdadelta, is it...?`
` ......To think that you were still here."`
`Beato's foot was caught in an ice-cold steel shackle,`
` ...tying her to the chair she sat in.`
`...She would no longer be able to escape from this seat.`
`"Hoohhohhohoho!`
` You won't be able to escape anymore, got it?`
` I can be more persistent than I look. Surprised?"`
`"......It's more surprising that you don't realize how persistent you look."`
`"You are not permitted to leave early or suspend this game.`
` You'll fight for all eternity in order to win, okay?`
` ......You don't want to lose, do you?`
` You want a little peek at the kind of wonderful world you'll be thrown into if you lose?"`
`"DON'T WORRY.`
` You can win, because I, the Great Lady Lambdadelta, will be looking after you `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`constantly `
`~ib~until you win~ib~`
`, for all eternity...!!"`
`"............`
`...Hmph, ...hahahahaha.`
` ......But even if I wish to fight, there is no opponent seated across from me, correct...?"`
`"......Don't worry, I found Battler."`
`When Bernkastel appeared and clapped her hands,`
` Battler appeared from the sky and plopped into the opposite chair.`
`Battler's eyes were slightly opened, but there was no sparkle in them, almost like a doll's.`
`Without one of the pillars that established his soul, `
`......he had fallen into the depths of the depths of darkness...and had been drifting about all this time.`
`...He should have then scattered and disappeared like mist.`
`Bernkastel had managed to scrape him together.`
`It's incredible that she managed to bring him back into a human form.`
`However, even though his flesh had returned, his soul had not.`
`...It had been blown away by Beatrice after having its existence denied.`
`It wouldn't come back easily.`
`"......Battler won't run from this fight either.`
` Not until he defeats you.`
` ...Just because your chances of winning are shrinking doesn't mean you'll be permitted the inelegance of abandoning everything and running.`
` Even he doesn't want that.`
` ......Isn't that right, Ushiromiya Battler...?"`
`Battler didn't answer.`
`...His heart was still...dead.`
`His eyes wavered slightly at the question, but he couldn't answer.`
`"Battler...!`
` Get ahold of yourself!`
` You are here.`
` And the enemy is before your eyes...!`
` Fight!`
` Fight to win!!"`
`Battler lazily repeated that, speaking incoherently.`
`......He'd come back.`
`The wound he bore on his soul was no small thing.`
`That was only natural.`
`Beatrice had woven her red, and he had been denied.`
`He had learned that the mother he'd respected was not his birth mother,`
` ...and he didn't know who he was.`
`...He was not...`
`Ushiromiya Battler......`
`"Don't talk stupid!`
` You are Ushiromiya Battler, no one else!`
` No matter who acknowledges that or denies that, make sure you believe it yourself...!!`
` After all, you're the only one who can create your own world.`
` Don't lose the world where you're Ushiromiya Battler!"`
`'!s1`
`......who...`
`am I......?`
` I'm not my mom's child, right...?`
` Where was I born from...?"`
`Battler asked that question as his eyes, which still hadn't regained their sparkle, stared lazily up at the ceiling.`
`Of course, she answered right away.`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` Beato proclaimed it with the red truth.`
` ...So I'll proclaim it too.`
` #ff0000Ushiromiya Battler is not Ushiromiya Asumu's son.#ffffff"`
`"......Hmph, ...in that case, he is not qualified to be the opponent in my game, correct...?"`
`"Beatrice, repeat it.`
` 'Ushiromiya Battler is not Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild'."`
`"............"`
`As Beato wrinkled her forehead, `
`...a painful-looking smile rose to her face.`
`"So you refuse to repeat it.`
` Beato proclaimed two red truths, `
`'#ff0000Battler is not Asumu's son#ffffff'`
` and `
`'#ff0000No one except Kinzo's grandchild Battler is qualified to be her opponent#ffffff'.`
` The following theory will allow Battler to be accepted without creating any contradictions.`
` Here's my blue truth, listen to it...!"`
`#5decffThe one qualified to be Beato's opponent is 'Kinzo's grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler', `
`and whether you're 'Asumu's son' or not isn't a problem.`
`Thus, even if you aren't Asumu's son, you can still be Kinzo's grandchild.`
`As long as you're Rudolf's son!#ffffff`
`"Hmph, it was just a silly word game, wasn't it?"`
`"......Your blue truth is valid.`
` Beato, your counterargument with the red truth?`
` If you cannot counter it with the red, Battler's qualifications as an opponent will stand unchallenged."`
`"............"`
`......Battler was still out of it.`
`He still couldn't really understand what she was saying for him.`
`...But even so, his spirit was starting to come back, bit by bit...`
`'!s1`
`......who...`
`...am I...?"`
`"Get ahold of yourself!`
` You are Ushiromiya Battler!`
` Yeah, maybe Mother Asumu didn't give birth to you.`
` But so what?!`
` That doesn't change in the slightest the fact that she was a mother to you, right?!"`
`"......For example, what is Ushiromiya Ange to you?`
` You might not share the same blood, but she's still your little sister, right?!`
` It's not about blood, it's about bonds, right?!"`
`"......That's...right...`
` ...Even though we don't share the same blood, ...Ange is...`
`...my little sister."`
`"Say it in red!`
` Say that Ange is your little sister!!"`
`"......`
`#ff0000Ange is...my little sister#ffffff.`
` ......Ah, ......I could say it."`
`She hugged Battler, who was still out of it and slumped in his chair, strongly from behind.`
`So much that it hurt.`
`"I don't know why Mother Asumu wasn't your birth mother.`
` But still, up until today and even now, you believe that she's your mother, right?!`
` In this world, there are plenty of people without even a mother, `
`...without even a family!!"`
`"Did Mother Asumu ever let you feel lonely?`
` Never, right?!`
` Don't throw your peaceful family away so easily!!`
` Your family bonds have gotten too thin after leaving your family for six years!!"`
`"You have to feel those family bonds much, much more strongly!`
` Remember!!`
` For Mother Asumu's sake as well, don't lose your love over a foolish witch's rant like this!"`
`".........`
`......You're right...`
` ...Mom was...always on my side...`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, but_4e867:`
`...and I wanna go home...`
` Where's...`
`all my...`
`...family...?"`
`The light still hadn't returned to Battler's eyes.`
`But...tears appeared.`
`"Your little sister is waiting at home for you to come back.`
` If even you don't come back, ...she'll be all alone forever...!`
` For your little sister's sake, please, win this witch's game...!!"`
`'!s1`
`...my...`
`little sister......`
` ...But I still...`
`...don't get it...`
` ......Why...`
`do I have to keep repeating this incomprehensible, cruel game with Beato...?`
` ......I've...`
`had enough......"`
`"In that case, settle this game quickly and go back home!!`
` Ushiromiya Battler, how long are you going to play around in a place like this?!`
` Your little sister is waiting for you to come home!!!"`
`......That's right.`
`Battler had been caught up in this strange game before he even knew it.`
`And, still unable to understand why he was fighting,`
` he had been constantly sucked into the witch's pace, played with and made to fight.`
`That should've been his most simple and first question.`
`...Because he didn't understand that, he had lost his purpose in fighting...!!`
`That's why my voice won't reach Battler's ears...!`
`Instead of a vague purpose, like winning against the witch, or because he couldn't forgive her...`
`...He has to be aware of a purpose for which he must win.`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, but_4e882:`

`"Battler is my toy!`
` His father and mother are both my toys.`

` ...You may continue to wander all alone forever, awaiting the return of a family that will never come back...!"`
`From Ange's arms that held him, ......the painful, sad days...`
`that had been experienced by his lonely little sister...flowed into Battler...`
`...Because he'd been playing around in a place like this,`

`"...Ange, ......Ange......!!`

` Thanks, Ange...`
` Your Onii-chan...has been forgetting something important this whole time...!"`
`Battler tried to turn around,`

`...Was it sweat?`
`Hot drops were splashing on the nape of Battler's neck.`
`...What they were...he knew from holding Ange's arm that clung to him.`
`......Because it stained Battler's hand, his fingers, ...red.`
`"......Blood...`
` ...A-Ange?!`
` A-Are you okay?!`
` H-Hey...?!"`
`It dripped and splashed.`
`He didn't know what was going on.`
`Battler didn't know, because he couldn't turn around,`

` In order to come here, `

`I had to follow...`

` ...Letting you, Onii-chan, `

`...Ange......"`
`...It was so hard......`

`"Ange?!`
` Ange!!`
` There's so much blood...!!`
` So much, so much!!"`
`He wanted to turn around, but Ange was gripping his head too tightly.`
`However, judging by the blood that was pouring out and Ange's pained breathing,`

`"......Don't...worry......`

`In chess, the ultimate goal is victory.`
`...So, if it can bring you to victory in the end, there's nothing wrong with sacrificing a few individual pieces.`
`Ange had cooly made a decision.`
`......She had been taught over and over again that she was a piece, not a player.`
`...In order to act like a piece and save Battler, right now, she would have to become a sacrificial piece herself.`
`......Battler had to know.`
`His purpose in this witch's game couldn't be something as abstract as finishing off the witch.`
`He had to win the game, release himself, and bring his family back home.`
`Why?`
` ......Because he had family, a little sister, who was waiting for him to come home.`
`A being was created so that Ushiromiya Ange's voice could reach you.`
`That's me, ANGE Beatrice...!!`
`I'll sacrifice the piece I am to give to you the will to fight, to give you purpose!`
`My purpose isn't to play with you in a witch's game for all eternity!`
`I came to bring you Ushiromiya Ange's mourning and sadness!`
` That is my unshakable purpose!`
`"......Ange!!`
` Ange!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaarrrghhh!!!"`
`The white, thin arm that held Battler...became pale and transparent, almost like wax.`
`...And even so, the fresh blood...stained it so cruelly...`
`'!s1`
`...disappear now, but...`
` ...Onii-chan, fight with all you've got, `
`......and I'm sure, you'll...`
`...come back to me......`
` ......I'll be waiting, `
`......always......`
` ...I'd planned on helping you out a lot more than this, `
`...but I couldn't do anything.`
` ...Sorry............"`
`"D-Don't worry about that...!!`
` You...taught me, didn't you...?!`
` You taught me why I have to win...!`
` And that...I've got to win for certain...and come back to you...!!"`
`"What......am I doing, lazing about in a place like this...?!!`
` Yeah, I won't play around anymore...!!`
` 'Cause I'll come back, I'll come home!!`
` I'll definitely come home, bringing a souvenir, I promise...!!!"`
`'!s1`
`......so promise me one thing..."`
`"What? I'll promise anything...!!"`

` ...Rise from your seat, `

`eeee...ee......`
`............`
` ...Ange...?"`
`"Ah, crap, and you even promised that you wouldn't turn around..."`
`"...A-Ange......`
` Nnn...wh-where..."`
`Behind my chair, `
`'!s0`
`had been smashed, `
`...and there was a sticky, pulpy...`
`mountain...`
`And around that mountain of blood and minced meat, `
`...the clothes and shoes Ange had been wearing...`
`lay crumpled as though they'd been taken off and thrown away...`
`...As though...just a human's insides had been pulverized and tossed there like scrap.`
`...As though Ange, who had been standing there until a second ago, had been crushed......`
`"Ange...?`
` ...Wh-Where's Ange...?`
` Where did Ange disappear to...?`
` H-Hey!`
` Where did Ange go?!"`
`The two young-looking witches said nothing...`
`...and just silently looked at the mountain of blood and meat and clothes.`
`But...I didn't want to accept it.`
`...I definitely didn't want to accept it!!!`
`".........I was right in front of you.`
` ......I was watching the whole time.`
` Watching what happened......to Ange behind you."`
`"...D-Do you know...?`
` ......Where...did Ange go......?"`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, bea_4e997:`
`tore chunks of flesh the size of a thumb off her...`
`and threw them away.`
` ......I was watching.`
` I saw as countless cruel tools, burned red-hot in the witch's furnace, approached Ange from behind, `
`and one bit at a time, ...pecked at her, twisted her, ripped chunks off her, ...and tore her to pieces."`
`"......Ange should be proud.`
` In order to share some last words with her brother, `
`...she stopped herself from gasping at that pain until the very end..."`
`...As if something like that could have happened...`
`'!s0`
`...what had fallen there...`
`...was without a doubt, what she had been wearing on her head, those pink-jeweled...hair ornaments.`
`To be honest, I'd thought they were a bit too childish for her and didn't suit her...`
`...So I remembered them well.`
`......Why did Ange wear such cheap hair ornaments all the time...?`
`No, no, `
`...the thought that this is Ange...`
`...couldn't possibly be...`
`uu, uuuuuuuuuu...!`
`".........You're pretty blunt, Beato."`
`"Battler didn't see it, `
`so you could've just said she turned into butterflies and flew away, or something."`
`'!s1`
`You guys also...`
`...s-saw...`
`...that happen...?`
` Y-`
`You saw...`
`Ange...`
`get torn into little bits...?`
` You were watching, `
`......and yet, `
`...you stayed...`
`so calm the whole time......?!"`
`Without answering, Bernkastel, Lambdadelta,`
` and Beatrice stared at me,`
` ...some in pity, ...others in derision, ...watching me......`
`Since she'd called herself Gretel,`
` and after what had happened with Virgilia in the last game, ...I'd thought she might be Beato's underling,`
` and I'd been wary of her, not trusting her even though she was an ally...`
`'!s0`
`......after learning that it truly was Ange, `
`...without even being allowed to see her face, `
`......I turn around...`
`and find...`
`something...`
`like this...`
` ......Aaaaaaaggghhh......!`
`"Why does it matter?`
` ......All this about your little sister."`
`"...What...did you say......?"`
`"After all, you'll never return from this place for all eternity anyway.`
` ......Whatever happens to your little sister in a world where you don't come home has nothing to do with you.`
` As long as you play here, the Anges of countless worlds will live in isolation,`
` and the same pain of her final moments just now will be forced upon her, spread over a period of more than a decade."`
`"......However, that is of no importance, correct?`
` It cannot be 'seen' by you from here.`
` You cannot observe it.`
` An unobservable fact cannot be proven except by the red truth."`
`"Therefore, your anxiety over Ange's misfortune after this may be needless.`
` ......She might, surprisingly, be able to live a casual life without ever having to work thanks to Rudolf's inheritance, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`...That's...`
`a lie.`
`From Ange's arm, every part of that sad future world had poured into me in an instant.`
`'!s0`
`I keep on...`
`lazing about forever...`
`and playing in a place like this......!!`
`...I...`
`never thought about anyone but myself...`
`I must defeat her!`
` I'll take back my family, `
`back to where Ange's waiting, ...and come home as soon as I can......!`
`Because even as I hang around with the witch like this,`
` Ange's heart continues to be torn to bits by sadness...!!`
`"......Ange, is this...`
`...what you wanted to see...?"`
`'!s0`
`...yet with all my might, `
`...pointed...`
`"......Beatrice..."`
`"Indeed."`
`"......Resume this game.`
` ......I won't run away anymore, ...and I won't let you escape."`
`"Bring it on.`
` I can no longer escape or hide.`
` ......Let us decide this between you and me for good."`
`"......One shall win.`
` One shall lose and be destroyed.`
` No other resolution can exist."`
`"......I'll win.`
` No matter how long it takes, I'll definitely smash you...!!`
` There aren't gonna be any more compromises, interruptions or losses by default in this contest!!`
` I won't run away!`
` I won't let you get away!!"`
`"Try and defeat me with everything you've got...!!`
` There's absolutely no need for stupid tricks and deceit, for intermingling and acting friendly!!`
` You and I are enemies...!!!`
` I have to settle this as soon as possible......and bring my family back to Ange!!!"`
`...Unwavering resolve.`
`...Certain willpower.`
`The certain willpower of a Human becomes certain magical power.`
`...That leads to a miracle...and promises that it shall be so.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`Yes, this is a promised, ~ib~certain miracle~ib~.`
`.........Are my chances at victory not even one in a billion...?`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` No, shall it be ~ib~certainly impossible, without any Fragment of a miracle~ib~?`
`Before I knew it, a cold, stiff chain had bound my other leg without a sound,`
` tying me to the chair...`
`......All that's left is to either be killed and lose to Battler...`
`or resist and continue in an endless tie for all eternity.`
`...Or perhaps I should say it's to continue tying until I've prepared my heart for death.`
`Either way, I...`
`......Must fight to lose, and nothing more.`
`I have already been bound by the chains of eternity.`
`And Battler won't let me escape either.`
`...Should I pathetically beg his forgiveness...?`
`Should I beg for compassion by appealing to his pitying heart...?`
`Should I forget appearances and prostrate myself?`
`Because of the chains, even that choice will not be granted me.`
`...Checkmate.`
`This is a perfect stranglehold.`
`............However.`
`I am the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
`The demon lord of gold who reigns in the Golden Land.`
`Even in a fight to lose, there is an attitude fitting for me.`
`And I have the right to adorn my death in a manner suited to me.`
`"......I am no different.`
` I'll make you accept the existence of my magic, and the door to the Golden Land will open on this island.`
` You shall become the guest of honor at that first tea party."`
`"Everyone besides you has gathered already, you see?`
` Because the honored guest's arrival has been delayed, the tea party cannot begin."`
`"Your father, mother, cousins and everyone else are getting tired of waiting for your arrival."`
`"Sure, that's perfect, that's just perfect!!`
` What the hell is magic, what the hell are witches...?!!`
` I'm done playing with you!!`
` Here we go, Beatrice...!!!"`
`"Come as hard as you can, for there will be no compromise, interruptions or losing by default.`
` One shall win, and one shall be destroyed.`
` If you have no desire to lose, then you must defeat me, kill me.`
` However, I won't be killed so easily.`
` Until you can prepare a fitting end for me, I can resist over and over again."`
`"Can you do that?`
` ...No, you probably can.`
` You surely can.`
` Come on, come and kill me.`
` ......"`
`".........Is it that hard?`
` Then let's go with the usual.`
` ........."`
`'!s1`
` As if I'd be killed!`
` Even if I can't win, I can at least harass you enough to stop you from snatching victory, riiiiiiiiiiiight?!"`
`"Hoh, that's a good look on your face!`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*`
` Uhhyahhahahahahaha, `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"Try and kill me, `
`try and kill me, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeroooooooooooooooooooohhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!"`
`......I don't have a clue what's going on.`
`Please, someone explain in a way even I can understand...`
`what happened yesterday.`
`I was in the kitchen of the mansion, grabbing some food without permission.`
`If you open up that massive business-class refrigerator, you can find anything.`
`You can eat and drink as much as you like.`
`...Even if the typhoon didn't clear up for a week, I'd have more than enough to eat.`
`With wine in one hand, I was helping myself to some dry-cured ham.`
`I wonder just how expensive this wine and ham are.`
`You ingredients are out of luck too.`
`If only you'd had Gohda-san to cook you, you could've been reborn as much more incredible food...`
`I looked at the clock.`
`Very soon, it would be 24:00.`
`October 5, the second day, would end.`
`......The insane October 4, yesterday, seemed like a lie.`
`...That's how much...nothing had happened after that test thing.`
`Nothing happened.`
`No phone call came, and no letters came.`
`No person came, and no one attacked me.`
`Nothing happened at all.`
`I wanna start demanding a refund on all the time and energy that tension stole from me,`
` ......because after that, for an entire day, a full 24 hours...`
`...Nooothing happened.`
`So surely, nothing's gonna happen now.`
`......A full 24 hours ago...`
`...Beatrice called me to the spot in front of the mansion's entrance.`
`There, I was given a strange test to determine the Successor to the Headship or whatever.`
`I gave a serious answer in my own way, but it somehow hadn't meshed with the other side.`
`Beatrice got pissed for no reason and fell silent.`
`I yelled at her to try and say something, but she gave no answer.`
`When I asked where Maria was, she just told me to go to the chapel and left.`
`To tell the truth, it was an anticlimax.`
`...No matter what kind of weird test you give, at least tell me whether I've passed or failed.`
`Are you trying to say 'Thanks for coming, your results will be mailed to you later' or something?`
` ...Quit messing with me.`
`Anyway, I then headed to the chapel.`
`...After failing their tests, both George-aniki and Jessica were killed.`
`I couldn't let Maria get killed too.`
`...Also, I might get a chance to catch some person trying to kill her.`
`As a little kid, I often heard from Jessica that you'd get in trouble if you went near the chapel,`
` so I'd never been there, but I at least knew where it was.`
`I couldn't find any trace of a person there,`
` ......but there was a key bundle lying in front of the door.`
`I thought this might be someone telling me to open the door, but after trying all the keys, I found that none of them fit.`
`I also called Maria's name, but there was no answer whatsoever.`
`I searched around the chapel, but there was a limit to what I could do in the pitch black with just a flashlight.`
`I realized that this key bundle might be a set of master keys, which could make it possible to open the door to the mansion.`
`I found no sign of Maria, so I returned to the mansion.`
`The mansion was wrapped in silence.`
`And, in a horrible stench.`
`However, it's amazing how good humans are at adapting.`
`The inside of the mansion must still be wrapped up in that smell.`
`However, I grew completely used to it and stopped minding it.`
`It didn't seem any worse than any old house where someone had burnt some meat.`
`At first, I was bewildered by the stench, but I decided to head to the dining hall for the time being...`
`and found those corpses that were so pitiful, Gohda-san and the rest had hesitated to speak of them in detail.`
`It was the remains of Aunt Natsuhi and the others who'd become the first victims.`
`Half of each head had been completely split open,`
` and it was so gruesome that even without knowing a thing about examining corpses, I could say that they were 100% dead...`
`...And on top of that, the remaining halves of their faces were left like normal, so it was even easy to identify them.`
`...Really convenient corpses, these were.`
`And in addition to those six bodies...was one more.`
`This seventh corpse......was Maria.`
`She lay next to Aunt Rosa, as though sleeping alongside her.`
`......I cried.`
`At the death of an innocent young girl.`
` And at the cruel way my dad and the rest had died.`
`I raced through the mansion swinging the hat-stand spear, yelling 'Come out here, bastard'.`
`...But I couldn't find any trace of anyone else.`
`Thinking they might be planning to hide somewhere and attack me from behind, I went around searching for hiding places,`
` sometimes growing more cautious,`
` and sometimes intentionally letting my guard down in various ways, but in the end, not even a kitten appeared...`
`Then, morning came.`
`...My tension and fatigue combined with my drowsiness, making for the worst kind of dawn.`
`Humans are pretty incredible.`
`...Even when a murderer might been hiding somewhere, we prioritize drowsiness and fatigue over our own lives.`
`...By that time, I was starting to feel pretty ridiculous.`
`After all, for a full six hours before dawn, I'd walked around the mansion, yelling at the culprits to show themselves.`
`My search had been a careful one, and I'd tired myself out and let my guard down.`
`Even so, no one came to attack me.`
`Basically, I lost patience with them and figured they could do whatever the hell they wanted......`
`The boat won't come until the typhoon passes.`
`They said on TV that it won't pass until tomorrow, so I've got another full day today.`
`Lazing about lost its interest,`
` ...and even though I knew it would probably make the police mad, I decided to play detective a bit.`
`First was the dining hall, where the very first murder had occurred.`
`The six who had been killed in the beginning really were pitiful.`
`...The weapon used was probably a gun.`
`Maybe their heads were split by something powerful, like a magnum bullet or a shotgun.`
`It was a reasonable theory to hold.`
`Compared to that, the seventh corpse, Maria, had died in a much better and cleaner way.`
`At a glance, I could see no external wounds and didn't understand how she'd been killed.`
`But by her mouth were traces of bubbles that she might've spat out,`
` and it looked like a typical death by poisoning that you might see in a TV drama.`
`Wasn't Maria called out to the chapel and given a test...?`
`...So why was she in the corpse-filled dining hall, lying next to her mother, dead...?`
`Even if the cause of death was poison, ...who gave it to her?`
`Her clothes weren't disturbed at all.`
`It's hard to imagine that she was forcibly pushed down and given an injection of poison.`
`......It's probably better to assume that she was given a capsule of poison or something and made to swallow it.`
`But compared to the scattered and violently mutilated corpses in this room, Maria's corpse was too clean.`
`If they had a gun, they only needed to pull the trigger.`
` But poisoning, whether by having her drink it or by an injection, would take a lot more effort.`
`Considering the culprit's brutal nature, you'd think Maria's death alone was given special treatment.`
`Why was only Maria given a sleep-like death?`
`......True, being killed is always a pitiful thing,`
` ...but for some reason, Maria's death alone seemed very courteous to me...`
`Both of Maria's hands were joined on her chest, as though the dead person had put them there herself.`
`...Did Maria do that herself before dying...?`
`...Isn't this usually something done by someone else after the person dies...?`
`As though sleeping with her mother, whose head was half crushed, Maria dozed in peace.`
`...For some reason, that contrast really bugged me.`
`Including the direct cause, it's probably safe to say that Maria's death is shrouded in mystery...`
`And more than anything else.`
`The biggest mystery of this dining hall...was the 'pitfalls'.`
`...The 'pitfalls' that both Uncle Krauss's group and Gohda-san's had mentioned.`
`After the first six were killed, five more fell through 'pitfalls' and were captured.`
`......What are pitfalls?`
`Those things that suddenly open and you fall through them, right...?`
`The room had a solid floor with a carpet that looked dignified, if a bit worn out.`
`...No matter how you looked at it, it was single piece.`
`If a pitfall had opened up, there would have to be a seam just in that place.`
`...And, if there had been some trick like a pitfall, wouldn't it creak when you walked on it??`
`No matter how much I walked around, feeling the carpet, I just couldn't imagine that a pitfall was hidden here.`
`Anyway, it'd be one thing if a single person fell, but a full five people did.`
`...By putting together everyone's stories, each one of them had fallen from a different location,`
` so at the very least, there had to be five separate places with pitfalls.`
`......So what does this mean?`
`Was this room actually made with pitfalls across the entire floor,`
` so by pushing a button, you could open up a pitfall in the location of your choice, ...some kind of contraption like that??`
`That kind of ridiculous mechanism would be surprising even in a ninja mansion.`
`...But if Dad and the rest had heard about this, `
`I wonder if they'd say 'I wouldn't put it past Grandfather to do it, to make it'.`
`...At any rate, I didn't learn anything more from the dining hall.`
`Do the pitfalls not exist?`
` Or do they exist, but I just can't find them, amateur that I am?`
`I can't say for sure.`
`Since they claimed that the pitfalls were there,`
` ...I can't ignore them, even if I can't find them...`
`The next ones to be killed were Jessica and George-aniki.`
`I'd discovered George-aniki when I'd been called out for my test.`
`He had been called out to the arbor in the rose garden...and, probably, shot in the forehead with a gun.`
`Jessica had been called to her own room on the second floor of the mansion.`
`The door to her room was locked.`
`But that wasn't a problem at all, since I had a master key.`
`Inside the room, ......it was horrible.`
`...But after the dining hall, I was used to corpses, ...so I'd built up a bit of an immunity.`
`The phone receiver was loose and dangling.`
`...Had she been killed while still on the phone with me?`
`Jessica was leaning against the wall right next to it, `
`...with half of her head split open.`
`As far as I could tell by glancing at the scene, ...it looked as though she'd been killed while on the phone.`
`In that case, had the culprit been right there before her eyes?`
`......I hadn't gotten that impression when listening to Jessica's voice over the phone.`
`I'm pretty sure Jessica said... 'They got me'.`
`It's probably best to assume that she'd already received a fatal wound at the time of the phone call.`
`That's right, and she also said this.`
`"When you come, Battler, I'll be a corpse with half of its head split open."`
` Yes, that's what she said.`
`......From what I could tell by looking at Jessica's corpse, there were no wounds on her other than the damage to her head.`
`Could she have had an injury serious enough to make her prepared for death, and then died halfway through the phone call?`
`But the way she'd talked on the phone made me think that she'd escaped harm for the time being.`
`You shouldn't be able to have a casual conversation over a phone if the culprit's right before your eyes.`
`So, did the culprit come in partway through the phone call and kill Jessica...?`
`......No, that can't be right.`
`After all, this room was locked.`
`...Wait, that doesn't tell me anything.`
`...If the culprit stole a master key from one of the victims, locking the door would be meaningless.`
`But she had no external wounds other than her head.`
`......In that case, should I assume that the fatal wound she was prepared to die from and the actual external wound that damaged her head were two different things,`
` and that both of them were made to the same part of the body?`
`In other words, Jessica was struck severely to the head...and received an incredibly bad wound.`
`Then she called me...and either lost consciousness or died while on the phone.`
`Then, the culprit came and damaged her head again, ...something like that.`
`After being called to this room, Jessica was attacked by the culprit and received a serious injury.`
`Then, the culprit thought she'd been killed...and went away for the time being.`
`...But Jessica miraculously started breathing again...and called me with what would become her dying message.`
`Then, the culprit realized that they'd failed to kill her...and rushed back to deliver the final blow after Jessica fell unconscious from massive blood loss...`
`......That seems to add up, more or less.`
`Except for how Jessica was able to accurately predict the nature of that final blow.`
`And, there was one more thing that bugged me about the phone call from Jessica.`
`Jessica had said this...`
`"George nii-san's done for too.`
` That was...an instant death."`
`...She said it almost as though she'd witnessed George-aniki being killed.`
`But while you certainly could see the rose garden from the window in Jessica's room,`
` and you could even see the roof of the arbor where George-aniki had been summoned, ......it was very far away.`
`Add on the fact that it was the night of a typhoon, and it's very hard to imagine that she was able to witness everything that happened by the arbor from this window.`
`...And more than anything else.`
`Jessica left before George-aniki.`
`So she shouldn't have known that George-aniki's test took place by the arbor.`
`Why did Jessica know...that George-aniki had been killed...?`
`......Also, during my search of the entire mansion, I found Kyrie-san's corpse as well.`
`It was in one of the old guest rooms, at the back of the first floor.`
`In the past, before the construction of the guesthouse, the relatives had spent the night in these.`
`...Kyrie-san's situation matched Jessica's perfectly.`
`She'd probably been killed during her phone call with me.`
`The receiver was hanging untidily, ...and Kyrie-san lay crumpled in that corner.`
`But the way she had been killed was very different from Jessica.`
`Her head wasn't smashed.`
`...Instead, a stake with an occult design was buried into her forehead.`
`...It was so gruesome, ...so I pulled it out.`
`After pulling it, I realized that this might get me into trouble with the police later.`
`So, a little too late, I set it down by Kyrie-san's side.`
`Its tip was sharp and stained with enough blood that it must have penetrated fully to the brain.`
`I didn't know what kind of metal it was made of, but it was about as heavy as a paperweight.`
`Certainly, if you were stabbed all-out with something like this, it might cause a terrible wound.`
`......I...probably knew what that stake meant.`
`...It's one of those.`
`The style of killing from the fourth twilight onwards in the witch's epitaph.`
`...It's probably that 'gouge with a stake and kill' thing.`
`However, a human skull is very firm.`
`......No matter how much someone mustered their strength, could it really have been pierced so neatly...?`
`No.`
`...By my reasoning, this stake wasn't the cause of death, but had just been used to damage the corpse after death.`
`She was probably killed with a gun or something, like George-aniki,`
` ......and the stake had been stuck into the hole left by the gun.`
`...Thinking of it that way makes it easier to accept.`
`But...was Kyrie-san really killed with a gun?`
`As she said on the phone, even though she was holed up inside a locked room, Kyrie-san was being attacked.`
`In fact, this room had been locked.`
`...Also, `
`...she mentioned a golden thread or something flying in and attacking her.`
`In fact, there were four places around Kyrie-san's corpse with holes that could have been caused by some kind of attack.`
`'!s0`
`a golden thread attacked her...`
`...through the keyhole...?`
`I looked at the door from Kyrie-san's perspective.`
`If it had been one of those old keyholes you see in old mystery movies,`
` where you can peek through to the other side, then it would've clearly been possible to stick something through it.`
`But even though the doors in this mansion were old-fashioned, the locks were the familiar, average cylinder style that you could find in any normal house.`
`...In other words, they weren't constructed in a way that would let you penetrate through them.`
`So no matter how thin an object you might try to stick through the keyhole,`
` it's unthinkable that something penetrated through from the outside and attacked.`
`......A cylinder lock.`
`......And a keyhole......?`
`But despite that, Kyrie-san definitely said that something like a golden thread had flown in through the keyhole,`
` ...spun around while aiming for her, and attacked her...`
`'A golden thread attacking through a keyhole'.`
`......I couldn't understand what it meant at all.`
`But, even so...`
`...Kyrie-san probably predicted that I wouldn't be able to understand all this.`
`And it wasn't just Kyrie-san.`
`Jessica said it over the phone too.`
`...No, since the very beginning, from the time we talked with Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san and got the phone call from Uncle Krauss's group, `
`...everyone has said the same, consistent thing.`
`......Grandfather summoned witches and demons...and is killing people with magic.`
`They'd been shown that right before their eyes.`
`These weren't tricks or fakes.`
`There was no choice but to believe it.`
`...With one voice, they had all said that.`
`When the mystery woman calling herself Beatrice appeared,`
` even I had pretty much believed that she was a real witch and might start summoning goat monsters right and left.`
`...However, after being left alone for a whole day, my feeling of tension had faded completely.`
` I was now able to think that something so stupid definitely couldn't be true.`
`Did they lose their heads a little in an extraordinary situation where their lives were exposed to danger.........`
`and mistakenly think that a witch was attacking them with magic?`
`......But multiple people gave the same kind of testimony, and on top of that, none of their opinions conflicted each other.`
`...If it had just been a single statement, I'd be able to suspect that they just didn't see what they thought they saw,`
` ...but doing that now is pretty...difficult...`
`Then, right next to the back door, I found Uncle Krauss with his head half smashed.`
`...Even though he'd escaped the dungeon of Kuwadorian...`
`and somehow made it this far by a secret underground passage, ...he had been killed.`
`Buried into the gruesome cross-section of his half-crushed head...`
`was a stake with an occult design, like the one that had been buried into Kyrie-san's forehead.`
`And in this situation, it was very hard to imagine that this stake was the weapon used.`
`...He had been killed with a powerful gun like the six in the dining hall,`
` and after death, had been jabbed with a stake like Kyrie-san.`
`I wonder if the golden threads that Kyrie-san spoke of attacked Uncle Krauss too.`
`Does there exist some kind of tool, like an endoscope, that's very thin but can be moved about at will......?`
`And that can also attack people...?`
`No way. I've never heard of anything like that.`
`But even so, ...if this fact had been revealed to one of the relatives,`
` maybe they'd say 'I wouldn't put it past Grandfather to make it'...`
`Since I can't deny the existence of golden thread X that can be moved at will and attack people,`
` I can either accept that this mysterious weapon exists, or else...`
`I'll have to accept that this was a murder committed with magic.`
`To find the next corpse, I had to go out through the back door and search around outside a bit.`
`Behind the mansion, in the wild-grown bushes that were almost swallowed up by the forest, there was something like an old well, `
`...and right next to it...were Doctor Nanjo and Shannon-chan's corpses.`
`Both corpses had their heads smashed.`
`...And, though they weren't stuck in, there were stakes lying right next to each damaged head.`
`...Each corpse was atrocious, but having to look directly at Shannon-chan's lovely face, which had been half blown away, was very painful...`
`Then, there was the well.`
`I'd heard that inside it was a secret underground passage to the mysterious mansion, Kuwadorian.`
`...By this time, I'd begun to think that Beatrice and her accomplices might've used this underground passage...`
`and left for Kuwadorian.`
`Even though there had apparently been at least ten of them, I hadn't seen a trace of anyone.`
`...It seemed very likely that they'd already escaped to a different location.`
`There's the typhoon.`
`They can't go out to sea.`
`It goes the same for the forest.`
`There's no way they could traverse such a deep, uncultivated forest on foot.`
`In that case, they had only one place to go.`
`The mysterious hidden mansion, Kuwadorian.`
`...Through the secret underground passage at the bottom of the well...!`
`...By this time, I had entirely lost my fear of being killed if I happened to come across the enemy.`
`Don't fuck with me...!`
`This time I'll storm into your mansion...!`
`"......Ah, ...wh-what the hell...?!`
` ...D-Damn it...!!"`
`The old well had a firm cover on it.`
`The cover was an iron grill.`
`The gaps between the bars were perhaps 20 centimeters across.`
` You could peer inside, but it really wasn't something a human could pass through.`
`If I hadn't known better, I wouldn't have thought it anything more than a simple cover to prevent falls.`
`...But from what Kyrie-san had told me, I knew that its purpose was to prevent intruders from entering the secret underground passage in its depths...!`
`But the cover was extremely firm and rigid, and no matter how much I pushed or pulled, I couldn't even get close to opening it.`
`I couldn't find any obvious lock.`
`It might be sealed by some mechanism.`
`But no matter how much I investigated it, I couldn't find anything to release it.`
`......The biggest piece of information Kyrie-san had tried to give me, gambling her final moments,`
` ...was the underground passage in this well...!`
`"Don't think I'll be stopped by something like this cover...!`
` I'll smash it to bits...!`
` I'll search for a tool...!"`
`I had an idea.`
`...After all, I'd seen the various tools in the gardening shed when we'd locked Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san in there.`
`But the shutter to the gardening shed was locked.`
`On top of that, the key was with Gohda-san, who was dead on the inside.`
`...In other words, this gardening shed was a closed room.`
`There's no way to open it from the outside.`
`In that case, I've got to break the shutter.`
`There has to be a tool for that somewhere.`
`...Kinda feels like I'm going in circles here.`
`Then, while searching for that, I learned that the source of the stench that had permeated the mansion this whole time...was the underground boiler room.`
`The boiler room was dimly lit, humid, smelled horrible, and on top of all that, was incredibly creepy.`
`But there were several large tools there, and I managed to find a fire hatchet and some massive wire cutters.`
`And......Grandfather's corpse.`
`No, strictly speaking, I should probably say that I found a burnt corpse of a person who was probably Grandfather.`
`Someone's corpse had been stuffed into the blazing fires of the boiler...`
`However, by coincidence, I was able to notice the number of toes on the corpse.`
`...Both feet had six toes.`
`...That's right, I think I heard it from Dad some time long ago.`
`Something about Grandfather having polydactyly, with extra toes.`
`According to old Ushiromiya family tradition, it seems that those with extra fingers or toes had some kind of good fortune and were treated as a good omen.`
`...And because of that, Grandfather was selected to be the Successor or something......`
`But I wonder if I can be certain this is Grandfather's body just from the number of toes.`
`After all, Grandfather was supposed to be the leader of the group of culprits.`
`I didn't have a clue why he'd get stuffed into a boiler in a place like this and die.`
`A mysterious corpse, burning and spitting out a terrible stench amid the flames...`
`...If it really was Grandfather,`
` ......did that mean that the leader of the group of culprits wasn't Grandfather, but that Beatrice after all...?`
`Grandfather was used because he was convenient...and was then thrown away?`
`......Unfortunately, it didn't look like I'd be given a chance to hear Grandfather's side of the story...`
`Now that I had obtained a tool, I thought about rushing to take on the cover to the well,`
` but I decided to break the shutter to the gardening shed first.`
`...I had plenty of time to kill anyway.`
`I figured I should check on the condition of Gohda-san's and Kumasawa-san's corpses.`
`I hit the shutter with the hatchet, breaking into it,`
` stuck the wire cutter into the crack,`
` and scissored it around, opening up a hole.`
`Then, I faced Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san's corpses once more...`
`As a result, I learned a new fact.`
`First, they had not died by being hung by the neck.`
` Both of their feet were solidly on the floor.`
`...And on both of their foreheads were signs that they'd been shot with a gun.`
`The loop seemed longer than a normal noose.`
`On top of that, the length was different on each to match the height of each person.`
`In other words, the lengths had been adjusted so that both Gohda-san, who was tall, and Kumasawa-san, who was short, `
`had their feet solidly but barely on the ground.`
`Also, while the ropes carried both of their weights as their heads lolled, both of them had some slack below their knees.`
`This meant that if they'd stood up with these loops around their necks, there would've been some extra length.`
`In other words, these loops wouldn't have been that great for hanging people.`
`The direct cause of death was probably a shot to the head.`
`It was gruesome.`
` Their insides were still dripping out from those gaping holes, staining their faces a deep red.`
`It's probably best to assume that they were then hung, pulled up, and left exposed like that.`
`...If they'd been shot with a gun, they would probably have been lying down on the floor.`
`...If that had been the case, you wouldn't have been able to tell they were dead even if you peeked through the window.`
`The mountain of stuff would've gotten in the way, so if they'd been lying down, they would've been hidden.`
`To make the deaths of these two known to the rest of us who couldn't go inside,`
` they would've had to hang them like this, making it visible from the outside.`
`...Was this...done to get back at us for thinking that those two would surely be safe if we left the key with them...?`
`I wonder where the shutter key we gave Gohda-san, which should've ensured their safety, is now...`
`That key...was in the pocket of his trousers.`
`The gardening shed key had been kindly left there, and even the plate was attached.`
`In other words, the gardening shed had been a closed room after all.`
`And that gave rise to another question.`
`...Because this can't be explained by a hanging.`
`If they didn't commit suicide, then those nooses were set up by the culprit.`
`...It might have been possible to shoot them through the window, but it's really unthinkable that someone could've tied two loops to the beam from the outside.`
`And furthermore, there's no way they could've lifted up the heavy corpses.`
`In other words, to do all of this, they would've had to go inside.`
`But the key was in Gohda-san's pocket, and the shutter had been locked.`
`In other words, the gardening shed had been a closed room.`
`Gohda-san had said that there was only one key to this shutter.`
`...But is it possible that there was a copy...`
`and that the culprit was in possession of it...?`
`If we're allowed to theorize that there actually was a duplicate of the gardening storehouse key...and that Gohda-san just didn't know about it, `
`then this isn't even close to a closed room.`
`......But why is it that, despite the fact that almost all of the other corpses were shot to death and left almost completely alone,`
` just these two corpses were intentionally hoisted up?`
`I couldn't help but feel something a bit odd about that...`
`After this, if we assume that the mystery corpse in the boiler was Grandfather's,`
` ...the deaths of 16 people have been confirmed.`
`There were 18 people on this island.`
`I'm here, and there are 16 corpses.`
`Kanon-kun's corpse is the only one I haven't been able to confirm.`
`According to Kyrie-san, he had been killed while climbing out of the well...and had fallen down into it.`
`So with the well closed up like this, it's impossible to check.`
`I tried shining a flashlight through the bars, down into the darkness in the depths of the well.`
`But it seemed that the jet-black darkness had no intention of showing me its depths with a light of that level...`
`It looked like I'd have to break the bars after all.`
`Using the hatchets and things I'd dragged from the boiler room and the gardening shed, I tried breaking the cover of the well.`
`But the metal bars were extraordinarily sturdy, and breaking them wasn't easy.`
`...I hit them with the hatchet over and over, until my hands started feeling weird, and eventually gave up on breaking them...`
`...It's impossible.`
`If they were at least wood, I might've been able to break them.`
`But this metal...`
`That's right, there's no way you can slice through metal bars like butter with a human's strength.`
`...I can't even begin to understand...that story about how Kanon-kun cut through metal bars.`
`I heard that a light like a red laser beam grew out of his arm...`
`and that he sliced through the metal bars like he was cutting through butter.`
`Cutting through metal bars like butter...?`
`...And what's with the red laser beam?`
`Does that mean he secretly had a burner on him or something...`
`and used that to burn through the bars...?`
`Still, just what kind of laser......could cut through metal bars like butter?`
`...It almost sounds like the kind of laser beam you'd find in those robot anime I'd loved as a kid, doesn't it?`
`Does something like that actually exist...?`
`And how did Kanon-kun get that laser beam...?`
`No matter how much I want to ask him, he's already been killed.`
`Plus, even his corpse is now in the depths of the well, beyond this cover.`
`If Kanon-kun could slice through metal bars, I'm sure he could handle this metal cover in a single swing.`
`...It...feels just like the closed room Gohda-san was locked in while holding the key.`
`Only one person can open the door, but they're locked inside...`
`...If only I had that power of Kanon-kun's, I'd be able to do something about this cover myself...`
`............`
`Just who is Kanon-kun?`
`He couldn't really be...a non-Human being capable of using a strange power, right?`
`Kyrie-san told me to believe in witches, and I even met an insane woman calling herself one.`
`...Could Kanon-kun possibly be...`
`a human on the witch's side...?`
`...Or else, `
`......the culprit?`
`......What the heck.`
`...Am I gonna start treating him like the culprit...just because I can't find his corpse?`
`Hoh, ...treating him like the culprit because there's no corpse...?`
`And who was the one babbling about the suspicious being innocent...?`
`......Very well, I couldn't bear having you push all the crimes on Kanon and building a human culprit theory that way.`
`I will guarantee it with the red...`
`#ff0000Kanon is dead.#ffffff`
`#ff0000Among the five people in Kyrie's group, he was the first to die.`
`In short, he was the 9th victim.#ffffff`
`"...Since there's no corpse, ...I can't say for sure...`
`that Kanon-kun is dead."`
`So, my whispering in red does not reach the piece you...`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ......But it did reach `
`~ib~you~ib~`
`, right......?`
`At a glance, this was a mass murder due to something strange that could only be thought of as magic.`
`...Golden threads that attacked through key holes.`
`No, we even have testimony that something gold flew around the dining hall when the first six died.`
`The two might've been the same weapon.`
`Then there was the closed room murder of the garden shed, and the laser beam that could cut metal bars.`
`...And that wasn't all.`
`There was much, much more...like the group of goat monsters,`
` the story of a witch who could create pitfalls just by snapping her fingers, the rabbit-like demons who had fired golden threads...`
`I think there was more, ......but each part was all screwed up.`
`I couldn't possibly accept it...and was forced to suspect that it was some kind of trick or mistake.`
`...But why in the world had everyone spoken with one voice, saying the same thing without contradictions in their testimony...?`
`It's not only the magic.`
`There's Maria's mysterious death.`
`Why Jessica knew that George-aniki had been killed.`
`The mysterious burnt corpse that I couldn't confirm really belonged to that damn geezer.`
`...And more, and more.`
`All stuff I don't get...!`
`I tilted the wine bottle up and gulped.`
`...I don't have a clue what's going on.`
`After dinner last night, the kids were chased out and told to go back to the guesthouse, `
`......and then there was a massacre in the dining hall.`
`Kyrie-san and the rest were dropped through pitfalls and captured.`
`Then, Jessica and George-aniki were called out to take a test or whatever and killed.`
`Even though Kyrie-san's group was able to escape the dungeon somehow, all of them got killed in the end.`
`And at the very, very end, even Maria was killed, leaving me all alone.`
`......In short, I did nothing except stay locked up in the guesthouse.`
`During that time, a huge incident occurred and ended.`
`What can I call it except incomprehensible?`
`I don't have a clue anymore!`
`"Now I'm nothing but a drunk.`
` You plan on leaving only me alive...?`
` Show yourself right away and come to kill me already.`
` It's too much of a pain, so I won't search for you.`
` You show me your true form yourself...!`
` I won't run or hide, so come at me with arrows or bullets or whatever...!"`
`I haven't gotten any sleep since yesterday, so I'm incredibly sleepy.`
`You wanna kill me, go ahead.`
`I decided to return to the guesthouse and boldly rest in a bed.`
`...When I exited the kitchen and passed through the lobby, `
`......that portrait of the witch came into view.`
`The big clock did too.`
`...It was almost exactly 24:00.`
`Then, the sound of the bell rang out, proclaiming that 24:00 had arrived...`
`As I listened, ...I looked up at Beatrice's portrait.`
`Exactly 24 hours ago, I met you.`
`What were you trying to say...?`
`And where did you go?`
`Just who in the world are you......?`
`Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
`I haven't solved a single one of the riddles surrounding you...!`
`Show yourself...`
`......And fight me...!!`
`Then, ...the witch showed herself.`
`Like a guest of honor finally appearing, she showed herself on the landing at the top of the big staircase...`
`"So, you finally show yourself...`
` ...I've been kept bored for a whole day."`
`"......Correct.`
` I gave you a whole day.`
` Was that enough for you to fully exercise the rights of the Human side?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I was bored, after all.`
` I did a heck of a lot of it."`
`"......Ange...was a good piece."`
`"Don't you...speak Ange's name."`
`"......She appeared through a miracle, sacrificed herself, and gave you the tenacity required for certain victory."`
`"Don't you...speak Ange's name."`
`"......That brutal death was something you needed.`
` If you hadn't seen that death, you wouldn't have grown serious.`
` Without the wake-up call of Ange's ill-fated future, your tenacity for victory would not have been born."`
`"I told you not to speak Ange's name...!!"`
`"......In short, she was a necessary sacrifice.`
` Otherwise, an anger great enough to kill me would not have been born in you.`
` The rivalry between us cannot be destroyed."`
`"Damn you, Lady Bernkastel, it's more fitting to call that a trump card than a piece.`
` ...No matter how much a piece acts, it does not stray from the board.`
` But no matter how much power a trump card wields, it is always thrown away after it is used."`
`"Ange was truly a good trump card for you."`
`"Don't you...speak Ange's naaaaaaaaaaaammme!!!"`
`At Battler's angry roar, Beato finally stopped talking.`
`"...You know, I don't have time to play around in a place like this anymore.`
` ...Even a tie will keep Ange waiting.`
`'!s1`
`...take my family, `
`...and go back home!!`
` I won't waste a second playing witch games with you!!"`
`"In that case, what should you do?`
` You know, don't you?"`
`"Yeah!`
` I'll beat you down!!`
` I'll blast away all witches, magic, illusions and delusions!!`
` Come on, let's get started!!!`
` I won't let you trick me again!!`
` Resume the game, okay?`
` I'll tear apart the witch's veil concealing the outright lie you are!!!"`
`"You talk too much.`
` All you have to do is honestly say 'I'll kill you'."`
`"Yeah.`
` If those are the words you want, ...I'll say them.`
` This is the first and last wish of yours that I'll lend an ear to."`
`"......I thank you."`
`"I'll......"`
`"............"`
`"Very well!!`
` Let us begin, Battler...!!`
` Yes, the time for the witch hunt has come...!!`
` Try and chase me, try and corner me, try and kill me! I expect a lot from you!!`
` Try and show me what your little sister gave you in her last moments...!!"`
`'!s0`
`...Battler's cry burned the world with a white light.`
`And, if you opened your eyes amidst the darkness, ...the two of them could be seen in a rose garden...`
`"......Who shall make the first move?"`
`"Me."`
`"How bold."`
`In the rose garden, beautiful rose petals danced.`
`The color of those rose petals...was red.`
`Did the fact that they faced each other in this beautiful rose garden...`
`prove...or make claim to a red, single truth?`
`......That must be why the roses are red.`
`But in the language of flowers, ...roses represent passion.`
`...Not truth.`
`The flower for truth is a forget-me-not.`
`And that flower...is blue.`
`"I'll bore through everything with my blue truth.`
` ......From the very beginning of everything.`
` I'll start from the very first game!"`
`"Very well.`
` Let's see what you've got.`
` ...Come."`
`"Here I go......`
` I've already proclaimed it, but I'll say it again.`
` ...This isn't just for the murder of Doctor Nanjo in the last game.`
` This'll tear apart every scene from every game since the beginning...!!"`
`"#5decffUshiromiya Kinzo is already dead!`
` So the true number of people on the island is 17!`
` By adding in an unknown person X, that makes 18 people.`
` By supposing the existence of this person X, the crime is possible even if all 17 people have alibis.`
` By this, even though the number of people reaches 18, it's still possible for culprit X to exist and carry out crimes, even if all 18 people seem to have alibis!!#ffffff"`
`You can break through all of the murders in Episode 1 by supposing an unknown person X.`
`Furthermore, it's even possible to explain the mystery of Kinzo's evaporation from the closed room sealed by the receipt...`
`by making the bold assumption that Kinzo wasn't there in the first place.`
`Unless Beato counters this with the red truth,`
` the Illusion of the Witch from Episode 1 has been completely smashed.`
`......This blue truth is valid.`
`The wedge of blue truth that Battler had thrown stabbed right through the top of Beato's left foot.`
`...Was the red blood pouring out from there...a protest being made by her red truth...?`
`Beato shut one of her eyes tight, enduring the unbearable pain of the blue truth that denied her.`
`"Hmm, not bad.`
` ...But I mustn't be denied yet, I mustn't be killed yet.`
` ...This is not yet enough.`
` ......In the subsequent games, there were mysteries that couldn't be explained with that alone, right?"`
`"...Which mysteries?"`
`"In the final stages of the second game,`
` George took Gohda and Shannon with him, barricaded them in Natsuhi's room, and was killed.`
` The key that unlocked Natsuhi's room was locked up inside the room, and all of the remaining keys that could unlock that door were in Rosa's hand.`
` Even if a culprit X existed, it should have been impossible to construct that closed room."`
`The blue wedge that pierced Beato shook.`
`She was resisting, fighting to pull it out.`
`"No, that doesn't shake my blue truth.`
` If culprit X were to obtain a master key, that's not even close to a closed room."`
`"No, it was impossible for the culprit to obtain one.`
` #ff0000All of the master keys were under Rosa's control!#ffffff"`
`"But that's meaningless if Aunt Rosa was the culprit!`
` #5decffAunt Rosa handed a key over to culprit X by some method, assisting in the closed room murder!`
` And after that, she retrieved the key by a similar method!#ffffff`
` Too naive, Beato!!`
` I'd already guessed that much at the time!"`
`"...*cackle* Yes, you did, didn't you...`
` ...Gwaaargh...!!!`
` ......Agh, ...ack-"`
`The wedge that had been gradually losing its sparkle and had seemed as though it was about to be pulled out...`
`regained its strong blue again thanks to Battler's additional blue truth...and dug into Beato again, eating into her foot.`
`Beato let out a cry of anguish at that pain.`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, bea_9e449:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, bea_9e450:`
` Not yet, `
`......not yeeeeeeeet!!"`
`"On to the third game.`
` The six linked closed rooms, the murders of Aunt Rosa and Maria, Dad and the rest's deaths in the hall, the murders of Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi...`
`#5decffall of that can be explained if we suppose that Aunt Eva was the culprit.#ffffff"`
`"This argument was already won back then.`
` And even that final riddle you proposed through EVA, `
`#5decffthe murder of Doctor Nanjo, can be explained with an 18th unknown person X.#ffffff`
` That breaks through the whole third game!!! Can you counter that?!"`
`"Guh, aah...!!`
` ...O-Of course...!`
` This much is...nothing to worry about...!`
` In that case, how do you explain George's disappearance from the guesthouse?`
` I shall add to the red truth.`
` #ff0000George did not go down the stairs of the guesthouse.#ffffff`
` He flew out through the window!"`
`In the final stages of the third game, George suddenly vanished from the second floor of the guesthouse.`
`Eva, who had been on the first floor, claimed that no one had come downstairs,`
` but because of the blue truth, George could've snuck down to the first floor and escaped while Eva was busy carrying Krauss's and Natsuhi's corpses outside.`
`But by adding an additional red truth, Beato had denied that possibility.`
`To go outside without going down the staircase to the first floor, he would've had to leave by the window.`
` But all of the windows had been locked from the inside...!`
`"So what?`
` It's just like you said.`
` He flew out the window, right?`
` There was a lawn, so we couldn't tell if he'd jumped down, and it was raining so hard.`
` Any light traces would've disappeared."`
`"I'll use the red truth again.`
` #ff0000All windows and doors leading to the outside were locked from the inside.#ffffff`
` #ff0000Furthermore, it is impossible to lock any of those from the outside!#ffffff`
` George had no technique by which to lock them...!"`
`"I'll use more of the blue.`
` I said it myself at the time.`
` #5decffIn that case, everything works out as long as someone locked the window after George-aniki escaped through it!#ffffff`
` Nothing difficult about that!!"`
`"Gwaaaaaaaahhaaaaah...!!`
` Gguuuuhhh... Can I not...escape after something like this...?"`
`Beato couldn't remove the blue wedge that was buried into her foot.`
`The fake witch was burned more and more by that forceful blue...`
`"There's still nothing that shakes my blue truth in any of the first three games.`
` ...In that case, the only game that can prove you're a witch...is this game, the fourth game."`
`"...Since I haven't countered you with the red, that is so.`
` I shall have to prove witches using only this game.`
` ......Very well.`
` Give me everything you've got."`
`"There's nothing strange about the murder of the six people in the dining hall.`
` #5decffThe 18th person X went wild with a gun and killed everyone.`
` As for the pitfalls, there's a chance that pitfalls truly were hidden there,`
` and it's possible to explain it using Kyrie-san's theory, supposing that poison dart-shooting device X, which can knock a person out instantly, exists.`
` The murders of George-aniki, Jessica, and those who escaped from the dungeon can also be explained with guns, just like the dining hall.#ffffff`
` There's nothing strange about it!"`
`"But I'm sure you've got a counterattack, right?`
` Bring it on!!"`
`"Your greatest sword, this 18th person X, is based on the theory that Kinzo was already dead.`
` I knew you would make that claim.`
` That's why I took Kinzo out of his study.`
` All members in the family conference welcomed that Kinzo, right?`
` #ff0000All of those who met at the family conference acknowledged the presence of Kinzo!#ffffff"`
`"That's right.`
` But Grandfather was seriously ill, bedridden on the verge of life and death, right?`
` If he was so worn out that he looked like a different person, maybe no one would've cared, right?"`
`"I'll counter with this.`
` #5decffThat Grandfather was a different person, a body double.`
` A different person the relatives mistook for Grandfather!#ffffff"`
`"Then I'll counter with this.`
` #ff0000No person would mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight.`
` No matter what disguise might be used, they would not mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight!#ffffff"`
`"Then I'll use this.`
` #5decffIn the second game, when you announced with the red truth that there were five master keys, even though there could've been more than five in first game,`
` you changed the premises of the later games.`
` So, it's possibile that Kinzo's life or death status was changed for the 4th game alone.#ffffff"`
`"#5decffTherefore, Kinzo's presence in the fourth game doesn't serve as proof that he was present in the previous games...!`
` Therefore, even if we suppose that the six murders in the dining hall were carried out by Grandfather, it contradicts nothing!#ffffff"`
`"Then let me counter this way.`
` #ff0000Kinzo's life or death status is the same at the start of all four games.`
` The setup was not different for the fourth game alone...!#ffffff"`
`"Repeat it.`
` 'Kinzo was alive at the start time of every game'!"`
`"I refuse to repeat it.`
` I won't answer, Battler.`
` I won't give you the red truth you so desire...!"`
`"...Damn, ...you're standing in my way, geezer...!!`
` Are you putting yourself on the line to protect Beatrice, this most beloved witch of yours?!"`
`Swaying, that damn geezer came into view.`
`...Heh, is he trying to be some kind of knight, blocking the path between me and Beato...?!`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle* Battler,`
` are you capable of surpassing me...?"`
`"I won't let you reach, I will not let you reach, ...not to the Golden Witch's height, you seeeeeeeeee?!`
` Fuhhahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Your thoughtless reasoning cannot surpass even me alone!`
` Die!!!"`
`Kinzo's jet-black cape spread as though it would swallow the world,`
` becoming the snout of a vast black dragon that came at me, trying to swallow me in one gulp.`
`...Faced with that black dragon's roar, I calmed my breathing and closed my eyes lightly...`
`"I'll swallow you up in a single gulp!!`
` Disappear, inexperienced fooooooooooool!!!"`
`"......Quiet, you damn undying ghost."`
`"Hoh, so you call me a ghost?`
` So, you intend to see it through to the end, this theory that I am already dead!!`
` That will prove fatal to you!!`
` Be swallowed up by the first twilight of the fourth game and disappear!!"`
`The black dragon's vast mouth, its snout, its fangs...swallowed Battler whole...!!!`
`In that instant, Battler suddenly opened his eyes!`
`"Thanks, Beatrice.`
` Your third game became a foothold for my counterattack."`
`"What...?"`
`"See ya, damn geezer.`
` This is goodbye.`
` ......As a basis for claiming that 'Kinzo was dead' even in the 4th game, I propose the following theory!"`
`"Very well, come with all you have, my descendant!!`
`"Here I go, you damn geezer!!`
` #5decffMy theory's that the name of Kinzo gets passed on as the title of the Ushiromiya Family Head!`
` Ushiromiya Kinzo was already dead.`
` And he passed 'that name' on to someone else!`
` Everyone acknowledged that!!`
` That way, 'All of those who met at the family conference acknowledged the presence of Kinzo'!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffThere wasn't even any need for someone to disguise themselves as Grandfather.`
` Because everyone acknowledged a new 'Kinzo'!`
` So, 'they didn't actually mistake Kinzo by sight'!!`
` As long as this theory is not denied, nothing can change the fact that you're dead!!!#ffffff"`
`"This is the final blow.`
` Damn geezer, I demand that you repeat it.`
` 'Among all of the people there, not one had multiple, different names'!!"`
`"I...can...not......!!`
` Gah, gwoooooooooooooooooooragghgghghh!!"`
`"Rest in peace, damn geezer.`
` Thank me. You were finally able to die.`
` This is your requiem, take it and drop dead!!"`
`"#5decffUshiromiya Kinzo was already dead!`
` That's right, you definitely deserve to be pitied, since whenever we find your corpse, it's always completely burnt.`
` That was a device to hide the fact that time had passed since your death!!`
` Then, you passed that name on to someone else!!`
` With this theory, even though 'you' were dead, 'Kinzo' was able to appear at the family conference!!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffHow's that? This is checkmaaaaaaaaaaaate!!#ffffff"`
`Several dozen blue stakes bored into Kinzo's ghost.`
`Their terrible destructive power wouldn't let the ghost recover again...!!`
`"...Be...atr...ice......"`
`"......Kinzo,`
` ...thank you for everything.`
` ...Rest...in peace...`
` I will not forget...my time spent with you......"`
`Dispersing along with the shadow of the black dragon as golden flower petals scattered,`
` ...Ushiromiya Kinzo became a gold-colored cyclone and disappeared...`
`Even after death, he had fought for the sake of the woman he'd loved.`
`...There's no doubting that your love and madness were the real thing...!`
`"......Nggg, ......Battler......"`
`"Don't hate me.`
` ...Let the dead sleep.`
` Don't wake them.`
` ...You're up next.`
` This is the end for you too."`
`Beato still couldn't pull out the blue wedge that pierced her foot...`
`She realized that she was on the verge of death...`
`"I've gone along with you a whole bunch.`
` I think I've more than fulfilled any responsibility I had to play with you.`
` ...But it's about time to finish things up.`
` I've got a lonely little sister waiting at home."`
`"...Let me take my leave with my whole family...!!"`
`"...Then kill me.`
` ...In that case, try and kill me!`
` ...I won't run or hide, and by now I won't even be able to avoid it!!`
` Come ooooooooooooooooooooooon, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!!"`
`"You've got it!!`
` With the 18th person X from the 'Kinzo was dead' theory, everything that remained has been pierced through!"`
`"#5decffGeorge-aniki and Jessica's deaths in the fourth game can also be explained by culprit X!!`
` And the five who escaped from the dungeon and were killed, and the two in the gardening shed, and Maria in the end!`
` All of those can be explained with 18th person X!!`
` There's nothing strange there at all!!#ffffff"`
`"With this, I've fully explained the culprit using humans for all games!!`
` Beatrice, ...this is...checkmaaaaaaaaaaaate!!"`
`"Uu, ...whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh......aah...!"`
`Beatrice, who couldn't dodge, had several blue stakes driven into her and was skewered...`
`Beato grabbed at them, trying to pull them out somehow...`
`'!s1`
`...that got meee...`
` ......It huurts......`
`...This'll......kill me, won't it......?`
`...If I don't pull these out, `
`......I'll die...`
`I've had enough of the pain...`
` ...I've had enough of......`
`...the...anguish...`
`With both hands, ...Beato firmly grasped one of the blue stakes.`
`...Naturally, the power of the witch-denying blue truth burned her hands.`
`...Unable even to hide her tears at the pain, Beato howled and tried to pull the stakes out with all her might...`
`If I can't pull these out, ......I'll die......`
`...This is......my final counterattack......`
`"Then Battler,`
` ...how do you explain my several acts of magic...?`
` ......The very first time those appeared...was in the second game, when I fixed Maria's pumpkin marshmallow.`
` At that time, Rosa definitely witnessed that magic."`
`Certainly, at that time, Rosa witnessed gold butterflies gathering and the fixing of a marshmallow by the miracle of magic.`
`"...*cackle*cackle*...`
` ...Rosa alone witnessing it isn't very credible, right...?`
` That's why I increased the number of witnesses to the uppermost limit later on.`
` ...Which is what...happened in this last game..."`
`"The summoning of my minions!`
` And brutal murders due to magic!`
` All of those were witnessed by a great many people...!!`
` That is itself...proof that my magic exists...!!`
` How do you explain that, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerr......?!!!"`
`"......Stalemate."`
`"......Wh-Whaat...?"`
`"'Magic exists because magic exists'.`
` Didn't the rules of our Braun tube trial say that you couldn't use that kind of argument?"`
`"......Y...es, ...you're right......`
` ...Heh, ......hahack, ...guh..."`
`"No matter who `
`or how many people `
`witnessed magic,`
` that cannot become proof of magic's existence!!"`
`"Whether all the magic you've shown exists or not, I can ignore it all and explain things with Humans.`
` That's my undeniable right.`
` ...Am I wrong?"`
`At those words, the blue stakes let out an even brighter light, knocking my hands away.`
`'!s1`
`...pull them out after all......`
`...ggghh......`
`As Battler is now, even if I pull up a witness for each individual bit of magic and demand an explanation, he'll probably use some kind of move to deny all of them.`
`...Not just the magic with the marshmallow I showed Rosa, ...but all the miracles of magic.`
`So, I can no longer even claim to be a witch without questioning him about something like how a marshmallow was fixed...`
`I'm in such an inferior position that I must fight over such trivialities...`
`It may be...`
`...impossible for me......`
`...I know that...`
`This was to be a game without victory from the very beginning.`
`...So, it was only natural that the day of my defeat would eventually come.`
`'!s1`
`up until today...`
`...just to lose to Battler......?`
`......I began the game...`
`thinking I might be able to win.`
`Even if I wouldn't be able to win easily, I believed that in a game repeating endlessly, a miracle would eventually occur.`
`...After all, I had certain willpower on my side, an unwavering desire to win with certainty.`
`...However, I've now lost that miracle completely.`
`And, that certain willpower resides in Battler, ...leaving me certainly without even a one-in-a-million chance at a miracle.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`Or perhaps I should say I've been left without a miracle ~ib~or~ib~ certainty...`
`I will have no victory...and no end through a tie.`
`'!s1`
`is to continue on resisting...`
`...until defeat is given to me...in this game...`
`That's right, I...`
`...am fighting......only to be killed by Battler......`
`...I looked into Battler's eyes.`
`That which was reflected inside them...wasn't me.`
`......The figures of the little sister waiting for his return...and the family he had to bring back were reflected in those eyes.`
`To him, my existence is already...not even that of an individual.`
`...Obviously.`
` From the very beginning, he has been trying to deny the individual that I am.`
`......Yes, ...that last game...`
`sure was fun...`
`I was only tricking him a bit, `
`...but for just a short period of time, it felt like we understood each other, ...and that was fun...`
`...That's right, `
`...I should've made my move then...`
`I should have continued for eternity with Battler still totally fooled...`
`'!s1`
`...that's just no good, right...?`
`......That...`
`just wouldn't be true victory......`
`"......Is this...checkmate?`
` Beatrice?"`
`Beato had been run through with several blue stakes, skewered over and over to the ground while still standing.`
`Because of that, she wasn't even able to fall over,`
` ......and, still looking up into the sky, ...was sewn in place...`
`That tragic form...`
`might have been a fitting end for the cruel witch who had endlessly toyed with 18 people's lives and who had killed constantly for hundreds and thousands of years.`
`Gently, ...as though someone was mourning over something, ...rain began to fall.`
`...Amid that rain, Beato was soaked...and crucified...`
`"...Is it over, Beato?"`
`'!s1`
`...even let out a squeak......"`
`"Not yet.`
` You aren't a woman who'll let things end with just this."`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, bea_9e558:`
`...ridiculous...`
`  ......How can you look at this...`

`"......Hoh...`
` ......So you would expose me...to even further shame...?`
` Isn't it settled already...?"`
`"Stand up.`
` Our brawl still isn't over."`
`"......Not over, ...you say......?"`
`"That just now wasn't you losing.`

` And...`
`I won't let you run away."`
`"............"`
`"Just who are you?`
` And what in the world is it that you want?"`
`If you want to know, ...why don't you just try your favorite move...?`

`an illusion...`
` Isn't that...`

`"............"`
`"I'll break through you.`
` How could I let you run away like this?"`
`"............"`
`"I won't let you run back to the darkness of illusions while you're still all hazy like this.`
` ......I'll break through you.`
` Completely.`
` So stand up.`
` Don't act all frail like that!`
` You're still hiding several moves!`
` I can tell!"`
`".........Why...won't you just let me escape...?"`
`"Dad, Mom, and Ange.`
` All the cousins and all the relatives.`
` And all the servants.`
` You toyed with them so much and killed them...!!`
` I definitely won't forget, won't forgive that inhumanity!"`
`"I can still feel...Ange's arms on my shoulders...!!`
` I won't forgive your inhumanity...!!`
` So I won't let you get away like this...!!!"`
`Battler's eyes burned with the flames of hatred...`
`...The time had long since passed during which pitiful behavior would have earned his compassion.`
`...After being tricked once, Battler will never sympathize with me again.`
`'!s1`
`......this is like the boy who cried wolf, isn't it......?`
`......What am I supposed to do......?`
` ......What should I do......?`
`...Is fighting endlessly only to avoid admitting defeat...a fitting endless torture for the Endless Witch?`
`......Is endlessly harassing Battler, to avoid giving him victory, ...also part of being the Endless Witch......?`
`'!s1`
`......Is this...`
`...what the Endless Magic is......?`
`I've...`
`...had enough......`
`I've...`
`...had enough...`
`...of endlessly being toyed with......`
`by witches...`
`I will have no victory...and no tie.`
`...In that case, there's only one result that can release me.`
`...Hmph, ...hahahahahahaha...`
`Since the time I succumbed to the path of witches.`
`Since the day I made that contract with demons.`
`......It was promised that I would meet my end through tragedy, was it not......?`
`"What's wrong?!!`
` Golden Witch, Beatrice!!`
` If you are the ruler of Rokkenjima, show me a majesty fitting for that, even at the very eeeeeeeeeeeeennddd!!!"`
`Lightning.`
`...The world was smashed with white.`
`......Fitting last moments...for the ruler of Rokkenjima.`
`Haha, ......hahhahahahahahahahaha......`
`"Hahhahahahahaha, ...wahhahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!!"`
`"............"`
`Still pierced by the blue stakes, ...Beato faced the rainy sky and let out a cry of laughter.`
`Then, she slowly raised her face...and stared at Battler.`
`"......Fool.`
` ...Just when I was about to praise your good fight and hand over victory...`
` ......You shall regret that pride..."`
`"This isn't something for you to hand over.`
` I'm gonna take it from you!!`
` The same goes for you, right?!!`
` You could never accept an easygoing victory where I just say 'Maybe witches existing isn't so bad'... Isn't that the very reason you intentionally fell apart like that at the end last time...?!!!`
` That's right, last game, you took pity on me just once, didn't you?!!"`
`"So now I'll pay back that debt! Stand!!!`
` My enemy, my Golden Witch, Beatrice!!!"`
`"Hahhahaha...`
` Fool.`
` ......You foooooooooooool, hhahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` You simpleton...!!`
` You think you'll get another chance?!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!"`
`When Beato yelled, the blue stakes that had pierced her chest blew to bits and disappeared.`
`...However, the blue wedge that had pierced her foot in the very beginning did not vanish.`
`"You can't pull it out yet.`
` You can't pull out the blue truth of the 18th person X...!!"`
`"I will respond to one thing you told me to repeat.`
` As you reasoned,`
` #ff0000Kinzo is already dead at the starting time for all games!#ffffff`
` However, this means that you can take one person out!!`
` #ff0000Before now, I have proclaimed that no more than 18 humans exist on this island.`
` I will lower that by one for Kinzo!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000No more than 17 humans exist on this island!!`
` That excludes any 18th person.`
` In short, this 18th person X does not exist!!`
` This applies to all games!!!#ffffff"`
`"What do you know?`
` Looks like you're still hiding some pretty crazy stuff up your sleeve after all...`
` The island, which had no more than 17 humans on it, has been set up to appear as though there were 18.`
` Taking one off makes it 17, so we've finally reached the correct number.`
` ......This way, the wedge I knocked into you has been removed.`
` We'll have to start the fight over, back from square one...!"`
`The blue wedge that had sewn Beato in place broke apart.`
`......There was no longer anything piercing her.`
`The scars on her body had disappeared completely.`
`There stood, ...just as Battler had hoped for, ...the figure of the majestic Golden Witch who ruled Rokkenjima.`
`"...Then come, Battler.`
` Once more from the beginning.`
` Try and break through everything with the blue truth.`
` I too will no longer play, run, or hide."`
`"If you are worthless, then I shall end this match right here, right now.`
` With my grand victory, I'll make you regret your refusal to compromise for all eternity!!!`
` Come, starting from the first game!"`
`"Right!!`
` From the first twilight of the first game!!`
` #5decffThere's nothing strange about the murder of the six relatives that were found in the gardening shed at the start!`
` The crime was possible for any of those who didn't have an alibi!!#ffffff"`
`"Valid.`
` Continue, what about the next closed room murder, with Eva and Hideyoshi?!`
` Even the chain was set for that closed room!`
` I shall add to the red truth.`
` #ff0000Both deaths were homicides!`
` It is not the case that, after the construction of the closed room, one of them committed suicide after committing murder!`
` Furthermore, the murder was carried out with both the victim and the perpetrator in the same room!`
` No method exists for the perpetrator to commit murder from outside the room!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffSuppose that the culprit was a human without an alibi.`
` In other words, the dead!`
` We weren't able to identify some of the first six corpses because of their smashed faces.`
` Maybe one was actually a disguised corpse, and culprit X killed those two after making us think they were a victim and hiding away!`
` Then, after the closed room murder was constructed, the culprit hid under the bed and waited for all of us to come and leave!!#ffffff"`
`"Very well, next!`
` Kanon was killed in the boiler room, correct?`
` I shall add to the red truth.`
` #ff0000All of the survivors have alibis!`
` Let us include the dead as well!!`
` In short, no kind of human or dead person on the island could have killed Kanon!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffIf no one could kill him, then he might've been the one to kill!!`
` Kanon-kun might've killed himself.#ffffff"`
`"Repeat it!`
` 'Kanon-kun did not commit suicide'!"`
`"#ff0000Kanon did not commit suicide#ffffff."`
`"One more.`
` Repeat it, 'Kanon-kun's death was a homicide'."`
`"I refuse to repeat it."`
`"By that refusal, it may be possible to view it as a homicide, but you've already proclaimed in red that no one could've killed him.`
` In other words, it wasn't a homicide.`
` This is the same as the linked closed rooms from the third game."`
`"#5decffKanon-kun died for a reason that was neither suicide nor homicide.`
` The details are unknown, but he died due to an accident.#ffffff"`
`"#5decffBecause of the Devil's Proof, I refuse to explain what kind of blunder could've led to an accidental death where a stake was driven into his chest!!#ffffff"`
`"Hohoh, now that you have borrowed the power of demons, you are without peer!`
` It is valid!"`
`"In that case, what about the murders after that in the parlor, of Genji, Nanjo, and Kumasawa?!`
` Naturally, `
`#ff0000Maria, who was in the same room, did not kill them!`
` And of course, their three deaths were homicides!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffWe can explain those murders with culprit X, who hid away using an unidentified corpse.`
` After all, those three had their faces smashed.`
` It's completely possible that one of them was a body-double corpse!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000I guarantee the identities of all unidentified corpses.`
` Therefore, there were no body double tricks!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffThen you can explain it with simultaneous murders.`
` Each of them had a gun, pointed it clockwise, and blew each others' faces off at the same time!`
` After that, Maria collected those guns and hid them!!#ffffff`
` How about that?!!!"`
`"What?! ...What a ridiculous argument!!!`
` H-How amusing...!!`
` Then what about Natsuhi in the end?!"`
`"I shall add to the red truth!`
` #ff0000Natsuhi's death was a homicide!`
` There were no unidentified corpses, and all of the survivors have alibis!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffYou can explain it with an indirect murder due to trap X!`
` Something was done to Aunt Natsuhi's gun.`
` It could have been a trap gun, built to send a bullet right into the forehead of anyone who tried to hold it up and shoot it!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000The bullet buried into Natsuhi's forehead was not fired from her gun!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffIt's possible that Aunt Natsuhi was lured out by that letter, whose contents were unknown!`
` She was called out into the hall.`
` Then, she was forced to stand at a specified location at a specified time and murdered by trap X, which used a gun that had been installed there beforehand!!#ffffff"`
`"Wonderful!!`
` These reckless arguments of yours are even starting to feel pleasurable now!`
` Out of respect, I shall hand the first game over to you...!!`
` Well done!!`
` ......Gaaaah!!!"`
`The instant Beato acknowledged her defeat in the first game,`
` the stakes of the blue truth once again pierced her chest, letting out a terrible sound...`
`"...Ku, ...gwah, ......gaaaaaahhh!!!`
` This is still...hardly painful, ...and it's not over yet!!`
` Come, now for the second game!!"`
`Beato just barely pulled out the stakes that had pierced her chest,`
` ...but even though there was no hole left behind, she still seemed to be bearing a deep wound that was letting out a massive amount of blood.`
`And, she was tormented by an equally fierce pain...`
`But Beato grinned, grinding her teeth, and pushed for the next game to start.`
`But I won't feel sympathy for her.`
`...Just by her existing there, we've been killed and harassed over and over,`
` ......and Ange's been burdened with a future of isolation...!!`
`"Correct, just by my being here and laughing, this eternal hell will continue...!!`
` I won't give your little sister back...!`
` Let her cry over the family that shall not return for the next thousand years...!!"`
`"Damn iiiiiiiiiittt!!`
` No compassion, no mercy! On to the second game!!`
` I'll start with the first crime!`
` Right after it happened, I penetrated to the truth of the closed room murder where the six were killed in the chapel.`
` #5decffSomeone secretly borrowed Maria's key...and secretly returned it to Maria's bag after the crime was over!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000From the time Maria received her key to the instant Rosa unsealed the envelope the next day, the key passed through no one's hands!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffThat door might've had an auto-lock, just like Gramps' study.`
` In other words, it was unlocked before the crime, with a rock or something wedged in so that it couldn't close completely.`
` Then, someone gave the key to Maria.`
` The lock was automatic, so it's possible to make a theory where the key wasn't needed!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000There were no doors with auto-locks other than Kinzo's study!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffThe victims locked the door from the inside.`
` One of the six was the culprit, and this person killed the other five, then pretended to be dead!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000The six were already dead by the time they were discovered!`
` All of their deaths were homicides!`
` All six were genuine victims and did not take part in a mutual murder!`
` There was no simultaneous murder!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffThere were people, Kumasawa-san in particular, who had no alibi at the time.`
` If we assume that someone was hiding on the inside, then we've got no problems!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000There was no one hiding in the chapel.`
` Therefore, the shut-in murder you suggest does not work!#ffffff`
` What's wrong, is that all, Ushiromiya Battleer?!`
` It's not so easy once you get to the second game, riiiight?!"`
`It was a thundering exchange of red and blue truth.`
`The stakes and wedges of blue truth that I sent flying attacked one after the other, and Beato cut them down one after another with her red truth, her red treasured sword, knocking them down.`
`But the blood she'd lost from the first game was probably serious.`
`This intense exercise was putting an even greater strain on her.`
`I could also see her breath grow ragged.`
`That's why I can't hold back now!`
`...I'll corner that witch!`
`This time I'll break through her!`
`"Not yet, aah, it's useless, it's all useless!!`
` My twisted logic isn't finished yet!!`
` Then what about this?!!"`
`"#5decffThe food they were given had small bombs in it, which exploded from inside their stomachs.`
` In other words, the crime was possible through trap X!`
` The exact nature of bombs they could swallow without noticing and which could also blow open their stomachs is a Devil's Proof!`
` I refuse to explain!!#ffffff"`
`"Pfft, hhahahahahahahhahahahhaha!!`
` What the hell's thaaaaaaaaat?!`
` Small bommmmmmmbs?!`
` Waahhahahahahhahhahha!!"`
`But Beato failed to knock down the blue wedge as it flew at an angle like a breaking pitch.`
`It let out a loud *thunk*...and gouged itself deep into her left shoulder.`
`However, even as the breaking pitch hit her, her laughter didn't seem to be stopping.`
`...Yeah, I get it, even I think that theory's pretty screwed up...!!`
`"Hah, laugh as much as you want!!`
` Got a problem with that?!!"`
`"None!!`
` Quite a pleasurable, reckless argument!!!`
` Next up is the closed room with Jessica and Kanon!"`
`"No problems there!`
` #5decffIf the culprit was one of the servants, they could've used a master key.`
` It's not even a closed room!#ffffff"`
`"After that, there was an attack in the servant room from a mystery person who seemed to be Kanon, and Nanjo and Kumasawa were killed, right?!`
` I had already proclaimed Kanon's death in red before that time.`
` So, who was that Kanon?!"`
`"#5decffIf Kanon-kun's death was proclaimed with the red, there's no way he was alive.`
` Therefore, there's a chance that the one who attacked that group was in a disguise that made everyone mistakenly think it was Kanon-kun!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000They would never mistakenly think any other person was Kanon!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffThen, just like the heredity of Kinzo's name, there's a possibility that Kanon's name was inherited by someone.`
` You could suppose that Kanon-kun was killed, a different person succeeded that name, and that this person attacked them!!#ffffff"`
`A sound like a watermelon being squashed rang out, and a blue wedge was buried deep into Beato's left flank...`
`Maybe it hit in a bad place, since it seemed to be really effective.`
`After leaning over and moaning for a while, `
`...she laughed it off as though trying to make it seem like no big deal.`
`Yeah, I get it.`
`That must've hurt a lot...!!`
`"Hyahhaaaaaaaahhh!!`
` Once again, you've set up some Human as the culprit as if it were nothing!!`
` You truly are gabbing on about things you'd never be able to open your mouth and say on the game board!!"`
`"And yet it's valid!`
` That reckless argument is pleasurable!!`
` ...Truly pleasurable.`
` ......This isn't pain, ...it's pleeeeeeasure!!"`
`When Beato howled, the wedge that had pierced her was blasted away.`
`But the wound remained, and she continued to be tormented by a fierce pain.`
`"You ready? I'll keep going.`
` My blue truth for the last murder in the second game, the three who died in Aunt Natsuhi's room, should still be valid even with the 18th person X denied!`
` Do you have a counterargument for that in red?!`
` If you don't, the second game is all mine too!"`
`"No, I don't!!`
` Fighting over such trivial matters bores me!!`
` I'll give it to you, I'll give you the second game!!`
` Gwaaaaaaaaagghghh!!!!`
` ......Fff, ...gwooooooooooohhhh......!!"`
`The instant she acknowledged her loss in the second game, two blue stakes gouged through Beato's chest this time...!`
`The witch's lungs were gouged, as were her intestines.`
`Her face twisted in anguish.`
`Her body twisted as she gasped in pain.`
`"Does it hurt...?"`
`"Huuuuurt?`
` ...No, no, this just tickles.`
` Uhhyahhyahyahyahhyaaaaaaahhh!!`
` ...At least compared to having your entire body torn to bits and turned into a pile of scrap meat, like your sisteeeeeeeer!`
` I'll make you scrap meat too, then you siblings can be all mixed together like ground beef and pork, *giggle*giggle*, kyahaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"Ahh, ...aaaaaarrrrrrrrggggh!!`
` I'll beat you to death, I'll tear you to bits the same way!!`
` Next!`
` The third game!!`
` How long are you gonna sit around, all worn out like that?!!`
` I've only just started knocking you down to hell!!"`
`"...Guh...gah, ...aaaaaaagghhh!!`
` Naturally, as if something like this could wear me down!"`
`"You're right. We're still just getting started!`
` Come, let us begin the third game, starting with the six linked closed rooms!`
` You supposedly did penetrate this closed room at the time.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` But then you ~ib~killed off Kinzo~ib~...!!"`
`At the time, I theorized that Gramps was the culprit,`
` and that after killing the other five and stringing the keys across each room, he'd constructed his own closed room in the boiler room...`
`...And that there, he'd died in an accident while carrying out some kind of scheme, burning to death in the boiler.`
`But now I've declared that Gramps was already dead.`
`So I've denied my own theory myself, ironically enough...!`
`However-`
`"There's no problem!`
` #5decffPlenty of people besides Gramps could've committed the crime!`
` You could even claim that all the adults holding the family conference were in on it!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000All five master keys were discovered, each in the pocket of one of the servants!`
` The individual room keys were found inside envelopes alongside the corpses!`
` In short, all keys related to the linked closed rooms were locked inside the linked closed rooms!!`
` No key could have been returned from outside the room using the crack of the door, the crack of the window, vents or any place of the sort!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffThen they were killed with poison gas!`
` Even if a key couldn't pass through, gas could, right?!`
` The murder was carried out from outside the closed room!!#ffffff"`
`"#ff0000All of them had what appeared to be gunshot wounds that were fatal!`
` Murdering them from outside the room would have been impossible!!`
` I shall say more with the red!`
` When the five other than Kinzo were killed, the killer was definitely in the same room as them!`
` I already proclaimed in red at the time that there were no suicides!!#ffffff"`
`"#5decffAfter the murder of each person in their respective rooms, the culprit created a linked closed room.`
` But the culprit had no way to return just the key to the very last room.`
` And yet, they were able to do it.`
` After all, the first person to discover a corpse just had to pretend to find the key and pull it from the pocket of one of the corpses!!#ffffff"`
`She couldn't fully block the retort of that blue stake...!`
`Beato was pushed back by the blue wedges that were unleashed on her one after another, finally failed to block one, and once again took a severe wound.`
`"Nnnn, nnnnggg, ...gyaaaaaahhh!!"`
`As she howled in pain, she pulled out the blue wedge that had pierced her right arm.`
`...Beato's entire body had been torn apart and pierced with blue wedges, stakes, and blades, over and over again,`
` and now she was totally covered in blood.`
`But even so, Beato grinned.`
`Cackling as though this was amusing...!`
`"Fuhhahhahhaaaaaaahhh!!`
` How could a man who promised to bring Ange's parents home voice a theory where those parents are culprits?"`
`"Splendid, even that's just fine, riiiiiiight?`
` Go be a big, happy family getting their hands dirty with mass murder,`
` then return to Ange stained with blood that will never come oooooooooff!!`
` How could we expect anything less from the people who returned alive from the witch's islaaaaaaaaaand?`
` Just what that mincemeat Ange neeeeeeeeeeeeeds, hyahhaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!"`
`"Aaaaaarrrrgggghhh, shut uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuupp!!`
` I'll kill you!!`
` I'll tear you apart!!`
` No need to waste your time begging for your life, I'll definitely give you the worst kind of death by my own hands!!"`
`"Yes, you probably could do it...!!`
` I've explored the depths of cruelty for over a thousand years, and you probably will gift me with a fitting end for all that...!!"`
`"Ooh, does that hurt?`
` Is it harsh?`
` Or does it ticckklllllleee?!"`
`"Is that supposed to torment me, come on, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeer, there are still mysteries leeeeeeeeeeeeft!!"`
`Beato had already countered my first powerful move, the 18th person X,`
` by making the number of people on the island 17.`
`But just limiting the number of people to 17 didn't overturn the theory that Aunt Eva was the culprit.`
`I can crush most of the murders in the third game this way...!`
`Blood dripped from all over the body of the Golden Witch...`
`I cornered her, this time thoroughly without mercy.`
`This isn't a game played to decide who wins and who loses.`
`...Yeah, we aren't playing.`
`Even the time I spend playing and fighting like this...delays my trip home.`
`In her isolation, Ange will continue to have her heart torn apart by loneliness and sadness...!`
`I have to go back to Ange as fast as I can!!`
`"......You're all worn out.`
` Standing at death's door, are you?"`
`"...*cackle*cackle*`
` ...It still...doesn't burden me...`
` ...Something like this......!`
` ...*cackle*cackle* It tickles...!!"`
`"It looks like you don't need any mercy."`
`"I never asked for it in the first place."`
`"I'm going all out."`
`"Do so.`
` When our roles were reversed, I showed no mercy.`
` So you ought to do the same when given the chance."`
`"Otherwise, I'll summon another isolated Ange from a different world,`
` and this time, I'll tear off her arms and legs, stick her with a spear and roast her, okaaaaaaayyy??`
` Uhhyahhaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!"`
`"Shut uuuuuuuuuuup!!`
` Never again!!`
` Not my family!`
` Not my relatives!`
` Not any of the servants!!`
` I won't let you make them your playthings!!"`
`"...I've already broken through all of the mysteries in the fourth game with the blue truth.`
` ......The only one left is the very last one from the third game.`
` ...Only the murder of Doctor Nanjo."`
`"...Oho, ...have I already been cornered so far...?`
` ...*cackle*cackle* What a precarious state I'm in...`
` ...Iiihhihhihhihhi, ...ghagh, *cough*cough*!`
`"`
`She coughed violently, spitting up blood.`
`...Her insides had been punched through so many times.`
`It was only natural.`
`"In other words, the mystery of Doctor Nanjo's murder is the last line of defense for you being a witch, right...?"`
`"......As you say.`
` If you defeat that, it will mean that all of my mysteries have been defeated.`
` ......Unless I counter one of your truths with some new red truth...or present a new mystery,`
` I...will die."`
`".........`
`...You don't look like someone who's been pushed into a corner, standing on the brink.`
` ...You still have some kind of hidden pitch up your sleeve, right...?"`
`"Well, who knows...?`
` I have already tired of a too-long life after a thousand years...!`
` I've started to think that having this life ended by a rival like you, whom I stumbled upon at the very end, ...might not be so bad."`
`"*cackle*cackle* You can do it, can't you?`
` Do it.`
` ...I beg you, kill meeeeeeeee.`
` I'm always the one killing, and I've never had the experience of being kiiiiiilled!"`
`"I've killed the 18 of you hundreds of times, but I haven't been killed myself even once,`
` so I wanted to experience it just once myseeeeeeeeelf, hehihihihihihihihi!!"`
`It was a graceless show of boldness, unchanged from before.`
`...But blood dripped from her mouth, her once beautiful dress was covered with holes,`
` and blood poured from all over her body, making her physical appearance stand in sharp contrast to her attitude.`
`Maybe the shot she'd taken to the flank was still tormenting her,`
` since she was still pressing down on it unconsciously, without a trace of grace.`
`...But I've got no time for pity.`
`As long as I feel sympathy for this witch, my family and I won't be released from this place.`
`...Until I defeat her, we won't be able to go home...!!`
`In the outside world, it may be possible for even enemies to understand each other when circumstances change.`
`But pure evil does exist.`
`Evil that brings misfortune just by existing...and is to be spared no compromise.`
`Just by its continued existence alone, ......it's evil!!`
`"I don't pity you.`
` Just like how you didn't show pity for any of us...!"`
`"......Well, of course.`
` All of you are just pieces in the game!`
` It's just unbelievably fun to think about which six to kill in the beginning, how to kill the next two, `
`and whether I can find a much, much more grotesque method of murder, you seeeeeeeeeee??"`
`"Hey, Battler, I've reformed a little, so forgive me this time too.`
` If you do, I'll change my methods of killing into something a little better, okay?`
` I'll listen to how you want them to be killed and in what order, got iiiiiiit?"`
`"It's so fun, toying with people's liiiiiiiiives!!`
` I'm sure you could think of a way to turn Ange into a pile of scrap meat much, much more thoroughlyyyyyy!!`
` Come, Battleeeeeer!!`
` Try to expose the truth of Nanjo's murdeeeeeeeeeeeer!!"`
`The 18th person X has been defeated.`
`But I won't give in...!!`
`I'll stop that witch's breathing cold!!`
`The end of the third game.`
`It was announced in red that the survivors at that point in time--Battler, Eva, Jessica,`
` and Nanjo--were all uninvolved with Nanjo's murder.`
`And it was also proclaimed that he was murdered directly, by someone before his eyes.`
`All other people had the strongest possible alibi...by having their deaths proclaimed in red...`
`......I'll...break through this, without using the 18th person X...!`
`Think, don't stop thinking...!!`
`Her red doesn't only bind me, it's also supposed to be her weak point...!`
`I've got to somehow use it against her......!`
`'!s0`
`...there's still a gap...!`
`Yeah, ...this way, I can break through it.`
`This way, Beatrice's legend of the witch is finished.`
`"...True, the others probably were dead.`
` #5decffHowever, their deaths were not proclaimed in red at the instant Doctor Nanjo died.`
` Strictly speaking, it was in the fight between me and EVA after Doctor Nanjo's corpse was found.`
` In other words, if someone was alive at the time Doctor Nanjo was killed, and then died before EVA made that proclamation, you can sew right through that crack!!`
` In other words, it's like this.#ffffff"`
`"#5decffSomeone who was first confirmed dead by EVA's proclamation was a culprit.`
` They cleverly played dead earlier and waited for us to come and go...!`
` Before their death was announced in red, we were made to think that they'd died.`
` Then, they killed Doctor Nanjo...and later died for some reason!`
` After that, EVA proclaimed their death in red!!#ffffff`
` That theory can explain Doctor Nanjo's case!!"`
`"How's that, Beatrice?!"`
`When he forcefully asked that question, ...there was a terrible sound that could only be likened to that of a compressor,`
` and a blue stake that was as thick as a log...`
`appeared from under the earth and skewered the Golden Witch, Beato, pulling her up into the air...`
`Ugly tearing sounds rang out,`
` and each time, ...a blue stake or wedge would appear and pierce Beatrice's body.`
`...When that finally ended...`
`Her tragic form was exposed there, pincushioned by more than ten stakes and wedges all over her body and dripping with blood, ...dangling and crucified...`
`...There was none of the dignity of the brutal witch who had sneered at the honor of the dead and toyed with and killed hundreds of the living.`
`The rain, which had started falling at some point, ...quietly tormented the crucified witch...`
`As Battler heaved with his breathing, he waited for some kind of answer from the Golden Witch...`
`...Although it wasn't long, `
`it took the witch a bit of time to show any signs of life...`
`"......It hurts...`
` ...It huuurts......"`
`"...You got...what you...deserved.`
` ...Now you can experience a portion of the pain felt by all those you've killed..."`
`Even as he said that, it seemed Battler had lost a little of his momentum at this extremely pathetic sight.`
`...Even if it was an enemy,`
` he couldn't look straight at a woman exposed in such a brutal fashion.`
`But even so, ......unless he destroyed Beatrice,`
` this battle...wouldn't end...`
`'!s1`
`......I beg you......`
`...hic..."`
`Huh...?`
`...Beato let out a sob...`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, bea_9e797:`
`...huuuurts......`
` ......End it...`
` ......End it......`
` ...Even with this, I still...`
`...can't die...`
`hic...`
` ......Even though it hurts so much, `
`......I still...`
`...can't die......`
`......hic...!"`
`'!s1`
`...asking...`
`...of me...?"`
`"......End it......`
` ......Release me......from this pain......"`
`Beato's expression...was soaked with blood and tears.`
`Battler certainly had been tricked by her at one point.`
`...So he was probably able to suspect that her expression...that even her tears were an act.`
`However, ......Battler...believed in those tears.`
`......After all, those tears...`
`had the red of truth mixed in with them.`
`"...What should I do?`
` What can I do to end your pain...?"`
`'!s1`
`...expose...everything.`
` ......This is...`
`......my...`
`heart."`
`"...Your heart......"`
`"......ll...me."`
`"......Beato..."`
`'!s1`
`...ll`
`...me...`
` ......Just...`
`...let...`
`me...`
`die......`
`...hic, `
`......nngaaaahhhh......"`
`Were those tears from pain and torment, ...or else...`
`Either way, that pathetic expression...`
`was painful for Battler to look at, even after burning with such anger...`
`"...Quickly, ......go back...to...Ange......"`
`"I'll listen to your request.`
` Not so that I can go back, ...but to end your pain."`
`'!s1`
`ou... `
`......Battleeer......`
`...nnnngggggg..."`
`In her last breaths, Beato summoned up all of her remaining strength...`
`and managed to close both of her hands into fists...`
`A red light began to gather at those fists.`
`'!s0`
`......as though appealing to the heavens for something...`
`"...You'll......be able to kill me...`
` ......All of me...`
` ...My heart......`
` ......Crush it.`
` ......Pierce it.`
` ......Okay...?"`
`The red light around both her arms gradually began to strengthen...`
`"......Ple...a......"`
`After saying that much, ...her face tilted to the side a bit.`
`Then, her right arm lost its light and flopped down.`
`...But her left arm alone did not lose its light...and remained held out towards the heavens.`
`Then, ......before Battler's eyes,`
` another Beato appeared with a faint form, transparent like a curtain.`
`...The crucified Beato had already lost consciousness.`
`'!s0`
`...her eyes expressionless, `
`......and spoke.`
`"......`
`#ff0000Ushiromiya Battler.`
` I will now...kill you.#ffffff"`
`"......And...?"`
`"......`
`#ff0000And right now,`
` there is no one other than you on this island.`
` The only one alive on this island is you.`
` Nothing outside the island can interfere.#ffffff"`
`...I...understand.`
`This is...`
`the 'last mystery' Beatrice will be able to make as a witch.`
`She's...trying to offer it to me.`
`Entreating me...to solve this final mystery...`
`and kill her...`
`"Do it......`
` I'll accept...your final mystery."`
`"......#ff0000You are all alone on this island.`
` And of course, I am not you.`
` Yet I am here, now, and am about to kill you.#ffffff"`
`"Like a souped up version of Doctor Nanjo's murder...`
` ......So...?"`
`"......Who...aaam I...?"`
`"Is that......your final question?"`
`'!s1`
`aaam I......?"`
`Then, ...Beatrice slowly approached me and, still expressionless, ......held me...`
`......Yeah, I get it, Beato.`
`I'll......kill you, don't worry......`
`I also...slowly held her head.`
`......Then I, as a piece,`
` left the game board...`
`'!sd`
`@`
`A fork was stuck into a shortcake peeking out of a gift box, `
`and there were decanters with drinks of various colors lined up on a side table.`
`But the color of the partially finished drink that had been poured into a cup was venomous, matching none of the decanters.`
`Someone had probably been playing around, mixing various things together.`
`That can be lots of fun, if you don't mind the taste.`
`On top of the fluffy bed were several colorful, big pillows like something from a dream.`
`And on this bed that looked like something out of a child's dream world,`
` Bernkastel lay face down, `
`and Lambdadelta lay face up, clutching a pillow and relaxing...`
`"Ahhahahhahhahha, it was pretty thrilling this time, wasn't it?`
` I got reeeally panicky when Beato said she'd stop the game."`
`".........What a rude witch, to start a game like this and try to end it by throwing it away."`
`"Wasn't Ange a good piece?`
` After Beato ran for it, Ange dragged her back and made her resume the game.`
` Although it's a shame that she gave Battler a little too much enthusiasm."`
`"......After all, I knew Battler was a softy."`
`"No kidding.`
` He looked like he might even go easy on Beato, his enemy."`
`"......I was uneasy that, like the last game, he might actually feel compassion for Beato and take the game in a weird direction.`
` ......Ange was a trump card to get Battler back on track when he mistook his goal.`
` ......Although I wanted her to support him a bit more before using her up.`
` She really did get used right off the bat.`
` What a waste for a piece that required so much preparation."`
`"Hehheheheh!`
` Good thing I shackled her with that rule about not giving her name!`
` If that hadn't been set up, the brother-sister tag team would've swallowed Beato up and won in the blink of an eye."`
`"......I thought it'd be a chance for them to press her all at once, `
`but your mark was so restrictive that I couldn't make the best use of her.`
` ...Aaah, what a waste that piece was."`
`"Isn't it obvious that such an unfair piece would have to be retired right away?`
` Well, in the end, she did a good job of preventing the suspension of the game, and that helps me out too.`
` The way she made both our interests match is what made her a truly wonderful piece."`
`"......She was an innocent kid like Battler, so it was easy to get her to do as I said.`
` ......Morons and impulsive types make the best pieces.`
` ...Aaah, I really can't stand losing that piece."`
`"By now, that kid's minced meat!`
` Hey, let's make hamburgers out of her later on☆`
` Oh wait, didn't you like gyoza more?`
` I wonder what little sister tastes like, *giggle*, hilarious!"`
`".........Is it really okay for you to be so relaxed?`
` Thanks to Ange, Battler has gotten all fired up.`
` I'm pretty sure he's started a hot pursuit of Beato, making this game take a big turn in my favor, right...?`
` I mean, didn't Battler just solve almost all the mysteries up until now?"`
`"Huuh?`
` Nooot even close!`
` Almost all of Battler's blue truth was wrong!`
` Beato's lukewarm red is full of holes.`
` If she had any brains in her, she'd slip through it easily by setting up a suitable web of twisted logic.`
` ...Yeah, it really ticks me off.`
` If it were me, I'd thoroughly cut down all of it with the red."`
`"......Oh, really?`
` And I was sure that those were all correct.`
` ...Well, I don't know about that small bomb part though."`
`"Not all of Battler's blue truths were valid.`
` ...When talking about the first game, Beato clearly declared that `
`#ff0000she guaranteed the identities of all unidentified corpses#ffffff!`
` This defeats Battler's theory about the culprit of the Eva/Hideyoshi closed room murder being someone who faked up a corpse."`
`"Next, Kanon might've died in an accident in the boiler room, but...*giggle*!`
` What kind of accident could drive a stake into his chest?`
` Are you a moron?`
` I'll slice it with that red treasured sword thing."`
`"#ff0000Kanon did not die in an accident!#ffffff`
` For the next one, the murders of the three including Genji in the parlor, the thought that it was a simultaneous murder where they shot each other in a clockwise pattern at the same time is laughable.`
` #ff0000Genji, Kumasawa, and Nanjo are not killers#ffffff!"`
`"The final trap X to kill Natsuhi was also ridiculous.`
` #ff0000The thing that shot Natsuhi wasn't a trap, it was a real shooting murder with a gun raised and trigger pulled!#ffffff`
` *giggle* Sucks for you...!"`
`"...You shouldn't do that.`
` Saying something like that in red.`
` That kid's trying to say that she bounced Natsuhi's bullet back with magic and killed her."`
`"Ohohohoh, oh my, how terrible of me, you're right...!`
` Even the blue truth for the second game was way too naive.`
` #ff0000When the six were murdered in the chapel, the culprit was inside the chapel!#ffffff`
` That guy keeps trying to explain things using trap X.`
` What the heck is trap X, some weird mystery novel cliche?"`
`"It's also laughable to say that, in the case where Nanjo and Kumasawa were killed in the servant room, someone else inherited Kanon's name.`
` #ff0000No one else can go by Kanon's name!`
` A different person can't claim that as their name!#ffffff"`
`"And that theory about borrowing the master key from Rosa for Natsuhi's room is also worthless!`
` #ff0000After the master keys came into Rosa's control, never did any of them leave her hands!`
` Except for the time when she lent one to Battler to unlock Natsuhi's room.#ffffff`
` I can keep on going, but just taking a quick look at them turns out like this, get it?"`
`"......Forget taking a quick look, ...you've just denied Battler's blue truth for the first and second games across the board.`
` ......My, my, what a shame.`
` If Battler heard, he'd faint."`
`"...Right?`
` Beato wasn't cornered at all.`
` ......Looks like that kid's a pretty good actress after all.`
` I'm sure she planned to make it look like she was getting cornered this game,`
` and then sometime next game, *bang*, she'll slice it up with a single red stroke to make Battler freak."`
`"*giggle* And then I'm sure she'll say it again with a huge smile.`
` 'Witches neeever get into a pinch'!`
` Pff, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"......Then that whole tragic atmosphere as though Beato was getting cornered was all an act?"`
`"Isn't it obvious?!`
` She really is a great actress!`
` Even though she wasn't cornered at all, it felt like an astonishing, last-episode climax!`
` She's totally the winner for best supporting actress this year!!`
` Oh, but of course I'm the star!`
` You'd do fine too, Beeern!"`
`"......At the end, she said something like 'Kill me' and laid out a big riddle.`
` Wasn't that her last stand, with Beato to be finished for good if that riddle was solved?"`
`"*giggle*giggle*...!`
` Come on, were you seriously tricked too, Bern?`
` That wasn't even close to a last stand!`
` Beato's still holding back a killer hidden move.`
` ...When she stuck out both hands to give the final riddle, did you notice how she lowered just her right hand?"`
`"...Yeah, now that you mention it.`
` ......Is that what that meant?"`
`"Sure is!`
` That kid still had plenty of hidden moves left!`
` And none of the mysteries have been solved...!`
` That tension, like she'd been exposed and the next episode would be the last...`
` She truly is a genius at acting.`
` Yeah, I wanna see her knock Battler down to the very bottom right away!"`
`"That kid's been totally encouraged by her 'North Wind and the Sun Strategy' from last time, right?`
` I'm sure Battler will sympathize with Beato again and fall for it completely...!`
` After all, a single tear from a woman can fool a man, totally economical and profitable!!"`
`"......I wonder if Battler will get caught by the same move again.`
` I've got to spur him on so he never feels sympathy again.`
` ...Although Ange's mincemeat seems to have done that pretty well."`
`"A power-up from an Ange-flavored hamburger?`
` Ohhohohohohohoho!`
` Of course, I won't lose either.`
` Starting here, I'll thoroughly support Beato to rally her up enough to compete with Battler.`
` ...Beato won't lose.`
` I mean, I'm threatening her with a wonderful punishment game if she loses♪"`
`"......Your punishment games are seriously not cool, so you should go a little easy on her."`
`"I've decided what to do for your next punishment game, Bern.`
` Wanna hear? Wanna hear?"`
`"No."`
`"Come ooon, ask me☆`
` Guess what, guess what?`
` I'll lock you in a wonderful, wonderful castle.`
` That castle will be surrounded by pure white castle walls, 12 kilometers to a side.`
` With a height of 10 meters.`
` Magic and tricks are prohibited!`
` You really couldn't jump over that, right?"`
`"1,440,000,000 cubic meters?`
` ......You can stop there, I already know what you're going to say."`
`"Eheheheheh!`
` And that place will start getting buried with gems, one every day!`
` I'll lock you in it until the castle walls are packed with them, and you've been buried to death with gems.`
` Isn't that a wonderful, romantic punishment game?"`
`".........If you multiply the length of the walls by five and make it one tenth its current height, I wouldn't mind if you shut me in it right now."`
`"Really?!`
` That would make it 3,600,000,000 cubic meters, right?!`
` The time period for the punishment game would more than double, right?!`

`@:dwave_eng 0, lam_9e328:`
`Lambdadelta playfully approached Bernkastel, who yawned, looking bored, as she touched the bottom of Lambdadelta's chin as though cuddling a cat...`
`"You're betting on Battler's victory.`
` And I'm betting on an eternal tie for the two of them.`
` ......Doesn't that mean no one's betting on Beato's victory?"`
`".........I wouldn't.`
` Her chances of winning are zero."`
`"Ohohoh!`
` How truly pitiful, being told by the Witch of Miracles that there's no chance of a miracle!`
` Although I wouldn't bet on her either, right?`
` I can say that with certainty!"`
`"......It's also pretty sad when the Witch of Certainty says that you're certainly screwed."`
`Unusually for them, they giggled together...`
`"I wonder how this game will resolve itself..."`
`"......Yeah, that's the one thing we can't predict.`
` ...That's why it's fun."`
`"I won't permit escaping or suspensions any longer.`
` I'll certainly make them continue their game, and I won't let them run away...!`
` Even though I can't even imagine what will happen next,`
` I know it certainly won't end that way."`
`".........At the very least, it won't end with Beato's victory."`
`"I mean, think about it.`
` Neither of us `
`is betting on Beato's victory!`
` In other words, if it looks like Beato is gonna win, she'll have us two Great Witches as enemies...!"`
`"......Exactly.`
` Our powers are most in equilibrium when balancing between a tie and Battler's advantage.`
` If it tips too much in Beato's favor, both of us will line up along the same vector and drag Beato back."`
`"In other words, the instant Beato's in a superior position, ...she'll have to deal with both of us as enemies.`
` ......Ehheheheheh!`
` A common front with Bern, sounds fuuun♪"`
`"......Thanks.`
` ...But I'm not going into a konpeitou candy bath with you."`
`"Aaaw, and I was gonna cover you with melted marshmallows `
`while taking a konpeitou shower."`
`"......How pitiful.`
` That child is a living toy, a doll you caught so that you could play with me, Lambda."`
`"I'm good at playing with dolls.`
` ...I really can do it well, okay?`
` I'm proud of being able to play with a single toy for hundreds of years without getting tired of it."`
`"......You're her ally at some times and oppose her at others,`
` toying with her for all eternity.`
` ...How pitiful. That kid is now our doll."`
`"Hehheheh, that's right, that kid is our doll.`
` No end has been prepared for that kid except the ones the two of us desire.`
` In other words, I can say for sure that this can only end by repeating a tie for eternity because of me,`
` or else with Beato losing and being destroyed because of you, Bern.`
` ......Heheh, ...as far as this game ending with Beato's victory goes..."`
`"......I will proclaim it as the Witch of Miracles."`
`"Then I will proclaim it as the Witch of Certainty."`
`""Beato certainly cannot win.`
` And a miracle certainly will not occur.""`
`""Ahhahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!""`
`'!sd`
`@:dwave_eng 0, but_9e2:`
`"So just what happened?`
` Was that basically the 'bad ending', where time runs out before the culprit gets exposed?"`
`"Uu-.`
` Definitely a bad ending.`
` Uu-."`
`"That's right.`
` Beatrice's letter, which Maria-chan read on the first day, did tell us in advance to solve the riddle of the epitaph.`
` We were all so busy trying to protect ourselves and look for the culprit that we didn't even take a shot at it."`
`"...That's right.`
` If we had actually tried to solve the riddle, maybe things would have ended differently."`
`"I wonder about that.`
` Shannon-chan, you did a good job too!`
` You don't have to be our waitress and serve tea.`
` After all, this is a wrap party.`
` As a group of people who met a horrible fate, let's all get along and lick each other's wounds!`
` Licklicklick!!"`
`"Speaking of a horrible fate, Shannon beats the rest of us hands down, doesn't she?`
` She was such a beautiful character, so I thought she'd definitely survive until the very end, `
`but she was killed right in the beginning, and on top of that...what was it?`
` Half of her face was smashed, right?`
` That's the worst!"`
`"...That was my role, so, umm, ...there was no way around it..."`
`"...Nee-san, it's nothing for you to worry about.`
` Judging by the last epilogue, even Milady and the rest of them met an extremely tragic end."`
`"Ahahaha, ...it seems so.`
` I think I remember seeing this horrible picture, kind of like my entire body had been eaten apart and dismembered."`
`"Speaking of which, don't you think Kanon's last moments were the coolest?`
` Even though he had the tables turned on him, it was a showdown with the culprit, right?`
` It's a whole bunch better than our confusing last moments, right?"`
`"...Though, in the end, I was unable to get a solid hit in."`
`"Still, ...I think Kanon-kun's death was a big hint.`
` After all, because of that, the existence of the 19th person was made clear."`
`"That's right.`
` At that time, everyone's location was obvious.`
` So it was impossible for anyone other than some unknown 19th person to kill Kanon."`
`"Uu-!`
` I said it was Beatrice from the beginning, over and over.`
` Uu-!"`
`"...I don't wanna believe it, but that does prove the culprit was a witch calling herself Beatrice."`
`"That's right...`
` There were many strange things that happened...that a human couldn't do..."`
`"Uu-. Only a witch could do things like murdering Aunt Eva in that closed room.`
` A human couldn't do it!`
` Uu-!"`
`"...Not only is the existence of a 19th person clear, but it's also obvious that this person holds a power that humans can't even imagine."`
`"In that case, I don't think there's anything wrong with calling this person Beatrice."`
`"...We probably met at the very end.`
` ...Met with the Golden Witch."`
`"Like I kept saying, Beatrice exists.`
` It all went bad because no one ever believed.`
` Uu-!`
` Even one of her witch friends says that miracles won't occur if you don't believe.`
` Uu-!"`
`"That's right.`
` Beatrice-sama is generous to those who respect her."`
`"...It seems to me that Maria-sama was never a target of Beatrice-sama's wrath up to the very end, despite the horrible crimes that occurred one after another."`
`"Well, Maria believed in Beatrice from the very beginning.`
` ...But if that's the case, how do you explain why you and the rest were all killed? You guys believed in Beatrice just as much, right?"`
`"...Beatrice-sama probably had her reasons."`
`"If the song of the epitaph represented Beatrice-sama's resurrection ceremony, many sacrifices were needed.`
` ...He must simply have been designated to be one of those."`
`"...Shannon-chan, you met a horrible end...`
` At the very least, I wish your death could've been more peaceful and pretty."`
`"...Umm, well, ...it's not like it hurt...`
` Anyway,`
` right now, I'm perfectly fine, so don't worry."`
`After seeing him stroke Shannon's cheek, which had been crushed during the story, everyone laughed out loud, smiling.`
`"Well, it feels a bit weird saying this, ...but I was sure this story would fit into the standard mystery genre.`
` I'm a bit surprised to find out that it's a fantasy.`
` After all, a Western mansion shut away from the outside world on an isolated island, with an inheritance problem on everyone's minds... It sounds just like a typical mystery novel to me."`
`"...Uu-.`
` It's not fantasy!`
` Beatrice 'exists'!`
` Uu-."`
`"...Yes, we understand.`
` Beatrice-sama does 'exist'."`
`"That's right.`
` ...Beatrice-sama does 'exist'."`
`"...I hate to admit it, but I've got no choice.`
` Because it's obvious that a 19th person, a witch, was involved...!"`
`"Many things happened that'd be impossible for humans.`
` During the story, we tried to deny that in all sorts of ways.`
` ...But now, I can say it for sure.`
` Each crime, every single one, would've been impossible for a human.`
` ...They'd be impossible to carry out unless it was the witch Beatrice using all of the power magic could provide."`
`"The culprit was a witch.`
` That point's perfectly clear.`
` Heh, long live Beatrice.`
` Hahahahahaha."`
`"Uu-.`
` Everyone believed.`
` I'm so glad.`
` Uu-!"`
`"...Gods and witches might seem terrifying to people who are frightened of them,`
` but I think they must be affectionate to those who believe in and respect them."`
`"...I think you're right."`
`"So, this murder case game is finally over.`
` Now's the time to pull ourselves together and try hard to solve the riddle of the epitaph, just like Beatrice said, right?"`
`"Uu-!`
` I agree!`
` Beatrice will definitely be happy."`
`"Hahahahaha...`
` Everyone ignored that letter during the story."`
`"...Even though it was thrust right in front of us, we almost completely ignored it.`
` I kind of feel sorry for Beatrice-sama."`
`"I've got the epitaph written down right here!`
` Let's all solve it, let's all solve it...!"`
`"This story probably went wrong ever since that time."`
`"...That may be so.`
` Maybe we should've tried solving the epitaph's riddle from the beginning, like Beatrice said."`
`"Well, it's a little late now.`
` Even so, let's try solving it now and see if the witch forgives us.`
` Let's go, let's try to solve the riddle of the epitaph.`
` ...It was something like, 'Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved hometown.'..."`
`Maria put her notebook on the table and opened to the page where the epitaph was written.`
` Everyone stared at it, getting really into it as they started guessing this and that about the riddle.`
`Surrounded by the smell of black tea and freshly baked vanilla cookies, they spent the time comfortably and happily...`
`"......Hold on a second, you guys."`
`But Battler spoke in a way that cut through the conversation.`
`His expression looked a little unhappy.`
`What could he not like about all of this fun?`
`"...I've been listening to you guys for a while, but... why did you all stop thinking?`
` Why are you so sure that the witch was behind all this?`
` ...Don't you realize something like that can't exist?"`
`With just those words, ...the happy atmosphere surrounding the tea party evaporated in an instant.`
`George and Jessica.`
`And Shannon and Kanon.`
`And Maria.`
`...All of them stared blankly, wondering what in the world Battler was talking about.`
`Even the foolish, arrogant Battler realized that he hadn't chosen his words well.`
`"...B-Because,`
` isn't it clear that these crimes were impossible for a human?"`
`"Th-That's right, that's right.`
` ...None of the cases would've been possible for a human."`
`"That's true...`
` After all, wasn't it full of things that humans couldn't explain...?"`
`"...I don't understand what you're saying, Battler-sama."`
`"I-I'm the one who doesn't have a clue what you guys are talking about!`
` Isn't it obvious that humans committed these crimes?`
` There's no way something like a witch exists, right...?"`
`"Th-Then, `
`...what about when I was killed in the storehouse, and something horrible was done to half of my face?`
` ...If the culprit was human, how could they have accomplished it...?"`
`"...That's...`
`...well, `
`it's hard to imagine how they did something that awful.`
` But that was the rose garden storehouse, right?`
` I'm sure there were plenty of weird tools in there.`
` Let's say they used some electrical tools like a grinder or an electric saw."`
`"......Th-`
`That's...`
`umm..."`
`"Then, Battler,`
` ...how do you explain Grandfather's disappearance from the study when it was a closed room...?`
` Even though the door was sealed, Grandfather just suddenly disappeared, right...?"`
`"We talked about that during the story, too.`
` It's not impossible that Grandfather used some trick to fool the receipt.`
` It's also possible that he went out the window, fell down, and Aunt Natsuhi locked the window from the inside.`
` I could think of a bunch of tricks you could use without relying on magic..."`
`"...Th-`
`That makes sense, but..."`
`"In that case, Battler-kun,`
` how do you explain the way my parents were killed in the guest room?`
` The door was sealed by the lock and the chain.`
` Naturally, the window was sealed too.`
` How do you think a human could've killed my parents?"`
`"...Well, `
`...we did have to leave that trick alone during the story.`
` Anyway, there's at least a good chance the culprit had a key.`
` And it was possible to look in through the crack of the door that the chain allowed.`
` ...I know this is a stretch, but it's possible some device was used through that crack.`
` ...Like maybe they stuck something through it...?"`
`"...Hmmmm, well, even though a door chain is incredibly simple, it's a big factor in setting up a closed room...`
` ...Still, there's probably some closed room trick they could've used.`
` If you bought some closed room mystery novels from the bookstore, you could probably find some trick that'd fit perfectly.`
` ...Anyway, I can't think of one now, ...but I claim that there's nothing humans can't do if they try hard enough."`
`"Isn't that argument horribly irrational...?`
` It's just ridiculous to claim that it's possible for a human to do something, even though you can't explain how..."`
`"...Why is that ridiculous?`
` Why did all of you stop thinking?`
` Even something that looks impossible has to be doable.`
` Doesn't it always work like that?"`
`"Battler, you're the one being ridiculous.`
` ...If you think a human could've done it, try explaining how.`
` You can't, can you?"`
`"And you're okay with saying the culprit is a witch just because I can't explain it?`
` With that argument, all the unsolved crimes in the world could be resolved by saying a witch is the culprit!"`
`"...Battler, you're sidestepping the issue, and you aren't explaining anything.`
` ...We're saying 'A human couldn't have done it.`
` Therefore the culprit is something that isn't human.`
` And that something is a witch.'`
` And yet you keep arbitrarily deciding that witches are impossible, even though you can't explain anything."`
`"...Kihihihihihihihihihihihi, it's almost like humanity was during the dark ages.`
` Like those fools who claimed the heavens spun around the earth...`
`those who said that the earth couldn't be spinning, even though they couldn't explain why."`
`"......Th-That kind of argument kinda pisses me off.`
` So this is basically what you're trying to say.`
` ...If I can't explain how a human could do it,`
` then I must accept that the culprit is a witch?"`
`"...It's not like we're forcing you to go that far.`
` We were just wondering on what basis you can say such nonsense."`
`"N-Nonsense`
`......?`
` ...H-Hey, have I really been saying something that weird just now?!`
` Am I the one who's crazy?!`
` You guys are really starting to freak me out!"`
`"...Battler-sama,`
` when I died in the boiler room, I was killed by a 19th person who shouldn't exist.`
` ...Can you explain how a human could have done that?`
` At that time, the locations of the 18 were well known.`
` Even so, I was killed."`
`"We talked about that in the story as well, right...?!`
` Kumasawa baa-chan, for example.`
` She said she followed right after you and headed down to the boiler room, but we can't know for sure whether that was a lie or not.`
` For all we know, she might've entered the boiler room with you and caught you by surprise!`
` Or maybe, when you stepped into the boiler room, you activated some kind of trap, one that might've been set up to hit you with one of those icepicks."`
`"After all, the stink of Grandfather's body was coming from the incinerator.`
` Someone was bound to go and check, so if the culprit just set up a trap beforehand, they could easily have stayed away from that place and used the time of Kanon-kun's death to create an alibi...!"`
`"...You talk about a trap in the boiler room, ...but what kind of trap could that be?"`
`"That's right.`
` Following his death, everyone immediately ran over to the boiler room.`
` But we didn't find any kind of weird device, did we?!"`
`"...That is correct.`
` Battler-sama, what kind of trap could I have been killed with...?"`
`"Well, `
`...I don't know that.`
` ...But anyway, they must've used some kind of clever trap, or maybe someone's lying, `
`...or what about this?!`
` Kanon-kun, what if the whole thing was just you playacting?!`
` Th-That's it, you were playacting!!`
` Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi were also playacting.`
` They made the closed room themselves, and were only pretending to be dead!"`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, jes_9e35:`
`umm, `
`...feeling okay...?"`
`"...Umm, ...should I bring some cold drinks...?"`
`"D-Don't look at me with those pitying eyes... I'm not saying something that crazy, right?`
` I'm just pointing out some possibilities you might find if you think of it all as a trick.`
` Look, isn't it a pretty classic trick in mystery stories to have one of the victims just be playing dead?!"`
`"A classic trick...?"`
`"I-In other words,`
` when Kanon-kun was killed, we knew for sure where all the rest of us were.`
` And let's assume that Kumasawa baa-chan wasn't lying.`
` But that's only counting the survivors.`
` ...What if the culprit pretended to be dead and joined a group of real victims so we'd lose track of them, and then acted on their own later? Everything would be explained!"`
`"......Huh...?`
` So, are you trying to say that Aunt Eva or one of the others was the culprit...?`
` But didn't Doctor Nanjo confirm all of their deaths, as a doctor?"`
`"...That's right.`
` Doctor Nanjo checked all of the victims.`
` ...Battler-sama, for your theory to work, wouldn't Doctor Nanjo have to be one of the culprits too?"`
`"Uh, yeah, that's right!!`
` Once you consider that Doctor Nanjo might've been one of the culprits and faked the proclamation of death, the whole story changes...!`
` See, that's also a classic trick in mystery novels, isn't it?!!"`
`"...But Doctor Nanjo was also killed, right...?"`
`"Umm, ...about that...`
` ...That's right, Doctor Nanjo faked his death!`
` After all, there wasn't anyone except Doctor Nanjo who could examine corpses properly, and everyone was really confused then anyway.`
` We didn't have any spare time to check and see if he still had a pulse!`
` With this theory, any one of the dead people could've been walking around!"`
`"...I think it would've been hard for the six of us who died in the beginning to do that...`
` ...After all, the shutter was closed, ...and there was a padlock that couldn't have been opened from the inside..."`
`"That's right.`
` Mom was holding onto that key.`
` So was Mom one of the culprits too?"`
`"...Aaaaaaah, wait a sec...`
` Maybe it was impossible for the first six, but in the case of Aniki's parents, the door was only locked on the outside.`
` So they could've opened it from the inside...`
` ...That's right, after we left the room, maybe they jumped out the window and got to the boiler room first!`
` ...I-Is that too much of a stretch...?!`
` Or maybe Doctor Nanjo made a mistake when examining the corpses?!"`
`"Look, he said it himself, right?`
` He said there's a very high probability of making a mistake when examining corpses!`
` If you disguised it well enough or prepared a substitute body, you could fake your own death!!`
` Let's leave the method or trick they used for later...and you see, it's not that hard to deny a 19th person existed, right?!`
` Much less a witch, right?`
` At least that much is completely impossible!!"`
`"...I don't know why you've been trying so stubbornly to say that one of us is the culprit.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihi. In other words, you want to suspect one of your relatives...?"`
`"That's not it...`
` It's just, uh, I can't easily accept that a 19th person existed...and even if one did, I think we should construct our argument from the point of view that the culprit was a human.`
` I'll only accept that it's a witch in desperation, at the very end, after everything else has been disproved."`
`"There's no way witches exist, right?!`
` Why has everyone been casually accepting that the culprit was a witch?`
` I think it's great how your family love makes you hate the thought that someone close to you is a murderer.`
` But is it okay to let that fool you?!`
` Don't you want to find the detestable culprit who killed so many people?!"`
`"Aniki, don't you want to avenge your parents?!`
` Jessica, don't you want to avenge Kanon-kun, and Kanon-kun, don't you want to avenge Shannon-chan?!`
` Shannon-chan, you should at least want to know who it was that killed you.`
` Why has everyone totally surrendered and decided that the culprit was a witch?!`
` What's wrong with all of you?!"`
`The foolish and short-tempered Battler tried to force his ignorance on the others and yelled at them.`
`...However, everyone just looked at him pityingly, silently watching over him.`
`At that time, the wise Maria laughed and pointed out Battler's mistake.`
`"...Kihihihihihihihihi.`
` ...I'm shocked.`
` ...All I see is you repeating this nonsense, thinking you've figured something out, Battler.`
` ...So?`
` What's next?`
` How would a human do it?`
` In practical terms, I mean?`
` I imagine you'll say 'I just can't think of anything now' or 'with some kind of device.' ...Using abstract words to run away and evade the topic."`
`"...What I really want to know, Battler, is this.`
` Why don't you believe in Beatrice?`
` She exists, so why don't you believe?"`
`"Because she doesn't 'exist'!`
` Witches don't 'exist'!!`
` There's no way!!"`
`...It was almost like a spoiled child who just doesn't want to accept something.`
`The pitying gazes quietly closed in around Battler, but they didn't reach his stubborn heart.`
`"...You realize that you're acting just like a spoiled brat throwing a tantrum, right?"`
`"...Battler-sama, `
`I understand your feelings, but..."`
`"...Beatrice does 'exist'."`
`"Battler-kun, ...why don't you believe?`
` Even though there's so much proof."`
`"I don't accept the argument that the witch must've been behind everything just because I can't explain it.`
` Does this mean that if you don't know how a light bulb shines, then magic is the cause?`
` That's wrong, isn't it?!`
` There's nothing that can't be explained without magic!!`
` All of this about witches and magic is just abdication of thought!`
` You just surrendered and gave up because you don't understand what happened!`
` Isn't that right?!"`
`"......Ki, hihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` Well, `
`...unsurprisingly, it looks like you alone won't believe no matter what, Battler.`
` ...If even a single person doesn't believe, the 'miracle' won't occur.`
` ...So, if you don't rethink your ignorant theories, the miracle...the magic won't be completed."`
`"Hehe...`
` Now I see.`
` ...I finally figured it out.`
` ...So, in other words, you guys are trying to force me to say the witch exists, right?`
` A lie that everyone accepts becomes 'the truth'.`
` ...Is that what this is all about?!`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` ...I'm so sorry.`
` I'm so sorry I keep going on about this, but what you're doing is all useless. I refuse.`
` ...`
`~ib~You guys are all pressing me, and that's why it's all useless~ib~`
`."`
`"......Why?"`
`"Sorry, but why don't you let me spin the chessboard around one last time...?`
` If you want to force me to accept that there's a witch, there's a really easy way.`
` ...And it's not the indirect way of saying 'it must be a witch because humans couldn't have done it'!`
` All you have to do is show me a witch doing it with magic."`
`"Furthermore, what Maria said earlier is what'll really dig her grave.`
` ...You said that if even one person doesn't believe, a 'miracle' won't occur."`
`"But real miracles happen whether people believe in them or not!`
` Even if I alone don't believe!!`
` So any miracles or magic or witches that exist only because I believe in them are downright lies!!"`
`"........."`
`The uneasy mood following Battler's ignorant rant......`
`was blown away by a very soft and light laugh.`
`Whose laugh...?`
` Battler was surprised.`
` He had never heard that voice before.`
`When he looked at George and Jessica, at Shannon and Kanon and Maria, he noticed that they had suddenly gone respectfully silent.`
`"......Beatrice."`
`"...How amusing.`
` ...I haven't met such a charming human for quite some time."`
`'!s1`
`Who...`
`...are you...?"`
`'!sd`
` ...How amusing indeed.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"...This is Beatrice-sama, the Golden Witch who has lived for a thousand years."`
`"It is an honor to be graced with your presence, Beatrice-sama..."`
`"...Please forgive Battler-kun's ranting."`
`"Th-This guy's just stubborn, and, umm, he still doesn't understand the situation he's in...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...`
` What a treat this is.`
` ...Most witches get tired of living after the first thousand years.`
` How nice it is to meet a man with backbone such as yourself every once in a while."`
`"...It is quite an honor to be present when Beatrice shows herself, Battler."`
`"...Heh, `
`...heheheheh!!`
` How...`
`...astonishing.`
` ...Are you really that desperate to make me believe that a witch...`
`that a 19th person is the culprit...?`
` This is starting to get interesting...!`
` And it's all useless...!!`
` You must be the illusion that Maria and the others call the witch, Beatrice."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"...And, you'll only be allowed to exist if everyone believes it.`
` ...You have that kind of a half-existence, right?`
` That's why you want to make me believe too.`
` ~ib~You can't exist because I alone don't believe in you~ib~.`
` ...Isn't that right?!"`
`"...Your powers of comprehension aren't bad for a mere commoner who knows nothing of magic.`
` ...Yes, it seems you were born with a strong magic-resisting power.`
` ...You're a natural enemy of us witches.`
` ...No matter how much we turn your world upside down, `
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`~ib~you never believe in us.~ib~`
` ~ib~Therefore, the magic won't succeed~ib~.`
` ...I accept that attitude of yours.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"I've got no clue what you're saying, ihihi!`
` It's very kind of you to go to all of the trouble of showing yourself to us,`
` but I don't believe you exist in the slightest."`
`"It's true that many strange things happened during those two days.`
` Like Maria said earlier, even though I think all the tricks could be explained, I still can't lay out the practical details of each one.`
` However, that doesn't mean I'll surrender."`
`"I'm different from the rest of them, got it?`
` I'll never accept that it was the work of a witch just because I can't explain it."`
`"...This keeps getting more amusing.`
` Making you surrender will be worth my while...`
` ...You're just the kind of man I'd like to force into praising my name......`
` I'd love to try making a man like you kiss my toes.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"If you want to talk nonsense, talk all you want...!`
` I deny you exist.`
` All of the events can be explained with 'human tricks'...!!`
` There's no room for even a speck of magic or witches!!"`
`"Wonderful!`
` ...What a perfect way to divert oneself from a thousand years of boredom.`
` Then let me ask you.`
` A short while ago, you said that using the crack in the door would be sufficient to kill Eva and Hideyoshi, right...?`
` Explain how they could have been killed using some human trick."`
`"...Heh.`
` Suddenly jumping right into the toughest part, are you?`
` ...Does that mean this is the trick you're proudest of?`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
` Miss `
`~ib~Real Culprit~ib~`
`?"`
`With a shake of her golden pipe, `
`gentle, multi-colored smoke trailed out of the end.`
`The smoke quickly obscured their surroundings,`
` ...and they were suddenly in the hallway of the mansion.`
`The door in front of them, slightly opened but secured by the chain, was...`
`That's right, it's the door to the room where Eva and Hideyoshi were killed.`
`"...N-Nice trick..."`
`"Very well.`
` Show me what you would do through this small crack, Battler."`
`"Erk, ...`
`...th-they probably had some device to shoot those 'icepicks'.`
` If they used that..."`
`"How would they reach Eva over on the bed when you can't see that far through this crack?`
` ...And how would they reach Hideyoshi, in the bathroom with the door shut...?"`
`"......Damn...`
` ...There's a crack...`
` There should be some way..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` If you can't think of one, allow me."`
`"...Oh?`
` How would a witch do it...?`
` C'mon, let's see your little trick..."`
`"...Battler, you're being rude to Beatrice..."`
`"How nice, how nice.`
` What a charming man.`
` ...That will make it even more fun to force him into submission."`
`"...Heh!`
` You really wanna make me kiss your toes that much...?!`
` Only if I surrender!`
` But watch... I'll definitely expose this trick, and then I'll make you kiss my ass instead!"`
`"...*cackle*`
` What a delightful man.`
` I'll remember that promise.`
` ...Weak witches kiss the behinds of demons to gain power.`
` Because there's no more humiliating oath.`
` Just being told that makes me want to force you into surrender.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`Paying no mind to Battler's worthless ranting, Beatrice once again shook the golden pipe.`
`...That's right, that golden pipe was her precious magic cane.`
`"Come, arise, children.`
` I am the guide of Purgatory.`
` Forgive the deadly sins and hold the Seven Stakes."`
`Guided by those magic words, which sounded like a command, seven stakes gathered.`
`...They were the stakes of the seven demons symbolizing the deadly sins of sinful people.`
`"Beelzebub and Asmodeus.`
` Come, forgive the sins.`
` Release the spirits of the sinners...!"`
`"Wha...?!"`
`The picks of Beelzebub and Asmodeus responded to Beatrice's call.`
`The two stakes of the demons were sucked in through the crack of the door, like billiard balls struck by a cue stick.`
`Then, several scattered noises refracted through the wall, making a sound like a woodpecker.`
`And at the end, a pleasant sound could be heard.`
`...It was a small, satisfying sound, like the one heard when someone is chopping firewood and the falling ax neatly and easily slices through the wood.`
`It was the sound of the two picks burying themselves deep into Eva's and Hideyoshi's foreheads.`
`"...Right down the middle.`
` Want to see...?"`
`They'd definitely heard two sounds like a pair of foreheads being split open.`
`Battler wasn't permitted to see it, since he was on the other side of the door,`
` but those two had died again, and this second time, they lay not an inch apart from where they had lain the last time, with the exact same blood-spray as before.`
`"...Y-You moron...`
` ...Th-That's insane...!`
` Y-You think you can just kill them like that?!!!"`
`"I can kill them.`
` ...I can kill them just like this...!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`Suddenly, they were no longer in the hall, but seated at the tea party they had started from.`
`...Everyone but Battler was sitting meekly, ...but Kanon was moaning, fresh blood dangling from his mouth.`
` What a rude thing to do at a tea party.`
`Satan's stake was buried deep into Kanon's chest.`
`'!s1`
`...gah`
`..."`
`"K-Kanon-kun, `
`...Kanon-kun!!`
` ...D-Damn iiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`Battler was the only one getting agitated.`
`George, Jessica, Shannon...everyone else was meekly hanging their heads like students being yelled at by their teacher.`
`"...Kanon was captivated by a trifling anger and tried to disturb my banquet.`
` ...Being easily captivated by anger is your deadly sin.`
` Cleanse yourself, repent, and do it over."`
`'!s1`
`...rice...`
`...sa...ma..."`
`"B-Beatrice-sama,`
` ...please, forgive him...`
` I think Kanon-kun has repented enough...!"`
`"Wonderful.`
` I am generous to those who respect me.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"Don't screw with me!!!`
` Do you think I'll accept your existence because of this cheap act?!`
` Like hell you're a thousand-year-old witch!`
`  Your tricks aren't a thousand years old, they're just the sum of a century of classic tricks from the mystery genre!`
` There's no such thing as magic!!`
` Definitely not!!`
` All of the crimes can be explained with 'human tricks'!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` You would explain my thousand years with a hundred years of humans...?`
` Good, good, that's why I like you...!"`
`"...Foolish Battler...`
` Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi...!"`
`"...Cut it out, Battler-kun...`
` You can't...`
`go...against the witch..."`
`'!s1`
`...u, `
`...u..."`
`Shannon started moaning, holding her cheek.`
`...Maybe she had a toothache.`
`But apparently, it wasn't a toothache after all.`
`...A slight redness spread across the cheek Shannon was holding.`
`It looked like that redness was causing Shannon unbearable pain...`
`Her fingers were pressing in against her cheek, and drops of sweat appeared all over her body...`
`"...Shannon, `
`...Shannon...!!`
` Hang in there...hang in there!"`
`"What's going on?!`
` Damn it, what the hell is that red stuff...?!"`
`It expanded rapidly, covering half of Shannon's face...`
`...Then, the stupid dunce Battler finally realized...`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, geo_9e47:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, geo_9e48:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, geo_9e49:`
`because you won't believe, aaaaaaaaaah, `
`...the magic is`
`...the magic is dissolviiiiiiiing!!"`
`For the first time in his life, ...Battler heard that sound, like a pomegranate splitting.`
`The red spray even landed on Battler's face...`
`Poor Shannon's face had been split in half, ...and her last horrible moments in that storehouse were repeated once again.`
`"U-Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh, Shannon, Shannon!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!!"`
`"Ngg...nnnnnggg, damn it, damn iiiiiiiiiiit!`
` Stop it, stop it, stop it!!`
` Don't humiliate the dead, don't humiliate the deeeeeaaaaad!!"`
`"Uuuu, ...gah, ...eeeggh!!"`
`This time, the redness spread across George's entire body...`
`It was like the beautiful cloud drawn by milk when it's poured into black tea.`
` It spread out and extended across his entire body.`
`...As it did, it seemed to give George increasingly greater pain.`
`Looking at this bizarre spectacle, ...Battler was petrified as he frantically thought with his pitifully clumsy imagination...`
`about the nature of this strange death George and the rest were experiencing...`
`Eventually, ...that redness reached the nearby Jessica as well...`
`'!s1`
`...eeh, `
`...ack, `
`......hh!!"`
`"S-Stop it, stop it, stop it!!!`
` What did Aniki do,`
` what did Jessica do,`
` just STOP IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!!!"`
`'!s1`
`Battler, `
`...d-`
`don't let the witch`
`...break your spirit...!`
` ...Deny her, `
`erase her...`
` ...A-As long as at least one person denies her, `
`she's an illusion that can't exist...!`
` Aaaaahhhh, gghhh!!"`
`"A-Are you okay, Jessica?!!`
` Whaa, A-Aniki?!?!"`
`George was no longer recognizable as a human.`
`...He looked like the pile of leftover meat after the good, delicious meat has been scraped off to be cooked.`
`...The only thing that even resembled a human was the shape of his lower jaw and rib cage.`
`And it was clear that Jessica, who was covered with a steadily strengthening redness, was approaching the same fate.`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, mar_9e63:`
`@:dwave_eng 0, mar_9e64:`
` ...If you don't, `
`...everyone's magic...`
`...will dissolve..."`
`"M-Maria, it's all over your body, too...!!!"`
`"I revive all the dead with my magic.`
` ...But as long as you don't believe, that magic will hold no true power.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` But I'm sure that a man like yourself won't surrender to something like this, right...?"`
`'!s1`
`Battler...!`
` We...`
`...didn't want to doubt our friends...`
` We refused to face reality...`
`and gave in to the witch...!`
` But...`
`Battler, you won't...`
`...won't...`
`give in to the witch...!`
` Geh, `
`ggghh, `
`...gggggghhkkkkkkk!!!"`
`"Jessica, Jessicaaaaaaa, gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!"`
`Poor Jessica met the same end.`
`...Just like George, she ended up like a butcher's leftovers.`
`George and Jessica were now so destroyed, melted and mixed up, it was impossible to tell them apart.`
`"...Battler,`
` don't cry.`
` ...Beatrice will restore the dead over and over.`
` So there's nothing to be sad about...`
`'!s1`
`......even if we die, we're still...`
`...just...`
`fine..."`
`The redness began eating into the whole of Maria's body...`
` The foolish Battler watched and screamed.`
`"I won't forgive you, I'll never forgive you!!`
` A witch?! Magic?!`
` I'll risk my body and soul to deny you...!!`
` No matter what happens, I can't accept you!!`
` Now that you've gone so far to piss me off, I'll never forgive you!!"`
`"I won't forgive, I won't forgive, I definitely won't forgive you!!`
` You'll regret making me, Ushiromiya Battler, your enemy!!`
` I'll deny you no matter what!!`
` No matter how baffling things get, it can all be explained by 'humans'!!!`
` I'll erase every cell of you from this world!!!"`
`"Well said! Battler, was it...?`
` That's just the thing to divert me from my thousand years of boredom!`
` Come, explain.`
` Try explaining it all with 'human tricks'!`
` And learn how lowly humans are!!`
` Let's see if what humanity has built up in a hundred years can oppose my thousand years!!`
` That's what will make forcing you to submit so pleasant...!!"`
`"So tell me, you who call yourself Battler!`
` What about Maria's letter?`
` How the six were killed?`
` The shutter?`
` The receipt's seal?`
` The closed room with the chain?`
` Kanon in the boiler room?`
` Genji and the others in the lounge?!`
` Natsuhi's suicide?!`
` The riddle of the epitaph?!`
` The location of the hidden gold?!"`
`"Yes, Battler, why don't you show me the power of 'humans'?!`
` Fuhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"`
`"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!"`
`"............"`
`Rosa awoke from her doze.`
`...It must have been a very deep sleep.`
`Her mind was hazy, and she wasn't thinking clearly.`
`Where is this...?`
`It felt like some mansion, but it didn't seem to be the Ushiromiya mansion.`
`She could see a room that looked like a parlor.`
`...And there was some tea that had been prepared.`
`It had probably been made for her.`
`Around the room, some glitter that looked like gold leaf drifted about, making the scene look quite fantastical.`
`...When she eventually realized that they were gold butterflies, it further strengthened that impression.`
`There was someone across from her.`
`...A woman.`
` ...A lady.`
`......It was the portrait's...`
`witch.`
`She seemed to be having a one-sided conversation.`
`She was probably talking to Rosa, `
`but Rosa, whose mind was clouded up by a deep fog, didn't have a clue what was being said...`
`"...Choose whatever you please.`
` If there is anything you want, I'll give it all to you.`
` You can think of it as a reward for your good luck, or else as proper compensation for how you've answered to my demands."`
`"It may have been a truly trivial matter from your perspective.`
` However, the deal was important enough to me to be deserving of this reward."`
`......What is she...talking about?`
`...I don't know, `
`...I don't know.`
`"It's just that...I am very much a witch.`
` Perhaps you'd best ask for something only a witch can give you."`
`"What a rare chance this is.`
` To actually receive the favor of Beatrice the Golden, me.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`".........Nng......"`
`Finally, Rosa started to feel the blood flowing through her body.`
`...Her movements were still sluggish, and she couldn't even voice the words she was thinking.`
`"I am commonly called the Golden Witch.`
` Bestowing a mountain of gold, like the one I gave Kinzo, is trivial to me.`
` ...After all, you can measure all the pleasures of the human world with money.`
` Therefore, gold is no more or less than the manifestation of the human world's pleasures."`
`"Can you imagine it?`
` A mountain of gold that you couldn't use up as long as you lived."`
`As the witch blew on her pipe, multi-colored smoke enshrouded their surroundings.`
`As she did this, the inside of the parlor...was suddenly filled with stacks of gold ingots.`
`It looked like a shining gold-colored wall.`
`...If each ingot was worth several ten million yen,`
` how much would all of this be worth?`
`It seemed sinful to even think of such a number.`
`"...However, the human world is difficult.`
` I know there are some things that cannot be settled, no matter how high into the sky you pile up gold.`
` I know there are cracks that cannot be filled.`
` I won't make light of that, which is why this is a gift that only a witch such as I can give."`
`"...Why don't I fill those cracks in for you?`
` Yes, how about this. It's something only I can give.`
` You should be very happy."`
`"...No need to thank me out loud.`
` I can tell right away.`
` It's written on your face and in the corners of your heart, *cackle*cackle*!"`
`Rosa felt a touch of discomfort at this witch, `
`who kept on talking even though Rosa hadn't uttered a single word, `
`but since she still couldn't manage to speak...and was so helpless that it was difficult to even move a finger, `
`she couldn't do anything but listen.`
`"How far must the deep wounds in your heart recede before they can be healed?`
` ......This is...`
`......deep...`
`quite deep indeed.`
` ...Sometimes, wounds close up while a fragment of foreign matter remains inside.`
` ...Even when such wounds appear to have healed, they continue to throb for all eternity.`
` Sometimes, you have to open the wound once more in order to heal it completely."`
`As the witch spoke, she stared deep into Rosa's eyes.`
`...What in the world...was she peering at?`
`Rosa felt uncomfortable, but she couldn't look away.`
`"......So, your pain was already fated by the time of your birth.`
` ...How heart-breaking.`
` ...You don't have to say it.`
` I understand.`
` ...I understand..."`
`Rosa was gradually being sucked into the witch's eyes.`
`Then, the world grew dark, spinning round and round as she was sucked in...`
`Rosa, Rosa.`
`Why are you such an idiot?`
`Oh, that's Krauss nii-san's voice.`
`Krauss nii-san is a real adult, so he's very smart.`
`So he hated the stupid kid, Rosa.`
`He was a very scary person.`
` I was often hit, and my toys were taken from me and broken.`
`I was apparently being punished for something bad I'd done, but I never really understood what it was, or why I was being punished.`
`I was always punished suddenly and then later told what the punishment was for, in a forced manner,`
` but it was always something I didn't remember doing.`
`...So I really hated Krauss nii-san.`
`Rosa, Rosa.`
`Why are you such an idiot?`
`Oh, that's Eva nee-san's voice.`
`Eva nee-san is a real adult, so she's very smart.`
`So she hated the stupid kid, Rosa.`
`She was always a very sly person, and she often lied to me, tricked me, bullied me all the time.`
`Apparently I was stupid, and she said it was only natural for stupid people to be swindled by those smarter than them.`
`So I wanted to become a wise person like Eva nee-san, and listened to what she said, but when I obeyed her, for some reason, someone always got really mad at me.`
`...So I really hated Eva nee-san.`
`Rosa, Rosa.`
`Why are you such an idiot?`
`Oh, that's Rudolf nii-san's voice.`
`Rudolf nii-san really knows how to get things done.`
`So he hated the stupid kid, Rosa.`
`When Krauss nii-san was around, he would be friendly with Krauss nii-san.`
`When Eva nee-san was around, he would be friendly with Eva nee-san.`
`...And when Krauss nii-san wasn't around, he would be violent like Krauss nii-san, `
`and when Eva nee-san wasn't around, he would play dirty like Eva nee-san.`
`And even though he was also bullied most of the time, `
`when Krauss nii-san and Eva nee-san weren't around, he gave me two people's worth of bullying.`
`...So I really hated Rudolf nii-san.`
`...Oh, but these were my memories from when I was a kid.`
`It's common for unfair things to happen between kids.`
`And you mustn't hold onto grudges for such things forever.`
`With time, those memories get buried away, and forgetting them bit by bit is supposed to be part of growing up and becoming an adult.`
`So becoming an adult is the same as separating yourself from all those memories.`
`And because of that.`
`No matter how much time passed, Rosa couldn't become an adult.`
`...Even though she had been blessed with a daughter called Maria and was called a mother, `
`...she didn't at all feel like she had become an adult.`
`The witch pitied her for that.`
`And she smiled, saying that she could heal that pain herself.`
`"...How can I heal you?`
` It's possible, but not easy.`
` ...I might rewind time, and giving you a world where you have no older siblings."`
`"But that way, your 'memories of being hurt by your older siblings' wouldn't remain,`
` and in that sense, while you might call it a gift, you wouldn't be able to accept it."`
`"A person is only satisfied when their starvation is healed.`
` But if you make it so they never starved in the first place, none of them will thank you.`
` Just like how there are no young people who give thanks for their daily gluttony.`
` ...Understand?"`
`I think she's telling me something really complicated.`
`...In short, even if she makes it so I never had older siblings, that wouldn't remove my pain...`
` Maybe that's what she's saying.`
`Strictly speaking, that's not quite right.`
`Healing isn't the same thing as removing pain.`
`It's the pleasure we earn as compensation for withstanding pain.`
`Therefore, removing the pain isn't healing.`
`To know the joy of healing, you have to know the pain.`
`"Which means...you must know joy, in order to compensate you for your pain.`
` You should be proud of your past sufferings.`
` After all, they are what make it possible for you to know pleasure that those without pain will never experience.`
` ...Those who experience this pleasure...cannot help but pass on the same joy to others...`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`When the witch snapped her fingers, even though the room was still filled with a mountain of gold and had already lost all semblance of reality, `
`a fabulous tablecloth appeared on top of the table...`
`and a wonderful meal was laid out, almost as though it was the opening of a banquet in a castle from some fairy tale.`
`For an instant, Rosa truly did feel a pleasurable surprise at how fabulous it was, `
`...but at the same time, she felt a bit of anticlimax.`
`After all, she didn't think being bullied by her siblings could be wiped away by just one meal, no matter how delicious.`
`"Food is the source of many human pleasures.`
` You simply must eat like a pig as long as you live."`
`"If one meal isn't enough, then have as many as you want.`
` Until the pain of your heart is healed, why not continue this gourmet banquet?`
` ...Begin it, furniture."`
`As the witch clapped twice, `
`there were suddenly two goat head servants there, and they began to prepare the meal.`
`From the beautiful dishes adorning the table, they efficiently took some food and began to pile it up on Rosa's plate.`
`It really did look delicious, but Rosa's body still felt as heavy as lead,`
` and there was no way she'd be able to eat.`
`Maybe they also understood that.`
`The goat head servants tied a napkin around Rosa's collar...`
`and gallantly brought a glass of before-dinner alcohol to her mouth, tilting it for her.`
`She remembered an old servant who had once carried rice porridge to her mouth when she was laid up with a high fever.`
`She couldn't drink it well, and it dripped down from her mouth, but she felt the fragrant sweetness spread throughout her mouth.`
`"It's a sweet aperitif of noble rot German-made wine.`
` A wine cocktail of white wine mixed with a crimson golden drop."`
`"If I had to give it a name, I'd call it a Bloody Krauss.`
` Soaked with just a golden drop of your brother's blood that was squeezed out of a compressor."`
`Rosa coughed violently.`
`And the bright red that stained her face made it look as though she had coughed up blood.`
`"You know a lot about black tea, so you should know what it means, right?`
` 'Golden drop' refers to the last drop in a drink.`
` It is called the most precious drop in black tea."`
`"......So a golden drop of blood is the same.`
` The last and most precious drop of blood squeezed out of a human.`
` We squeeze it using that."`
`As the witch snapped her fingers, a bright red veil that had been set up before something large was removed.`
`...The solemn and massive machine there was just like...`
`a coffin for a large-sized person, with many large bulb-like things stuck to it, `
`and it looked like a sinister torture device.`
`By its unnerving shape, `
`she could tell that with a human's strength, it could be used to tighten and compress something.`
`...And it seemed that there were still some squeezed dregs remaining, `
`...because of the bright red remains that stained it.`
`"But you can't take more than one golden drop at once.`
` No matter what kind of human you take it from, you can't get more than one drop.`
` But I am a witch.`
` Reviving a person is easy for me."`
`When the witch snapped her fingers, the human compressor suddenly began to shake.`
`...No, she could also hear a groan.`
`...It looked almost as though...someone sleeping in that man-sized coffin...`
`had woken up, and was now struggling to get out.`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`But that was wrong.`
` What was inside definitely had been ~ib~squeezed dregs~ib~.`
`Using her magic, the witch had once again revived the squeezed dregs to how they'd been before they were squeezed.`
`Three goat head servants with muscular physiques approached the compressor...and forcefully started tightening the large bulb.`
`...As they did, an unearthly moan came from inside the coffin.`
`...Rosa thought she knew the owner of that voice.`
`"It is fitting for cooking to be done in the kitchen.`
` Enough, stand back."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"...Do you understand how precious a golden drop is?`
` To have it stained this crimson requires that ~ib~several dozen people's worth~ib~ be squeezed."`
`The witch definitely said that only one golden drop could be taken from a single human.`
`And yet, she had dozens of people's worth of golden drops from a single human.`
`...Only a witch could do this.`
`The Golden Witch Beatrice could kill a single human 'endlessly'.`
`...In other words, before Beatrice, even death did not mean freedom.`
`"Do you need me to put it a different way?`
` Have you forgotten the day this man hit you, when you swallowed the blood that ran into your mouth?"`
`"That's right, remember that taste.`
` Remember the taste of the tears that you spilled until you were dry.`
` I believe this aperitif will be sufficient to heal that regrettable memory.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`Once again, the goat head servants tilted a deep red glass against her mouth.`
`...Rosa tried resisting by closing her lips, `
`but the deep red liquid was relentlessly poured into her mouth, which hung open with shock,`
` and the inside of her mouth was filled with a ghastly sweetness...`
`It definitely was a fragrant sweetness.`
`The living blood of her brother, who had given her such hateful thoughts and made her soak her pillow so many times, `
`had been collected from his death, repeated dozens of times.`
` How could the crimson-stained wine not be sweet?`
`But Rosa tried to spit it out.`
`Because of that, the deep red wine that spilled out of Rosa's mouth looked just like a bloodstain.`
`...Now that she knew that this ghastly substance wasn't a simple aperitif,`
` Rosa couldn't help but feel uncomfortable about what would happen if this banquet continued.`
`"That is a double-tongued salad made from vegetables in season.`
` ...On your 9th birthday, you made a wish that you'd someday get to chew this to bits, this salad made from Eva's tongue."`
`"............!!!"`
`When Rosa heard the true nature of the pink-colored meat piled up in the salad,`
` she had a sudden impulse to vomit her guts out.`
`...Furthermore, the goat servants stuck a fork in it...and carried it to Rosa's mouth.`
`"How does your double-tongued sister taste?`
` It must be quite soft and enchanting, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`It probably would be quite sweet, soft and enchanting in her mouth.`
`After all, Eva's lies were always sweet, and young Rosa had always listened to them.`
`...And, you might say the stimulating pepper seasoning expressed the truth behind those lies well.`
`'!s1`
` Nggggnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!"`
`As the tongue salad that kept being pushed into Rosa's mouth was covered with saliva, she spat it out.`
`But the goat head servants carefully returned it to the plate and carried it to Rosa's mouth over and over again.`
`"It goes without saying, but I made this salad liberally using five of Eva's tongues.`
` You can't get more than one tongue out of a person.`
` But I can get them over and over.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"......Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!`
` Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!"`
`As Rosa's tears dripped down, she resisted frantically.`
`However, the only way she could resist was by refusing to swallow.`
`Even if she didn't swallow it, `
`the taste of the french dressing increasingly permeated Rosa's mouth...`
`"Does it not please you...?`
` There's lots more.`
` Sea bass pie wrapped in the skin of Rudolf's face.`
` Soup with boiled brains, liver pate.`
` And look forward to dessert, *cackle*cackle*!!`
` It's not just your siblings, see?`
` I have lavishly assembled all of those whom you have trusted and yet by whom you were betrayed.`
` Why don't we continue this banquet for all eternity, until your heart is satisfied?`
` For all eternity.`
`...You're happy, right, Ushiromiya Rosaaaa?`
` Don't pretend you hate it, I know that you're actually happy, 'kay?`
` If you want to laugh, then do so,`
` and if you won't feel better until you've heard a raw performance of your annoying older siblings' screams, I'll let you hear them as much as you like.`
` Fear not, your reluctance doesn't trouble me.`
` That's just your personality, right?`
` On the inside, you're actually so happy that your skin is crawling all over.`
` And yet, on the outside, you're merely pretending that all this causes you pain, yes?`
`It's all right. Here, there is no need to worry about honor or your public image or anything, `
`so laugh as much as you want and chew it to bits.`
` Isn't this the beeest banquet, Ushiromiya Rosaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa???"`
`'!s1`
`...please, `
`...stop...`
`...*cough*, *hack*!!`
` Uugggghh..."`
`"Oh, I'm sorry, I wanted to leave dessert as a surprise, but let me reveal it now anyways.`
` Maybe that will be enough incentive for you to eat up the full course."`
`"Your dessert is that beloved daughter that you had to keep pretending to love,`
` oven-baked Maria with apples.`
` Doesn't that sound yummy?"`
`"Once you eat this, you will be released from everything.`
` Freedom, you see, freedom!`
` Finally, Rosa will gain freedom as an individual person, aren't you happyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?`
` You should be happy, drool is hanging from your mouth, just try looking in a mirroooooooooooooooooor, hyahahaaahaahaahaha!!"`
`Suddenly, a muscular goat cook was holding Maria under his arm.`
`And Maria gazed at Rosa with a face that was only slightly sad.`
`"......Mama...`
` ...Was I...a burden...?"`
`"...Nnnnnnn!`
`!`
` You aren't a burden!!`
` Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!"`
`As Rosa spat out the food that was continually being carried to her mouth, `
`as she was covered with filth and saliva and blood, she resisted filthily and screamed.`
`"...If you...`
`think I'm a burden,`
` ...I don't mind if you eat me."`
`"......After all, I'm always doing horrible things to you.`
` Even when you bring a man over, I can't stay quiet.`
` When you spend the night out with a man, I get lonely and unruly and make a mess of my room.`
` When I go to search by myself, I get lost, the police pick me up, and you're shamed.`
` When you don't come home for several days and I cry and have to be consoled by the neighbors, you're shamed."`
`"Because I'm like this, I'm a burden to Mama.`
` Sorry for being born.`
` So, I'll become delicious oven-baked apples for Mama's sake."`
`"And then, maybe Mama will be happy I exist for the first time.`
` Maybe she'll eat me and think I'm delicious.`
` Isn't it delicioooooooooooooooous?`
` Be choked up with tears of gratitude, your daughter is saying this much for you, riiiiiiiiiiiight?`
` Oven-baked apples and your beloved daughter make for the best dessert!`
` You've managed to raise such delicious ingredients, `
`aren't you the best mother, Ushiromiya Rosaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa???"`
`"......Mama, thanks for everything.`
` Bye bye."`
`'!s1`
` Wait, Maria, that's wrong!!`
` Stop it already, stop it already, `
`nooooooooooooooooooooooo!!`
` I didn't want something like this!`
` Please stop, please forgive me!!`
` No, `
`stop it already, `
`don't put it...in my mouth...`
`uuuuulg, `
`geeeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Have you been satisfied with my hospitality...?`
` Then I'll have you accept it.`
` That I am a witch.`
` Proclaim it.`
` 'Ushiromiya Rosa accepts that Beatrice is a witch'!!"`
`"......I accept it!!`
` U-Ushiromiya Rosa......`
`accepts that......`
`Beatrice is a witch!!`
` So give Maria back!!`
` Release meeeeeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*, hahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` I finally made you acknowledge it!!`
` That crafty Battler has already surrendered, and I made Rosa, the fool who denied me even after being invited to the Golden Land, accept it!!`
` Perfect!!`
` <It's perfect!!>"`
`"I've accomplished my perfect victory!!`
` Hehahahahahahahahakya-HAH-HAH-HAH-HAH-HAH-HA!!`
` Come, bring Maria, prepare a delicious oven roast for Rosa!!"`
`'!s0`
`'!s1`
` Slice up your cow tits and make me a sandwich."`
`"Wha, ...th-that voice!!`
` Ooof?!"`
`An arm grabbed the back of the witch's head and smashed her face into the table.`
`As it did, the witch broke to pieces, turned into a cloud of gold butterflies, and reformed into her body a short distance away.`
`"...B-Battler?!?!`
` ...Y-You bastard, `
`...I thought you'd surrendered so far that even your soul was furniture!!"`
`"Me too, `
`...but while I was listening to that gross recipe, I started to get a little hungry."`
`"Now I feel like eating a whole roast witch!!"`
`"And Maria.`
` It's ten years too early for you to talk about having someone eat you up.`
` But in ten years, you'd better say that to me. Promise."`
`"...Uu-.`
` Promise."`
`"B-Battler-kun...!"`
`"Sorry to keep you waiting, Aunt Rosa.`
` I'd forgotten.`
` This is a one-on-one fight between me and this woman.`
` It's totally wrong for me to give in.`
` ...Thanks to you hanging in there, I've gotten my will to fight back!!"`
`...Th-This person, he gave up down to the depths of his soul and surrendered to me, didn't he...?`
`...I see, he doesn't know when to give up, just what I'd expect from Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild...!`
` So the chick of a phoenix is a phoenix after all...!`
`"Heh, hehahahahahahahahaha, how dashing, how amusing!`
` I wouldn't have it any other way!!`
` I wouldn't have you any other way, Battler!!`
` Try to deny me, I'll completely and thoroughly smash you to bits!`
` Let me make you surrender over and over again. I'll teach you, one who has licked my shoes, the taste of defeat over and over again!!"`
`"No problem, I'll teach you that I, Ushiromiya Battler, am a man who can stand back up even after crawling through the mud!!`
` I've never been invincible in a fight.`
` I've lost loads of times.`
` But I'll definitely crawl through the mud and stand up again.`
` And then I'll finish this!!`
` In a man's fight, you don't lose until you accept defeat, no matter how much you get beat up!!"`
`"Don't think I'm out just because you took a shot at me.`
` I'll give you a good show, Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice!!"`
`"I'll accept your challenge, Ushiromiya Battler!!`
` Furniture, begin preparations for the next game!!"`
`"While we're waiting, why don't you tell me all about it?`
` There were a lot of closed rooms in this game.`
` Using red, I've smashed to bits most of the methods by which you tried to talk yourself out of them.`
` What other evasive quibbles will you show me now?!!`
` The lock to the chapel, the lock to Jessica's room, the lock to the servant room, the lock to Natsuhi's room, the lock to the parlor!!`
` Use your bizarre specialty, `
`those delusions, rantings, daydreams, and bluffs, `
`all slanted with ridiculous, incredible turns of events, and show how you can thoroughly deny meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Aaah, it's useless, `
`it's all useleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeess!!!"`
`"Hahahaha, wahahahaha!`
` I never expected Lady Bernkastel's piece to barge in at the very end...!"`
`"...I searched all over the place for a piece fitting for a game with you.`
` ...I was sure you'd like it."`
`"What's with that piece?!`
` Who was that person, who was it?!`
` She didn't say her name! That's mean!!`
` Hey, don't you think so too?!"`
`"...I have a general idea.`
` ...Or rather, I imagine most people would've figured it out."`
`"Most people?!`
` Well I don't get it, and it was that character's first appearance, wasn't it?!`
` If she doesn't say her name, I won't understand, the players won't understand, no one will understand, right?!"`
`"......Beato, don't bother telling her.`
` See?`
` Isn't she a funny kid?"`
`"I-Indeed.`
` ...Lady Lambdadelta's innocent airhead side is truly precious and amusing.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Come on, come on, why won't you tell only me, you meanie?!!`
` In exchange, I'll teach you a special secret that only I know!`
` So tell me!"`
`"...Hoh.`
` A special secret, you say?!`
` I want to hear, I want to hear...!"`
`"Bleah!`
` If you want me to tell you, first tell me who that girl really was!`
` The secret I know sure is awesome!`
` After all, it's about as awesome as knowing that Santa-san is actually daddy!`
` Huh?`
` *giggle*!`
` I said it☆ Sorry, I'll bet you're so shocked that it turned your world upside-down, right?!`
` Ohohohohoh!"`
`"......So, your father was the one who came to your place, Lambda?"`
`"He came...wait, what do you me-an?"`
`"...Lord Santa Claus only visits the homes of children with pure hearts.`
` I guess he didn't come to your place, did he?"`
`"Well, Lord Santa Claus is gracious.`
` Unless you're a re-ally bad scoundrel, he'll give you a present.`
` After all, he even gave them to me!"`
`"......As you grow and your heart is hardened, he stops coming, doesn't he?`
` How old were you, Beato, when he stopped coming?"`
`"Indeed.`
` He kept coming until I was about 12.`
` When my maiden's heart awoke, I quickly got somewhat embarrassed about Lord Santa coming."`
`"After I wrote 'Thanks for everything, that's enough,`
` so make sure you splurge on the last set of presents', he stopped coming.`
` Oooh, and I was looking forward to it too!`
` How old were you when he stopped coming, Lady Bernkastel?"`
`"......I was pretty wild.`
` ...It happened fairly early.`
` I think when I was about 9.`
` ...Something about that beard really irritated me, so I waited in my futon with some sewing scissors ready, trying to cut it off.`
` ......What a painful age."`
`"So, ...as far back as Lady Lambdadelta can remember, Lord Santa Claus never came to see her, huh?`
` ......He usually comes until the last year of elementary school or during middle school."`
`"...Maybe we should take her to a doctor.`
` I hear that being too precocious can have negative side-effects on the growth of mind and body.`
` ...Yeah, you can definitely see some of those.`
` ...Those negative side-effects."`
`"Hey, wh-what are you people talking about?!!`
` Bleeeeah!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Wahahahaha, it truly is boisterous when three witches gather!"`
`"...If you're talking about a secret on that level, I doubt this will be worth listening to.`
` Can I go now?`
` I have to get ready for the next game."`
`"What, hey, wait a sec!`
` Tell me who that woman really was!!"`
`"...Well then, tell me this special secret of yours first.`
` If it's good enough, then I'll tell you."`
`"Hohohohoh!!`
` Okay, I'll tell you, 'cause it really is a special secret!`
` ...Remember, in this game, there was a girl who found the gold and became the new witch, right?"`
`"Indeed.`
` And just what kind of secret might that person have?"`
`"Ehheheheheh!`
` I figured out who that girl really is.`
` Does anyone know?`
` *giggle*giggle*!`
` There was a hint in the way she talked."`
`"Remember, that girl said it a lot, didn't she?`
` 'If only you'd just blaaaah',`
` right?!`
` Yes, that phrase is the key point!`
` If only? Ifffonly?`
` Evvvvonly?!`
` Yes!"`
`"She was actually...Ushiromiya Eva!!`
` What do you think?!`
` Are you shocked?!`
` Ohohohohoh!!"`
`"Hoh...!`
` I never noticed that!`
` ...Muu, to think that there would be a hint in a place like that."`
`"...You're a real good sport, Beato.`
` This kid tends to get full of herself, so try not to overdo it.`
` See you, I'm leaving."`
`"Wait, wait!`
` It's not fair if you just listen to my secret and don't tell me yours!!`
` Tell me who she really was!!"`
`"...Your secret was so amazing that mine just wouldn't match up.`
` ...So in exchange, I'll teach you a special secret.`
` I'll tell you the name of the culprit in this game called 'Higurashi no Naku Koro ni'."`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, don't say it!!`
` I'm still playing i-t!!"`
`"...Ahhahahahahhahhahhahha...`
` See you, Beato.`
` The black tea was delicious.`
` However, the repertoire of jam on the crackers was lacking.`
` Add some gochujang chili paste every once in a while.`
` It goes great with Russian tea.`
` Later."`
`"Oh, I see.`
` I shall try it.`
` I'll call for some after preparing the next game.`
` Until then, feel free to polish up your strategy at your leisure."`
`"Yes, I'll do that.`
` This last game was pretty interesting.`
` Later."`
`"He-y, wait a sec, tell me-!!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*`
` My, my, you two really are close."`
`"............`
`...Yes, that's right.`
` ...Oh, I really like you, Bernkastel.`
` You could even say I love you.`
` ...I want to gouge out your eyes so that you see no one other than me.`
` ...Oh, that would be so wonderful.`
` It'd be great to dunk them in black tea.`
` Aha!"`
`"To think that you would be so entranced, Lady Lambdadelta.`
` ...I have a serious responsibility.`
` Still, this last game really was close!`
` I was a breath away from getting Battler."`
`"......Beato,`
` can I ask you something?"`
`"What is it?`
` I won't tell you that girl's name.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"...When are you gonna stop fooling around?`
` ...Are you even trying to win?"`
`Lambdadelta threatened her with a low voice that she had never used in front of Bernkastel.`
`...It completely blew away the calm atmosphere that had been there until a moment ago.`
`"......You know `
`I'm supporting you because you're supposed to be a witch who can win against Bernkastel.`
` If you don't have the power to win against her, `
`then I'll abandon you right away, okay...?"`
`"......How harsh of you.`
` What about me dissatisfies you?`
` ...As you know, my game board is perfect.`
` Lady Bernkastel will never be able to win..."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` Your board truly is impressive.`
` It truly is an impressive and perfect game board that Bernkastel definitely won't be able to win in, not even after a hundred years, `
`or even a thousand years."`
`"...That's why I made you a witch in exchange for letting me borrow it.`
` ......If I stop being your guardian, you'll immediately go back to being a Human.`
` ...Make sure you don't forget that, no matter how much incredible magical power you hold, ...you are nothing more than a temporary witch."`
`"...I-I understand.`
` ...I'm grateful to you..."`
`"Don't speak so casually to me.`
` I'll forgive that when Bernkastel's around, but not when she isn't.`
` I'll bet you've started to forget how much you owe me."`
`"Th-That is......n-n-not so..."`
`"...Aah, you really are disgusting.`
` Go ahead and talk the way you usually do.`
` But be mindful of what you say.`
` ...I have a surprisingly short temper, you see?"`
`"I-Indeed..."`
`"Let's get back to what we were discussing.`
` ...Your game board truly is perfect.`
` ...You should be able to defeat Bernkastel without any trouble.`
` ...But that kid won't surrender easily.`
` She'll challenge you over and over."`
`"That is no problem.`
` ...It has been certified by you, Lady Lambdadelta.`
` ...My game board is perfect."`
`"Yeah, that's right, it's perfect.`
` ......But are you, the player, perfect as well?"`
`"......What do you mean by that...?"`
`"What do I mean?`
` That's what I want to hear.`
` ......You play around a lot in your game.`
` ...Sometimes, that ends up confusing Bernkastel, so at first I thought it was some special strategy of yours."`
`"......But I get the feeling that's not quite true.`
` Rather than toying with the opponent in a match you can win, `
`...you don't actually care whether you win or lose, right?"`
`"R-Ridiculous...`
` How could that be...?"`
`"You know what?`
` Your role is to make Bernkastel surrender.`
` In other words, that means being the victor in this game for all eternity.`
` ...As long as you keep trying to become the victor 'with certainty', then I'll give you my power as the Witch of Certainty.`
` ......However."`
`"If you fight in a way that doesn't eliminate any possibility of your loss,`
` ...that's a different story."`
`"Of course, this is a game...`
` Just as Lady Bernkastel will lose when I win,`
` ...I will sometimes lose when she wins.`
` The possibility of loss always exists.`
` Therefore, I will-"`
`".........This is why you're useless.`
` There's no need for you to be a game board.`
` You just have to be a bird cage that can lock Bernkastel up here for all eternity."`
`"...What's the role of a bird cage?`
` Making certain the little bird inside never escapes.`
` ...What's a bird cage worth if it has cracks that sometimes let a bird out?"`
`"......O-Of course, games exist for the purpose of winning.`
` And it is impossible for me to lose.`
` ...Therefore, I will continue to win...`
` ...As you wish, for all eternity..."`
`"Good answer, that'll be fine.`
` ...I'll allow you to play around and use fakes as part of your tactics.`
` It ended up being useful during parts of this round."`
`"......But you know what?`
` If you make a move hoping for anything else other than victory,`
` ......make sure you're prepared for something amazing, okay?"`
`"I-I will not do such a thing...`
` I swear it...!"`
`"......Because originally, you weren't even a witch, and at any time, `
`I'll remind you what a truly shabby creature you were.`
` ......If you betray my expectations, that is.`
` As soon as you do, you can look forward to a fun, fun punishment game."`
`"...In the world of billions of Fragments, ...I'll send you into the most miserable one and seal you there.`
` ......You were already miserable to start with, so there's gonna be some reeeally miserable Fragments out there for the picking.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"............"`
`"Oh, I love you Bernkastel.`
` ...Struggle in Beatrice's bird cage as much as you like,`
` and over the course of a thousand years, realize that you can no longer escape."`
`"...And when you surrender,`
` ...I'll train you so that you can't do anything other than cry in the palm of my hand."`
`"......*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*`
` Ahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`'!sd`
`@:dwave_eng 0, bea_9e89:`
`"...Dried plum black tea.`
` ...The kind that goes for 200 yen a pack."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!`
` ...For a thousand years, I have been fond of black tea, but I did not know of such a thing.`
` ...I will never tire of living in this world."`
`"......Beato,`
` you don't have to display such hostility.`
` ...I am just a wandering witch.`
` I didn't come with the intention of violating the rules of your territory."`
`"...*cackle*cackle* Hostility? I bear nothing of the sort.`
` ...I am just terribly concerned with seeing to it that the legendary witch, Lady Bernkastel, is well attended to."`
`"...You misunderstand.`
` I am powerless.`
` Before a witch such as you, who possesses the dreadful power to kill an individual a hundred times, I am completely powerless."`
`"That a powerless Lady Witch like you possesses a power that none can approach is what is truly terrifying.`
` After all, that Great Witch, Lady Lambdadelta, was dethroned by you alone."`
`"...I only won an endurance contest.`
` She simply got tired."`
`"That is not what Lady Lambdadelta said though.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle* Too much humility can be unseemly, Lady Bernkastel."`
`"...That girl has a dreadful power.`
` ...The power to kill an individual 'without fail'.`
` However, 'without fail' doesn't exist in this world.`
` No matter how many times you divide one, you can never reach zero.`
` That girl has the power to bring the odds of failure down to 'almost exactly zero', ...the power to give rise to 'almost perfect certainty'.`
` ...I hope I never have to fight such a terrifying witch again."`
`"However, you have the power to cause success without fail, 'as long as the odds are not zero'.`
` ...Though you say 'without fail' doesn't exist in this world, you possess an infallible power yourself.`
` ...How very terrifying, *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"...The power to kill an individual 'endlessly'...`
` ...I think you're the more terrifying one."`
`"You jest.`
` ...From your point of view, mine is but a trifling power.`
` This is most certainly what one would call empty praise."`
`"...Call it flattery to make up for the cost of staying here.`
` ...I am a fleeing traveler who crosses the #fefefeFragments#ffffff, continually running from boredom.`
` ...I simply came around because I heard you'd started something interesting.`
` Have no doubts that I will choose to leave as soon as you are no longer interesting."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!`
` I, Beatrice, am deeply and humbly delighted to have the great Lady Bernkastel as an observer.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` And so, your impressions?"`
`"...Lambdadelta is terrifying because of her cruelty, but she's a girl I can understand.`
` ...You do seem to be capable of affection, but I can't understand you at all.`
` That makes you much more terrifying than her."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!`
` I am fickle by nature.`
` Do forgive me.`
` ...Besides, I believe you also enjoy entrusting your fate to the roll of fickle dice, right, Lady Bernkastel?"`
`"...When I roll the dice, I have a roll I clearly want to get.`
` Unlike you.`
` You, on the other hand, never let the dice fall from your hand.`
` So, whatever the roll might have been, you're never disappointed.`
` Whatever roll the dice show you, you are satisfied 'without fail'.`
` ...In that sense, you far surpass me."`
`"...You're one I really don't want to fight with.`
` Inside of you, there's nothing but zero.`
` That's why I can't win against you with my power.`
` ...It's the worst compatibility.`
` ...Perhaps Lambdadelta, on the other hand, has a good compatibility against you.`
` Since she would be able to kill your 'endless' nature."`
`"*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` ...Oh yes, witches truly are the best people to enjoy black tea with.`
` One doesn't get bored.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"...Then, I'm relieved.`
` Boredom is the only poison that can kill me.`
` ...So, don't kill me, okay?`
` Lady Beatrice, Endless Witch."`
`"If such is your wish, I, Beatrice, shall show you an even better time.`
` ...In that case, wouldn't it be best if I brought the next chessboard in right away?`
` It seems the next tale would do more for you than another cup of black tea."`
`"..............."`
`"Just wait for a moment.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*!"`
`...Something troublesome seems to have taken a liking to you.`
`I'd really like to lend you my power, but as you just heard, that girl's power and mine have a very bad compatibility.`
` Unfortunate as that may be.`
`But you really are pitiful, so I'll help you out just a bit.`
`First of all, about that girl.`
`She does have the name Beatrice, but that doesn't necessarily mean she is 'one individual woman'.`
`Get what I mean?`
`In other words, she's not some Human.`
`Her existence is a personification of the rules of this world.`
`To beat her, you have to expose the rules of this world and unravel them.`
`Perhaps this can be likened to learning the rules of chess by watching a game.`
`First, take a good look at the chessboard.`
`Then, learn the movements and roles of the pieces.`
`Then, look for the conditions required to win at her game.`
`When you've managed to reveal all these things, her heart will be exposed.`
`After that, you can rip it apart or crush it as you please.`
`...I am being quite generous.`
`In the past, when I had a human body, it took me a hundred years to notice even this much.`
`This is my meager farewell gift to you, the pitiful one captured by Beato.`
` It's just like a spoon.`
`A spoon can be used for more than just drinking soup.`
`You can use it to dig through the prison you're locked in, or as a weapon to gouge the witch's eyes out.`
`...Of course, you can also use the spoon to continually sip the watery soup inside your eternal cell.`
`...Don't get the wrong idea. I have no intention of becoming your ally.`
`I do feel empathy for you, but I won't help you.`
`...It's like I'm sitting in front of the television yelling at you on the other side, even though my voice won't reach you.`
`SO, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I AM A WITCH, RIGHT?`
`I intend to enjoy this endless tale that Beato is going to weave until I tire of it.`
`But that alone won't hold my interest.`
`...That's why I'll lend you my power.`
` It's all so that I don't get tired of this.`
`I am the cruelest witch in the world.`
`Whoever the opponent may be, I'll make them surrender with certainty.`
`...Even if it's Beatrice, the Endless Witch, okay...?`
`You are my game piece.`
` Give it your best shot.`
`I'll give you advice sometimes, out of her sight.`
`Don't bore me, okay...?`
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*...`
`"Well then,`
` ...did you find that game enjoyable?"`
`"...A game that one-sided goes beyond being riveting. It's boring."`
`"*cackle*cackle* My, my, but you're as harsh as always.`
` ...Considering how proud I was to have created a development so `
`impactful that it might satisfy even the boredom-hating Lady Bernkastel, this response is quite harsh."`
`"...Well, I'll admit it was impactful.`
` ...However, it was horrible as a fair game.`
` Unless you make the conditions a bit more even-"`
`"...Are you saying there's no way to win?`
` Not even for Lady Bernkastel?`
` ...*cackle*cackle*."`
`".........I wonder what you mean by that, Beato."`
`~ib~`
`~ib~`
`"There's no need to try and fool me.`
` I already know.`
` ...That ~ib~you're no bystander~ib~."`
`"............"`
`"Were you planning on hiding it?`
` You're an outrageous person to come into someone else's territory from such a great distance to work against them.`
` You came to watch from the sidelines, and probably to push strongly for my defeat.`
` I've guessed right, haven't I...?"`
`".........`
`And if so?"`
`"...*cackle*cackle*!`
` Truly amusing!`
` That I should be granted a chance to fight against Lady Bernkastel, the strongest of witches who defeated Lady Lambdadelta, is truly a pleasure!!"`
`"...Yes.`
` I'm also pleased.`
` I came all this way because I really wanted to see you, brimming with confidence, fall apart and lose."`
`"What an honest person.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!`
` Even so, it would be a shame if the contest between me and the great Lady Bernkastel`
` was resolved without at least one observer."`
`".........`
`...You called her here, didn't you.`
` That kid."`
`"Hohohohohoh!`
` I found you, I've finally found you, Bernkastel!!"`
`"......How are you, Lambda?`
` Looks like you've got lots of spare time too.`
` I wonder if it's fate that the pair who hates boredom should run into each other again..."`
`"Stupid kid.`
` Can't you see you only won against me because of a little luck and a problem of compatibility?`
` After that, you became such a brag, and now you're even picking a fight with Beatrice? Shouldn't you learn your place?"`
`"*giggle* Beatrice is strong.`
` And she's even more brutal than I am.`
` Just a bit!"`
`"And by the way, don't go shortening people's names without their permission!"`
`"......You're dumb too, Beato.`
` If this kid's in your game, she'll make a mess of everything."`
`"I certainly didn't just bring Lady Lambdadelta here to watch from the sidelines.`
` After informing me that you were betting against me, she said that she would bet against you."`
`"............You're still holding a grudge, aren't you."`
`"Hohohohoh!!`
` Because I'm the strongest witch in the universe.`
` But I lost to you, which means I'm not the strongest!`
` So any enemy of yours is my ally!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` And there you have it.`
` With the great Lady Bernkastel as our opponent, this may not even count as a handicap, but it should make for good entertainment."`
`"......Do as you like.`
` ...Now that I've been exposed, allow me to get serious."`
`"That would be well.`
` 'Going easy' has never been written in my dictionary.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Lady Lambdadelta, let us enjoy our precious time together."`
`"Yeah, I'll be counting on you, Lady Beatrice!`
` I've been betrayed pretty bad by her too.`
` Until the two of us smash her up and pay her back double, I won't be able to rest!!"`
`"......I'll be counting on you, Lambda.`
` And you, Beato.`
` ...No matter what we fight over, this will be a very significant battle for us all."`
`"That's right.`
` Of course, I don't plan on losing, but we've got a goal beyond who wins and who loses."`
`"After all, we hate boredom."`
`The three witches giggled, cackled, and guffawed.`
`"...That's right.`
` I should thank you, Beato.`
` It looks like I'll finally be able to escape my boredom.`
` Do your best to entertain me.`
` Along with Lambdadelta."`
`"Leave it to me.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!!"`
`"If we're decided, Beato, then let's start a strategy meeting right now!`
` I know all of this girl's weak points, and I'll teach you all of them!"`
`"And yet, Lady Lambdadelta, you were defeated by her, *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"Urrrrrrrrgggh, I won't tell you, I won't tell you!`
` Tsun!"`
`"*cackle*cackle* Hahhahahahahahaha!`
` ...She's never boring, that Lady Lambdadelta."`
`"......Isn't she?`
` Take care of her.`
` She gets lonely easily."`
`"I see.`
` So she's one of 'those' that are popular these days.`
` *cackle* As expected from Lady Lambdadelta.`
` Quite cutting edge.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`"Go already.`
` That kid's waiting for you to chase after her."`
`"...Then, if you'll excuse me.`
` See you next game.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`...I'm sorry.`
`That troublesome one came, but don't mind it.`
`More importantly, `
`......things sure got ugly.`
`I thought I experienced a very tragic end in Lambda's game, `
`......but this one is...exceptionally horrible.`
`...I can't say I don't understand why you're hugging your knees and closing up your heart.`
`If you meet a fate like that a few more times, `
`it'll take a lot less than a hundred years to kill your heart.`
`...Beato saw through me, so I'll confess.`
`You are now just like I was in the past, when I was imprisoned inside Lambda's world.`
`Shut inside a labyrinth of cruel fate, tormented by a witch, in a manner of speaking.`
`...I am a witch who was born from there.`
`...So maybe I'm like an older sister to you.`
` So I decided that I'd lend you my power.`
`'!s1`
`......even compared to my fate, `
`...yours is...truly brutal.`
`Not only do I sympathize with you, I'm almost brought to tears by your tragic fate.`
`But please, don't lose heart.`
`Please don't submit to Beato, no matter what.`
`Certainly, that child's game is quite unfair.`
`I've only been allowed a glimpse of the game board,`
` but the unfair and clever devices set up on the stage are so disgusting...that I imagine they far surpass those on Lambdadelta's game board.`
`And what's even more frightening...is that when that kid moves a piece, she doesn't always make the best possible move.`
`This is where she's very different from Lambda.`
`Lambda always uses an overpowering number of pieces to make the best possible move in order to win.`
`But Beato sometimes intentionally goes easy on her opponent when she moves her pieces.`
`Since, when we're in trouble, we try to seek out our opponent's strategy by looking at their moves,`
` this creates a very formidable amount of noise in our information.`
`That might cause a troublesome amount of disorder.`
`...However, as in chess, `
`though a player might be able to create some noise for their opponent with a useless move, they'll still miss out on the more valuable move they avoided.`
`In other words, it's not like your opportunities to take advantage of this are zero.`
`Although you may not be able to believe it, that analogy holds true for this game as well.`
`...Even though those developments looked so overpowering, `
`...there actually was a weak point.`
`A weak point that almost looks like she wanted you to take advantage of it.`
`...Though, I don't know if it's a trap or if she's testing us.`
`Anyway, don't surrender.`
`Don't stop thinking.`
`Don't deny any possibility.`
`As long as you continue to hold the will to fight, Beato will not win.`
`What's the most important element in defense during a witch's battle?`
`Rather than trying to win, try not to lose.`
`...If accepting her means your defeat, then you definitely mustn't accept her.`
`...Making you accept witches.`
`There is no longer any doubt that this is one of Beatrice's victory conditions.`
`Now that I have announced that I'm your ally, I too will make as great an effort as possible to lend you my power.`
`Make an effort yourself as well.`
`If you're still hugging your knees, quickly stand back up.`
`'!s1`
`......Umm, uh, `
`......g-`
`go for it, `
`Meep, `
`nipah-☆`
`......It's so embarrassing, doing this.`
`...I've done this much for you, so quickly stand back up.`
`"...Ah, there you are.`
` I wonder where Bern shrank off to?`
` *giggle* Could she be any more lame?"`
`Even so.`
`Just like usual, the pieces Bern chooses are pretty shabby.`
`It's the same with chess, right?`
`If all of your pieces were pawns, you'd have zero chance to win, right?`
`If all of your pieces were rooks and bishops, you definitely wouldn't lose.`
`...W-Well, last time, right when I felt just a little pity and said she could start with her pieces anywhere she wanted,`
` that idiot Bern, without taking notice of my compassion, started with all of her pawns on my side of the board!!`
`What's up with that? That wasn't a loss or anything!!`
` Aaah, just remembering it makes me queasy.`
`Because of that, I won't be able to rest until I see Bern's speechless face.`
`And since you, Bern's piece, fucked up so bad, I'm feeling just great!`
`Plus, she may not look it, but that girl really hates to lose, `
`so I'll bet she's off somewhere grinding her teeth and crying her eyes out right now.`
` How totally lame, *giggle*, hoohohohohohohohoh!`
`C'mon, laugh with me, ohohohohoh!`
`......Wait a sec.`
`Are you still hugging your knees?`
`You're already like this just because Beato got a little serious?`
`Could you be any more pathetic?`
`You're so pathetic, I'll help you just a little bit.`
`I, the great Lady Lambdadelta, the Witch of Certainty and the strongest in the universe,`
` will associate myself just a tiny bit with you and your hopeless chances at winning.`
` You should thank me.`
`You know, Beatrice may really be a cruel and powerful witch, but she's no match for me.`
`Why?`
` Because she's soft.`
`Though she'll set up the board in a way that'll let her win with just a few more moves, she'll intentionally avoid cornering you.`
`She'll do things like take worthless pieces and place excess pieces on the board to make things more one-sided.`
`Simply put, she's got the bad habit of playing around as soon as she thinks she's won.`
`Almost all the various attacks that hurt you and Bern......`
`look like utter waste and overkill to me.`
`...In other words, she's got a weakness, and you've got a chance.`
` See?`
` She isn't an opponent to be afraid of, right?`
`She sometimes mistakes her means for her ends.`
`And she has too much dark fun.`
`Sometimes, that even ends up creating and exposing her own weak points.`
`For a super-powerful witch like me, it's hard to understand why she's able to act so tough.`
`Why she lowers her own chances of winning.`
`......But, well.`
`Because of that, a witch like Bern, who likes to thoroughly read her opponent, has a really bad affinity with her.`
` Because reading her doesn't work.`
`...Maybe it's really easy for Bern to read and handle a straightforward and honest type like me.`
` Annoyingly enough!`
`...Well, still, a super firepower type like me can flat out beat up a light, wide-range barrage type like Beatrice, `
`so it's kinda like rock-paper-scissors.`
`If I'm paper, Beato is rock.`
`Which means Bern is scissors.`
`Well, maybe that doesn't matter.`
`Even though my paper loses to Bern's scissors,`
` if I was a sheet of super-paper, which is way more awesome than normal paper, I could beat even scissors, right?!`
`Bascially, I, Lady Lambdadelta, `
`am super-paper!`
` Hohohohoh!`
`It looks like you've regained a bit of your color.`
`That Beato, she's having fun torturing some piece called Rosa.`
`At a glance, you'd think she has really nasty tastes, right?`
` Wrong.`
`...She's just killing time, hoping that you'll stand back up and return.`
`It's a move to fire up your righteous indignation by intentionally doing something detestable.`
`Ah man, I hate kids like that!`
`Anyway, I'll head on back.`
`Ah!`
` Don't tell anyone about me helping you out just a little bit!`
`I mean, it's not like I helped you because I wanted to save you, okay?!`
`I, the strongest witch in the universe, had my throne stolen away when I lost to Bern!`
`So I've gotta take that throne back from her,`
` but if she loses to Beato here, then it's Beato who'll get the position of strongest next, right?!`
`...Well, it's not like I'm complaining. It'd be easier to steal the throne back from Beato, but then I wouldn't be satisfied, you see?!`
`I will defeat Bern!`
`And I'll take back my position as the strongest!`
`It's not like I'm really helping you, okay?!`
`I won't forgive you if you make Bern cry!`
`'!sd`
`The room was colored with hygienic tones...in other words, an emotionless white.`
`...It was a room at a certain university hospital.`
`Neither her doctors nor the person herself had any doubts that this room, `
`which had a price so high that no commoner could afford to spend a single night there, would be the last room she ever saw...`
`Was the person on the bed...`
`...Eva?`
`Even if someone told you that was so, she was unbelievably aged and worn out.`
`The well-built man in a suit waiting in the corner near the door was having a whispered conversation through an intercom with someone outside.`
`...He was a guard protecting Eva's person.`
`After telling the person on the other end of the intercom to wait, he approached Eva's bed.`
`...Eva had been awake for a short while.`
`...However, she stared at a single point in empty space, as though her mind was not in the same place.`
`"...Ange (縁寿)-san has arrived in the lobby below.`
` Should we let her pass?"`
`"............"`
`For a long time, Eva didn't answer.`
`However, bit by bit, her eyes began to regain their focus, and she gave a small nod, indicating that she didn't mind if they called Ange.`
`...It had been Eva who called her.`
`And she was right on time.`
`By this point, Eva would refuse anyone who wanted a meeting without an appointment.`
`The room was dark, even though it was still light outside, ...because the curtains were always closed.`
`...There was always one guard waiting in the room, and three more waiting in the corridor and the lobby.`
`They were all there to protect Eva's person...`
`Eventually, there was the sound of a knock.`
`Also, there was a message from the intercom that the guest's body check had been completed with no problems.`
`The door was unlocked, then opened, `
`......and a high school aged girl was standing there.`
`"Chairman,`
` Ange-san has arrived."`
`Eva reacted and turned her face towards the guest.`
`However, instead of reacting to the guard's call, maybe it would be better to say that she reacted to the smell of Ange's makeup.`
`...After being shut up in this room for so long, Eva was sensitive to even small changes in smell.`
`"............`
`So you came,`
` ...Ange."`
`"...I came.`
` You did call me."`
`On Eva's face, there was no trace of a person warmly welcoming their niece.`
`...And on Ange's face, you couldn't see the expression of one pleased to meet with their aunt.`
`Eva waved her arm, which had grown as thin as a withered branch, and motioned for the guard to leave.`
`The guard bowed silently and went out into the hall.`
`"...It's not only stuffy, but dark too.`
`"......Is your plan for that hit man you hired to shoot me through the window...?"`
`"......I wish I could get hired to assassinate you.`
` All I'd have to do is relax at home for a month and the job would take care of itself."`
`"...Heheheheh, hahhahhahhahha..."`
`Their discussion was quite morbid for an aunt and niece.`
`...However, they didn't look like they were joking.`
`...At the very least, Eva believed that someone was after her life.`
`All of the Ushiromiya family's massive fortune had come into the possession of Ushiromiya Eva.`
`...It was said that this fortune also included the 10 tons of hidden gold that Ushiromiya Kinzo was rumored to have hidden.`
`While this vast wealth lay in Eva's cunning, sly, and suspicious hands, no one was able to complain,`
` ...but it was rumored that as soon as it was passed on to Ange, who was no more than a young girl, certain people were plotting to snatch it away.`
`By now, Eva and Ange were Kinzo's only descendants.`
`...If Eva died, all of the wealth would go to Ange.`
`...And if Ange were then to be killed as well, `
`...that wealth would go to the family of Ange's mother, Kyrie.`
`In this sense, not only Eva, but Ange as well,`
` ...were in a position where it wouldn't be odd at all for their life to be targeted by some unknown person.`
`...And Eva had hated Ange for a long time.`
`This was because she knew that, after losing her only precious son, George, `
`...the inheritor of her own wealth would be none other than the girl who had been absent at that family conference 12 years ago, `
`and who had survived.`
`Eva shunned Ange, disliked her, and even hated her.`
`She isolated Ange in a special school and separated her from the youth and happiness normal people have, trying to keep her as a pet until death.`
`...However, Eva had succumbed to an incurable illness,`
` and ironically, ...her remaining life was estimated to be the same as Kinzo's had been at that family conference 12 years ago.`
`Both Eva and Ange...hated each other.`
`Even though they were each other's last blood relatives, ...they hated each other so much that they hoped the other would die quickly...`
`"......And?`
` Why did you go to all the trouble of calling for me...?"`
`"...I don't have much time left.`
` ...These quack doctors still can't detect any of the poison that's filling me up.`
` ......I know.`
` I'm sure it's some secret assassination drug used by those Soviet KGBs.`
` ...Ooh, I'm gonna be killed, I'm gonna be killed...!!`
` Isn't that great?! Very soon, I will die, which will surely be quite a load off your back...!"`
`"............`
`...What a pitiable person."`
`This always happened.`
`...They immediately deviated from the main topic, distorting it into a more unsettling discussion.`
`Eva, who was absolutely paranoid, believed that someone was always after her life.`
`And in actual fact, after inheriting the vast wealth of the Ushiromiya family,`
` she had used wild methods just like Kinzo had done in the past, repeatedly making money by any means necessary and creating many enemies along the way.`
`With a massive supply of capital, she had plotted to aggressively buy businesses that were starting to have rapid growth, `
`making them buy it back at a high price under the guise of reconciliation.`
`...Ironically, it was the same type of action that her husband's company had been hit with 12 years ago...`
`She had repeated this constantly for 12 years.`
`...She had also earned a lot of hatred.`
`If her husband had heard of this from beyond the grave, he might have defended her, saying that the loneliness from losing her family fueled her actions.`
`...However, of all the people who knew her now, none would defend her.`
`For some time, Eva eloquently spoke of how her life was being targeted,`
` listing off names of people who hated her,`
` and sneering at the fact that she still hadn't been killed.`
`Even though Ange heard her own name included in that list,`
` there was no particular change in her expression, and she waited indifferently for Eva to tire herself out...`
`"......You see, `
`...I really hate you."`
`"I'm honored.`
` Same here."`
`"......I built this future for George's sake.`
` ...To think that it would be snatched away by you.`
` ...To think that it would be stolen away by Rudolf's daughter...`
` ......I can't bear it.`
`'!s1`
`...without even leaving behind a child...`
` ......That, `
`...I cannot forgive......!"`
`"...If only you'd just give all of your fortune to charity.`
` What about all those religious people you used to go so far out of your way to find?"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*!`
` They all say the same thing.`
` ...My excessive wealth has become a burden to me.`
` And they always say something about how I need to give it up and cleanse myself.`
` ...Ahhahahahahahahahaha!`
` Then I thought of something.`
` I stopped donating!"`
`For a time, Eva had searched for the founders of several strange and new religious cults, perhaps seeking peace in her heart.`
`...But they gave her heart no relief, `
`and if anything, they ended up increasing her paranoia further...`
`"......If you have too much money, why don't you start buying up thoroughbreds and make some corned beef?"`
`"I've thought of something even more interesting.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I've worried over it a lot.`
` What could I do to make things horrible for you?"`
`"...I thought about killing you.`
` I also thought about erasing all of my wealth, leaving you penniless, and selling you off to a slave trader or something.`
` Wouldn't that be wonderful?`
` You'd have your arms and legs chopped off and be forced to take customers until you died.`
` Aaah, that would be so wonderful, `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"......Is this fun for you?"`
`"Oh yes, it is.`
` It's fun to scare you, `
`...but very soon, I will die.`
` ...So I thought about how I might continue to cause you pain even after my death.`
` ......And then, ...*cackle*cackle*!!`
` It was surprisingly simple.`
` ...I called you because I wanted to talk about it."`
`".........I have midterms coming up.`
` Keep it brief."`
`"...I have decided.`
` I will have you inherit all of my fortune."`
`"............`
`...Oh?"`
`"Not only that, `
`...but I decided that until the very day I die, `
`...I'll expand that fortune as much as I can, inflating it to massive proportions before having you inherit all of it.`
` ...*cackle*cackle* Can you even imagine what that would be like...?"`
`"...I don't get it.`
` Because it's stupid."`
`"Ehhehhehheh, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` That's right, you don't get it, do you...?!`
` Look forward to it, it really is fun, being rich...!`
` Every day, youkai from across Japan come to play."`
`"From now on, your entire life will be followed by talk shows and weekly magazines.`
` The media will criticize me no matter what I do or don't do!`
` If I donate, they'll attack me for being bourgeois, and if I hesitate, I'll be abused as a miser.`
` Oh, every day really is wonderful, you see?`
` I decided it'd be great let you have that kind of life, when you're so young and have so much ahead of you.`
` Doesn't that sound absolutely wonderful?"`
`"......Looks like the public's opinion of all you've done was spot on."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Too true, yes, that is too true.`
` ...Go ahead, abuse me as much as you want.`
` Soon, you will face that same criticism.`
` ...Japanese culture dictates that good people live in honorable poverty, while the wealthy should just die.`
` No matter what you do or do not do, you will eventually be lifted up as a symbol of envy and hate across Japan.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"I wonder how twisted your life will become after living that way...`
` You have no allies!`
` No one will listen to your worries.`
` Abusing you will become a public sport.`
` And no one can stop that!"`
`'!s1`
`@:dwave_eng 0, eva_9e79:`
`oh, I'm really looking forward to it.`
` ...I wonder how you will live your life...and how you'll end it...!`
` Enjoy to the fullest a life of being unable to trust anyone in the world, being unable to love anyone, being unable to talk with anyone...!!`
` I'll be patiently waiting for you to take that story of hardship down with you into hell.`
` Heheheheh, `
`ahahhahahahahahahaha, `
`wa-hhahhahhahhahhahhhahahahahahahahahahhahha, `
`gkk, `
`*cough*cough*, `
`ghah!!"`
`Her insane laughter turned into a painful cough.`
`Without changing her expression in the slightest, looking completely unconcerned, `
`...Ange stared at the only survivor of Rokkenjima.`
`Perhaps because he found the violent coughing suspicious, the guard gave a short knock on the door and rushed in at the same time.`
`Ange glanced at him, wordlessly making it clear that she didn't intend to move a step from where she was.`
`...Ange was prepared for some kind of trap to frame her in Eva's death.`
`However, that was fortunately a needless fear.`
`As the guard rubbed Eva's back, he poured hot water from a thermos into a mug.`
`As he did, Eva kept coughing, apparently in pain.`
`Ange figured that this was probably the last she'd see of the Rokkenjima Witch's final days.`
`Eventually, the coughing subsided, and Eva regained her normal breathing.`
`...However, the glittering madness inside her eyes hadn't subsided in the slightest.`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Now, I will give to you...`
`that cursed mass of gold and the Ushiromiya Family Headship, `
`...as well as...`
`...the name of the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
` ......Enjoy the insane, twisted rest of your life, fitting for the name of the witch...!"`
`"I don't need that.`
` More importantly, tell me.`
` ...On that day, what happened on Rokkenjima?`
` ......I don't believe it was an accident.`
` Tell me the truth about what happened that day, and why Father and Mother and Nii-san died...!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!`
` Oh, yes, that is the best way I have to harass you, isn't it?`
` ...What happened on that day?`
` What happened on this day in 1986...?`
` ...You want to know what they said before they died, riiight...?"`
`"I won't tell yoooooouu, `
`aaahhhyahhyahhyahhyah!!`
` I'll leave behind the cursed gold!`
` But you know what? I'll take the truth you seek with me to hell...!`
` That's the best way I can torment you!!"`
`"Oh, are you mad?`
` If you want to hear it so much, try going to hell and asking your family there!`
` In that case, you'd better die right now, right?!`
` Ahhahahahahaha, if only you'd just give up and die right now!!`
` Waaahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`That laugh continued until she started coughing again.`
`And that cough did not subside until she started moaning and going into convulsions...`
`October 4, 1986.`
`On Rokkenjima, the Ushiromiya family's customary...and final family conference was held.`
`And on the next day, October 5...`
`'An extremely unfortunate accident' occurred, and the Ushiromiya family was wiped out.`
`'Fortunately', Ushiromiya Eva escaped from that...`
`and inherited almost all of the Ushiromiya family's fortune.`
`However, due to the many turbulent rumors surrounding the Ushiromiya family, the way Eva acted afterwards, `
`and her unnatural actions 'at the time of the unfortunate accident', the public was in an uproar over whether this might have been a conspiracy to get all of the inheritance for herself.`
`Under pressure from the public, prosecutors repeatedly tried to investigate the matter, `
`and the media began tracing the outline of a conspiracy they called the Rokkenjima Suspicion,`
` but in the end, they weren't even able to find proof that this 'unfortunate accident' was a crime.`
`However, because the media continued to give the impression that the Rokkenjima Suspicion was a conspiracy of Eva's,`
` public opinion began to believe that she was the true culprit.`
`...Of course, that was also influenced by the bad impression caused by all that easily-condemnable, overbearing financial activity,`
` which she had carried out using that vast wealth.`
`Every time she did something and the rumors started spreading, the media would bring back the Rokkenjima Suspicion, `
`blaming the criminal justice system by saying that she was the true culprit, and that the only reason she hadn't been arrested was because even the police had been bribed.`
`So the impression that she was a great villain grew stronger and stronger...`
`Her heart eventually degenerated, `
`...and ironically, it began to transfigure her into the kind of human that the public expected...`
`By now, Eva had no one she could trust...and no family.`
`...After her beloved husband passed away, the talk shows occasionally mentioned his company, `
`saying that it was run recklessly, while criticizing and disgracing its former accomplishments.`
`Even her beloved son, George, `
`was dramatized as the stereotypical 'rich, lazy son' that the public expected,`
` ...and no one even wanted to know what a simple and honest character he had possessed.`
`...As to how much all of this hurt Eva and ran her to ruin, ...no one cared.`
`The public was only interested out of curiosity...`
`about how a super-rich evil woman who killed her whole family lived her pitiful later years.`
`So that happened more and more, `
`...and eventually...`
`...Eva's personality was transfigured until people started calling her a lunatic...`
`It was said that this sometimes reminded her of her father, whom she had once admired, in his later years, `
`and that she laughed at herself with scorn...`
`And, on the day of that final family conference...`
`Because Ushiromiya Rudolf's daughter, Ange, had been sick and had stayed with her mother's family, she had not participated.`
`At the age of 6, she had lost her family and had gained Eva as her guardian.`
`Since Ange had become Eva's only blood relative,`
` Eva 'took very good care of her'.`
`She had imposing guards surrounding Ange's person at all times, to prevent her from coming to harm.`
`...Ange had even her right to play with friends, to come home from school together, and to enjoy the seasons together...stolen away.`
`'So that she can live a full and pleasant school life',`
` Eva had sent Ange to an elegant boarding school that took care of her every need, completely isolating her from the world.`
`She didn't even know the popular songs that girls her age might hum.`
`She was never given a chance to enjoy window shopping with her friends or stuffing her mouth with crepes,`
` ...much less an encounter with a member of the opposite sex to make her heart throb.`
`Ange did not have a single friend.`
`If anyone carelessly acted friendly with Ange, they would be scolded by the guards, or else the teachers.`
`...All of them were strictly ordered not to let shabby humans approach the daughter of the esteemed Ushiromiya family.`
`During that time, the talk shows were always mentioning Ushiromiya Eva, always spreading rumors about her countless financial misdeeds.`
`...Those who knew who her 'daughter' was naturally began to keep their distance.`
`...Even now, she was called a witch at school, and anytime something bad happened,`
` even if there was no proof, it would be whispered--whispered as though if were absolute truth--that she had imposed her will on the school staff.`
`The environment makes the person.`
`By now, she had a heart as wild as those around her feared.`
`...No one trusted her, so she never bothered to believe in anyone.`
`No one loved her, so she never even tried to love.`
`And when Eva caught an incurable illness on top of all this,`
` it was whispered that this too was a conspiracy, and this time, Ange was set up as the mastermind...`
`Everyone whispered that the daughters of witches are witches too.`
`Even the talk shows and the weekly magazines whispered that.`
`'!s0`
`accepted it as though it was definitely...`
`no, `
`as though it was obviously true.`
`Therefore, since she already believed that she was a witch, `
`when she heard that the name of the Golden Witch was being turned over to her, she only felt like saying 'You just figured that out now?'`
`However, she was at least sure of one thing.`
`This title of witch that she had inherited...would definitely never be inherited by anyone else.`
`She would be the last Head of the Ushiromiya Family, and the last lonely...Golden Witch...`
`Ange could be seen on the roof of a skyscraper.`
`Compared to the winds of the world that had beaten down upon her until now, this strong, cold wind was warm and pleasant.`
`Below her lay a beautiful nighttime scene, and a dazzling river of red and white lights.`
`It was supposed to be clear out that night.`
`...So there really should have been countless stars stretching out over the sky.`
`...However, the light from the ground was too bright, so you couldn't see them at all.`
`...Ange couldn't help but think that what she truly sought must lie in that unseen starlight.`
`The world of reality below her looked so far away from here.`
`...She could imagine that this place was the closest to the world she really should be in.`
`......There was only one thing that Ange cursed.`
`Why had she not been able to go to that family conference, on that day 12 years ago?`
`Even though, if she had gone, it would probably have been possible for her to stay with her family forever.`
`...Lately, ...she'd been dreaming about her family over and over again.`
`The person I was 12 years ago calls out frantically, urging them not to go to the family conference.`
`But both Dad and Mom are too far away, and my hand won't reach them.`
`Battler nii-san always loved me a lot, and he'd always pat my head, `
`......but even though it looks like that hand's about to touch me, even it does not reach.`
`For some reason, I started having that dream over and over.`
`...Every time I had that the same dream, `
`I uselessly tried to stretch out my hand even more forcefully, over and over and over.`
`Even if only Battler nii-san had lived...`
`......Then, perhaps, we'd at least be able to support each other in my cold and lonely reality.`
`But his hand never reaches me.`
`Even if I climb to the roof of this tall building, `
`...I'm so far away from all of them.`
`...A mysterious girl appears in my dreams and urges me.`
`She urges me to find the truth of what happened 12 years ago.`
`"............`
`...If only I could learn...`
`...everything that happened to Father and the rest of them on that day, `
`......would they come back?`
` At least one of them...?!"`
`There was no way...`
`that anyone would answer that question for her.`
`I get it.`
`......In this world, I have no family or friends.`
`So, `
`......let's go.`
` ...Let's go home.`
`...To where my family is.`
`From the start, ...Ange's figure had been on the outer side of the fence.`
`The scenery below her eyes was distant, beautiful, and so fantastical that it actually didn't give rise to fear.`
`If I look down, I'll surely be swallowed up by the world below.`
`...So I looked up.`
`Because I wanted to be taken to the world above, the world where my family was.`
`......Who cares about vast wealth?`
`Who cares about cursed gold?`
`Who cares about the Golden Witch, Beatrice?`
`What I really want, even a mountain of gold couldn't get me...`
`What I need for that...is to take a single step forward, ...just that little bit of courage.`
`......At that moment,`
` ...I definitely heard a voice.`
`It was a voice I knew.`
`A voice that had...called to me in my dreams for so long...`
`Before my eyes...in other words, in mid-air above that jet black nighttime scenery...`
`...There was the figure of the girl I'd seen in my dreams...`
`She spoke again, with the same voice I'd heard in those dreams.`
`"......Your assistance is required."`
`"...My...`
`...assistance...?`
` Who needs it...?"`
`"......Your family needs it.`
` ...Your family has been eternally imprisoned in the span from this day 12 years ago until the following day."`
`"I-If I save them, `
`...does that mean my family will come home?!"`
`When I asked the question I had most wanted to, the girl cruelly stopped talking and hung her head.`
`"...I cannot promise that.`
` The enemy is the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
` ...A mighty opponent.`
` I cannot oppose her.`
` ...But, another Golden Witch might be able to manage something."`
`"......I-I don't know...what you're talking about."`
`"...The only one who can oppose the Beatrice of 1986...`
`is the final Beatrice of 1998.`
` ......In other words, you.`
` Ange.`
` ......#fefefeANGE#ffffff Beatrice."`
`"That witch from 12 years ago...`
`...took away my family......?"`
`"That's right.`
` She is your foe.`
` ......The root cause that always leads to your future of isolation."`
`"............`
`'!s1`
`...family's...`
`...foe."`
`"...In exchange, I will search for a Fragment with the ideal world that you wish for, a world where your family comes home.`
` ......I make no promises that your desire will be granted.`
` ...Beatrice's game board in 1986 is quite perfect."`
`"...I had planned on bringing you that ideal Fragment as a present today, but I still can't find it.`
` ......This is a very firm fate.`
` I haven't seen the likes of it since the time I fought Lambdadelta."`
`".....................`
`I-`
`I don't know...`
`what you're talking about."`
`"......I'm giving you a chance for revenge.`
` ...In exchange, I promise to search for and bring you the happiest resolution among the possibilities you're capable of accepting."`
`"............Revenge..."`
`"...It may be a fruitless effort.`
` Even if you succeed in your revenge, there's no definite proof that your family will return.`
` Even if you manage to hit a miraculous probability, you may only be able to bring one person back, if that."`
`...Ange understood the meaning of that dream.`
`...The dream where it seemed that, with just a little more stretching, her hand might be able to reach at least Battler nii-san.`
`"A miraculous probability...means it's still higher than zero, right...?`
` Is it 1%...?"`
`"...Trying to read any probabilities before the result is useless.`
` So I cannot tell you that number."`
`"But it'll definitely be slightly more likely than if I do nothing."`
`"Yes.`
` As long as you do not throw that desire of yours away.`
` But be prepared.`
` It is extremely close to zero."`
`".........`
`Okay.`
` I'll take you up on that offer."`
`"...Are you sure?`
` You probably won't be able to return here again."`
`"This isn't the world I'm supposed to be in.`
` ...I'll find the world I am supposed to be in myself.`
` Tell me your name."`
`"The Witch of Miracles, Bernkastel.`
` And by that name, `
`I acknowledge you as the Golden Witch, ANGE Beatrice.`
` ...As of now, you are a true witch."`
`The instant she proclaimed that I was a witch...`
`...I felt dizzy, as though something inside me had changed drastically.`
`At that time, I heard a *clunk*.`
`...It was the sound of the door that opened to the staircase to the roof.`
`It was Aunt Eva's guards.`
`...They're only 'guards' in name.`
`Aren't they the cage that wraps the tightest around me, shutting me in?`
`They saw that I was already on the other side of the fence and dashed forward, horrified.`
`"20, we've found the target.`
` Requesting backup on the roof."`
`"Ange-san...!`
` We were looking for you!`
` It's dangerous there, so quickly, come this way!"`
`"......What's that?"`
`"...My fan club.`
` ...I'm pretty popular."`
`"No point in getting caught.`
` ......Let's go."`
`Looking annoyed, Bernkastel turned on her heels.`
` ...In the jet black sky.`
`Watching that perfectly casual gesture, I followed her as though it was completely normal.`
`"Ange-san!!!`
` Wait!`
` Don't be hasty, look ooooooooooouuuut!!"`
`"Aaah, it's useless, it's all useless.`
` Well then, <see you again> next time.`
` Please send a limo to get me.`
` 'Cause everyone else will be there too.`
` See you."`
