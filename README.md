This is not finished and most likely never will be -- or at least it won't be for a long while. If you know what this is and want to use it in its current half-baked state, or want to fork to finish it yourself (I'll gladly accept PRs that finish the job for me, if someone's willing to, or just delete the repo if I find that the work was completed elsewhere), you may want to check out [the pre-archival README](README_OLD.md).
